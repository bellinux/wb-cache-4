25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain pointed out <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of the midshipmen in the boat, {{of the name}} of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
500|$|Most modern {{authorities}} have assessed McClellan {{as a poor}} battlefield general. [...] Some historians view him as a highly capable commander whose reputation suffered unfairly {{at the hands of}} pro-Lincoln partisans who made him a scapegoat for the Union's military setbacks. After the war, subsequent commanding general and 18th President [...] Ulysses S. Grant was asked for his opinion of McClellan as a general; he replied, [...] "McClellan is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of the mysteries of the war." ...|$|E

Slayer and Hoglan would play Dark Angel songs during soundchecks, which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel. Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: [...] "He came up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> day and started giving me his criticisms of the band. He said we needed to be more evil. And then he goes, 'By the way, I'm a better drummer than the guy you have in Dark Angel right now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his third}} term as Leader, Treatt criticised {{government}} cuts in transport services, but supported reductions in death duty taxes. At a Remembrance Day address in 1952, Treatt criticised radical student politics embodied by the [...] "long-haired intellectual types": [...] "My {{belief in the}} value of university life and in higher education generally is a strong and abiding one...the sort of long-haired type I am thinking about may not even have a university degree. He is encased in self satisfied assurance of his own mental superiority." [...] In his speech at the Lyceum Hall, Treatt warned of Australia's attitudes on its success: [...] "A sort of mental haze seems to obscure the vision splendid that lies before this country. We are proud of being a British country, a country with British traditions, institutions, and all those things which go to make up what we call our 'British heritage. But this pride is not matched by a pride in being Australian. This seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of the strongest sources of our weakness." ...|$|E
500|$|Series writer Brian Peterson {{discusses}} how {{the writing}} staff chose {{to develop the}} character: [...] "In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which is, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>one</b> of the best aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but {{as the one who}} is constantly going to butt heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later." [...] For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White—an additional character established in season three's [...] "Perry"—then they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming [...] "the reporter we all know and love". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the [...] "black and white" [...] mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to realize that there is sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to [...] "step it up and be more involved". In this case, Lois is acting more mature, taking charge in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he wants to have a life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois. As Durance explains, [...] " [...] got her confidence as a journalist and on the inside, she's going oh my god I'm truly in love with , more in love than I've ever been with anyone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Judge Learned Hand was {{possibly}} the first judge to advocate the intent standard, in Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten, reasoning that [...] "f one stops short of urging upon others {{that it is}} their duty or their interest to resist the law, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> should not be held to have attempted to cause its violation". The Brandenburg intent standard is more speech-protective than Hand's formulation, which contained no temporal element.|$|E

Treacher said [...] "The breakdown story really got <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>One</b> night I came home, had a drink and just started weeping. I had so many sad letters from people with nervous breakdowns. So many people wanted to end it all." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{these plans}} were {{hampered}} by the Metropolitan's continual delays to hold out for a more favorable lease. After {{the stock market crash}} of 1929, the Metropolitan could not afford to move anymore. On December 6, 1929, the plans for the new opera house were abandoned completely. Rockefeller later stated, [...] "It was clear that there were only two courses open <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>One</b> was to abandon the entire development. The other to go forward with it in the definite knowledge that I myself would have to build it and finance it alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{hypothesis}} ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>One</b> species of wild iris, the Iris pseudacorus, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It {{is easy to}} imagine that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume would have been called [...] "fleur-de-lis." [...] This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag. There is a fanciful legend about Clovis which links the yellow flag explicitly with the French coat of arms.|$|E

He remains <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of the greatest of all writers and masters, although I think him utterly base, contemptible and odious for certain reasons which you know."

2500|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether Blythe played organised cricket {{as a young}} man, although Albert Kinross suggests that he did so. He {{is known to have}} attended the last day of a match between Kent and Somerset at Blackheath in July 1897. Having arrived early, Blythe was asked to bowl at Kent's Walter Wright to provide some practice. He was watched by William McCanlis who was the manager of Kent's Tonbridge Nursery, Kent's recently established professional player development centre based at the Angel Ground in Tonbridge. McCanlis recalled that “I spoke to him and arranged for him to come and bowl <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> evening”. Blythe did so and he was invited to a trial at the Nursery where the Trials book records “Bowls slow left. A very useful bowler.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} {{were one of}} the chief inspirations for producing the Living Bible. Our family devotions were tough going because of the difficulty we had understanding the King James Version, which we were then using, or the Revised Standard Version, which we used later. All too often I would ask questions to be sure the children understood, and they would shrug their shoulders—they didn't know what the passage was talking about. So I would explain it. I would paraphrase it for them and give them the thought. It suddenly occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> afternoon that I should write out the reading for that evening thought by thought, rather than doing it on the spot during our devotional time. So I did, and read the chapter to the family that evening with exciting results—they knew the answers to all the questions I asked! ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{told that}} if people complained that the Torah {{disadvantaged}} them, they should know that God actually gave them the Torah to benefit then.

2500|$|During {{his last}} days, {{some of his}} new disciples began to preach him as God Almighty. I was afraid my meeting with such men would give rise to {{unpleasant}} discussions.

That was before his removal to a more commodious house on the riverside for treatment. Ramkrishna took me to task for neglecting him. I pleaded guilty to the charge and made a clean breast of it by letting him know the exact causes, I smiled and said, “As there are many editions of a book so {{there have been many}} editions of God Almighty and your disciples are about to make you a new one.” He too smiled and said, “Just fancy, God Almighty dying of cancer in the throat.

2500|$|Henry George's {{ideas on}} {{politics}} and economics had enormous influence in his time. His ideas {{gave rise to the}} economic philosophy now known as Georgism. However, his influence slowly waned through the 20th century. [...] Nonetheless, {{it would be difficult to}} overstate George's impact on turn-of-the-century reform movements and intellectual culture. [...] George's self-published Progress and Poverty was the first popular economics text and one of the most widely printed books ever written. [...] The book's explosive worldwide popularity is often marked as the beginning of the Progressive Era and various political parties, clubs, and charitable organizations around the world were founded on George's ideas. George's message attracts support widely across the political spectrum, including labor union activists, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, reformers, conservatives, and wealthy investors. As a result, Henry George is still claimed as a primary intellectual influence by both classical liberals and socialists. Edwin Markham expressed a common sentiment when he said, [...] "Henry George has always been <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of the supreme heroes of humanity." ...|$|E
