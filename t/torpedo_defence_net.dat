5000|$|Early booms {{were made}} of wood, {{originally}} 10 in in diameter but increased in the 1880s to 12 in. Each boom weighed 20 to 24 long cwt kg and cost £28 to £30. In the House of Commons on 9 April 1888 Admiral Field, who was MP for Eastbourne, asserted that steel booms designed by William Bullivant were at least 5 long cwt kg lighter, one-third less expensive and [...] "superior in many other respects", and asked Lord George Hamilton, First Lord of the Admiralty whether the Committee on <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Net</b> <b>Defence</b> had recommended steel booms and whether the Admiralty would further test them. In reply the First Sea Lord claimed that steel booms doubled up on impact, were more vulnerable to accidental damage and were harder to repair aboard a ship, whereas wooden ones were easier to replace. His Lordship further stated that the steel booms that the Committee favoured were of a different type to those designed by Bullivant.|$|R

40|$|Surface {{vessels and}} {{submarines}} {{must be able}} to defend themselves against a torpedo attack. Several studies have shown the benefits of multi-platform and multi-static operations. To facilitate <b>torpedo</b> <b>defence</b> system studies and the development of future tactics, TNO Defence, Security and Safety started the development of the Underwater Warfare Testbed (UWT). This testbed integrates the simulation models TDSTB (<b>Torpedo</b> <b>Defence</b> System TestBed), MUST (MUltiSTatic facility tool) and ALMOST (Acoustic Loss Model for Operational Studies and Tasks). The testbed models all relevant UWW assets, including vessels with sonars, helicopters with dipping sonars, and also enemy submarines (with their sonars and weapons). Each platform can use its own predefined tactics to operate alone or in task group formations. The UWT simulates the kinematics, communication and detailed acoustics signal levels (passive, active mono-static and bi-static, and intercept sonars) using the acoustic propagation and sonar performance model ALMOST. Within a simulation all systems will interact with each other. Simulated received signal levels are used to generate contacts and false targets for the tracker. The Detection, Classification and Localisation algorithms of the sonars can be modelled with high-fidelity and multi-resolution. This enables detailed runs and Monte-Carlo runs as well. The Underwater Warfare Testbed is used to evaluate operational tactics and future concepts for UWW. It is also applicable to develop submarine tactics operating in areas with multi-static sonar. The simulations in the UWT give the Royal Netherlands Navy valuable performance information for operational planning. In addition, it is also a useful tool for educational and training purposes. The authors will present the architecture and the applications of the Underwater Warfare Testbed...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of undersea defence {{technologies such as}} sonar relies heavily {{on the availability of}} high quality acoustic data. However, data acquisition is particularly expensive as sea trials involve experienced manpower and costly high-tech equipment. Also, at sea, the environment remains unpredictable and many disturbing effects are combined. Therefore, in the underwater technology department of TNO, the simulator SIMONA was designed to help developing and testing new algorithms for advanced array processing, at low cost, in a specific and controlled environment. SIMONA generates realistic hydrophone data for sonar arrays thanks to a modular structure. The various simulation modules for platform motion, active and passive target responses, reverberation and background noise have been verified with validated models and operational examples. SIMONA has proved an excellent tool {{in a wide range of}} sonar applications such as anti submarine warfare, <b>torpedo</b> <b>defence,</b> marine mammal localisation and mine countermeasures...|$|R

40|$|The TNO {{underwater}} warfare (UWW) {{research programme}} {{results in a}} large number of models used in operational research projects. To enhance the accessibility and re-use of these models for new projects, TNO-FEL has developed the modelling environment ‘MOSES - Maritime Operations Simulation and Evaluation System’. This research environment is based on object oriented simulation techniques, and provides the user with a framework to model, simulate and analyse UWW related problems – as a true underwater warfare testbed. MOSES consists of a computer infrastructure, a repository of models and documentation and tools. These tools support model and system developers as well as operational analysts. ‘Linking’ of models is possible on multiple levels, increasing its integrating capability. The range of MOSES applications is steadily growing: from conceptual models up to operational, sea going systems, from reconstruction of operation up to the use of detailed physics in underwater propagation. The warfare areas cover mine warfare (hunting, as well as sweeping) and anti submarine warfare. Foreseen are topics on <b>torpedo</b> <b>defence</b> and the deployment of unmanned underwater vehicles...|$|R
5000|$|... 1942 June: The Experimental Submarine Flotilla {{moved to}} [...] "Port ZD" [...] (Port D) at Keose on Loch Erisort in Scotland. Their first powered manned torpedo was the Mark I Chariot. Its hull was 21 in in diameter. It could make 2.9 kn and could dive safely {{to a depth}} of 20 ft. The nose was a warhead with 600 pounds of high explosive. Training was hard. The men often {{suffered}} from oxygen poisoning because of the use of pure oxygen at depth, burst eardrums and sinus trouble. The strangeness of the Chariots added to their problems. They were trained to ride and steer for a long time under water, and to then cut through harbour <b>defence</b> <b>nets.</b> The hardest part was learning to work with the Chariots' warheads.|$|R

50|$|Naval armour has {{fundamentally}} {{changed from}} the Second World War doctrine of thicker plating to defend against shells, bombs and <b>torpedoes.</b> Passive <b>defence</b> naval armour is limited to kevlar or steel (either single layer or as spaced armour) protecting particularly vital areas {{from the effects of}} nearby impacts. Since ships cannot carry enough armour to completely prevent penetration by anti-ship missiles, they depend more on destroying an incoming missile before it hits, or causing it to miss its target.|$|R

500|$|The only {{class of}} these late battlecruisers {{actually}} built were the United States Navy's [...] "large cruisers". Two {{of them were}} completed, [...] and a third, , was cancelled while under construction and three others, to be named Philippines, Puerto Rico and Samoa, were cancelled before they were laid down. They were classified as [...] "large cruisers" [...] instead of battlecruisers, and their status as non-capital ships evidenced by their being named for territories or protectorates. (Battleships, in contrast, were named after states and cruisers after cities.) With a main armament of nine 12-inch guns in three triple turrets and a displacement of , the Alaskas were {{twice the size of}} s and had guns some 50% larger in diameter. They lacked the thick armoured belt and intricate <b>torpedo</b> <b>defence</b> system of true capital ships. However, unlike most battlecruisers, they were considered a balanced design according to cruiser standards as their protection could withstand fire from their own caliber of gun, albeit only in a very narrow range band. They were designed to hunt down Japanese heavy cruisers, though by the time they entered service most Japanese cruisers had been sunk by American aircraft or submarines. Like the contemporary [...] fast battleships, their speed ultimately made them more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as the surface combatants they were developed to be.|$|R
500|$|Although a {{recommendation}} {{had been made}} while the ships were still under construction to extend the superstructure out {{to the sides of}} the ship to improve their stability and habitability, this was not acted upon until they were refitted during the 1880s. This refit also strengthened the breastwork and upper decks, added another watertight bulkhead as well as a false keel. Four quick-firing 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns were added on the breastwork for <b>torpedo</b> boat <b>defence</b> as well as five machine guns and several searchlights. This increased their crew to approximately 191 men and added [...] to their displacement.|$|R
50|$|The {{design and}} weapons mix {{resulted}} from experience of earlier, more specialised classes {{such as the}} Type 35.
