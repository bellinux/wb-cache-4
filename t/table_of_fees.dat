40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{cost-effectiveness}} of conventional outpatient treatment for alcoholic patients (CT) with this same conventional treatment plus home visits (HV), a new proposal for intervention within the Brazilian outpatient treatment system. A cost-effectiveness evaluation alongside a 12 -week randomized clinical trial was performed. We identified the resources utilized by each intervention, as well as the cost according to National Health System (SUS), Brazilian Medical Association (AMB) <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees,</b> and others based on 2005 data. the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated as the main outcome measure - abstinent cases at the end of treatment. There were 51. 8 % abstinent cases for HV and 43. 1 % for CT, a clinically relevant finding. Other outcome measures, such as quality of life, also showed significant improvements that favored HV. the baseline scenario presented an ICER of USD 1, 852. Sensitivity analysis showed an ICER of USD 689 (scenario favoring HV) and USD 2, 334 (scenario favoring CT). the HV treatment was found to be cost-effective according to the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health.

25|$|Cremated remains can be {{scattered}} or buried. Cremation plots or columbarium niches {{are usually}} cheaper than a traditional burial plot or mausoleum crypt, and require less space. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, require the burial or entombment of cremated remains, but burial of cremated remains may often {{be accomplished in}} the burial plot of another person, such as a family member, without any additional cost. This option is charged for in England in an Anglican church where the fee is set by the <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> Parochial <b>Fees</b> (£36 to incumbent and £78 to church council) a total of £114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra. It is also very common to scatter the remains in a place the deceased liked—such as the sea, a river, a beach, a park, or mountains, following their last will. This is generally forbidden in public places but easy to do. Some persons choose to have {{a small part of}} their ashes (usually less than 1 part in 1000, because of cost constraints) scattered in space (known as space burial and offered by companies such as Elysium Space, Celestis and Ascending Memories).

40|$|Tuition <b>fees</b> <b>of</b> public {{universities}} are greatly increasing {{in recent years}} in China. Many researchers have made an attempt to examine the effects <b>of</b> rising <b>fee</b> on students'enrollment behavior. However, there is no systematic analysis of the causes <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> increase, and the causal relations between the fee rising and the expansion of higher education. This paper will focus on the following four points: (1) the history <b>of</b> university <b>fees,</b> (2) the present situation <b>of</b> tuition <b>fees,</b> (3) the mechanism responsible for the fee rising, (4) the relation between the rising <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> and the higher education expansion. The findings of this article are as follows: (1) The transformation <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> system is not from free-fee one to high-fee one directly, but through several transitive phases in which various fee policies were experimented by the central government. (2) The present standard <b>of</b> tuition <b>fee</b> is very high. Fee average is up to 5000 yuan every year. And the amount <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> collected by different institutions varies greatly according to university and department's prestige. (3) Each institution of higher education {{played an important role in}} the process <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> rising. The central government changed the fee policies, which gave each institution an arbitrary power to decide its fee level and how to spend it partly. (4) Consequently, the fee rising in {{public universities}} gave an incentive to every institution and directly promoted the expansion of the higher education...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the impact <b>of</b> patent <b>fees</b> on the demand for patents. It presents a dataset <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> since 1980 at the European (EPO), the US and the Japanese patent offices. Descriptive statistics show that fees have severely decreased at the EPO over the 1990 s, converging towards the level <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> in the US and Japan. The estimation of dynamic panel data models suggests that the price elasticity of demand for patents is about - 0. 30. These results suggest that the laxity <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> policy at the EPO has significantly contributed to the rising propensity to patent. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics, University of Oxford, 2011.

Subjects played a web-based investment game, allocating money among fictional funds.
