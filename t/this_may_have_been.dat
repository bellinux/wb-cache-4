5|$|A {{number of}} songs written by Mendelssohn's sister Fanny {{originally}} appeared under her brother's name; <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{partly due to}} the prejudice of the family, and partly to her own retiring nature.|$|E
5|$|Barbette is {{credited}} with having returned to the United States in 1935 to star on Broadway in the Billy Rose circus musical Jumbo. However, some sources suggest that <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Barbette impersonator.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1828, however, it was {{suspended}} in June 1831 before {{the building has}} risen from its foundations. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> because the principal architect Harrison had died the previous year and Boffo working alone {{may not have been}} an option – his alterations to Harrison's plans for the Governor's residence in Odessa had been unfavourably received.|$|E

5|$|Edwards' {{re-election}} {{was more}} difficult. In four months {{he had lost}} the temporary support of Thomas' allies in the General Assembly who had voted for him in 1818. He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones {{by a vote of}} 23–19. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> due to the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane, a Thomas ally.|$|E
5|$|Five Percenter {{membership}} plunged after Clarence13X's death, but rebounded in 1970 {{after new}} leadership emerged and revitalized the group. After his death, {{the group was}} not dominated by a single leader. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{a result of their}} teaching that all black men are gods, which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year Tristano's sextet played at the first Newport Jazz Festival. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> his only jazz festival appearance – he considered them to be too commercial. Marsh left the band {{in the summer of}} 1955.|$|E

5|$|On the {{southwest}} of the palace courtyard there were some low platforms, possibly ritual dance platforms, and on the southeast side was a building with benches against three of the walls and hearths at each end. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the room where the}} Ahpo Sotz'il held court and received visitors and tribute.|$|E
5|$|Several days later, the Florida Panhandle {{experienced}} {{the effects of}} a tropical storm, marked by gale-force winds at Pensacola on September 22 and 23. No appreciable damage was reported. Ludlum considered that <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a continuation of the Galveston storm, but judged it to be a separate system.|$|E
5|$|The {{body was}} 1.63m in height. The mummy {{had a small}} face with no {{defining}} features, though he had slightly prominent front teeth; <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an inherited family trait, as this feature {{can be seen in}} some female mummies of the same family, as well as the mummy of his descendant, Thutmose II.|$|E

5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{one of many}} false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries. In the west, <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{due in part to the}} reliance of the British and Scandinavians on infantry-based warfare, where horses were only used for riding and pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Even {{classical}} historians, {{who were}} writing only {{years after the}} events themselves, seem to be divided {{as to what the}} motives of Spartacus were. Appian and Florus write that he intended to march on Rome itself—although <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no more than a reflection of Roman fears. If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.|$|E

5|$|In 766 Æthelbert succeeded Ecgbert as archbishop; he was consecrated 24 April 767, {{the feast}} {{day of his}} {{predecessor}} Wilfrid. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deliberate and a sign that Æthelbert wished to revive Wilfrid's ambitions for the archiepiscopal see. Æthelbert received his pallium from Pope Adrian I in 773. Alcuin was appointed head of the cathedral school after Æthelbert became archbishop. Much of Alcuin's description of Æthelbert's time as archbishop has the flavour of a panegyric, as Alcuin praised Æthelbert as a model bishop suitable for other bishops {{to use as a}} role model.|$|E
5|$|In 815 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} Ecgberht ravaged {{the whole of}} the territories of the {{remaining}} British kingdom, Dumnonia, known to the author of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as the West Welsh; their territory was about equivalent to what is now Cornwall. Ten years later, a charter dated 19 August 825 indicates that Ecgberht was campaigning in Dumnonia again; <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> related to a battle recorded in the Chronicle at Gafulford in 823, between the men of Devon and the Britons of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|In the end a {{total of}} 28 {{architectural}} firms registered their intent to submit entries to the competition—a lower number than expected, but Richardson suggests <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> due to work on proposals for the new Adelaide railway station. Out of those 28, {{a total of}} 26 firms submitted designs by the deadline. On 10 November 1924, before judging could be completed, the Richards Building in Currie Street was destroyed by fire, taking with it all 26 proposals.|$|E

5|$|Later that year, Campbell {{traveled}} with Angie Lewis to New Orleans {{for the annual}} convention of the American Nursing Association in June, where they gave a 45-minute or hour-long presentation — possibly a plenary session — about AIDS and HIV, having been invited at the last minute; Lewis suggested <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> because the ANA were unsure about hosting the session.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised {{a system in which}} infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
