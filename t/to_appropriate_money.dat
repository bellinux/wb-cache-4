25|$|In February or March 1899, as Sections 21, 22, and 23 {{were being}} {{prepared}} for the burial of Spanish–American War dead, Secretary of War Elihu Root chose a promontory on {{the eastern edge of}} the burial field as the site for a new Spanish–American War memorial. Veterans of the war strongly supported the construction of a memorial, but no action was taken. Agnes Kissam Capron, wife of Captain Allyn K. Capron, Sr. (an Army artillery officer who died of typhoid fever in September 1898), began lobbying Congress in April 1900 <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money</b> for a memorial and Representative John H. Ketcham introduced H.R. 11091 to authorize it.|$|E
25|$|Three months later, in April 1957, House and Senate {{subcommittees}} {{overseeing the}} District of Columbia voted {{to approve the}} Foggy Bottom site as well. The Senate followed suit in May, but the House refused <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money</b> to purchase the land. Eight months later, with the Auditorium Commission defunct, a number of civic leaders and members of Congress proposed that the cultural center be built on a site on the National Mall south of the National Gallery of Art (where the National Air and Space Museum is now). This proposal proved so unwelcome that Congress shifted again and chose the Foggy Bottom site for the cultural center. President Eisenhower signed legislation creating the National Cultural Center (later renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts) on September 2, 1958.|$|E
25|$|As the {{half-size}} {{models were}} nearing completion in 1933, the CFA suspended the project. By now, the United States {{was in the}} depths of the Great Depression. The bridge was finished and slightly over budget, and Congress was increasingly unwilling <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money</b> for any further construction except the most critical remaining construction items (such as roadways). Obtaining funds for the costly granite and expensive carving was politically impossible. Furthermore, what funds were available were impounded under the Economy Act of 1933. Nevertheless, the CFA wanted very much to proceed with the statues. With the full-size models already paid for, it asked the sculptors to finish their work. The Commission of Fine Arts visited Friedlander's White Plains, New York, studio on October 14, 1933, and approved his models.|$|E

25|$|Some Presidents {{have claimed}} the {{authority}} under this clause <b>to</b> impound <b>money</b> <b>appropriated</b> by Congress. President Jefferson, for example, delayed {{the expenditure of}} <b>money</b> <b>appropriated</b> {{for the purchase of}} gunboats for over a year. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his successors sometimes refused outright <b>to</b> expend <b>appropriated</b> <b>money.</b> The Supreme Court, however, has held that impoundments without Congressional authorization are unconstitutional.|$|R

500|$|During King William's War in the 1690s Nicholson {{asked the}} House of Burgesses <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money</b> for New York's defense, {{since it was}} {{threatened}} from New France and acted as a buffer to protect Virginia. [...] The Burgesses refused, even after Nicholson appealed to London. [...] When Queen Anne's War broke out in 1702, Nicholson lent New York £900 of his own money, {{with the expectation that}} it would be repaid from Virginia's quit rents (it was not). [...] The publicity of this scheme increased dislike of him in Virginia, and may {{have played a role in}} his recall. [...] Virginia was not militarily affected by the war. [...] These efforts by Nicholson to gain broader colonial support for the war were followed by larger proposals to London, suggesting, for example, that all of the colonies be joined under a single viceroy, who would have power of taxation and control of a standing army. [...] According to historian John Fiske, Nicholson was one of the first people to propose uniting all of the North American colonies in this way.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, rumors abounded of [...] "poor management, student discontent, professorial dissatisfaction, faculty factionalism, {{disciplinary}} problems, and campus scandals" [...] at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A University). The public was {{skeptical of the}} idea of scientific agriculture and the legislature declined <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money</b> for improvements to the campus because it had little confidence in the school's administrators. The board of directors decided the school, known as Texas AMC, needed to be run by an independent administrative chief rather than the faculty chairman. On July 1, 1890, the board unanimously agreed to offer the new job to the sitting governor and asked Ross to resign his office immediately. Ross agreed to consider the offer, as well as several others he had received. An unknown person informed several newspapers that Ross had been asked to become Texas AMC's president, and each of the newspapers editorialized that Ross would be a perfect fit. The college had been founded to teach military and agricultural knowledge, and Ross had demonstrated excellence in the army and as a farmer. His gubernatorial service had honed his administrative skills, and he had always expressed an interest in education.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, the Humphrey Bill, <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money</b> for {{monuments to}} mark the Trail, passed the House of Representatives and was {{introduced}} in the Senate, with a proviso that no money would be spent unless the Secretary of War could certify that the work would not require any further appropriations. Ezra Meeker set out that year on another two-year-long expedition, with the emphasis this time on locating and marking where the Trail had been, rather than on building monuments. [...] Sometimes the ruts in the ground from the emigrants' [...] wagons still existed and made it obvious, but other times he had to rely on the memories of old settlers. He journeyed to Texas, but had no success in interesting people in his project there. His tour was ended in 1912 in Denver when a flood struck the city, resulting in damage to his books. Nevertheless, according to Green, Meeker's two trips resulted in the placement of 150 monuments. A version of the Humphrey Bill passed the Senate in 1913, but died when the House of Representatives took no action. Despite this failure, groups began marking western trails: the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution put up plaques along the Cowlitz Trail in 1916.|$|E

500|$|The ditchers took {{a number}} of steps to ensure support for their proposals. [...] In 1921, WWPC secured a {{preliminary}} permit to build a dam at Kettle Falls, about [...] upstream from the Grand Coulee. [...] If built, the Kettle Falls Dam would have lain {{in the path of}} the Grand Coulee Dam's reservoir, essentially blocking its construction. [...] WWPC planted rumors in the newspapers, incorrectly stating that exploratory drilling at the Grand Coulee site found no granite on which a dam's foundations could rest, only clay and fragmented rock. This was later disproved with Reclamation-ordered drilling. Ditchers hired General George W. Goethals, engineer of the Panama Canal, to prepare a report. Goethals visited the state and produced a report backing the ditchers. [...] The Bureau of Reclamation was unimpressed by Goethals' report, believing it filled with errors. [...] In , President Warren G. Harding visited Washington state and expressed support for irrigation work there, but died a month later. [...] His successor, Calvin Coolidge, had little interest in irrigation projects. [...] The Bureau of Reclamation, desirous of a major project that would bolster its reputation, was focusing on the Boulder Canyon Project that resulted in the Hoover Dam. Reclamation was authorized to conduct a study in 1923, but the project's cost made federal officials reluctant. The Washington state proposals received little support from those further east, who feared the irrigation would result in more crops, depressing prices. [...] With President Coolidge opposed to the project, bills <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money</b> for surveys of the Grand Coulee site failed.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} years, the Spanish government continued {{to press the}} US for compensation for the ship, cargo and slaves.

2500|$|Senator Barbour {{aligned with}} Senators John C. Calhoun and Henry Clay on {{internal}} improvements and slavery. [...] Although his brother Philip Pendleton Barbour served contemporaneously in the U.S. House, their stances and votes often differed. [...] Senator Barbour proposed a committee on roads and canals, supported the Bonus Bill (authorizing spending the bonus {{from the national}} bank on internal improvements), and proposed {{a constitutional amendment to}} grant Congress authority <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money</b> for internal improvements. [...] Senator Barbour also opposed reducing the national army, supported a bill abolishing imprisonment for debts, and introduced the Navigation Act of 1818. [...] That Act closed U.S. ports to any ships arriving from British ports closed to U.S. ships. [...] Barbour hoped this would encourage the British to open their ports. [...] However, that efforts failed. [...] In 1823 a compromise led to the Elsewhere Act, which allowed for reciprocal trade.|$|E
6000|$|The Directors {{did wrong}} in their orders <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money,</b> which they must know {{could not have}} been {{acquired}} by the consent of the pretended donor, to their own use.[42] They acted more properly in refusing to confirm this grant to Mr. Hastings, and in choosing rather to refer him to the law which he had violated than to his own sense of what he thought he was entitled to take from the natives: putting him in mind that the Regulating Act had expressly declared [...] "that no Governor-General, or any of the Council, shall, directly or indirectly, accept, receive, or take, of or from any person or persons, or on any account whatsoever, any present, gift, donation, gratuity, or reward, pecuniary or otherwise, or any promise or engagement for any of the aforesaid." [...] Here is no reserve for the case of a disclosure to the Directors, and for the legalizing the breach of an act of Parliament by their subsequent consent. The illegality attached to the action at its very commencement, and it could never be afterwards legalized: the Directors had no such power reserved to them. Words cannot be devised of a stronger import or studied with more care. To these words of the act are opposed the declaration and conduct of Mr. Hastings, who, in his letter of January, 1782, thinks fit to declare, that [...] "an offer of a very considerable sum of money was made to him, both {{on the part of the}} Nabob and his ministers, as a present, which he accepted without hesitation." [...] The plea of his pretended necessity is of no avail. The present was not in ready money, nor, as your Committee conceive, applicable to his immediate necessities. Even his credit was not bettered by bills at long periods; he does not pretend that he raised any money upon them; nor is it conceivable that a banker at Benares would be more willing to honor the drafts of so miserable, undone, and dependent a person as the Nabob of Oude than those of the Governor-General of Bengal, which might be paid either on the receipt of the Benares revenue, or at the seat of his power, and of the Company's exchequer. Besides, it is not explicable, upon any grounds that can be avowed, why the Nabob, who could afford to give these bills as a present to Mr. Hastings, could not have equally given them in discharge of the debt which he owed to the Company. It is, indeed, very much to be feared that the people of India find it sometimes turn more to their account to give presents to the English in authority than to pay their debts to the public; and this is a matter of a very serious consideration.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{position}} is, that {{a system}} of internal improvements would overwhelm the treasury. That in such a system {{there is a tendency}} to undue expansion, is not to be denied. Such tendency is founded in the nature of the subject. A member of Congress will prefer voting for a bill which contains an appropriation for his district, to voting for one which does not; and when a bill shall be expanded till every district shall be provided for, that it will be too greatly expanded is obvious. But is this any more true in Congress than in a State Legislature? If a member of Congress must have an appropriation for his district, so a member of a Legislature must have one for his county. And if one will overwhelm the national treasury, so the other will overwhelm the State treasury. Go where we will, the difficulty is the same. Allow it to drive us from the halls of Congress, and it will, just as easily, drive us from the State Legislatures. Let us, then, grapple with it, and test its strength. Let us, judging of the future by the past, ascertain whether there may not be, in the discretion of Congress, a sufficient power to limit and restrain this expansive tendency within reasonable and proper bounds. The President himself values the evidence of the past. He tells us that at a certain point of our history more than two hundred millions of dollars had been applied for to make improvements; and this he does to prove that the treasury would be overwhelmed by such a system. Why did he not tell us how much was granted? Would not that have been better evidence? Let us turn to it, and see what it proves. In the message the President tells us that [...] "during the four succeeding years embraced by the administration of President Adams, the power not only <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>money,</b> but to apply it, under the direction and authority of the General Government, as well to the construction of roads as to the improvement of harbors and rivers, was fully asserted and exercised." [...] This, then, was the period of greatest enormity. These, if any, must have been the days of the two hundred millions. And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements during that four years? Two hundred millions? One hundred? Fifty? Ten? Five? No, sir; less than two millions. As shown by authentic documents, the expenditures on improvements during 1825, 1826, 1827, and 1828 amounted to one million eight hundred and seventy-nine thousand six hundred and twenty-seven dollars and one cent. These four years were the period of Mr. Adams's administration, nearly and substantially. This fact shows that when the power to make improvements [...] "was fully asserted and exercised," [...] the Congress did keep within reasonable limits; and what has been done, it seems to me, can be done again.|$|E

50|$|The 1930 midterm {{elections}} saw Republicans {{lose control of}} the House and narrowly retain control of the Senate. The election was also a victory for progressives of both parties, as Republicans closely aligned with Hoover lost several congressional elections. Additionally, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide re-election established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic nomination. Despite the election defeat, Hoover refused to refused to change his policies, rejecting the Chairman of the Committee on Employment's advice <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> additional <b>money</b> for public works. Instead, Hoover's first State of Union address after the election called for a balancing of the budget.
