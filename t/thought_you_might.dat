500|$|Scott Shetler of Pop Crush {{noted that}} the song was {{indirectly}} about Lopez's ex-boyfriends and husbands. He commented that the song was [...] "obviously condemning several exes" [...] and wrote [...] "A logical reading of the lyrics, though, reveals that the “bad boy” is probably Lopez’s former long-term boyfriend and Bad Boy Records founder Diddy, while the guy J. Lo danced with until saying “I do” is her second husband Cris Judd, a professional dancer and choreographer. The lyrics go on to reference two more men, who {{would seem to be}} Ben Affleck (“went nowhere but kept the ring”) and Lopez’s current husband, Marc Anthony (“he sang to me.”)" [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that [...] "One Love" [...] examines all of her high-profiled relationships, and commented that Lopez is not [...] "trying to gin up controversy with these red-meat tidbits about her personal life. She honestly <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be curious about Ben Affleck and whatever happened to that huge engagement ring he gave her all those years ago, during Bennifer’s dark reign." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror {{described}} {{the program as}} [...] "far too funny". A review in The Daily Mirror was positive, commenting, [...] "If {{you want to see}} a brilliant spoof about Tom Cruise's faith in Scientology and his relationship with Katie Holmes, look no further than C4's Star Stories." [...] She commented, [...] "It's so absurd, even Tom will laugh." [...] The Advertiser described Star Stories as [...] "a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups", and noted of the episode's title, [...] "This week's episode is titled Being Tom Cruise [...] - How Scientology isn't in Any Way Mental, which should give you some idea of the vein of humour mined." [...] The Sunday Times observed, [...] "Just when you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel." [...] Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their [...] "Critics' Choice" [...] column. They commented that the show's producers [...] " [...] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his [...] "Top Choice". Adams commented, [...] "This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done." [...] Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, [...] "This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV." [...] The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program [...] "was as subtle as a sledge hammer". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program [...] "a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival".|$|E
2500|$|In December 1916, Major-General Sir John Hanbury-Williams, {{head of the}} British {{military}} at Stavka, {{received word}} {{of the death of}} his son in action with the British Expeditionary Force in France. Tsar Nicholas sent twelve-year-old Alexei to sit with the grieving father. [...] "Papa told me to come sit with you as he <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> feel lonely tonight," [...] Alexei told the general. Alexei, like all the Romanov men, grew up wearing sailor uniforms and playing at war {{from the time he was}} a toddler. His father began to prepare him for his future role as Tsar by inviting Alexei to sit in on long meetings with government ministers.|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, Lovely Warren, {{the mayor}} of Rochester, put a red, white and blue sign next to Anthony's grave the day after Hillary Clinton {{obtained}} the nomination at the Democratic National Convention; the sign stated, [...] "Dear Susan B., we <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{like to know that}} for the first time in history, a woman is running for president representing a major party. 144 years ago, your illegal vote got you arrested. It took another 48 years for women to finally gain the right to vote. Thank you for paving the way." [...] The city of Rochester put pictures of the message on Twitter and requested that residents go to Anthony's grave to sign it.|$|E
