They possess a large repertoire, as they can emit up to 11 {{different}} sounds, such as cackles, whistles, trills, and squawks. They also make sounds by grinding their teeth or splashing, but they rarely use body language to make visual displays with their pectoral fins or tailfins, nor do they perform somersaults or jumps in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>other</b> species do, such as dolphins.|$|E

From {{the very beginning of}} the Protestant Reformation its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of microtomography scans of skull {{elements}} of the holotype specimen, Sereno's team created a [...] "prototype" [...] Nigersaurus skull they could examine. They also made an endocast {{of the brain and}} scanned the semicircular canals of its inner ear, which they found to be oriented horizontally. In their 2007 study, they stated that the structure of the occiput and cervical vertebrae would have limited the upward and downward movement of the neck and the rotation of the skull. Based on this biomechanical analysis, the team concluded that the head and muzzle were habitually oriented 67° downwards and close to ground level, as an adaptation for ground-level browsing. This is unlike <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>other</b> sauropods have been restored, with their heads held more horizontally.|$|E
500|$|Journalist {{and writer}} Martha Gellhorn, whom Hemingway {{had met in}} Key West the {{previous}} Christmas (1936), joined him in Spain.

Of Martha, Kert explains, [...] "she never catered to him <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>other</b> women did". Late in 1937, while in Madrid with Martha, Hemingway wrote his only play, The Fifth Column, as the city was being bombarded by Francoist forces. He returned to Key West for a few months, then back to Spain twice in 1938, where he {{was present at the}} Battle of the Ebro, the last republican stand, and he was among the British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river.|$|E

Fey told The New Yorker, [...] "I'd had my eye on the show forever, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>other</b> kids have their eye on Derek Jeter." [...] Originally, Fey [...] "struggled" [...] at SNL.

[...] In the same issue, the newspaper's K Foundation art award witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all [...] "entertaining, and satirically quite sharp", but [...] "the art world has chosen not to think .... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original.

500|$|Dragon Age: Origins is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game. The player is a Grey Warden, {{part of an}} order of elite fighters, whose task is to defeat the Archdemon and save the world from a disastrous event called the Blight. Players create their own Grey Warden character, customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class. The available classes are warriors, who perform strong physical attacks; rogues, who carry out stealth attacks and steal items from other characters; and mages, who cast spells on enemies, create combo spells, [...] and support other party members. The three choices of race are human, elf, and dwarf. The combination of class and race determines which of six different origin stories the player experiences: Dalish Elf, City Elf, Dwarven Noble, Dwarven Commoner, Mage, or Human Noble. This affects <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>other</b> in-game characters perceive the player's character; for instance, a Dwarven Commoner would receive hatred and discrimination from other dwarves.

500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>other</b> people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I {{thought that was a}} very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E

Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote, [...] "Don't they grow up fast?", referring to soap opera rapid aging syndrome. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote that aging the characters would help to [...] "beef up" [...] the soap opera's summer storylines. Roger Newcomb of the website We Love Soaps wondered if the character would [...] "have issues with his parents <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>other</b> aged kids on the show have of late". [...] Fairman later stated of Ehrich's portrayal: [...] "Recently, the powers-that-be at Y chose to age Lauren and Michael’s tot of a son, Fenmore, to a teenager (another victim of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome) and with that comes new complex problems for the Baldwins, and as it appears “Fen” may be a chip off the old block ... sort to speak. [...] The talented Max Ehrich was cast as the new Fen, and since he has begun to air in the part he has received high marks, not only from his scene partners, but daytime fans, too." [...] He also called Fenmore's family [...] "one of the most fascinating TV families". Luke Kerr, also of Zap2it, wrote that he [...] "really likes" [...] Ehrich as Fenmore, stating: [...] "He has totally mastered the Baldwin/Fisher crazy behind-the-eyes element of early Michael and Kevin (Greg Rikaart)." [...] Jamey Giddens also wrote of the character's family storyline, saying: [...] "A father hellbent on preventing his son from going down the same unspeakable path he once traveled; a mother who refuses to believe her child could be guilty of the heinous crime he's being accused of committing. No, this isn't the back page copy for Jodi Picoult's next best-selling novel, it's the saga of the Baldwins on The Young and the Restless!" ...|$|E
