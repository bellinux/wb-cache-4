5|$|Somewhere is the Rocky Mountains in {{southern}} Canada, Toklo's mom is bringing Toklo and his sickly brother to a river {{to teach them}} how to catch salmon. However, in insanity, Toklo's mom abandons Toklo after a mental break because his brother died. Now Toklo must survive on his own, just like Kallik. Wandering randomly, Toklo gets chased by human hunters and then meets a bear who is also getting chased by hunters. The bear gets injured, but <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to safety and requests that Toklo to retrieve certain herbs, which he does. The bear turns into a human and later introduces himself as Ujurak. It is revealed that Ujurak is a Shapeshifter, to Toklo's disbelief, before turning back into a bear. The two end up traveling together.|$|E
5|$|Writing for GameSpot, {{reviewer}} Joe Fielder {{highlighted the}} graphics {{for their new}} lighting effects and varied textures, saying that they improve the gameplay experience because <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game look better than its predecessors, but overall considered Tomb Raider III to be outdated, especially when compared to newer engines that were released at the time. Edge felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the desert}} planet, the search begins for a {{suitable}} source of lime to filter {{the air on}} Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, {{but not enough to}} be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits of lime. The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. <b>They</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the dialing remote, but the other two make it through. Rush is vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses, believing that the ship locked them out for a reason, and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns.|$|E

25|$|Ice {{and snow}} {{increase}} Earth's albedo, i.e. <b>they</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> reflect {{more of the}} sun's energy and absorb less. Hence, when the air temperature decreases, ice and snow fields grow, and this continues until competition with a negative feedback mechanism forces the system to an equilibrium. Also, the reduction in forests caused by the ice's expansion increases albedo.|$|E

25|$|There are {{important}} exceptions. They break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature. <b>They</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> clear that empirical definitions of temperature are {{contingent on the}} peculiar properties of particular thermometric substances, and are thus precluded from the title 'absolute'. For example, water contracts on being heated near 277K. It cannot {{be used as a}} thermometric substance near that temperature. Also, over a certain temperature range, ice contracts on heating. Moreover, many substances can exist in metastable states, such as with negative pressure, that survive only transiently and in very special conditions. Such facts, sometimes called 'anomalous', are some {{of the reasons for the}} thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature.|$|E
