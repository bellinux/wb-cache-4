5|$|The park {{is built}} on the disused {{southern}} viaduct section of a New York Central Railroad line called <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Line.

Here, NY9A exited the parkway and ran concurrent with US9 to the split in Yonkers. The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel connecting Manhattan's Battery Park to Brooklyn was completed in 1950. By 1960, an extension of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Elevated Highway south to the Manhattan tunnel portal became part of NY27A, which had ended in Brooklyn prior {{to the construction of}} the tunnel. On January1, 1970, NY27A was truncated on its western end to eastern Nassau County while NY27 was extended northward over NY27A's former routing through the Battery Tunnel and <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Elevated Highway.|$|E

5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators {{to conclude that the}} increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Boys' base for four days reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Boys moved the hostages.
