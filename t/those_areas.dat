In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally.

M-numbered trunklines are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial highways, and two-lane highways in remote rural areas.
