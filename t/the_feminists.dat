25|$|The {{literary}} {{currents of}} postmodernism often appropriated Urmuz as their guide. This tendency was {{illustrated by the}} writings of new figures in Romanian literature: the minimalists and neo-naturalists (Sorin Gherguț, Andrei Mocuța, Călin Torsan), the neo-Surrealists (Cristian Popescu, Iulia Militaru, Cosmin Perța, Iulian Tănase, Stelian Tănase), <b>the</b> <b>feminists</b> (Catrinel Popa, Iaromira Popovici), the political satirists (Dumitru Augustin Doman, Pavel Șușară) and the electronic literature writers (Cătălin Lazurcă).|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Lisa Levenstein, {{who works}} largely in fields pertaining to women's history, {{the feminist movement}} in the late 1970s briefly attempted a program to help older divorced and widowed women. Many widows were ineligible for Social Security benefits, few divorcees actually received any alimony, and after {{a career as a}} housewife, few had skills to enter the labor force. The program, however, encountered sharp criticism from young activists who gave priority to poor minority women rather than the middle class. By 1980, NOW downplayed the program as it focused almost exclusively on the ERA. Schlafly moved into the vacuum. She denounced <b>the</b> <b>feminists</b> for abandoning older middle-class widows and divorcees in need and warned that ERA would equalize the laws for the benefit of man, stripping protections that older women urgently needed.|$|E

25|$|After the {{beginning}} of the environmental movement in the early 1970s intersections among feminists and other social justice movements emerged. <b>The</b> <b>feminists</b> that took interests in these movements explored how oppressions were linked through gender, race, class and ecology, as well as species and ideas of nationhood. They took cues from Green Party politics, peace movements, and direct action movements. These feminists developed texts, such as Women and Nature (Susan Griffin 1978), The Death of Nature (Carolyn Merchant 1980) and Gyn/Ecology (Mary Daly 1978). These texts helped to propel the association between domination by man on women and the domination of culture on nature. From these texts feminist activism of the 1980s linked ideas of ecology and the environment. For example, conferences for women devoted to living on the earth and protests against nuclear testing and other militarism that oppresses femininity.|$|E

500|$|O'Leary {{also worked}} in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too {{difficult}} to attain.

The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible.

500|$|Madonna {{has stated}} that the song she most regrets {{recording}} is [...] "Material Girl" [...] and if she had known that the label would be attached to her for decades, she would probably never have done so. After making the video, Madonna said she {{never wanted to be}} compared to Monroe, despite posing like her and recreating many of Monroe's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably in a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated a certain type of liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Author Nicholas Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage. In 1993, a conference was held at the University of California at Santa Barbara, with the subject as Madonna: Feminist Icon or Material Girl?

On the advancing of the rapist plot, Goldman praised the increase in Veronica's personal involvement with the case, while continuing to criticize the portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>feminists</b> in the episode. [...] "At this point, neither we, nor Veronica, seem to be meant to have nearly any sympathy for them. And yet, shouldn't we all naturally be able to connect more to a group of girls who are passionately seeking to stop a serial rapist on campus?" [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a very positive review, lauding the Logan's half-brother storyline, calling it [...] "Top quality stuff. I loved the moment when Veronica realized Logan's brother was an imposter and in the next scene we saw the two guys surfing together. So much suspense!"

2500|$|Women's {{depictions of}} {{themselves}} in art, novels, and photography were in opposition to their objectification and portrayal as subjects of art. By creating their own art, in the post-Revolutionary period, artists could claim their own identity and interpretation of femininity. While the female artists of the immediate period following the revolution tried in their own ways to redefine their personal perceptions of body and its imagery in new ways, they did not typically champion social change. It was <b>the</b> <b>feminists</b> who came after, looking back at their work, who began to characterize it as revolutionary in sparking social change. In the 1950s, a group of Mexican writers called [...] "Generation of '50" [...] were influential in questioning the values of Mexican society. Rosario Castellanos {{was one of the}} first to bring attention to the complicity of middle-class women in their own oppression and stated, [...] "with the disappearance of the last servant will the first angry rebel appear". Castellanos sought to question caste and privilege, oppression, racism, and sexism through her writing.

6000|$|Now {{this is the}} {{attitude}} which I attack. It is the huge heresy of Precedent. It is the view that because we have got into a mess we must grow messier to suit it; that because we have taken a wrong turn some time ago we must go forward and not backwards; that because we have lost our way we must lose our map also; and because we have missed our ideal, we must forget it. [...] "There are numbers of excellent {{people who do not}} think votes unfeminine; and there may be enthusiasts for our beautiful modern industry who do not think factories unfeminine." [...] But if these things are unfeminine it is no answer to say that they fit into each other. I am not satisfied with the statement that my daughter must have unwomanly powers because she has unwomanly wrongs. Industrial soot and political printer's ink are two blacks which do not make a white. Most of <b>the</b> <b>Feminists</b> would probably agree with me that womanhood is under shameful tyranny in the shops and mills. But I want to destroy the tyranny. They want to destroy womanhood.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Feminists</b> {{held that}} women were oppressed by their {{internalization}} of patriarchal sex roles, and hence suffered from a kind of false consciousness. To liberate themselves from such oppressive roles, <b>The</b> <b>Feminists</b> held that the feminist movement must be entirely autonomous from men and eventually came to hold that women should be free of men in their personal lives as well. The group was strongly opposed to the sexual revolution, holding that {{it was simply a}} way for men to get easier access to women's bodies. (Ti-Grace Atkinson {{was one of the first}} radical feminists to be specifically critical of pornography.) They at first advocated that women practice celibacy, and later came to advocate political lesbianism. The separatist ideas of <b>The</b> <b>Feminists</b> were reflected in their membership quota, restricting women who lived with men to one-third of its members, and excluding married women entirely in 1971. After Atkinson's departure, <b>The</b> <b>Feminists</b> moved in the direction of advocating matriarchy and developing a [...] "woman's religion", ideas that later came to be known as cultural feminism.|$|E
