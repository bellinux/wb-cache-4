50|$|Foreign-exchange {{reserves}} are called reserve {{assets in the}} balance of payments and are located in the capital account. Hence, they are usually {{an important part of the}} international investment position of a country. The {{reserves are}} labeled as reserve assets under assets by functional category. In terms of financial assets classifications, the reserve assets can be classified as Gold bullion, Unallocated gold accounts, Special drawing rights, currency, Reserve position in the IMF, interbank position, other <b>transferable</b> <b>deposits,</b> other deposits, debt securities, loans, equity (listed and unlisted), investment fund shares and financial derivatives, such as forward contracts and options. There is no counterpart for reserve assets in liabilities of the International Investment Position. Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments. In the Central Bank’s Balance Sheet, foreign exchange reserves are assets, along with domestic credit.|$|E
40|$|The {{distinction}} between {{deposits and loans}} in macro-economic statistics Current international statistical standards include a {{distinction between}} deposits and loans. However, the criteria to perform the distinction between these instruments are not very clear {{in most of these}} standards, and/or require additional guidance for the practical compilation of the data. Furthermore, experience suggests that the analytical usefulness of this split may need to be further assessed, taking into account recent financial innovation. I. Current international standards The guidance provided by relevant international statistical standards may be summarised as follows: The 5 th IMF Manual on Balance of Payments (BPM 5) describes in paragraph 421 deposits as including “both transferable and other deposits. <b>Transferable</b> <b>deposits</b> consist of deposits that are exchangeable on demand at par without restriction or penalty, freely transferable by check or giro order, and otherwise commonly used to make payments (…). Other deposits include all claims reflecting evidence of deposit other than <b>transferable</b> <b>deposits</b> ” 2. According to paragraph 415, loans "comprise those financial assets created through the direct lending of funds by a creditor (lender) to a debtor (borrower) through an arrangement in which the lender either receives no security evidencin...|$|E
40|$|Based on a Financial Almost Ideal Demand System (FAIDS), {{this paper}} investigates the wealth {{structure}} of German households. The long-run wealth elasticities and interestrate elasticities were calculated using a unique new {{quarterly financial accounts}} macrodata set which covers the period from 1959 to 2009 and contains a portfolio of eight different financial assets. Descriptive analysis shows that all financial assets were characterized by substantial volatility of their weight in the portfolio of households. We found that portfolio shifts {{in the long run}} are determined significantly by changes in interest rates. The estimated model provides evidence that currency (and <b>transferable</b> <b>deposits)</b> is mainly a substitute for other assets and time deposits are typically a complement. Wealth elasticity is for most assets around unity. JEL Classification: E 21, G 11, C 32 financial wealth, household, portfolio structure...|$|E
40|$|In two essays {{published}} {{around the}} turn of the 20 th century Carl Menger (1892, 1909) offered a logical evolutionary account or “rational reconstruction ” of the development of money out of barter. He explained how money had emerged incrementally and spontaneously from individuals ’ efforts to economize on their costs of achieving desired trades. Menger had to rationally reconstruct the origins of commodity money because the events he wanted to explain took place prehistorically, before written evidence. His theory is consistent with the anthropological and experimental evidence we do have. Just as importantly, the theory is grounded in the behavior of decentralized, self-interested, and modestly informed individuals. These features favor Menger’s theory over theories that imagine money to be the creature of heroic invention, central planning, or (untraceable) legal restrictions. In “The Evolution of a Free Banking System ” (Selgin and White 1987) we used Menger’s account of the evolution of commodity money as the starting point for a discussion of the evolution of an unregulated bank-based payments system. We argued that, absent legal restrictions, private banknotes and <b>transferable</b> <b>deposits</b> would largel...|$|E
