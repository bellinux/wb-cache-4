5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival Logbook is the series's second guidebook. It {{was first}} {{discovered}} on Amazon on mid 2017. Although {{it has never}} been confirmed by Cawthon himself, several suggestions have stated that the guidebook will explore simple activities for children as <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> video games, or to familiarize new players to the game play of Five Nights at Freddy's. This new title is surmised to have crossword puzzles and word searches, instead of hidden lore or narrative hints about the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Unlike most of the previous book releases, the Survival Logbook has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it will have pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply reading from a device. The book is scheduled for release on December 26, 2017.|$|E

To date, Clemente's former teammate Willie Stargell and Andrew McCutchen are the only members of the Pittsburgh Pirates to win the award. Stargell won his award in 1974, and McCutchen won in 2015.

25|$|Structures {{as defined}} above are {{sometimes}} called s to distinguish them from the more general s. A many-sorted structure can have an arbitrary number of domains. The sorts {{are part of the}} signature, and <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> role of names for the different domains. Many-sorted signatures also prescribe on which sorts the functions and relations of a many-sorted structure are defined. Therefore, the arities of function symbols or relation symbols must be more complicated objects such as tuples of sorts rather than natural numbers.|$|E

In their first match after <b>the</b> earthquake <b>they</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> Waratahs, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games.

25|$|Overwatch is a team-based {{multiplayer}} online first-person shooter {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Blizzard Entertainment. It was released in May 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of pre-defined characters, known as heroes, each with a unique style of play, whose roles are divided into four general categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in {{a limited amount of}} time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards.|$|E
25|$|When Division I-AA {{was formed}} for {{football}} in 1978, the playoffs included just four teams, doubling to eight teams in its fourth season of 1981. In 1982 the I-AA playoffs were expanded to 12 teams, {{with each of}} the top four seeds receiving a first-round bye and a home game in the quarterfinals. In its ninth season of 1986, the I-AA playoffs were expanded again to a 16-team format, requiring four post-season victories to win the title. Eight conference champions received automatic bids, with the remaining eight bids available on an at-large basis. The field is traditionally set the Sunday before Thanksgiving and play begins that weekend. The top four teams are seeded; however, the matchups are not strictly set up by these seedings as geographic considerations are also taken into account to minimize travel. In April 2008 the NCAA announced that the playoff field would again expand to include 20 teams beginning in 2010. At the same time, it announced that the number of conferences receiving automatic bids would increase to 10. The structure then adopted included eight teams playing in four first-round games. The four first round winners advance to the second Round of Sixteen where <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> top four seeds.|$|E

500|$|The {{progression}} system received criticism. Ingenito {{thought that}} it was an unnecessary addition to the game. He added that the upgrade system hides a lot of content from players unless <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game frequently. Lathi however thought that after every character is unlocked, he felt less motivated to continue to play the game. LaBella thought that the system does not offer enough content and described it as [...] "thin". This was echoed by Strom, who felt that unlocking the characters was a [...] "grind".|$|E
500|$|In March 2017, Sayers' wife, Ardythe, {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} diagnosed with dementia four years prior. She stated that a Mayo Clinic doctor confirmed it was likely caused by his football career. [...] "It wasn't so much getting hit in the head," [...] she said." [...] It's just the shaking of the brain when they took him down with the force <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game in." [...] While he remains physically healthy, the disease has had an adverse effect on his mental health and memory in particular, making simple tasks such as signing his own name difficult.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the game, a [...] "personality transfer" [...] {{phenomenon}} frequently causes Cocoro's and Satoru's {{minds to}} switch places with each other, leaving {{them in the}} other person's body. As the player only learns what their current character experiences, they need {{to play the game}} as both characters in order to access all information. Choices the player makes as one of the characters also affect what happens in a playthrough as the other; for instance, if the player chooses to drink water as Satoru, there will be no water left if they play through the game as Cocoro, and if they get into an argument with a character as Cocoro, their relationship to that character becomes strained when <b>they</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game as Satoru.|$|E
