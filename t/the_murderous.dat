5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|At {{the police}} station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. As Sarah predicted, the agents {{do not believe}} that Hank, an {{upstanding}} member of the community, would be capable of such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> events constantly haunt him.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{arrive at}} the port {{and talk to the}} owner of the dog Dr. Ian Detweiler (Andrew Robinson), a cryptozoologist. Detweiler says the dog is a Wanshang Dhole, a species thought to be extinct. The two agents soon receive news of the other attack and, after investigating, Mulder {{believes}} the Dhole has near-human intelligence. Mulder and Scully visit Berquist, who tells them that the breed they are looking for is extinct. Meanwhile, a dog catcher is chasing a stray through a warehouse when a man enters the building. He promptly transforms into <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> dhole and attacks the catcher. Mulder and Scully soon {{arrive at the}} scene, followed by Berquist. She finds a paw print with five toes, one more than regular canines.|$|E

5|$|Chris Columbus—who {{had written}} the Spielberg-produced Gremlins, The Goonies, and Young Sherlock Holmes—was hired to write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a Katharine Hepburn type {{according}} to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old pygmy. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier—an old friend of Indiana—travel up the Zambezi river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a Toshiro Mifune type), who dies eating a peach {{because he is not}} pure of heart.|$|E
5|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare, the shortened single reel adaption of the play. The film opens with {{the meeting of the}} kings of Bohemia and Sicilia. Hermione, the queen of Sicilia, entertains Polixenes, king of Bohemia. This arouses jealousy in Leontes, the king of Sicilia. Leontes decides to poison Polixenes and orders a courtier to carry out the task. The courtier slips the poison into the cup, but he changes his mind and confesses to <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> plot. Polixenes and the courtier depart safely, but this enrages the Leontes, who has his wife imprisoned. In prison, Hermoine gives birth to a daughter and sends it to her husband, Hoping to quell his anger. This further upsets Leontes and he orders the child to be taken out to the wilderness to die. Hermione is then brought before a tribunal, swoons, and is pronounced dead by Paulina.|$|E
5|$|First, Frederick {{had assumed}} {{he could use}} his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his {{reconnaissance}} had been incomplete. The Russians {{had been there for}} two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason for him not to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, perhaps, that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.|$|E

25|$|Mark Gruenwald {{became the}} writer of the series with issue #307 (July 1985) and wrote 137 issues for 10 {{consecutive}} years from until #443 (Sept. 1995), the most issues by any single author in the character's history. Gruenwald created several new foes, including Crossbones and the Serpent Society. Other Gruenwald characters included Diamondback, Super Patriot, and Demolition Man. Gruenwald explored numerous political and social themes as well, such as extreme idealism when Captain America fights the anti-nationalist terrorist Flag-Smasher; and vigilantism when he hunts <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> Scourge of the Underworld.|$|E
25|$|Mark Strong as Pinbacker, <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> {{captain of}} Icarus I, the first ship {{that was sent}} to reignite the Sun. Pinbacker was {{inspired}} by the character of Sergeant Pinback from Dark Star. The character's disfiguring burns were influenced by the injuries suffered by F1 driver Niki Lauda. Boyle described the character of Pinbacker as a representation of fundamentalism. The director also described the potentially unrealistic presence of Pinbacker as an example of something that breaks the pattern of realism, similar to his scene in Trainspotting (1996) in which Ewan McGregor's character dives into a toilet.|$|E

In the third season of Columbo, Ferrer starred in the episode Mind over Mayhem as <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> head of a high-tech think tank. He was also in episode 8 of Magnum, P.I. with his son Miguel in 1981. In 1986 he appeared in the two-part episode The Don in the TV series Matlock.|$|E
25|$|All three {{battalion}} advances {{were turned}} back with great losses. The final group, led by Wells and Farnsworth, circled back toward Big Round Top, where they met {{a line of}} the 15th Alabama across their front. Farnsworth's party had dwindled to only ten troopers as they weaved back and forth, trying to avoid <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> fire. Farnsworth fell from his horse, struck in the chest, abdomen and leg by five bullets. Postwar accounts by a Confederate soldier who claimed Farnsworth committed suicide with his pistol to avoid capture have been discounted. Maj. Wells received the Medal of Honor for his heroism in leading {{the rest of his}} men back to safety. The Vermont regiment suffered 65 casualties during the futile assault.|$|E
25|$|Religion is a {{prominent}} part of society, although the dominant religions have evolved. A merging {{of the major}} religious groups of the 20th century {{has resulted in the}} First Amalgamated Church, while Voodoo is now mainstream. New religions include Oprahism, Robotology, and the banned religion of Star Trek fandom. Religious figures include Father Changstein-El-Gamal, the Robot Devil, Reverend Lionel Preacherbot, and passing references to the Space Pope, who appears to be a large crocodile-like creature. Several major holidays have robots associated with them, including <b>the</b> <b>murderous</b> Robot Santa and Kwanzaa-bot. While very few episodes focus exclusively on religion within the Futurama universe, they do cover a wide variety of subjects including predestination, prayer, the nature of salvation, and religious conversion.|$|E
