The experiment included 19 treatments: soil alone (T), two treatments containing soil + mineral fertilizers mixtures, soil + compost (C) at 60 t ha- 1 and 15 treatments including soil + compost + different individual or combined mineral complements of N, P, K and S. Four harvests of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. c. v. Argo) were carried out. Application of compost alone to soil caused an increase, {{especially during the}} second, third and fourth harvests, both in the boron concentration and in boron plant uptake, although no toxic effects were observed.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in the Soil Science Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Minia University, Egypt. The {{experiment}} was conducted using sandy calcareous soil treated with three application rates (10, 15, 20 ton fed *) of <b>town</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> (urban wastes) and plant residues compost (rural wastes) compared with the applicable rate (15) of the traditional cattle manure. Corn was used in this experiment as a test crop. Treating sandy calcareous soil with the tested organic materials increased plant height, dry matter production, water use efficiency, uptake of N, P and K by corn plants, compared with the control. Application of the tested materials to sandy calcareous soil increased CEC, OM content, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium, water holding capacity and available water, compared with the untreated soil (control). However it decreased hydraulic conductivity of the treated soil, compared with control. The improvement of the above mentioned parameters was proportional to the increase in the application rate of the tested materials up to 15 ton fed. Comparing the effect of the three tested materials at 15 ton fed on improving most of soil properties, plant growth and nutrients uptake by corn plants, they could be arranged in the following descending order: plant residues compost>cattle manure> <b>town</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>compost.</b> ecycling of urban and rural wastes for agricultural uses as compost is one of the alternative organic fertilizers in Egypt.

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{landscape}} slope position and organic waste residues on soil properties and cassava yield is {{a critical component of}} site-specific management. A field study was conducted in an Ultisol at Nsukka, southeastern Nigeria to investigate {{the effects of}} landscape slope positions and two organic waste residues (urban <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> and sewage sludge) on soil properties and cassava yield. The treatment consisted of two landscape slope positions, two organic waste residues, and a control; arranged in a split – plot design in RCBD. The two slope positions - mid slope (26 %) and toe slope (5 %) occupied the main–plot, while organic residues at the rate of 50 % inorganic nitrogen fertilizer requirement of cassava and a control were the sub-plot treatment. The result obtained from this study showed that slope position significantly (p 0. 05) higher at the toe slope position. However, percent survival was significantly (p> 0. 05) higher at mid slope position. Significant interactions of the slope positions and organic residues were observed in bulk density, total porosity and fresh root yield. The highest fresh cassava root yield of 11. 63 tha- 1 of the study was obtained in plots amended with urban <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> under the toe slope position.

40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to compare the effects of sewage sludge (S) and town refuse(T) additions on plant growth and yield components of wheat (Triticum sativa L.), some soil physico - chemical properties and available nutrients in reclaiming sandy soil. The organic residues were applied at rates of 5 %, 10 %, and in different combinations with N, P, K mineral fertilizers. The addition of sewage sludge, <b>town</b> <b>refuse</b> and their interactions at low rates produced the striking changes in sandy soil. An improvement in soil {{physical and chemical properties}} was noticed with increasing addition of organic residues. <b>Town</b> <b>refuse</b> furnished better results than the sewage sludge.

40|$|Cauliflower crops {{were grown}} in several regions and seasons (spring and summer). Five days after planting, the plants were treated against the root fly by pouring onto soil around the plant stem an {{emulsion}} of chlorfenvinphos [2 -chloro- 1 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) ethenyl diethyl phosphate] in water. The fields {{were divided into}} plots. Onto each plot, one of the organic fertilizers, city <b>refuse</b> <b>compost,</b> mushroom cultivation compost, or cow manure was applied {{at the rate of}} 100 tons/ha, 1 or 3. 5 months before the insecticide treatment. There were also control plots which were not treated with any of the organic fertilizers. During the first 50 days crop period which followed the insecticide treatment, the chlorfenvinphos soil concentrations were always greater in the organic fertilizer-treated plots, than in the untreated ones (controls). The intensity of the organic fertilizers effect as to the increase of chlorfenvinphos soil persistence was in the following increasing order: city <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> < cow manure < mushroom cultivation compost. The organic fertilizer effects were greater when they had been soil-incorporated 3. 5 months-instead of 1 month-before the chlorfenvinphos soil treatment. The increase of the insecticide soil concentrations-due to the organic fertilizers treatments-should increase the plant protection efficiency during the period of the first 50 days, during which time the young plants are the most sensitive to insects. During the following period of the 2 or 3 last crop weeks, the effects of the organic fertilizers onto the rate of chlorfenvinphos soil metabolism were levelled off; at harvest, the very low soil-resting residues were similar in the organic fertilizers treated and untreated plots. At harvest, no chlorfenvinphos nor its metabolites were detected in the 'flower' of cauliflower of all the plots, the analytical limit of sensitivity being 0. 02 mg kg- 1 fresh weight for all of these compounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{production of}} urban waste requires urgent responses because of various environmental problems that arise when urban refuse {{is stored in}} landfills or incinerated. Recycling of domestic waste and composting of its organic fraction has been indicated as a possible disposal solution. A three-year experiment was conducted to quantify the minimum rate of urban <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> (URC) addition able to improve some physical and chemical soil properties at the lowest cost and environmental impact. URC was added to a silty clay soil and to a sandy loam soil 0 %, 3 %, 6 %, 9 % rate (w/w). Samplings were made 12, 24 and 36 months after URC application. To study the only effect of compost on soil due to its interaction with the soil matrix, each soil-compost mixture was divided into three boxes and kept outdoors weed free. After 12 months, 3 % URC resulted the minimum quantity able to ameliorate several soil properties. In silty clay soil this rate significantly ameliorated microaggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity, but negative effects were observed on electrical conductivity. After 24 months, 3 % rate significantly increased soil organic matter content. In the sandy loam soil, after 12 months, 3 % rate of URC determined {{a positive effect on}} organic matter and cone resistance in dry soil condition. Electrical conductivity increased at 3 % URC addition. The minimum URC quantity affecting hydraulic conductivity and plastic limit was 6 %, and 9 % for the liquid limit. Under these experimental conditions, the lowest rate (3 %) of URC incorporation to soils appears to be the minimum quantity able to improve most of the soil properties influencing fertility.

In the first place, the effects of insufficiently-matured compost on the soil-plant system are studied, and the criteria and methods proposed for the determination of compost maturity are described. The conditions or characteristics which the compost must meet o assure an acceptable degree of maturity are also established. Numerous tudies make clear that the most notable ffect of immature compost is the biological blockage of soil-available nitrogen which may give rise to serious N-deficiencies in crops with consequent depressive ffects.
