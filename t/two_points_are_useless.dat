50|$|Loss and {{avoidance}} is the Core Drive that motivates us to avoid something negative from happening. On a small scale, {{it could be}} to avoid losing previous work or changing one's behaviour. On a larger scale, it could be to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> because you <b>are</b> now quitting. Opportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this Core Drive, because people feel if they didn't act immediately, they would lose the opportunity to act forever ("special offer for a limited time only!").|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the line-segment is the {{shortest}} length between <b>two</b> <b>points.</b> The arc-length of a hypercycle connecting <b>two</b> <b>points</b> <b>is</b> longer {{than that of the}} line segment and shorter than that of a horocycle, connecting the same <b>two</b> <b>points.</b> The arclength of both horocycles connecting <b>two</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> equal.

5000|$|Why is 2PD {{unreliable}} as {{a measure}} of tactile spatial acuity? It has long been recognized that, if not pressed precisely simultaneously, <b>two</b> <b>points</b> may evoke temporally distinguishable neural activations; <b>two</b> <b>points</b> may <b>be</b> distinguished from one, then, not because <b>two</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> perceived spatially, but because two contacts are perceived temporally. Furthermore, neurophysiological recordings have shown that <b>two</b> <b>points</b> evoke a different number of action potentials in the receptor population than one <b>point</b> does; <b>two</b> <b>points</b> may <b>be</b> distinguished from one, then, not because <b>two</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> actually perceived, but merely because the two-point configuration produces a different overall response magnitude. [...] In summary, the two-point task can present both a non-spatial temporal cue and a non-spatial magnitude cue. To an observant participant, these unintended non-spatial cues could signal the presence of <b>two</b> <b>points</b> compared to one, even when the <b>points</b> <b>are</b> placed closer together than the participant's spatial resolution.|$|R
