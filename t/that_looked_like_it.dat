2500|$|Estimates of Dalkowski's top {{pitching}} speed abound. Cal Ripken Sr. {{guessed that}} he threw up to [...] Most observers agree that he routinely threw well over 110miles an hour (177km/h), and sometimes reached 115mph (180km/h). Radar guns, which {{were used for}} many years in professional baseball, did not exist when Dalkowski was playing, so the only evidence supporting this level of velocity is anecdotal. It is certain that with his high speed and penchant for throwing wild pitches, he would have been an intimidating opponent for any batter who faced him. Andy Etchebarren, a catcher for Dalkowski at Elmira, described his fastball as [...] "light" [...] and fairly easy to catch. According to Etchebarren his wilder pitches usually went high, sometimes low; [...] "Dalkowski would throw a fastball <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was coming in at knee level, only to see it sail past the batter's eyes".|$|E
2500|$|Since Paul's Boutique {{was first}} released, its {{critical}} standing improved significantly. NME found the album to [...] "still [...] an electrifying blast of cool" [...] in a 1994 review, viewing it as a [...] "younger incarnation" [...] of Ill Communication. Mojo {{asserted that the}} album [...] "shredded the rulebook" [...] and called it [...] "one of the most inventive rap albums ever made". In a 2003 review, Rolling Stone gave it five stars and called it [...] "a celebration of American junk culture that is still blowing minds today - even fourteen years of obsessive listening can't exhaust all the musical and lyrical jokes crammed into Paul's Boutique". Mark Kemp of Rolling Stone also gave the album five stars in a 2009 review, calling it a [...] "hip-hop masterpiece". Nate Patrin of Pitchfork Media dubbed it [...] "a landmark {{in the art of}} sampling, a reinvention of a group <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was heading for a gimmicky early dead-end, and a harbinger of the pop-culture obsessions and referential touchstones that would come to define the ensuing decades' postmodern identity". In a review of the album for AllMusic, contributor Stephen Thomas Erlewine summed the initial reaction to Paul's Boutique and praised the density that the album contains: ...|$|E

2500|$|Octavio López {{started out}} as a body builder, {{developing}} the physique that would later on become one of his strong points. He began training for a professional wrestling career in the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) Gym under Karloff Lagarde and Ray Mendoza as well as training with Ojo de Tigre and Ebano Ruiz. He made his professional wrestling debut in 1992 under the ring name Urko and later worked as Espiritu Negro for a brief period of time. After wrestling for a few months he decided to dedicate himself to developing his physique and receive further training in the UWA wrestling school. In June, 1994 he made his re-debut for the UWA, this time working under a new ring character, Cibernético, (meaning [...] "cybernetic" [...] or Cyborg), complete with a colorful mask <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> had printed circuitry on it to enhance the [...] "Cyborg" [...] character. On July 31, 1994 Cibernétcio wrestled on his first Toreo de Cuatro Caminos show, UWA's biggest venue. On the night he teamed up with veterans El Canek and Dos Caras, taking on Los Villanos, Villano III, Villano IV and Villano V. While he made his debut as a tecnico (fan favorite) he soon turned against El Canek, turning rudo (villain), setting up a feud with the UWA's top tecnico in the hopes of using Cibernético to replace some of the UWA headliners that had left the promotion. The attempt to create new headliners was too late and by January 1995 the UWA closed down.|$|E

According to Chris Kramer, Senior Director, Communications and Community at Capcom Entertainment, the marketing group felt that {{if they were going to}} release a game <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> came from 1987, it would be best to have the marketing campaign reflect that.|$|E
50|$|Much of Wiseman's work {{tends to}} be oblique, as he prefers to make people go outside, discuss, {{research}} {{and think about the}} implications of his work rather than trying to convey his points in a 45-minute talk. So instead of talking directly about eyewitness testimony in law he would set something up <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> something like the colour changing card trick. In this mind set he has presented keynote addresses to organisations around the world and in well known forums and congresses like the Swiss Economic Forum and ESOMAR Congress. Much of this work has involved helping organisation become more successful by embracing the lucky mind-set.|$|E
