5|$|Denmark's first churches {{from the}} 9th century were built of timber {{and have not}} survived. Hundreds of stone churches in the Romanesque style {{were built in the}} 12th and 13th centuries. They had a flat-ceilinged nave and chancel with small rounded windows and round arches. Granite {{boulders}} and limestone were initially the preferred building materials, but after brick production reached Denmark {{in the middle of the}} 12th century, brick quickly became <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>of</b> choice. Among the finest examples of brick Romanesque buildings are St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted (c. 1170) and the unique Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (c. 1200) with its five tall towers.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>of</b> the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E

5|$|Since Patagosaurus {{is known}} from many specimens, {{including}} at least one juvenile, its anatomy and growth are fairly well understood. Both ages exhibit the typical features of a sauropod, a long neck, small head, a long tail, and being quadrupedal. The juvenile exhibits features different from the adult in regions like the mandible, pectoral girdle, pelvis and hindlimb, although overall their anatomy is quite similar. The many known specimens help fill in gaps in the anatomy of the genus, such as the forelimb and skull. Parts of the skeleton, like the pectoral girdle, tibia and pubis, are more robust, while others, like the forelimb and ischium, are more gracile. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>of</b> Patagosaurus is similar to closely related taxa like Cetiosaurus and Volkheimeria, more primitive genera such as Barapasaurus and Amygdalodon, and more derived sauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>of</b> the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

These deposits have been dated to the Upper Kimmeridgian stage of the Jurassic - specifically, to the regional equivalent of the Upper Kimmeridgian known as the Mittleres Kimmeridge, and belong to the Süntel Formation. Although well-preserved, fossils from this quarry were recovered generally by regular blasting operations in the quarry.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a {{considerable}} amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952–54), an examination from a feminist {{point of view of a}} male-centred epic poetry. H.D. used Euripides's play Helen as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's Cantos, a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include Sagesse, Winter Love and Hermetic Definition. These three were published posthumously with the collective title Hermetic Definition (1972). The poem Hermetic Definition takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's Canto 106. Sagesse, written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to Trilogy. being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. Winter Love was written together with End to Torment and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to restate <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>of</b> the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to Helen in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style of variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>of</b> the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E
5|$|When {{both men}} were arrested on 18 January, Carty said he was {{innocent}} of the allegations and claimed {{he had been in}} a pub in Kilburn with relatives and friends, and stayed the night at a relative's house. When police searched his home, they found a pair of trainers that forensic tests showed had a drop of ap Rhys Pryce's blood on one toe. DNA from several people, including Brown, were found on the trainers. Officers also found a top with traces of Brown's DNA, and fibres found on Pryce's overcoat were microscopically indistinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>of</b> that top. Brown also said he had been in Kilburn {{the night of the murder}} and initially claimed that he had nothing to do with either the robbery of the other man or the robbery and murder of Pryce. When the mobile phone of the other victim (Ali) was discovered at his home, he claimed he had bought it from two men. Detectives also found that Brown had hoarded press cuttings of Pryce.|$|E
