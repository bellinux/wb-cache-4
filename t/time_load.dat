50|$|Dynamic loading is a {{mechanism}} by which a computer program can, at run <b>time,</b> <b>load</b> a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory. It {{is one of the}} 3 mechanisms by which a computer program can use some other software; the other two are static linking and dynamic linking. Unlike static linking and dynamic linking, dynamic loading allows a computer program to start up in the absence of these libraries, to discover available libraries, and to potentially gain additional functionality.|$|E
5000|$|Calculating {{the elastic}} modulus with {{software}} involves using software filtering techniques to separate the critical unloading data {{from the rest of}} the load-displacement data. The start and end points are usually found by using user defined percentages. This user input increases the variability because of possible human error. It would be best if the entire calculation process was automatically done for more consistent results. A good nanoindentation machine prints out the load unload curve data with labels to each of the segments such as loading, top hold, unload, bottom hold, and reloading. If multiple cycles are used then each one should be labeled. However mores nanoindenters only give the raw data for the load-unload curves. An automatic software technique finds the sharp change from the top hold time to the beginning of the unloading. This can be found by doing a linear fit to the top hold time data. The unload data starts when the load is 1.5 times standard deviation less than the hold <b>time</b> <b>load.</b> The minimum data point is the end of the unloading data. The computer calculates {{the elastic modulus}} with this data according to the Oliver-Pharr (nonlinear). The Doerner-Nix method is less complicated to program because it is a linear curve fit of the selected minimum to maximum data. However, it is limited because the calculated elastic modulus will decrease as more data points are used along the unloading curve. The Oliver-Pharr nonlinear curve fit method to the unloading curve data where [...] is the depth variable, [...] is the final depth and [...] and [...] are constants and coefficients. The software must use a nonlinear convergence method to solve for , [...] and [...] that best fits the unloading data. The slope is calculated by differentiating [...] at the maximum displacement.|$|E

The classical load flow solution returns the power flow of each system branch—but it only does it once by assuming a <b>time</b> invariant <b>load.</b> <b>Time</b> domain <b>load</b> flow returns the same solution, but repeatedly in intervals of typically 15  min (O(102) s).

Results were summarized as follows: 1) Total serum protein concentration reached the maximal value just after the short and long time loads, but thereafter it began to decrease gradually and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise on the former load and also 60 minutes after exercise on the latter one. And total serum protein concentration was significantly higher just after exercise on the long <b>time</b> <b>load</b> than on the short time one. 2) Albumin relative and absolute concentrations in serum protein reached the maximal value just after exercise on both the short and long time loads, but thereafter they began to decrease and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise on the former load and also 60 minutes after exercise on the latter one. And albumin relative and absolute concentrations were significantly higher just and 15 minutes after exercise on the long <b>time</b> <b>load</b> than on the short time one. 3) Globulin relative concentration in serum protein reached the minimal value just after exercise on both the short and long time loads, but thereafter it began to increase and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise on the former load and also 60 minutes after exercise on the latter one. On the other hand, globulin absolute concentration did not show significant change after exercise on both the short and long time loads. And globulin relative concentration was significantly lower just after exercise on the long <b>time</b> <b>load</b> than on the short time one. 4) α-and β-globulin relative and absolute concentrations in serum protein did not show significant change after exercise on the short <b>time</b> <b>load.</b> On the other hand, α-and β-globulin relative concentrations reached the minimal value just aftere xercise on the long <b>time</b> <b>load,</b> but thereafter they began to increase and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise. Butα- and β-globvlin absolute concentrations on the long <b>time</b> <b>load</b> did not show significant change after exercise. And　β-globulin relative concentration was signifi antly lower just after exercise on the longtime load than on the short time one. 5) γ-globulin relative concentraion in serum protein reached the minimal value just after exercise on both the short and long time loads, but thereafter it began to increase and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise. On the other hand, γ-globulin absolute concentraion on both the short and long time loads did not show significant change after exercise. In the relative concentration, γ-globulin decreased more markedly than α-and β-globulin. 6) The ratio of albumin to globulin in serum protein reached the maximal value just after exercise on both the short and long time loads, but thereafter it began to fall gradually and recovered to the resting level 30 minutes after exercise on the former load and also 60 minutes after exercise on the latter one.

40|$|Abstract: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{is one of}} {{the tools}} that quantifies the inputs and outputs and evaluates the {{potential}} environmental impact during the entire life cycle of a product, process or service. However, one of the limitations in a conventional LCA is that time is rarely taken into consideration in LCA methodology. The consideration of time in an LCA is mostly considered in the scope definition and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Therefore, this paper reviews the time consideration in each phase of LCA methodology from goal and scope definition to LCIA. Moreover, the possibility of improvement, such as the <b>time</b> <b>load</b> in LCA is also reviewed. Key words: Life cycle assessment <b>Time</b> <b>load</b> LCA Life cycle impact assessmen...|$|E

The developed method includes a genetic algorithm (GA) based self-tuned PID controller for online application.

Furthermore, a very short <b>time</b> <b>load</b> forecasting (VSTLF) scheme is also employed as a novel approach for the system load variations {{to be considered in}} the LFC system. For validation of the proposed method, several comparative case studies are presented. The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy improves the system dynamics remarkably.
