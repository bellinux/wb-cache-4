Beckinsale's second film appearance of 2006 was opposite Adam Sandler and Christopher Walken in Click, a comedy about an overworked family man who discovers a magical remote control that allows him to control time.

500|$|Although he {{required}} Robinson to {{keep the}} arrangement a secret for the time being, Rickey committed to formally signing Robinson before November 1, 1945. On October 23, it was publicly announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season. On the same day, {{with representatives of the}} Royals and Dodgers present, Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals. In what was later referred to as [...] "The Noble Experiment", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s. He was not necessarily {{the best player in the}} Negro leagues, and black talents Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson were upset when Robinson was selected first. Larry Doby, who broke the color line in the American League the same year as Robinson, said, [...] "One of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player.

In November 2014, Toy Story 4 was confirmed to be in development with Lasseter serving as director. In an interview, Lasseter stated that [...] " [...] {{lot of people in the}} industry view us doing sequels as being for the business of it, but for us, it's pure passion...One of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> very important for me as an artist is to continue directing.

2500|$|With Rushmore, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson {{wanted to}} create their own [...] "slightly {{heightened}} reality, like a Roald Dahl children's book". Like Max Fischer, Wilson was expelled from his prep school, St. Mark's School of Texas, in the tenth grade, while Anderson shared Max's ambition, lack of academic motivation, and had a crush on an older woman. Anderson and Wilson began writing the screenplay for Rushmore years before they made Bottle Rocket. They knew that they wanted to make a film set in an elite prep school, much like St. Mark's, which Owen had attended along with his two brothers, Andrew and Luke (Luke being the sole graduate), and St. John's School in Houston, Texas which Anderson had attended. The film also featured M. B. Lamar High School. According to the director, [...] "One of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> most appealing to us was the initial idea of a 15-year-old kid and a 50-year-old man becoming friends and equals". Rushmore was originally going to be made for New Line Cinema but when they could not agree on a budget, Anderson, Wilson and producer Barry Mendel held an auction for the film rights in mid-1997 and struck a deal with Joe Roth, then-chair of Walt Disney Studios. He offered them a $10million budget.|$|E

2500|$|Among fellow writers, Dickens {{has been}} both lionised and mocked. Leo Tolstoy, G. K. Chesterton, and George Orwell praised his realism, comic voice, prose fluency, and satiric caricature, {{as well as his}} passionate {{advocacy}} on behalf of children and the poor. The French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favorite writer, writing his novels [...] "stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression." [...] The Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickens's novels in several of his paintings like Vincent's Chair and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens, especially A Christmas Carol, was one of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> keeping him from committing suicide. Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature. His late contemporary William Wordsworth, by then Poet laureate, thought him a [...] "very talkative, vulgar young person", adding he had not read a line of his work; Dickens in return thought Wordsworth [...] "a dreadful Old Ass". Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him [...] "the greatest of superficial novelists": Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth and the novels, [...] "loose baggy monsters", betrayed a [...] "cavalier organisation". Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with his works, finding his novels [...] "mesmerizing" [...] while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Belaney's {{efforts and}} {{conservation}} were focused towards the beaver up North; however, {{with the publication}} of The Men of the Last Frontier, his conservation efforts came to include all wild animals. While he had at one time been a fur trapper, he came to believe that [...] "the trap, the rifle, and poison" [...] would some day result in [...] "the Dwellers in the forest {{to come to an end}} too." [...] He expressed in Pilgrims of the Wild how our rush to exploit natural resources for commercial value overlooks [...] "the capabilities and possibilities of the wild creatures involved in it." [...] It was this [...] "commodification of all living <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the destruction from the beaver." [...] Belaney expressed that if there were [...] "temporary at least" [...] protection for fur bearing animals, then we would [...] "see the almost human response to kindness" [...] from animals. He called for people to remember [...] "that you belong to nature, and not it to you." [...] Men of the Last Frontier was first called The Vanishing Frontier, and subsequently named Men of the Last Frontier by the publishers, which he felt [...] "missed the entire point of the book" [...] as he [...] "spoke of nature, not men."

2500|$|Adrian Ballinger and Cory Richards were {{sponsored}} by Eddie Bauer to climb Everest, and they relayed {{information from the}} Everest climb using the smartphone software application and service Snapchat. Mount Everest has had a 3G wireless data communication network since 2010. One of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> reported by them, was that bottled oxygen was stolen from them {{and there was some}} bad behaviour up there. The bottled oxygen was there for emergency back-up if they ran into trouble. Cory Richards summited Mount Everest without oxygen and returned safely, and Adrian made it almost to the top also. Another famous mountaineer, British climber Kenton Cool achieved his 12th Everest summit (the second-highest number of Everest summitings for a foreigner after Dave Hahn), and US celebrity mountaineer Melissa Arnot, completed her sixth summit, and achieved her personal goal of climbing Everest without supplementary bottled oxygen. This also {{turned out to be the}} most summits for a foreign female (not Nepali or Chinese), and one of the first US women to summit and survive without supplementary oxygen. In 1998 Francys Arsentiev had made it to the summit, but died during the descent; she went on to become a famous corpse as a landmark known as [...] "Sleeping Beauty" [...] until she was buried on Everest in 2007 by one of the people who had tried to help her. Another woman from the Americas, the Ecuadorian woman Carla Perez also summited Mount Everest in 2016 without supplementary oxygen. Perez and Arnot became the fifth and sixth women to summit Everest without supplementary oxygen. There is an ongoing discussion about the use of extra bottled oxygen in mountaineering. Also at issue is Dexamethasone (Dex), which is valuable as a lifesaver as it reduces swelling in the brain if someone comes down with high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). When American Bill Burke was interviewed for his attempt, he noted how one of his team members had overdosed on Dex, prompting a medical evacuation even as in his more recent expedition, someone had 25 doses of Dex. He also noted it was hard to argue against large supplies of Dex, due its life-saving properties against some types of altitude sickness, especially HACE. An example of a death in which Dex was implicated was Dr. Eberhard Schaaf in 2012 on Everest. Schaaf died on descent at the south summit from altitude sickness. It has a good reputation as a life saver, and is commonly given to Everest climbers for its ability to intervene in last desperate moments when altitude sickness sets in. For example, in the 2016 season Robert Gropel said he gave Dex to his wife (as reported by the Telegraph) in attempt to save her as they tried to descend Everest. Of course, Dex is just the tip of the iceberg, with the UIAA noting the aforementioned dexamethasone, but also [...] acetazolamide (aka Diamox), amphetamine, and alcohol use; and another noted Diamox (acetazolamide) use among trekkers. It is not really a matter of some authorities being for or against medications, but awareness, as misuse can cause drug interactions and various side effects. [...] In particular it was noted that supplementary oxygen significantly lowers death rate on ultra-high altitude mountain climbing, and is generally not regulated as a drug, whereas the safe use of medications is less understood or even acknowledged in many cases.
