5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> <b>as</b> the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans {{did in the}} face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Even though Maryland did not {{secede from}} the Union, Steuart's loyalty lay with <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> <b>as</b> did {{that of his}} father. He {{commanded}} one of the Baltimore city militias during the riot of April 1861, following which Federal troops occupied Baltimore, an incident which was arguably the first armed confrontation of the Civil War.|$|E
5000|$|Rudyard Kipling {{who lived}} at Rottingdean {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Downs <b>as</b> [...] "Our blunt, bow-headed whale-backed Downs". [...] Writing in 1920 in his poem <b>The</b> <b>South</b> Country, poet Hilaire Belloc describes <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Downs <b>as</b> [...] "the great hills of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Country". [...] In On <b>The</b> <b>South</b> Coast, poet Algernon Charles Swinburne describes <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Downs <b>as</b> [...] "the green smooth-swelling unending downs".|$|R

50|$|In 1972, {{when he was}} 18 year of age, he {{presented}} himself to the Randwick Club, but was advised to spend a year with the Colts due to his lack of experience. Instead, {{he went back to}} join <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Sydney Jersey Flegg Team. He also played some Third Grade matches for <b>the</b> <b>Souths</b> <b>as</b> an amateur rugby player.|$|R
5|$|He {{defeated}} Badlay ad-Din, the Sultan of Adal at the Battle of Gomit in 1445, which consolidated {{his hold}} over the Sidamo kingdoms in <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as the}} weak Muslim kingdoms beyond the Awash River. Similar campaigns in the north against the Agaw and the Falasha were not as successful.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in <b>the</b> <b>South.</b> <b>As</b> the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> <b>as</b> the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Most {{accepted}} Lord Shiva as {{the primary}} deity and the lingam, the universal symbol of Shiva, was consecrated in shrines dedicated to him. The other Hindu gods of the pantheon such as Murugan, Pillaiyar, Kali were also worshipped. At the village level, village deities were popular along with the worship of Kannaki whose veneration was common amongst the Sinhalese in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>as</b> well. Belief in charm and evil spirits existed, {{just as in the}} rest of South Asia.|$|E

5|$|On the Union left, Nelson's {{division}} led the advance, {{followed closely}} by Crittenden's and McCook's men, down the Corinth and Hamburg-Savannah roads. After heavy fighting, Crittenden's division recaptured the Hornet's Nest area by late morning, but the Crittenden and Nelson forces were repulsed by determined counterattacks from Breckinridge. Wallace's and Sherman's men on the Union right made steady progress, driving Bragg and Polk to <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> <b>As</b> Crittenden and McCook resumed their attacks, Breckinridge was forced to retire. By noon Beauregard's line paralleled the Hamburg-Purdy Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{guidelines}} set by Judah Benjamin in 1861 {{soon became}} {{the choice of}} the clothing depots across <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>as</b> the war went into its second year. This easier-to-produce jacket, with the loosened hat and trouser regulations, made it easier to clothe Confederate infantrymen. The typical uniform by the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862 was a slouch hat or kepi, a shell-jacket, and a pair of sky-blue or gray cloth trousers, with brogans.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at 12:00, the newly arrived 3rd Battalion resumed the attack against Hill 518 from <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>as</b> did the 1st Battalion the day before, in a column of {{companies}} that resolved itself in the end into a column of squads. Again the attack failed. Other attacks failed on September 4. A North Korean forward observer captured on Hill 518 said that 1,200 North Koreans were dug in on the hill {{and that they had}} large numbers of mortars and ammunition to hold out.|$|E

5|$|The {{town has}} good {{access to the}} {{motorway}} network. Junction 7 of the M60 is just {{to the north of}} Stretford's boundary with Sale, and the A56 road gives easy access to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>as</b> well as to Manchester city centre in the other direction. Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative.|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> <b>as</b> well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with South College Avenue DE 896 splits to the south. A {{park and ride}} lot {{is located at the}} southeast corner of this intersection. DE 4 continues east near Delaware Stadium and the Bob Carpenter Center on the University of Delaware campus to the north, intersecting Chestnut Hill Road. At this point the road becomes Chestnut Hill Road and runs between farmland to the north and residential neighborhoods to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>as</b> it comes to a crossing of Norfolk Southern's Delmarva Secondary railroad line. The road heads into commercial areas and intersects DE 72, with a park and ride lot situated southeast of {{the intersection}}.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Andriamasinavalona's reign, the {{highlands}} around Imerina were wracked with violent conflict among minor princedoms centered around fortified hill towns. Andriamasinavalona successfully united {{a number of these}} principalities in the territory bordering his own, thereby expanding the boundaries of Imerina to include Fanongoavana to the west, Rangaina to the north, Ombifotsy to the east and Sahasarotra to <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> <b>As</b> he brought each territory under his control, he restricted the autonomy of its original rulers and imposed strict submission to his own authority. His diplomatic and political conquests enabled Andriamasinavalona to extend his kingdom to its fullest historical extent, making him the first Merina sovereign to rule over the entire province of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward, I-496 passes {{north of}} the {{assembly}} plant complex {{and south of the}} central business district. East of a partial interchange with Walnut Street, the freeway passes the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, which is located on I-496's southern service drive. The south side of the freeway is adjacent to Cooley Gardens near the confluence of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers. I-496 crosses the Grand River downstream from the confluence and meets the eastern terminus of the Capitol Loop. This interchange with Cedar and Larch streets is also a connection to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96) and Pennsylvania Avenue. St. Joseph Street ends after the connection to Pennsylvania Avenue. The main freeway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation. I-496 runs parallel to {{the north side of the}} rail line while Malcolm X Street follows to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>as</b> far as the Clemens Avenue overpass. The freeway then crosses into East Lansing near the Red Cedar Natural Area.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{territory}} lay {{in what is}} now Scotland {{south of}} the River Forth, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland (Alba), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct or indirect control over most of the region to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>as</b> far as the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland. Lothian and the Merse were the heartlands of {{the northern part of the}} old English Earldom of Northumbria, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of Lauderdale, Eskdale, Liddesdale, and most of Teviotdale and Annandale, were English in language and regarded themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having been under the control of the king of the Scots for at least a century.|$|E

5|$|Duyệt's death {{opened the}} way for Minh Mạng to apply his {{policies}} in <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>as</b> the viceroy's subordinates lacked the influence to defy the court. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyệt's followers’ political power by abolishing the post of viceroy and putting the south under his direct rule, thus making Duyệt the last holder of the post. Soon after Duyệt's death, Minh Mạng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyệt and his aides had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices.|$|E
5|$|East of NY198, {{the road}} becomes more open {{as it passes}} through neighborhoods with a more {{suburban}} residential feel to them. Along this stretch, NY33 connects to several streets, including Bailey Avenue (U.S. Route62 or US62) and Harlem Road (NY240). Past Harlem Road, the expressway makes a slight curve to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>as</b> it prepares to meet a toll-free section of the New York State Thruway (I-90) at a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond I-90, the expressway veers to the south again, traversing an S-curve before connecting to Union Road (NY277) {{by way of a}} partial interchange. After another , NY33 curves south under Genesee Street before joining it at a traffic light in front of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Elstow first {{formed in}} the area known as Lakeview. Administrative affairs were handled from 1905 to 1909 by the Local Improvement District #17-A3 and then by rural {{municipality}} Blucher No. 343. The station of Fountain was on the rail line and Provincial Highway 14 in 1907. Lanigan received steel in 1907. Lanigan was a CPR junction point and five rail lines served the area from Lanigan, as well as Provincial highway 14 (the Yellowhead) and Hwy 20. Humboldt and Watson were served to the north, and Nokomis to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>as</b> well as the main Saskatoon Winnipeg line. The rail came to Wynyard in 1909, and three years later the area incorporated as a town. Wynyard was the CPR divisional point.|$|E
