500|$|Producer Tonino Cervi, {{head of the}} {{production}} company Italy Film, {{was the first person}} to propose a film adaptation of the Diabolik comic strip. During this period, Andre Hunebelle's film Fantomas was popular.

[...] In another interview, he acknowledged that [...] "nowadays a good film based on Flash Gordon would be a sensational success [...] but it would cost as much as Cleopatra. I have to settle for something more modest, so I'm doing Diabolik." [...] Cervi's initial intention was that Diabolik would allow him to finance an anthology film directed by Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, and Akira Kurosawa.|$|E
