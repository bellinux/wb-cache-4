5|$|Bill Haywood {{had left}} the WFM and was {{organizing}} for the IWW {{by the time the}} Lawrence Textile Strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts garnered national attention. On January 11, 1912, textile mill workers in Lawrence left <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> protest of lowered wages. Within a week, twenty thousand workers were on strike. The IWW already had a presence in Lawrence and assumed leadership of the strike.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's {{campaign}} made {{extensive use}} of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats {{did not want to}} lower the tariff so much that they would lose <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> <b>In</b> a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.|$|E

5|$|The new {{industrial}} workforce often {{lived and}} worked under very poor conditions, and enjoyed few employment rights. Workers who left <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> protest could find themselves arrested by the mounted police {{under the terms of}} the Masters and Servants Act for deserting their employment, or alternatively detained under the vagrancy laws. Although the position of organised labour was weak in Canada – the trade unions only had very limited legal rights – the number of industrial disputes grew significantly over this period. The resulting lockouts and strikes sometimes required armed government intervention. The militia was most commonly used for this purpose, but the mounted police were cheaper to deploy and were considered to be more politically reliable.|$|E
5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people to lose <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across {{the remainder of the}} southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1837, Sherman {{left school}} {{and found a}} job as a junior {{surveyor}} on construction of improvements to the Muskingum River. Because he had obtained the job through Whig Party patronage, the election of a Democratic governor in 1838 meant that Sherman {{and the rest of his}} surveying crew were discharged from <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> June 1839. The following year, he moved to Mansfield to study law in the office of his older brother, Charles Taylor Sherman. He was admitted to the bar in 1844 and joined his brother's firm. Sherman quickly became successful at the practice of law, and by 1847 had accumulated property worth $10,000 and was a partner in several local businesses. By that time, Sherman and his brother Charles were able to support their mother and two unmarried sisters, who now moved to a house Sherman purchased in Mansfield. In 1848, Sherman married Margaret Cecelia Stewart, the daughter of a local judge. The couple never had any biological children, but adopted a daughter, Mary, in 1864.|$|E

5|$|Ismael {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} {{further to the}} north, peaking at 10.9inches (276mm) in Sonora. Severe flooding was reported in Huatabampo. The hurricane directly affected 24,111people in 8 municipalities. Throughout Sonora, the strong winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs of 6,827 homes. The hurricane also destroyed 107 schools and 2 health centers in the state. The passage of Hurricane Ismael damaged high-tension power lines and cable lines, causing interruptions to the communication system. The hurricane also weakened 2,163miles (3,481km) of gravel roads and damaged about 100miles (165km) of paved highways. 250people lost <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> Sonora due to sunken or damaged fishing boats.

5|$|More than 30,000 workers {{walked off}} <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> May 1919 in {{what came to}} be known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the {{activity}} of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 19th century further changes in {{northern}} Westchester negatively affected the West Somers church. The railroads began to spur suburbanization, as city residents who originally spent their summers and weekends in the area {{began to realize that}} they could live there full-time and commute to <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> the city via train. The growing city, in need of water, began acquiring large tracts of land, sometimes including whole communities, in the area through eminent domain, reducing the total amount of land available for development and thus driving up the value of what remained. This induced many of the area's farmers, the population from which West Somers had grown, to sell their farms for subdivision and development.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Velasquez {{decided to}} adopt a new {{organizing}} strategy. The union believed that Ohio tomato growers {{would be unable to}} recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. So that year 2,000 FLOC members walked off <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> Ohio. While some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the Campbell Soup Company were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC initiated a boycott of Campbell's. Six years later, not much had changed even though FLOC had conducted a well-publicized 560-mile march from Toledo to Campbell Soup headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, in 1983. Even the support of the National Council of Churches and a group of Catholic bishops in Ohio failed to sway the company.|$|E
