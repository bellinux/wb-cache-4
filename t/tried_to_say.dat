25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} sat down. On my left was Guttierez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E
25|$|By November 2006, Kip and B.G. {{began to}} show displeasure in TNA and {{threatened}} to go find work elsewhere {{if they did not}} receive gold soon. They began performing the crotch chop, a reference to the WWE's DX. On the November 2 edition of Impact!, Kip and B.G. threatened to quit. Kip grabbed the mic and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something to the TNA administration and Spike TV, but each time his mic was cut off. Kip then tried to use the announcer's headset, but it was cut off as well. Frustrated, he started yelling loudly to the crowd, but he was cut off again as the show went to a commercial break. When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was reported that the segment was a worked shoot that Vince Russo had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return. Kip and BG appeared in an internet video on TNA's website where they addressed the owner of WWE Vince McMahon.|$|E
500|$|From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied {{history at}} Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While there {{he had his}} first work published, the {{critical}} essay [...] "Two Meredithian Heroes", which was printed in the college magazine in autumn 1905. As an undergraduate he met and fell {{under the spell of}} A. C. Benson, formerly a greatly loved master at Eton, and by this time a don at Magdalene College. Walpole's religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: [...] "e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for me more than anyone in the world. I could not believe it... It is extraordinarily touching.... It is quite right that he should believe all this passionately; it is quite right that I should know that it will not last... I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this as tenderly as I could..." ...|$|E

[...] "When there are no safe bets, that's when I feel my blood move." [...] He also shared how {{important}} the lyrics to this song are for him when he posted a photograph of Unorthodox Jukeboxs artwork via his Twitter account. [...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E

It'll obviously include all kinds of people. But as you look at generations as social units, we consider it to be at least as powerful and, in our view, far more powerful than other social groupings such as economic class, race, sex, religion and political parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many writers {{felt that}} Gibson's film was {{accurate}} about the Maya, since it depicts {{the era of}} decline and division that followed the civilization's peak, collapse, re-settlement, and proto-historic societal conditions. One Mexican reporter, Juan E. Pardinas, wrote that [...] "this historical interpretation bears some resemblances with reality [...] Mel Gibson's characters are more similar to the Mayas of the Bonampak's murals than the ones that appear in the Mexican school textbooks." [...] "The first researchers {{tried to make a}} distinction between the 'peaceful' Maya and the 'brutal' cultures of central Mexico", David Stuart wrote in a 2003 article. [...] "They even <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> human sacrifice was rare among the Maya." [...] But in carvings and mural paintings, Stuart said: [...] "we have now found more and greater similarities between the Aztecs and Mayas." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cobb {{was having}} a {{tremendous}} year in 1911, which included a 40-game hitting streak. Still, [...] "Shoeless" [...] Joe Jackson led him by [...]009 points in the batting race late in the season. Near {{the end of the}} season, Cobb's Tigers had a long series against Jackson's Cleveland Naps. Fellow Southerners Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly {{both on and off the}} field. Cobb used that friendship to his advantage. Cobb ignored Jackson when Jackson <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything to him. When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily back at him, making him wonder what he could have done to enrage Cobb. Cobb felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to [...] "fall off" [...] to a final average of [...]408, twelve points lower than Cobb's [...]420, a twentieth-century record which stood until George Sisler tied it and Rogers Hornsby surpassed it with [...]424, the record since then except for Hugh Duffy's [...]438 in the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{claims he}} {{established}} a friendship with Sean Hannity, on whose radio program {{he had once been}} a frequent presence. In 2008, while Hannity and Malik Zulu Shabazz of the New Black Panther Party were debating Barack Obama's association with Jeremiah Wright, Shabazz asked Hannity if he should [...] "be judged by (his) promotion and association with Hal Turner". Hannity began to say that he didn't know Turner, but then said he was someone he had banned from his radio program ten years before. Turner subsequently gave an account of their association on his website, in which he said of Hannity's response: [...] "I was quite disappointed when Sean Hannity at first <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he didn't know me. In fact, Sean does know me and we were quite friendly a few years ago." [...] Phil Boyce, Program Director of WABC, disputed the account, which described a friendship developing between Turner and Hannity in 1993, three years before Hannity was actually hired at WABC.|$|E
2500|$|The Sandinistas' {{relationship}} with the Roman Catholic Church deteriorated as the Contra War continued. The hierarchy refused {{to speak out against}} the counterrevolutionary activities of the contras and failed to denounce American military aid. State media accused the Catholic Church of being reactionary and supporting the Contras. According to former President Ortega, [...] "The conflict with the church was strong, and it costs us, but I don't think it was our fault. ... There were so many people being wounded every day, so many people dying, and it was hard for us to understand the position of the church hierarchy in refusing to condemn the contras." [...] The hierarchy-state tensions were brought to the fore with Pope John Paul II 1983 visit to Nicaragua. Hostility to the Catholic Church became so great that at one point, FSLN militants shouted down Pope John Paul II as he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Mass. Therefore, while the activities of the Catholic church contributed {{to the success of the}} Sandinista revolution, the hierarchy's opposition was a major factor in the downfall of the revolutionary government.|$|E
