5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each <b>theca</b> contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E
25|$|In females, {{synthesis}} of estrogens starts in <b>theca</b> interna {{cells in the}} ovary, by the {{synthesis of}} androstenedione from cholesterol. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the basal membrane into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas <b>theca</b> cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and <b>theca</b> cells are essential {{for the production of}} estrogen in the ovaries.|$|E

50|$|The <b>thecae</b> of Chlorodendrales {{species are}} often unique, {{and it is}} an {{important}} character for species identification and classification. Thecate features vary greatly from species to species, in which <b>thecae</b> can vary between 1-5 scale layers, in scale shape, in scale size, and in molecular composition/ultrastructure. These thecate features are genetically determined, and thus, they are a consistent and reliable characteristic that will not be influenced by environmental factors.|$|R
25|$|During the {{reproductive}} years, most estradiol in women {{is produced by}} the granulosa cells of the ovaries by the aromatization of Δ4-androstenedione (produced in the <b>theca</b> folliculi cells) to estrone, followed by conversion of estrone to estradiol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.|$|E
25|$|LH (luteinizing hormone) is {{a larger}} protein hormone {{secreted}} into the general circulation by gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. The main target cells of LH are the Leydig cells of testes and the <b>theca</b> cells of the ovaries. LH secretion changes more dramatically with the initiation of puberty than FSH, as LH levels increase about 25-fold {{with the onset of}} puberty, compared with the 2.5-fold increase of FSH.|$|E
25|$|As the {{amplitude}} of LH pulses increases, the <b>theca</b> {{cells of the}} ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of progesterone. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called granulosa cells. Smaller increases of FSH induce {{an increase in the}} aromatase activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation. The remaining testosterone, together with adrenal androgens is responsible for the typical androgenic changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hair as outlined above, body odor, acne. The bioactivity of testosterone is to a large degree limited by SHBG which in turn is mainly controlled by estradiol and prolactin levels (estradiol stimulates, prolactin decreases SHBG synthesis).|$|E

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of freeze-dried whole cells and empty <b>thecae</b> of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense Nygaard originating from dense blooms in Lake Kinneret (Israel) was followed experimentally under controlled {{conditions in the}} lab. The two materials (whole cells; empty <b>thecae)</b> were suspended in replicate bottles containing nutrient-poor epilimnetic water from the lake. After 7 d, nutrients (N, P, and trace metals) were added to half the bottles. We followed the changes with time in dry weight, the dynamics of nutrients, microbial abundances {{and a range of}} microbial activities including leucine incorporation rates and activities of hydrolytic enzymes. Because of the low N and P content of <b>thecae</b> (C: N: P atomic ratios. 3000 : 19 : 1) relative to protoplasts (276 : 51 : 1), the microbial utilization of <b>thecae</b> was expected to depend much more on the availability of external nutrient sources than the utilization of protoplasts. Indeed, {{decomposition of}} <b>thecae</b> did not occur in the absence of external nutrients but was rapid (1 – 2 d to their disappearance) after nutrients were added. In contrast, almost no stimulating effect of nutrient addition was observed for the decomposition of whole cells. The results suggest that intensive regenerative nutrient cycling or external nutrient inputs are a necessary precondition for an efficient trophic transfer of the energy stored in blooms of thecate dinoflagellates. The high nutrient demands of microbial degradation imply furthermore a competition for nutrients between heterotrophic degradative and phototrophic productive processes. Because o...|$|R
50|$|The frustule's {{structure}} is usually {{composed of two}} overlapping sections known as <b>thecae</b> (or less formally as valves). The join between the two <b>thecae</b> is supported by bands of silica (girdle bands) that hold them together. This overlapping allows for some internal expansion room and is essential during the reproduction process. The frustule also contains many pores and slits that provide the diatom access to the external environment for processes such as waste removal and mucilage secretion.|$|R
25|$|In pure {{morphological}} terms, a dinocyst can {{be described}} as the body formed by the cyst wall, as well as the space it encloses and all the spaces within it. Cysts may develop their wall immediately within the <b>theca,</b> and such cysts are called proximate. Alternatively, the cyst may comprise a more or less spherical central body with processes or crests, and such cysts are termed chorate or proximochorate. Cysts may have a single-layered wall (autophragm), a two-layered wall (comprising an outer periphragm and an inner endophragm) or a three-layered wall (ectophragm, periphragm and endophragm if the outer wall is structurally supported, or otherwise periphragm, mesophragm and endophragm). Cysts with two or more wall layers that define a cavity are termed cavate. Excystment usually results in loss of part of, or an opening in, the cyst wall, termed archeopyle, the shape and position of which may indicate the position and/or shape of one or more thecal plates.|$|E
25|$|This form of {{division}} {{results in a}} size reduction of the daughter cell that received the smaller frustule from the parent and therefore the average cell size of a diatom population decreases, until the cells are about one-third their maximum size. It has been observed, however, that certain taxa {{have the ability to}} divide without causing a reduction in cell size. Nonetheless, in order to restore the cell size of a diatom population for those that do endure size reduction, sexual reproduction and auxospore formation must occur. Vegetative cells of diatoms are diploid (2N) and so meiosis can take place, producing male and female gametes which then fuse to form the zygote. The zygote sheds its silica <b>theca</b> and grows into a large sphere covered by an organic membrane, the auxospore. A new diatom cell of maximum size, the initial cell, forms within the auxospore thus beginning a new generation. Resting spores may also be formed as a response to unfavourable environmental conditions with germination occurring when conditions improve.|$|E

2500|$|Reproduction {{among these}} organisms is {{primarily}} asexual by binary fission, with each daughter cell receiving {{one of the}} parent cell's two frustules (or <b>theca).</b> [...] This is used by each daughter cell as the larger frustule (or epitheca) into which a second, small frustule (or hypotheca) is constructed.|$|E
2500|$|Testosterone is a {{steroid hormone}} {{produced}} {{primarily by the}} Leydig cells of the testes, and in lesser amounts by the <b>theca</b> cells of the ovaries and the adrenal cortex.

2500|$|Many protists and {{bacteria}} produce other cell surface structures apart from cell walls, external (extracellular matrix) or internal. Many algae have a sheath or envelope of mucilage outside the cell made of exopolysaccharides. Diatoms build a frustule from silica {{extracted from the}} surrounding water; radiolarians, foraminiferans, testate amoebae and silicoflagellates also produce a skeleton from minerals, called test in some groups. [...] Many green algae, such as Halimeda and the Dasycladales, and some red algae, the Corallinales, encase their cells in a secreted skeleton of calcium carbonate. [...] In each case, the wall is rigid and essentially inorganic. It is the non-living component of cell. Some golden algae, ciliates and choanoflagellates [...] produces a shell-like protective outer covering called lorica. Some dinoflagellates have a <b>theca</b> of cellulose plates, and coccolithophorids have coccoliths.|$|E

50|$|Pinnularia are {{elongated}} elliptical unicellular organisms. Their cell {{walls are}} composed chiefly of pectic substances on a rigid silica framework.

The margins of the two <b>thecae</b> are covered by a connecting band called a cingulum and all together {{are referred to as}} a frustule. the surface view is called valve view and band view is called girdle view.The outer larger valve is called Epitheca and the smaller inner valve is called hypotheca. The cell is covered by a mucilaginous layer.|$|R
2500|$|Because P450scc and StAR {{are also}} {{essential}} for sex steroid synthesis in the testis and ovary, {{the production of}} testosterone by Leydig cells in the testis and androgen (which leads to estrogen production by granulosa cells) and progesterone by ovarian <b>theca</b> cells and luteal cells, respectively, can also be impaired. Similar to the adrenal gland, cholesterol accumulation damages the Leydig cells of the testes. [...] In the ovary, the damage begins after puberty, {{the time when the}} ovary starts making steroid with follicle development. [...] The placenta also makes steroid to help maintain pregnancy. [...] However, since StAR is not required for placental steroid production, pregnancy goes to term. [...] When the mutation in P450scc that causes lipoid CAH is either heterozygous or its presence on both alleles does not completely destroy all function, affected babies can survive to birth as well. Also of note, enlargement of the adrenal gland is not always found in the patient, especially in cases where a mutation in the gene for P450scc is the cause.|$|E

Though numerous net samples were taken from the same locality throughout the year, I did not meet with the animal again, only empty <b>thecae</b> sometimes being found. However when for the purpose of recovering more specimens, samples of bottom mud were taken, the living animal was seen again, though only once, and in one living specimen. After that I did not succeed in catching the animal again. Describing a new species from such scanty material as two living specimens and a few empty <b>thecae</b> may seem to be premature and not justified, but as the characteristic features are so unlike those of other species known of the genus Hyalosphenia, I feel sure that a mistake is out of the question...|$|R

40|$|Evolutionary {{trends of}} the Gothograptus lineage (Graptolithina, Retiolitidae) {{from the lower}} Homerian to lower Ludfordian, Silurian are described. Gothograptids evolved towards {{simplification}} of the tubarium and {{decrease in the number}} of <b>thecae.</b> The lineage is characterized by finite growth, ending with a tubular appendix in most species, long sicula and singular genicular processes in some forms. Species belonging to the genera of the Gothograptus lineage (Gothograptus, Baculograptus, Neogothograptus and Holoretiolites) occur continuously from the Cyrtograptus lundgreni to the Saetograptus leintwardinensis biozones. Gothograptus nassa is the only retiolitid known to appear immediately after the lundgreni event. The oldest genera of the lineage, Gothograptus and Baculograptus, have a well-developed tubarium with a dense reticulum and nema incorporated into the lateral wall. Younger genera have a free nema and, in general, gradually reduced number of <b>thecae,</b> lists, reticulum and apertural processes, whereas the sicula becomes longer. The best-developed apertural processes occur in Gothograptus. Holoretiolites Eisenack, 1951, the last known representative of the lineage, has the most reduced tubarium with three pairs of <b>thecae,</b> few lists and no apertural processes. This is one of the last representatives of the retiolitids, which became extinct in the S.  leintwardinensis Biozone...|$|R
