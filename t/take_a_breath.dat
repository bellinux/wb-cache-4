25|$|A biped has {{the ability}} to breathe while running, without strong {{coupling}} to stride cycle. Humans usually <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> every other stride when their aerobic system is functioning. During a sprint the anaerobic system kicks in and breathing slows until the anaerobic system can no longer sustain a sprint.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{swimming}} {{calls for}} one breath every third arm recovery or every 1.5 cycles, alternating the sides for breathing. Some swimmers instead <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> every cycle, i.e., every second arm recovery, breathing always {{to the same}} side. Most competition swimmers will breathe every other stroke, or once a cycle, to a preferred side. However some swimmers can breathe comfortably to both sides. Sprinters will often breathe a predetermined number of times in an entire race. Elite sprinters will breathe once or even no times during a fifty-metre race. For a one hundred metre race sprinters will often breathe every four strokes, once every two cycles, or will start with every four strokes and finish with every two strokes. In water polo and water rescue, the head is often {{kept out of the}} water completely for better visibility and easier breathing, at the price of a much steeper body position and higher drag.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Take</b> <b>a</b> Deep <b>Breath</b> is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by Canadian band, Brighton Rock.

500|$|The Boston Globe {{music critic}} Joan Anderman criticized the album saying [...] "Jackson's {{decision}} to recycle the nympho routine {{one more time}} is just boring [...] A quarter-century into her career, it was Jackson's moment to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> dig a little deeper, and make a bold - {{or at least a}} different - statement. Instead, she has trussed herself up in vinyl to coo another batch of digitized porn." [...] On a better note, she called the tracks [...] "Rollercoaster" [...] and [...] "Luv" [...] "engaging tracks", describing them as a [...] "sassy-sweet side" [...] and [...] "a plump, crackling confection", respectively.|$|E
500|$|According to Donald Spoto in The Dark Side of Genius, Hitchcock's wife, Alma Reville, {{spotted a}} blooper {{in one of}} the last {{screenings}} of Psycho before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to Patricia Hitchcock, talking in Laurent Bouzereau's [...] "making of" [...] documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath.</b> In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences. Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimation to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.|$|E
500|$|Sophocles {{died at the}} age of ninety or ninety-one in {{the winter}} of 406/5 BC, having seen within his {{lifetime}} both the Greek triumph in the Persian Wars and the bloodletting of the Peloponnesian War. As with many famous men in classical antiquity, his death inspired a number of apocryphal stories. The most famous is the suggestion that he died from the strain of trying to recite a long sentence from his Antigone without pausing to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath.</b> Another account suggests he choked while eating grapes at the Anthesteria festival in Athens. A third holds that he died of happiness after winning his final victory at the City Dionysia. A few months later, a comic poet, in a play titled The Muses, wrote this eulogy: [...] "Blessed is Sophocles, who had a long life, was a man both happy and talented, and the writer of many good tragedies; and he ended his life well without suffering any misfortune." [...] According to some accounts, however, his own sons tried to have him declared incompetent near the end of his life; he is said to have refuted their charge in court by reading from his as yet unproduced Oedipus at Colonus. One of his sons, Iophon, and a grandson, also called Sophocles, also became playwrights.|$|E

50|$|The defense {{pathologist}} {{testified that}} the 23- or 24-week fetus was stillborn, with lungs insufficiently developed to breathe, while the prosecution pathologist {{testified that the}} fetus was at 25 to 30 weeks and was born alive. The prosecutors used a widely discredited lung float test {{to determine whether the}} fetus <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> after birth. The procedure tests the buoyancy of the lungs in the belief that lungs that float suggest that the fetus <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> and the lungs in this case did float. Forensic experts discredit the use of such a test in criminal proceedings {{because of the number of}} false positives on record. The jury in Patel's case determined the fetus had been alive and found Patel guilty of child neglect.|$|R

[...] It is an ambush predator and primarily carnivorous, feeding on crustaceans, molluscs and fish (although some aquatic plants may also be eaten).

2500|$|Jeannine Etter of Youth Outlook stated [...] "Janet {{takes us}} from ballads to hard-core dance beats, and from sex to politics. The set changes {{appropriately}} reflect {{some of the}} stages of her musical development, from the more playful circus/funhouse vibe of light and playful songs like [...] "Escapade" [...] to the sexual side of Janet's music that keeps getting stronger and stronger as the years go by. During the performance, one lucky man is picked from the audience, strapped to a chair and [...] "tortured" [...] as Janet performs a highly erotic dance for him." [...] The excerpt concluded [...] "Janet is extremely beautiful, but she also demonstrates a humility obtained from pain, reflection {{and a sense of}} spirituality." [...] Christine Robertson of Evening Post, who reviewed Jackson's concert in Wellington, New Zealand, exclaimed [...] "The sleek choreography and superb dance spectacle saw Jackson seldom <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> from one set to the next—her control of the stage complete. Most of the time she plunged into two decades of hits which give her the right to stand her ground" [...] among her contemporaries.

50|$|One {{objection}} {{that can}} be offered against Van Inwagen’s view is the vagueness of the category {{of life and the}} ambiguity of when something gets “caught up” in a life. For example, if <b>a</b> cat <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> and inhales <b>a</b> carbon atom, it is unclear at what point that atom becomes officially incorporated into the cat’s body.|$|R
2500|$|Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff {{is shaped}} like a round ball, with pink skin, large blue or green eyes, catlike ears, and a tuft of fur on its forehead. Its skin is rubbery and stretchy. It can inflate its body like a balloon (usually when it becomes angry; this is {{accompanied}} by a distinctive [...] "honk" [...] sound), or flatten its body, much like fellow Nintendo character Kirby. An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air. Game Freak's staff have noted Jigglypuff as both one of their and the public's favorite Pokémon, in terms of both anime and video game appearances.|$|E
2500|$|One young {{admirer of}} the Basie {{orchestra}} in Kansas City was a teenage alto saxophone player named Charlie Parker. He was especially enthralled by their tenor saxophone player Lester Young, who played long flowing melodic lines that wove {{in and out}} of the chordal structure of the tune but somehow always made musical sense. [...] Young was equally daring with his rhythm and phrasing as with his approach to harmonic structures in his solos. [...] He would frequently repeat simple two or three note figures, with shifting rhythmic accents expressed by volume, articulation, or tone. [...] His phrasing was far removed from the two or four bar phrases that horn players had used until then. They would often be extended to an odd number of measures, overlapping the musical stanzas suggested by the harmonic structure. He would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> in the middle of a phrase, using the pause, or [...] "free space," [...] as a creative device. The overall effect was that his solos were something floating above the rest of the music, rather than something springing from it at intervals suggested by the ensemble sound. When the Basie orchestra burst onto the national scene with its 1937 recordings and nationally-broadcast New York engagements, it gained a national following, with legions of saxophone players striving to imitate Young, drummers striving to imitate Jo Jones, piano players striving to imitate Basie, and trumpet players striving to imitate Buck Clayton. Parker played along with the new Basie recordings on a Victrola until he could play Young's solos note for note..|$|E

We sat down and had a long talk over this matter, and then we agreed to make a regular, systematic search through the woods, {{so as to make}} sure at least that you had not been killed. But now we thought of the difficulty of getting out of the cave without your help. Peterkin became dreadfully nervous when he thought of this; and I must confess I felt some alarm, for, of course, I could not hope alone to take him out so quickly as we two together had brought him in. And he himself vowed that if we had been a moment longer with him that time, {{he would have had to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of salt water. However, there was no help for it, and I endeavoured to calm his fears as well as I could; `for,' said I, `you can't live here, Peterkin,' to which he replied, `Of course not, Jack; I can only die here, and as that's not at all desirable, you had better propose something.'

Adrienne had changed the world, and he was looking out upon it with different eyes. Sentiment, which before he had scoffed at a little, as became a sturdy young Briton but lately escaped from public school and college, had suddenly become for him something akin to a holy thing. He was almost a poet that night--he who had scarcely read a line of what the world calls poetry since his school days. There was a man whom he had hated all his life. Just then he began to think of him without a particle of anger or resentment. If he could have met him there, among those drooping, white-flowering shrubs, he felt that he could have shaken his hand, have asked him heartily after his health, and doubtless have fixed a day to dine with him. The world was a capital place, and Palermo was on the threshold of heaven. His big, boyish heart was full to over-flowing. Oh! it is a fine thing to be in love! ...|$|E
