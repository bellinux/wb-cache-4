Jason and Sam team up, {{and are able to}} rescue the baby from Heather. They're reunited with their son, whom they name Daniel Edward Morgan.

Sadly, the night <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> Jason is shot by Cesar Faison (Anders Hove), and presumed dead when his body isn't found. Sam later found out that Jason is Danny's biological father. Though Sam was initially in denial about Jason's death, she later accepted that Jason was never coming home.|$|E
25|$|Under these {{circumstances}} any political bargaining {{might well have}} been disastrous to Home Rule. Redmond desperately wanted and needed a rapid enactment of the Home Rule Act, and undoubtedly his words were a means to that end. He called on the country to support the Allied and British war effort and Britain's commitment under the Triple Entente; this was a calculated response to the situation principally in the belief that the attained measure of self-government would be granted in full after the war and to be in a stronger position to stave off a final partition of Northern Ireland. His added hope was that the common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together, but above all that nationalists could not afford to allow Ulster Unionists to reap the benefit of being the only Irish to support the war effort, when they spontaneously enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. He said Let Irishmen come together in the trenches and risk their lives together and spill their blood together, and I say there is no power on earth that when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> can induce them to turn as enemies upon one another.|$|E
