40|$|The {{synthesis}} of thromboplastin, a potent trigger of blood coagulation, can be induced in human peripheral blood monocytes. Indirect {{evidence suggests that}} newly synthesized thromboplastin becomes in part available on the cell surface. We have attempted to study the localization and availability of thromboplastin more directly by isolating plasma membranes from isolated human peripheral blood monocytes. The specific activities of the plasma membrane markers increased 16 - 22 -fold in these preparations with a recovery of about 15 %. The contamination by mitochondria, lysosomes, nuclei and endoplasmic reticulum was low as estimated by marker enzymes and electron microscopy. In both unstimulated and stimulated monocytes thromboplastin was largely recovered in this plasma membrane fraction, providing direct evidence for its membrane localization. Phospholipase C (E. C. 3. 1. 4. 3) is a potent inactivator of thromboplastin through its hydrolysis of the phospholipids necessary for <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>activity</b> [Otnaess, Prydz, Bj√∏rklid & Berre (1972) Eur.

40|$|Human monocytes {{synthesize}} {{the protein}} component of thromboplastin and express increased procoagulant activity when appropriately stimulated in vitro. The activity reached maximum between 2 and 20 h {{depending on the}} stimulant used. The presence of lymphocytes (lymphocyte: monocyte ratio 4 : 1) enhanced this activity only very slightly (up to 1. 3 -fold) {{at the time of}} maximal monocyte thromboplastin expression. Lymphocytes had a marked potentiating effect on PHA stimulation that became clearly evident after 12 h, at which time the thromboplastin response of monocytes alone to PHA had subsided. The <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>activity</b> of monocytes remained at a high level for 24 - 40 h in the presence of PHA or endotoxin and lymphocytes, but lymphocytes did not influence the early (4 - 8 h) thromboplastin response. Neither did lymphocytes alter the magnitude or the time course of the response when monocytes were stimulated with PPD, TPA or immune complexes. The lymphoblastoid cell line Molt 4 (T cell like) was as effective as lymphocytes, Daudi cells (B cell like) were slightly less effective. The enhancement of <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>activity</b> in PHA-stimulated monocytes could be induced also by conditioned medium from PHA stimulated lymphocytes. We conclude that freshly isolated monocytes synthesize thromboplastin directly upon interaction with a stimulant, and are not dependent on a helper effect of lymphocytes or lymphocyte products.

40|$|Summary We have {{analysed}} 15 infiltrating duct carcinomas of the breast, 10 gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, {{one each}} of the thyroid and larynx, and four mesenchymal tumours for the presence {{and the nature of}} procoagulant activity (PCA). The metastatic tumours had a significantly higher PCA (P = 0. 01 - 0. 001) as compared to the non-metastatic tumours in the respective groups, and almost 20 - 25 times the activity as comnpared to normal tissue (P = 0. 001). Although the majority of the tumours had FVII-dependent tissue thromboplastin-like activity, some of the tumour homogenates revealed the presence of an FVII-independent PCA. Unlike the known alternate PCA, which acts via factor X activation, this PCA was factor X independent. It caused clot formation in FX-deficient plasma (six cases) and purified fibrinogen solution (four cases), indicating the presence of a Xa-like enzyme or a thrombin-like activity respectively. As early as 1938, Sproule recognised the association between malignancy and alterations in haemostasis. Since then, {{it is well known that}} malignant disease is associated with a high incidence of vascular thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (Rickles & Edwards, 1983). Deposition of fibrin within and around the tumour has been convincingly demonstrated immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally (Rickles & Edwards, 1983) but its precise role in the growth and spread of the tumour is largely unknown. O'Meara (1958) first described the procoagulant activity of cancer cells.

40|$|Purified heparin, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate in {{mixtures}} were fractionated by sequential precipitation with increasing volumes of acetone and analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis and for M(r), charge density, constituent disaccharides, and anticoagulant activity (for heparin). Purified glycosaminoglycans are generally utilized for pharmaceutical purposes and show physicochemical properties of glycosaminoglycans used as drugs. Heparin {{is the first}} glycosaminoglycan to precipitate at low percentages of acetone. The relative amount of slow moving and fast moving components, the M(r) and charge density, and the disaccharide pattern of fractionated heparin depend on the percentage of solvent. The activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time <b>activity</b> of fractions composed of heparin decreases with the charge density and M(r). Dermatan sulfate is precipitated by acetone over a narrow range (0. 6 - 0. 7 vol, 37 - 41 %), and one of these fractions is constituted by 100 % of this polysaccharide. These species of dermatan sulfate have different percentages of constituent disaccharides compared to the native polysaccharide. Nonsulfated disaccharide and disaccharide- 6 -sulfate are enriched. The dermatan sulfate species precipitated by acetone are also enriched in disaccharide- 4, 6 -disulfated. Chondroitin sulfate is the most soluble glycosaminoglycan in mixed acetone/ water solvent. It begins to precipitate at 0. 8 vol (44 %) of acetone. Different species of chondroitin sulfate can be recovered by precipitation at different percentages of solvent, and they show a decrease in M(r) and charge density depending on the percentage of acetone. The chondroitin sulfate species fractionated are also enriched in disulfated disaccharides compared to native polysaccharide. A different distribution of the three disulfated disaccharides can be {{pointed out in the}} fractionated chondroitin sulfate.

Cases were included if the attending clinician requested coagulation testing. Blood was obtained from each dog and coagulation (prothrombin time, partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, antithrombin <b>activity,</b> d-dimer concentration, and fibrinogen concentration) and TEG analyses were performed. Hematocrit (Hct) was also measured. Traditional coagulation results were evaluated for correlation with those from kaolin-activated TEG. Spearman‚Äôs correlation was used to calculate correlation coefficients. Fibrinogen was positively correlated with maximum amplitude (Pearson r= 0. 72, P< 0. 001) and global clot strength (Pearson r= 0. 72, P< 0. 001). There was no correlation between any of the remaining coagulation variables, TEG parameters, or Hct.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{analyzing}} the effects of lipoproteins on functions of lymphoid cells, {{it was observed that}} physiological concentrations of isolated human plasma lipoproteins possess varying capacities to rapidly enhance the expression of procoagulant activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. In a strict dose-dependent fashion, very low density lipoprotein, intermediate density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein enhanced both the surface expression by viable cells and the total cellular content of procoagulant activity during a 6 -h incubation. Very low density lipoprotein induced a maximal 6. 7 -fold increase in the expression of a <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>activity,</b> which was consistent with tissue factor, in that it was dependent on Factors VII, X, and II. Both intermediate density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein induced approximately a 12 -fold increase of a different procoagulant activity which appears to be a direct prothrombin activator. This prothrombinase was calcium dependent and was inhibited by 2. 5 mM diisopropylfluorophosphate, but was not neutralized by anti-Factor X antibodies or by inhibitors of Factor Xa. In contrast to the other lipoprotein density classes, low density lipoprotein did not stimulate procoagulant activity, but instead actively suppressed the generation of the two procoagulant activities induced by the stimulatory lipoproteins. Suppression by low density lipoprotein was clearly evident at molar ratios of low density lipoprotein to stimulatory lipoproteins of 1 : 3 or less. Reconstitution of all lipoproteins to physiological concentrations was not stimulatory {{as a consequence of the}} suppressive effects of low density lipoprotein. These data indicate that isolated plasma lipoproteins are capable of regulating the expression of two different procoagulant activities of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro.

40|$|As {{noted in}} {{previous}} studies, epiphysis {{is one of}} the important factors in the neurohormonal regulation of blood hemostatic potential. Steroid hormones are produced in the gonads, regulate the process of sexual differentiation and sexual reproduction invertebrates and humans. In turn, these processes are regulated by the pituitary gonadotropins. After the effects of different doses of progesterone and testosterone on coagulation observed its acceleration, i. e. hypercoagulation. This work is part of the research on the influence of the epiphysis on coagulation in different experimental conditions. Coagulation has long attracted our attention due to the influence on the process of the epiphysis. Epiphysis receives information about the external light through the organ of sight, participates in the mechanism of the biological clock. During the daytime, the synthesis of serotonin dominated in the epiphysis, but at night due to acetylation of serotonin, melatonin is produced. In the study of the epiphysis at different ages, it was found that with the onset of sexual maturation in the epiphysis occurs atrophy and calcification, i. e. epiphysis is rudimentary and does not have a vital function. In connection with this postulate, we decided to investigate the effect of progesterone and testosterone on thermocoagulation. Progesterone is a female steroid sex hormone that is produced by the corpus luteum of the ovary, placenta, small amounts of the adrenal cortex and testes. Progesterone {{plays an important role in}} sexual cycle, ensures the normal development of the pregnancy. The synthesis and secretion of progesterone-regulated by luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin. Testosterone is a male steroid hormone produced by the testes, adrenal glands, ovaries, placenta, and liver. Testosterone has secreted actively in the prenatal period, defining the sexual differentiation of the reproductive organs and the whole body. The synthesis and secretion of testosterone regulated by luteinizing and follicle stimulating hormone. Testosterone secretion is subject to seasonal and age changes. Sex hormones not only affect reproductive function, but also other systems. In this regard, we were interested in how these hormones affect blood clotting factors in intact and hypophysectomized animals. Epiphysis causes an acceleration of blood clotting factors. Progesterone and testosterone cause the acceleration of blood clotting in hypophysectomized animals The action of the progesterone and testosterone blood coagulation depends on the dose of its application. Small doses of progesterone accelerate the process of blood clotting, and small doses of testosterone, on the contrary, slows it. In hypophysectomized animals 30 minutes after applying of progesterone and testosterone <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>activity</b> of blood increases sharply.

Methods Thirty-four LV patients were tested for prothrombin time, activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, antithrombin <b>activity,</b> protein C and S activity, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, prothrombin gene mutation, factor V Leiden mutation, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation, plasma homocysteine and fibrinogen. Thirteen of these patients were treated with anticoagulant drugs (either warfarin or heparin). Results Of 34 patients, 18 (52 %) presented laboratory abnormalities of procoagulant conditions. Positive treatment response to anticoagulant therapy was observed in 11 patients. Improvement of pain was obtained in 1 - 3 weeks, an average of 1. 8 week. Complete healing of the lesions was observed in about 2. 3 months. Remission was sustained even after treatment interruption and lasted an average 7. 8 months. No severe adverse effects were noticed.

Normal FVII activity is obtained using human placenta <b>thromboplastin</b> but low <b>activity</b> using rabbit or bovine brain thromboplastin. Exons 2 - 8 and the intron-exon junctions of the FVII genes of the propositus were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from peripheral white blood cells, and screened by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. DNA fragments showing aberrant mobility were cloned and sequenced. We detected a single-point mutation, a homozygous G to A transition at nucleotide position 6, 055 in exon 4, {{which results in}} the substitution of Arg 79 by Gln in the first EGF-like domain. This mutation results {{in a loss of}} a site for the restriction endonuclease MspI. The Msp I digestion pattern of the PCR-amplified exon 3 + 4 fragments from each member of the family was determined. The Msp I haplotypes were consistent with this G to A transition being associated with reduced FVII activity as detected using thromboplastins from various species. We conclude that the Arg 79 to Gln substitution in the first EGF-like domain of FVII identified in the propositus is responsible for the inherited FVII abnormality in this Japanese family.

In subjects undergoing a liver biopsy and entirely lacking the I 148 M variant, insulin-resistant subjects had higher hepatic expression of F 8, F 9 and FGG than equally obese insulin-sensitive subjects. Expression of pro-inflammatory genes in adipose tissue correlated positively with PT (% of normal), circulating FVIII, FIX, FXI, VWR:RCo and fibrinogen, and expression of anti-inflammatory genes negatively with PT (%), FIX and fibrinogen.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{progression}} of plasma D-dimer concentrations and coagulation status in horses with different types of colic. DESIGN: Prospective clinical observational study performed between March 2004 and September 2008. SETTING: Veterinary university teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Horses admitted and treated for colic and hospitalized for > 48 hours were considered. Animals were classified by diagnosis into medical obstructive conditions (MO), surgical obstructive conditions (SO), inflammatory conditions, and ischemic lesions (IS). INTERVENTIONS: Three blood samples were obtained from each horse (admission, at 24 - 48 h [or after surgery] and upon discharge). For each sample, plasma D-dimer concentration, prothrombin time, activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, antithrombin <b>activity,</b> {{and the presence of}} subclinical disseminated intravascular coagulation were determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: When median plasma D-dimer concentration values at admission and after 24 - 48 hours were compared, they were different but stable in horses with MO (1. 29 - 1. 95 nmol/L) and inflammatory conditions (5. 70 - 6. 69 nmol/L). However, 10 -fold and 5 -fold increases were observed, respectively, in SO (2. 08 to 16. 38 nmol/L) and IS (3. 08 to 15. 91 nmol/L) in the postoperative period. By 24 - 48 hours, the percentage of horses with coagulopathy increased in most groups (MO, 43 to 58 %; SO, 50 to 96 %, IS, 53 to 90 %). By the time of discharge, 87 % of horses with SO problems and 89 % of horses with IS still had some form of coagulopathy documented. CONCLUSIONS: Throughout hospitalization, horses with MO problems had less severe coagulopathy and lower plasmatic D-dimer concentrations compared to other groups of horses. On admission, most horses with inflammatory conditions presented with coagulopathy. At 24 - 48 hours of hospitalization and following surgery, the hemostatic profile can differ markedly when compared to admission values. Peer reviewe...|$|R
