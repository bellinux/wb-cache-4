50|$|<b>The</b> centre adds <b>to</b> <b>state</b> {{resources}} by conferring fixed percentage of revenue from taxation {{and from other}} sources <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states.</b> However, this does not ensure a proper balance in distribution. There are states which are poorer or more backward than the others and therefore require central finances on a much larger scale than the others. This is why recommendations for special grants were introduced. Hence in this manner, the extra resources controlled by the centre were shared with <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> finance <b>the</b> <b>state</b> plans. However, this system in turn induced <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> undertake those schemes in which they got a higher share of the central finances and therefore a steady central assistance was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> for a planned period. The grants {{were supposed to be}} given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> which did not have enough capital assets that would have earned them enough money to pay for loans taken from the centre.
