His final public concerts were held in Fukuoka Dome in Japan on December 19–20, 1994. The {{following}} year, Sinatra sang for the very last time on February 25, 1995, before a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom, on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament. Esquire reported of the show that Sinatra was [...] "clear, tough, on the money" [...] and [...] "in absolute control".

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} began recording the final 30 minutes of Flight93 at 09:31:57. At this moment, it recorded Jarrah announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen: here the captain. Please sit down, keep remaining seating. We have a bomb on board. So sit." [...] The controller understood the transmission, but chose to respond, [...] "Calling Cleveland center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." [...] The cockpit recording captured Dahl moaning and Jarrah telling him in English {{to sit down and}} to stop touching something (presumably the controls); Jason Dahl's wife, Sandy Dahl, listening to the cockpit {{voice recorder}}, determined that Jarrah [...] "was fussing at my husband...he was speaking in English, and he spoke Arabic anytime he was talking with the other hijackers. Jason made moaning sounds after that. It sounded like he was trying <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with</b> stuff or get up, because the hijacker pilot kept telling him to stop and to sit down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Black Widow" [...] {{is a song}} {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and 29 seconds and {{has been described as}} a song that [...] "channels more trap music with its beat". The song combines a sparse snap and heavy trap beat with a refrain that follows a slow-building, clapping chorus formula which peaks but deliberately never capitalizes. Instrumentally, [...] "Black Widow" [...] is composed of an ominous steel drum rhythm, and heavy bass, while its dance breakdown is employed with minimalism. Azalea solicits the track's verses with a snarling, bitter technique, consisting of rhyming employed with a spitting delivery. While Ora uses a seething element to sing the track's hook, [...] "I'm gonna love ya, until you hate me / And I'm gonna show ya, what's really crazy / You should've known better, than <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with</b> me harder / I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you / Gonna love you, gonna love you / Like a black widow baby". Combined, Ora and Azalea's vocals are based on a call and response structure throughout the song.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, ranging from largely positive to negative. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A–, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot", citing the [...] "lush, smoky gaming sequences" [...] in particular. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Hell Money" [...] the eleventh most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show noting, [...] "If there’s one thing you don’t want <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with,</b> it’s the Chinese mafia. Especially the branch that dresses up like Slipknot and either a) burns you alive, if you’re lucky, or b) forces you {{to participate in a}} haunted organ-harvesting raffle only to slowly carve you up and sell your vital organs on the black market, {{whether you like it or}} not." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it a [...] "hard episode to love [...] sincere and purposeful". The two praised the conceit of the episode, arguing that by presenting the situation from the Chinese immigrants—members of an alien culture—and Chao's point of view, [...] "Mulder and Scully seem clumsy and arrogant. And by implication, the audience are made to feel just as arrogant." ...|$|E

5000|$|Variety panned the film, {{calling it}} [...] "an overly ambitious slice of Grand Guignol that is none too grand in {{conception}} or execution", and writing, [...] "it could do small biz on the midnight circuit, although auds {{would have to}} be told whether laughing or cringing would be most appropriate." [...] JoBlo.com was more positive, writing that [...] "the film went a little too nutty when it came <b>to</b> <b>messing</b> <b>with</b> me and only repeat viewings will tell if the madness can actually make solid sense or if the screenwriter was hitting the “Bear Bong” too hard while writing the script, but having said that, get in a silly mood, kick the leeches out of your pad and enjoy the buzz." ...|$|R
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website stated that Eve was the [...] "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" [...] who was enjoying a successful career; [...] she {{was described as}} an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected {{to go along with}} it without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with</b> them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as if somebody came and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E
500|$|Her {{involvement}} with Billy Abbott is another significant romance for Chloe, {{and the characters}} marry shortly after Delia is born. However, the marriage ended, {{paving the way for}} a reunion between Billy and his high school sweetheart, Mac Browning (Clementine Ford). In response {{to whether or not the}} Chloe and Billy pairing should be revisited, Hendrickson stated, [...] "You know what, I really hope so. I’ve definitely asked for it." [...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because she has a very rocky background, but through and through she has just been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program. Of Chloe's [...] "heartbroken" [...] reaction to his [...] "death" [...] in spite of the bitter break-up, Hendrickson said, [...] "to open up and show what was going on with her was a great release for me, because that entire time she was remaining strong and stable, and like no one is going <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with</b> her. I mean, no one dumps Chloe Mitchell!" ...|$|E
500|$|Tim McCanlies {{was hired}} to write the script, though Bird was {{somewhat}} displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies {{decided to have a}} brief scene displaying his survival, stating, [...] "You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back." [...] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. [...] "didn't have time <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with</b> us" [...] as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as [...] "paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling." [...] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, [...] "I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He’s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he’s developed The Iron Giant. I can’t stop thinking about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Wales of IGN {{rated the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.9 out of 10, stating {{that despite the}} episode's premise, it came [...] "perilously close to greatness," [...] and praised Raynor's [...] "crackling script which graciously walked the tightrope between balls-out farce and affectionate sci-fi pastiche". Wales noted that Tennant and Tate [...] "relished" [...] the {{perpetual}} swings from [...] "square-jawed serious" [...] to [...] "faintly sadistic subversion", <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with</b> audience expectations. Ryan's performance as Staal was again praised, but Wales felt Agyeman still displayed [...] "the charisma and range of a dead fish, despite Martha's transformation from lovesick sap to Ripley-esque super soldier." [...] Wales summed up that the episode [...] "did pretty much everything a two-part opener should – swiftly shifting the pieces into place for next week's inevitably bombastic showdown." [...] Alan Stanley Bear of Airlock Alpha called [...] "The Sontaran Strategem" [...] an [...] "exciting and nostalgic adventure", {{and said that the}} episode lives up to the show's reputation for transforming a normal object, in this case the car, to a [...] "global killer". Bear praised the episode for Donna and Martha's introduction being opposite to Rose Tyler and Sarah Jane Smith's in [...] "School Reunion", for providing a human element in the subplot where Donna visits her grandfather, and for the episode's cliffhanger. However, Bear wrote that it took too long to [...] "get to the point", and criticized the [...] "bland Sontaran dialogue and the cliched simplicity of mind control", which he felt [...] "reduced {{what could have been a}} fantastically intricate story piece into Saturday morning cartoon material." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hannah Banana" [...] {{was written}} by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and {{directed}} by John Holmquist, before {{the conclusion of the}} eighth production season. Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's only so many times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think often times there's a fear <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with</b> what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes." [...] Marie described Beth as a girl that is [...] "rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can." [...] The song in the episode sung by Cyrus {{was written by}} Chevapravatdumrong, and composed and performed by Family Guy composer Walter Murphy.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing all the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at {{how easy it is}} to convince yourself you know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>with</b> our minds, than it would be to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty of room to send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E
