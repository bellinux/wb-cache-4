5|$|Max Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable bullet time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine {{what they want to}} do. In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone to act as a visual cue. When in use, the bullet <b>time</b> <b>meter</b> will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables bullet time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the bullet time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete the bullet <b>time</b> <b>meter.</b> The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{a number}} of unstudied aspects of retail {{electricity}} competition. We first explore the implications of load profiling of consumers whose traditional meters do not allow for measurement of their real time consumption, when consumers are homogeneous up to a scaling factor. In general, the combination of retail competition and load profiling does not yield the second best prices given the non price responsiveness of consumers. Specifically, the competitive equilibrium {{does not support the}} Ramsey two-part tari#. By contrast, when consumers have real <b>time</b> <b>meters</b> and are billed based on real time prices and consumption, retail competition yields the Ramsey prices even when consumers can only partially respond to variations in real time prices. More complex consumer heterogeneity does not lead to adverse se 1 ection and competitive screening behavior unless consumers have real <b>time</b> <b>meters</b> and are not rational. We then examine the incentives competitive retailers have to install one of two types of advanced metering equipment. Competing retailers overinvest in real <b>time</b> <b>meters</b> compared to the Ramsey optimum, but the investment incentives are constrained optimal given load-profiling and retail competition. Finally, we consider the e#ects of physical limitations on the ability of system operators to cut o# individual customers. Competing retailers have no incentive to determine the aggregate value of non-interruption of consumers in the zones they serve, preferring instead to free ride on other retailers serving consumers in the same zones...|$|R

For a bar magnet, {{the direction of the}} {{magnetic moment}} points from the magnet's south pole to its north pole, and the magnitude relates to how strong and how far apart these poles are.

Unlike other music games, the player's actions are not dictated by a set rhythm displayed onscreen, but rather the player plays as he sees fit. Additionally, Drumscape lacks a scoring system to indicate success or failure of a player. As the player drums, stage lights and crowd cheers are triggered to create a more realistic experience.|$|E

Defeating enemies in these games earns money {{that can be used to}} purchase new weapons, armor, and items to make the player stronger. Many of these games have a Metroidvania approach to gameplay, in which obtaining new items or abilities can grant access to new areas in the game.|$|E

Kurosawa constantly sent Takemitsu notes, which only served to infuriate him, so he frequently visited the set to gain a direct sensual experience.

50|$|Rhythm is the {{arrangement}} of sounds and silences in <b>time.</b> <b>Meter</b> animates time in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars, which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as Waltz time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place {{an emphasis on the}} first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the backbeat used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or common time) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the snare drum, a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the rhythm section, which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as jazz and bluegrass, double bass) and a drum kit player.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} is presented {{that allows a}} Vector Network Analyzer to be operated as a Large Signal Network Analyzer {{without the need for}} a harmonic phase reference generator. The mode of operation exploits the architecture of a Rohde and Schwarz ZVA- 67, which incorporates internal signal and local oscillator sources based on direct digital synthesis [1]. This unique capability leads to a Vector Network Analyzer based Large Signal Network Analyzer configuration that provides for time coherent receivers. This feature combined with a modified calibration procedure, allows the instrument, to provide error corrected RF current and voltage waveform measurements, requiring only the internal signal sources and an external phase (<b>time)</b> <b>meter</b> [2 - 5].
