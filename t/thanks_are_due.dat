60|$|In {{correcting}} the proofs for the press, I {{have had the}} advantage of the skill and knowledge of my friend Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey, to whom my <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due.</b>|$|E
60|$|My special <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to Mr. Gordon Wordsworth, who has, in {{the kindest}} manner {{and for many}} years, placed {{everything}} at my disposal, which could further my labour on his grandfather's Works.|$|E
60|$|They were {{approaching}} the peopled {{part of the}} mole. Quickly, but eloquently, Blood expressed his thanks, where he knew that no <b>thanks</b> <b>were</b> <b>due.</b>|$|R
40|$|After Professor Pityana had {{prepared}} this statement, it transpired that Professor Mathabe {{was not well}} and would not attend Senate. The Principal requested Professor David Mosoma, the Deputy Vice Chancellor, to take the chair, and I am sure the same sincere word of <b>thanks</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to him – Dawid van Wyk (presenter of the statement) ...|$|R
6000|$|An ass munched thistles, while a {{nightingale}} From passion's fountain flooded all the vale. 'Hee-haw!' cried he, 'I hearken,' as {{who knew}} For such ear-largess humble <b>thanks</b> <b>were</b> <b>due.</b> 'Friend,' said the wingèd pain, 'in vain you bray, Who tunnels bring, not cisterns, for my lay; None but his peers the poet rightly hear, Nor mete we listeners by their length of ear.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to the Editors of the Morning Post, the Westminster Gazette, and the Bystander {{for their}} amiability in {{allowing}} tales {{that appeared in}} these journals to be reproduced in the present volume.|$|E
60|$|My <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due,</b> and {{are given}} heartily, to {{the editors of}} The Youth's Companion for {{permission}} to use several sketches that have already appeared, and to Mr. Charles Copeland, the artist, for his care and interest in preparing the illustrations.|$|E
60|$|Personally, my <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to my friend, Mr. York Powell, {{for much}} {{valuable}} aid and assistance, {{and to the}} Rev. E. McClure, one of the Society's secretaries, for his kind revision of the volume in proof, and for several suggestions of which I have gladly availed myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> really <b>due</b> to {{somebody}} else. The head contractor {{is not allowed}} to sub-let work without our approval, and although I recommended your being given a chance, the decision rested with another man." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{thought was}} to {{do no more than}} belittle the service he had {{rendered}} her, to stem her flow of gratitude, since, indeed, he felt, as he said, that it was to the Queen-Regent her <b>thanks</b> <b>were</b> <b>due.</b> All unwitting <b>was</b> it--out of his ignorance of the ways of thought of a sex with which he held the view that it is an ill thing to meddle--that he wounded her by his disclaimer, in which her sensitive maiden fancy imagined a something that was almost contemptuous.|$|R
40|$|We wish to {{acknowledge}} the financial support of METRANS. Special <b>thanks</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to Charles Abbott, an undergraduate economics major at CSULB (now an alumnus), who worked on all aspects of data collection for this project.

We had, however, one common interest--to get here in time to save the station and, above all, to catch and break up this gang of scoundrels.|$|E
60|$|My <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to the Editors of the Outlook and the Speaker for {{the kind}} {{permission}} they have given me to reprint {{a considerable number of}} the following poems. They have been selected and arranged rather with a view to unity of spirit than to unity of time or value; many of them being juvenile.|$|E
60|$|He did not die, however. In {{about another}} week {{he was well}} enough to move. We carried him down to Mozufferpoor, the first large town in the plains thereabouts, and handed him over for the stage of {{convalescence}} {{to the care of}} the able and efficient station doctor, to whom my <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> for much courteous assistance.|$|E

40|$|In the {{completion}} of this thesis, I find myself thankful {{to a number of}} people, without whom I would {{have never been able to}} be so successful. First and foremost, I must extend my thanks to my advisor, Professor Giulio Gallarotti. Without his positive attitude, guidance and encouragement, this project would be much less meaningful than it feels now. I owe you a few swimming lessons. Next, a <b>thanks</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to Professor Barry Chernoff, Professor Michael Dorsey, and Valerie Marinelli in the College of the Environment, whom supported my efforts to pursue my passion by offering me a position to furthe...|$|R
40|$|I wish {{to extend}} sincere {{appreciation}} to my major Adviser, Dr. Phil Kenkel, for his supervision acumen, intuitive guidance, inspiration and good personal relations.

The guns of the battery which has annoyed us are all spiked, and their {{magazine}} blown up, {{and all this}} without {{the loss of a}} man, thanks to the Warreners, who went out alone and disabled all the guns, by wetting the primings. All your <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> at all, Captain Barclay," [...] the old veteran said. [...] "You have well earned your promotion; and Gambetta--who {{speaks of}} you, I may say, {{in the highest}} terms--tells me that he promised you the step, if you got in. I need not say that, whether he had done so or not, I should have given it to you.|$|E
60|$|Sincere <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> from {{me for the}} {{attention}} you paid to Mrs. W.'s letter, written during my absence. You know the favourable opinion I entertain of Mr. Graves; and I was under a promise to let him know, if any vacancy occurred in the neighbourhood, and to do all I could, without infringing upon prior or stronger claims, to promote the attainment of his wishes.|$|E
40|$|Natal. The views {{expressed}} in this report are {{the responsibility of the}} author alone. The author is deeply indebted to the competent and enthusiastic group of interviewers 3 as well as the Port Elizabeth newspapers for their responsible coverage of the survey on which this study is based: both factors contributed greatly to harmonious and expeditious field work. A special measure of <b>thanks</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to Messrs. International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) for their computerised tabulations of the raw data completely free of charge. In particular 3 the writer wishes to thank most sincerely his friend and colleague 3 Professor Hilstan L. Watts 3 former Director o...|$|R
6000|$|And afterwards, from Spider, and Pat, and Clam, and Johnny Heinhold, and others, {{came the}} tips that Old Scratch liked me and {{had nothing but}} good words for the fine lad I was. Which was the more remarkable, because {{he was known as}} a savage, cantankerous old cuss who never liked anybody. (His very nickname, [...] "Scratch," [...] arose from a Berserker trick of his, in fighting, of tearing off his opponent's face.) And that I had won his friendship, all <b>thanks</b> <b>were</b> <b>due</b> to John Barleycorn. I have given the {{incident}} merely {{as an example of the}} multitudinous lures and draws and services by which John Barleycorn wins his followers.|$|R
40|$|We {{acknowledge}} the County Administrative Board of Östergötland for financially supporting {{the development of}} the POPCYCLING-Bråviken model which is described in this document.

60|$|Of the {{specimens}} here {{selected for}} exhibition, my title piece originally {{appeared in the}} Fortnightly Review: 'Honey Dew' and 'The First Potter' were contributions to Longman's Magazine: {{and all the rest}} found friendly shelter between the familiar yellow covers of the good old Cornhill. My <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to the proprietors and editors of those various periodicals for kind permission to reproduce them here.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{the tales}} themselves, taken individually, I {{have only to}} say, by way of {{necessary}} explanation, that [...] "The Lady of Glenwith Grange" [...] is now offered to the reader for the first time; and that the other stories {{have appeared in the}} columns of Household Words. My best <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to Mr. Charles Dickens for his kindness in allowing me to set them in their present frame-work.|$|E
60|$|My <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to Professor John B. Watson and to Dr. T. P. Nunn {{for reading}} my MSS. {{at an early}} stage and helping me with many {{valuable}} suggestions; also to Mr. A. Wohlgemuth for much very useful information as regards important literature. I have also to acknowledge the help of the editor of this Library of Philosophy, Professor Muirhead, for several suggestions by which I have profited.|$|E
60|$|No <b>thanks</b> <b>were</b> <b>due</b> to {{the weather}} for the renewed spirits of the men. It rained almost unceasingly. The flat ground on which the troops were encamped was a sea of mud. There was one good effect in this: there was water in all the spruits, and the men were able to indulge in a wash-up of their clothes and an {{occasional}} bath; and although they had to put their clothes on wet, they were scarcely more damp than when they took them off. There was other work to be done. Two naval guns, a mountain battery, and some large cannon were with great labour got up {{on the top of}} Swartz Kop.|$|R
40|$|We thank {{management}} at BSC for their cooperation and support, Valerie Folkes and Youjae Yi for some useful discussions, and Ronald Rust and Eugene Anderson for insightful {{comments on an}} earlier version of the manuscript.

60|$|The editor again {{takes the}} {{opportunity}} to thank Colonel F. Grant for the service he has rendered him in placing at his disposal his fine collection of Swift's tracts. The portrait which forms the frontispiece to this volume {{is one of those}} painted by Francis Bindon, and was formerly in the possession of Judge Berwick. For permission to photograph and reproduce it here, <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> to Sir Frederick R. Falkiner, Recorder of Dublin.|$|E
60|$|To my {{distinguished}} countryman, David Wilkie, to Edwin Landseer, who has exercised {{his talents}} {{so much on}} Scottish subjects and scenery, to Messrs. Leslie and Newton, my <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due,</b> from a friend {{as well as an}} author. Nor am I less obliged to Messrs. Cooper, Kidd, and other artists of distinction to whom I am less personally known, for the ready zeal with which they have devoted their talents to the same purpose.|$|E
60|$|The first {{portion of}} this essay is given {{at the end of}} the volume {{containing}} Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Prose Pieces. Recently the remainder of the original manuscript has been discovered, and is here published for the first time. It was written for the Chancellor's English Essay Prize at Oxford in 1879, the subject being 'Historical Criticism among the Ancients.' The prize was not awarded. To Professor J. W. Mackail <b>thanks</b> <b>are</b> <b>due</b> for revising the proofs.|$|E

The author is also thankful to Victoria University of Technology for the financial support provided over the period in which this work was carried out. More personally, the author owe most to his parents, wife Amba and sister Mousumi for their constant support and encouragement, without which this work might never have culminated in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Juliet D’Souza, Scott Linn and John Pointon for their helpful discussion.
