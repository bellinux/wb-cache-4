25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the Lightning was {{designed}} to meet the RAF's OR946 specification for tactical air navigation technology, and thus featured an integrated flight instrument display arrangement, an Elliott Bros (London) Ltd auto-pilot, a master reference gyroscopic reader, an auto-attack system, and an instrument landing system. Despite initial scepticism of the aircraft's centralised detection and warning system, the system proved its merits during the development program and was subsequently redeveloped for greater reliability. Communications included UHF and VHF radios and a datalink. Unlike the previous generation of aircraft which used gaseous oxygen for lifesupport, the Lightning would employ liquid oxygen-based apparatus for the pilot; cockpit pressurisation and conditioning would be maintained through <b>tappings</b> from the engine compressors.|$|E
25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a plug bridge, which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced <b>tappings</b> or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90°.|$|E
2500|$|The C64 used an {{external}} power supply, a conventional transformer with multiple <b>tappings</b> (as opposed to switch mode, the type now used on PC power supplies), encased in an epoxy resin gel which discouraged tampering but tended {{to increase the}} heat level during use. The design saved space within the computer's case and allowed international versions to be more easily manufactured. The 1541-II and 1581 disk drives, along with various third-party clones, also come with their own external power supply [...] "bricks", as did most peripherals leading to a [...] "spaghetti" [...] of cables {{and the use of}} numerous double adapters by users.|$|E

500|$|Magnus and <b>Tapping's</b> {{portrayal}} of the character received generally mixed reactions from critics, with the negative comments pointing toward's <b>Tapping's</b> accent.

60|$|And yet all was not {{silence in}} solitary. Early in my {{confinement}} I used to hear, at irregular intervals, faint, low <b>tappings.</b> From farther away I also heard fainter and lower <b>tappings.</b> Continually these <b>tappings</b> were {{interrupted by the}} snarling of the guard. On occasion, when the tapping went on too persistently, extra guards were summoned, and I knew by the sounds that men were being strait-jacketed.|$|E

500|$|Magnus's English {{accent was}} not well {{received}} by some critics. She was listed ninth in io9's [...] "Worst Fake Accents From The Yanks (And Canucks) Of Science Fiction", with Meredith Woerner stating [...] "I really want to like this new Sci Fi Channel show, especially since the monsters look amazing – but I'm worried <b>Tapping's</b> dreadful accent will get in the way. It sounds completely forced in all the clips I've seen so far, but I'll guess I'll {{have to wait until}} October 3 to make my full assessment." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wondered why Tapping decided to speak with an [...] "iffy accent," [...] but added she would be of interest by fans of <b>Tapping's</b> previous works, notably Stargate. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called <b>Tapping's</b> English accent [...] "unremarkable", whilst calling the show an [...] "unremarkable series." ...|$|R

500|$|Martin Wood {{directed}} [...] "Small Victories" [...] {{and made}} a short cameo appearance with Sergeant Siler (stunt coordinator Dan Shea) in an SGC corridor. Andy Mikita served as the second unit director and filmed {{the coverage of the}} practical Thor puppet after Amanda <b>Tapping's</b> coverage had been shot. Michael Shanks, who provided the voice of Thor in post-production ADR, read some of Thor's lines for Tapping on-set. The top lip of the Thor puppet, which was visibly broken during the filming, proved a challenge. One anecdotal blooper moment that Amanda Tapping often tells at conventions and which producer Joseph Mallozzi named one of his favorites in {{the first five years of}} Stargate SG-1, is that of the puppeteers raising Thor's hand to touch <b>Tapping's</b> behind during filming. Tapping instinctively slapped the expensive prop, then she kneeled down and apologized to the puppet in all seriousness before realizing the silliness of her reaction.|$|R
500|$|Paul Simpson of Total Sci-Fi {{rated the}} season 7 out of 10, and {{summed it up}} as [...] "although {{frequently}} predictable, Sanctuary usually provides an entertaining hour."

Moreover, Deputy hated Jasper, and if he saw Jasper carrying the body of a man, on the night when a man disappeared, he was clever enough to lead Durdles to examine the vault, AT ONCE. Deputy had a great dislike of the Law and its officers, but here was a chance for him to distinguish himself, and conciliate them.|$|E

2500|$|Amanda Tapping {{was part}} of the Stargate SG-1 main cast for all of the show's ten seasons. She did not appear in season 6's [...] "Disclosure" [...] or season 7's [...] "Inauguration" [...] except in clips from {{previous}} episodes and was completely absent from season 8's [...] "Prometheus Unbound" [...] and the season nine episodes [...] "Avalon (Part 2)", [...] "Origin", [...] "The Ties That Bind" [...] and [...] "The Powers That Be" [...] due to <b>Tapping's</b> maternity leave (she appeared briefly in [...] "Avalon (Part 1)" [...] to explain her absence); and season ten's [...] "Bad Guys".|$|R
50|$|Filming of the episode, and {{the season}} itself, began on February 18, 2008 at The Bridge Studios in Vancouver. The regular cast of Joe Flanigan (Lt. Col.

Picardo's {{character}} Woolsey replaces Col.

[...] "Right here the old doctor lost his nerve, up to this time he was a fairly acute observer. His next entry is evidently some weeks or, possibly, months later. He says: 'Slowly we have learned to understand the phenomena, but we cannot control them, and the child is still cruelly embarrassed by intrusive <b>tappings</b> and cracklings as she visits her friends or as she sits in her seat in school. She has become afraid to sleep alone, and calls piteously for a light whenever the noises begin.'" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thoroughly}} {{agreed with}} Patterson {{in what he}} said. It happened, however, that very shortly afterwards the epidemic of influenza broke out, {{and we were all}} worked to death. One morning I met Patterson on my round, and found him looking rather pale and fagged out. He made the same remark about me. I was in fact feeling far from well, and I lay upon the sofa all afternoon with a splitting headache and pains in every joint. As evening closed in I could no longer disguise the fact that the scourge was upon me, and I felt that I should have medical advice without delay. It was of Patterson naturally that I thought, but somehow the idea of him had suddenly become repugnant to me. I thought of his cold, critical attitude, of his endless questions, of his tests and his <b>tappings.</b> I wanted something more soothing--something more genial.|$|E
60|$|During the {{interval}} of {{preparation for this}} venture, since his wife and furniture's uncompromising disappearance into space, he had read and learnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his position, of the worthies who had spent their youth within these reverend walls, and whose souls had haunted them in their maturer age. Some of them, by the accidents of his reading, loomed out in his fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest. The brushings of the wind against the angles, buttresses, and door-jambs were as the passing of these only other inhabitants, the <b>tappings</b> of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their mournful souls, the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement, making him comrades in his solitude.

60|$|Jack lay wide awake, {{with hot}} cheeks, and {{throbbing}} head, {{and all sorts}} of queer sensations in the broken leg. The soothing potion he had taken did not affect him yet, and he tried to beguile the weary time by wondering who came and went below. Gentle rings at the front door, and mysterious <b>tappings</b> at the back, had been going on all the evening; for the report of the accident had grown astonishingly in its travels, and at eight o'clock the general belief was that Jack had broken both legs, fractured his skull, and lay at the point of death, while Jill had dislocated one shoulder, and was bruised black and blue from top to toe.

60|$|We {{lapsed into}} silence again, {{listening}} to the dull confusion of noises like the muffled sounds of a street or factory that filled our ears.

It was a series of relatively very little definite sounds, <b>tappings</b> and rubbings, like a loose spray of ivy against a window or a bird moving about upon a box. We listened and peered about us, but the darkness was a velvet pall. There followed a noise like the subtle movement of the wards of a well-oiled lock. And then there appeared before me, hanging as it seemed in an immensity of black, a thin bright line.|$|E
6000|$|And {{then she}} pointed out to him clearly {{how it could be}} {{improved}} by introducing a messenger instead of a telephone call, and cutting the dialogue just before the climax while they were struggling with the pistol, and by completely changing the lines and business of Helen Grimes at the point where her jealousy overcomes her. Hart yielded to all her strictures without argument. She had at once put her finger on the sketch's weaker points. That was her woman's intuition that he had lacked. At the end of their talk Hart was willing to stake the judgment, experience, and savings of his four years of vaudeville that [...] "Mice Will Play" [...] would blossom into a perennial flower in the garden of the circuits.
