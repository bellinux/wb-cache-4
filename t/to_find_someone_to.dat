5|$|The game's plot {{describes}} {{a journey through}} a child's emotions and anxieties. After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> relate to. The hollow planet Gravida's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains. This larger creature is followed by several tiny creatures, some of which ride on its back. One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida. Though it is isolated and lonely, the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it. The planet Malaisus is composed of water, with a monster identical to the player's swimming around with a shoal of fish. The monster tells the player to leave. Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides, one angry and one happy. A two-faced creature travels across the surface; one is happy and the other morose. Bibulon is orbited by four moons, {{each of which has}} differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy. When players find the planet Debasa, they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog. Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys. Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.|$|E

25|$|Emilio Estevez {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of John Bender. However, when Hughes was unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> play Andrew Clarke, Estevez was recast. Nicolas Cage was considered {{for the role}} of John Bender, which was the last role to be cast, though the role was narrowed down to John Cusack and Judd Nelson. Hughes eventually cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look threatening enough for the role. At one point, Hughes was disappointed at Nelson because he stayed in character by harassing Ringwald off-camera, and the other actors had to convince Hughes not to fire him.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{has stated}} that the video is based on Jackson's real life. He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even {{at the peak of}} his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room {{sometimes}} and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> talk to.

500|$|Jackson's {{previous}} album Off the Wall (1979) received strong {{critical acclaim}} {{and was also}} a commercial success, eventually selling over 20 million copies worldwide.

The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> talk to. But I just end up coming home."

500|$|Kulwicki {{began his}} racing {{career as a}} 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work {{involved}} travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up {{doing most of the}} work himself. [...] "I showed him how", Gerry Kulwicki said. [...] "And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.'" ...|$|E

Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. Now that I have a franchise, what do I do with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E
500|$|In {{an opening}} {{statement}} {{for the trial}} on May 4, Cisneros's defense denied her client's participation in the murder, and called Martínez a liar. They stated that Martínez and Garza orchestrated the murder without Cisneros's involvement. The prosecution told the jury that Cisneros orchestrated the murder. Fischer's mother took the stand and repeated her versions {{of the story and}} of the two loud noises she heard before finding her son's corpse covered with blood on the driveway. In addition to her, other witnesses took the stand to tell the jury their stories, including his stepfather and a gardener, who saw a vehicle with Mexican license plates leaving the house when Fischer was shot dead. Martínez testified in court again that Cisneros agreed to pay her <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> murder Fischer after Martínez told her that he was not in love with her daughter. Investigators who worked on the case also testified in court and stated that Martínez cooperated with them to set up a meeting with Cisneros after she assisted her in finding someone to have Fischer killed. The prosecution stated they had audio tapes of Martínez's meeting with Cisneros, but they were asked to hold off on presenting the evidence because the defense stated the tapes were tampered with. [...] The recordings were admitted to court on May 8 and presented to the jury through translated transcripts.|$|E

For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we were in there mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They wanted nothing to do with it. They were into Pavement or whatever." [...] After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.|$|E

Though their idea of the character underwent several changes over the development, the selection of J.K. Simmons helped solidify the character.

But some people chip and chip at the ground underneath you in trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> blame. I do my best in football and I have no time to protect my back, so it's left wide open. Maybe that’s a lot of my trouble.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As McKittrick was {{led from}} the court, Bennett asked her to give {{evidence}} against Paulus, but she was initially reluctant to do so. She continued to resist until the case against Paulus was heard in February 1975. At the trial, McKittrick testified that Robinson had paid Paulus $25,000 <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> eliminate Hill, and that in turn, Paulus had paid Vandiver $5,000 {{to carry out the}} murder. McKittrick and Robinson both passed polygraph tests. The results indicated that McKittrick was being truthful when she stated that Robinson had caused John Hill's death and that Robinson was telling the truth when he said {{he had nothing to do}} with Hill's murder. Bennett also produced evidence that Ash Robinson had taken out a private telephone number, which had been found written on a scrap of paper in Paulus's handbag. DeGuerin then sought to portray McKittrick as a liar by calling Paulus to the witness stand, a strategy that was almost successful until Paulus deviated from the agreed testimony. She had sought to portray herself as a respectable widow who had taken pity on McKittrick. However, after telling the court that she did not know Vandiver, but had taken McKittrick into her home after a friend of her late husband had introduced them in the spring of 1972, Paulus offered comment on the difference between the two women's lifestyles. She told the court [...] "I liked [...] even though you could gather from her conversation that her life was just a little bit different from mine".|$|E
