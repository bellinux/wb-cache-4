25|$|An {{absolute}} listener {{may also}} use absolute strategies for tasks {{which are more}} efficiently accomplished with relative strategies, such as transposition or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard equal temperament. It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention. This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>concert</b> pitch convention {{other than the one}} in use, e.g., A = 435Hz (the Paris Opera convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries) as opposed to the Anglo-American modern standard A = 440Hz. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly {{different from that of the}} rest of the group.|$|E
25|$|J.K.

For JKB, this, and her inability to have children, is a problem. Gajapathi (Janagaraj) works for JKB as a tambura musician, {{and he is a}} compulsive liar. The film starts with an introduction of all characters of the film followed by JKB going <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>concert</b> where he finds Gurumoorthy (Delhi Ganesh), who works for JKB as a Mridangam musician, drunk. He instructs Gurumoorthy to leave the premises and performs in the concert without the use of Mridangam which is considered a basic/compulsory instrument to perform a carnatic concert. When Gurumoorthy is asked to permanently leave the band, he promises not to drink again. While Bhairavi's grandfather is going to receive his pension, which he does on the first of every month, Gajapathi lies to him that his pension has been cancelled. The old man starts crying and JKB intervenes to confirm that his pension is not canceled and that he can go and collect it. JKB then scolds Gajapathi for it and tells him the old man could have died on hearing such a lies, as he is very particular about his pension. Following this, when JKB finds out that Gajapathi has lied to him too and others causing problems he asks him to promise to speak the truth.|$|E
