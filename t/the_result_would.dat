5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested {{to him that the}} term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E

5|$|Published {{partially}} {{in response}} to Dissenting clergyman Richard Price's sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and primogeniture. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections, he argues that citizens {{do not have the}} right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be anarchy.|$|E

5|$|The same night, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien gave a {{televised}} {{address to the}} nation in English and French. Broadly similar in both languages, Chrétien promoted the virtues of Canadian federalism to Quebec, touched on the shared values of the country, warned that Parizeau would use the referendum result as a mandate to declare independence from Canada (while explicitly not stating <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be accepted), and announced that Quebec would be recognized as a distinct society and that any future constitutional reform that impacted Quebec would be made with the province's consent.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics and sounds in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team did not intend to create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|In January 1874, Gladstone {{called a}} general election, {{convinced}} that if he waited longer, he would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme {{of the past five}} years. As the constituencies voted, it became clear that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish Home Rule League. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.|$|E

5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} {{the following month}} that the developer was planning to create the game for Sony's PlayStation 2, perhaps {{to coincide with the}} console's release. Ultimately, however, the developer became involved with Sega's Dreamcast through Visual Concepts—a Sega developer in charge of third-party game development. Johnson and Voorsanger began development of the third game with the intention to re-make ToeJam & Earl; according to Johnson, the game would include the same elements as the first game, but with improved graphics. However, this notion was curtailed by Visual Concepts, who felt that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be too old-fashioned, and too niche in appeal. Johnson later said that he was unsure, at the time, whether to cater to fans who wanted a remake of the original or attempt to capture a new audience.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E

50|$|A {{second problem}} with {{abstention}} is {{it tends to}} help maintain the status quo, which {{may be seen as}} antithetical to the purpose of protesting in the first place. In a system where one candidate has a majority of support, protesting by abstention will increase that majority in <b>the</b> election <b>results.</b> To illustrate this, consider a group of 10 people voting for two candidates, A and B. Six support candidate A and three support candidate B, and one is wishing to protest, using their vote, against either the system or both candidates. If the protestor votes for candidate A, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be 70% to 30% (for A and B respectively); if the protestor abstains, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be 67% and 33% (A and B respectively); if the protestor votes for B, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be 60% and 40% (A and B respectively). In a larger election, the differences are numerically smaller but act to increase/decrease the proportional vote in the same ways.|$|R
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The {{switch from}} high-altitude to low-altitude flight {{profiles}} severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned {{to provide the}} desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht invaded Luxembourg, Netherlands and Belgium. In the Netherlands the Germans made steady progress. By 12 May, {{units of}} the German Army Group B were closing on Rotterdam and Amsterdam, while in central Belgium the Germans were close to {{reaching}} the Dyle river east of Brussels. In response to the invasions, the Allied First Army Group, {{under the command of}} Gaston Billotte, containing the French Seventh Army, French Ninth Army, French First Army and the British Expeditionary Force, advanced to the Dyle river in order to form a solid front line as part of the Dyle Plan, a defensive strategy to halt the German advances in Belgium. However, the offensive by Army Group B was a diversion. The main thrust of Fall Gelb was to be conducted by Army Group A through the Ardennes in Luxembourg and southern Belgium. Once these lightly defended areas were negotiated, Army Group A's XIX. Panzerkorps (19th Tank Corps), under the command of Heinz Guderian, was to strike into France at Sedan, located on the Meuse river. Its capture would enable a German advance into the undefended depths of France and to the English Channel, into the rear of the Allied mobile forces advancing into Belgium. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be a strategic-level encirclement.|$|E

5|$|There {{are almost}} no written sources {{from which to}} re-construct the {{demography}} of early medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 inhabitants in Dál Riata and 80–100,000 for Pictland, which was probably the largest region. It {{is likely that the}} fifth and sixth centuries saw higher mortality rates owing to the appearance of bubonic plague, which may have reduced the net population. The examination of burial sites for this period like that at Hallowhill, St Andrews indicate a life expectancy of only 26–29. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high-fertility, high-mortality society, similar to many developing countries in the modern world, with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children for women. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>would</b> have been a relatively small proportion of available workers to the number of mouths to feed, making it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and more complex societies to develop. From the formation of the kingdom of Alba in the tenth century, to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349, estimates based on the amount of farmable land, suggest that population may have grown from half a million to a million. Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague, there are many anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of the}} 15th century. Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population in the later clearances and the Industrial Revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of burghs. It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of more than 10,000 by the end of the era.|$|E
