5|$|It's my {{definitive}} {{statement in}} regards to the incredible pay-back I've received for having the nerve to talk about the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did {{in the past few years}} with my Sex book and my record. It's getting it off my chest. It is defensive, absolutely. But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I do the same <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did before … I think about the same things, so … I'm {{the wrong kind of}} person to be really big and famous.|$|E

But my conviction is that I have suffered for <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E

I am wrong... I am wrong and I know that my words and my actions were wrong and I'm not trying to justify {{that in any way}} – I am wrong, and the people who have complained are not wrong. They're just insulted by me and I completely take that criticism.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, one of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, {{but they were all}} good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky {{and then all of a}} sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E

"The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't understand," [...] said Mr. Newberry to Dr. Boomer as {{they went}} out from the club arm in arm (for they might now walk in that fashion with the same propriety as two of the {{principals}} in a distillery merger), [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't understand is why the Reverend Mr. Dumfarthing {{should be willing to}} consent to the amalgamation." ...|$|R

25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know are completely untrue.|$|E

500|$|A thirty-four second promo trailer of I Am... World Tour was {{launched}} on several websites in early November 2010. The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a 90-minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired , {{shot at the}} Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé' official website in November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on November 21, 2010 to premiere the concert film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the DVD in New York, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> see... It's a lot of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> reveal about myself that I would never give to another director." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{found that}} the most {{difficult}} aspect of producing the film independently was their inability to fix all of the mistakes made in the film's animation. Todd Edwards explained that [...] "it becomes an equation: 'I have 10 <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would like to change in this shot. I {{have the time and}} the budget to do three. Pick those three and then let's move on.' And that was hard to do." ...|$|E

And in my own mind, only {{someone who has been}} so intimately a victim of this madness as I have can do justice to what I have to say." ...|$|E

500|$|Blyton's {{range of}} plots and {{settings}} {{has been described}} as limited and continually recycled. Responding to claims that her moral views were [...] "dependably predictable", Blyton commented that [...] "most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe in and stand for– you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself". Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein {{repeatedly}} depicted aerial combat {{between the}} United States and the Soviet Union. In {{the early and}} mid-1960s, he produced [...] "explosion" [...] sculptures, taking subjects such as the [...] "catastrophic release of energy" [...] from paintings such as Whaam! and depicting them in freestanding and relief forms. In 1963, he was parodying a variety of artworks, from advertising and comics and to [...] "high art" [...] modern masterpieces by Cézanne, Mondrian, Picasso and others. At the time, Lichtenstein noted that [...] "the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have apparently parodied I actually admire." ...|$|E

500|$|Bono began each concert as The Fly and {{continued}} to play the character {{for most of the}} first half of the concert. In contrast to his earnest self of the 1980s, as The Fly, Bono strutted around the stage with [...] "swagger and style", exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star. He adopted the mindset that he was [...] "licensed to be an egomaniac". He often stayed in character away from the tour stage, including for public appearances and when staying in hotels. He said, [...] "That rather cracked character could say <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't", and that it offered him a greater freedom of speech.|$|E
500|$|After {{her second}} album, Jackson {{terminated}} business affairs with her family, commenting [...] "I {{just wanted to}} get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to do." [...] Attempting a third album, Jackson teamed with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They set out to achieve crossover pop appeal, while also creating a strong foundation within the urban market. Within six weeks, Jackson and the duo crafted her third studio album, Control, released in February 1986. The album peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over ten million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead found touring {{stressful}} {{and took}} a break in January 1996. They sought to distance their new material from the introspective style of The Bends. Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There was {{an awful lot of}} soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all. And I'm deliberately just writing down all the positive <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hear or see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it." ...|$|E
