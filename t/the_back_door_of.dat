5|$|As Reyes brings William back to Scully's apartment, Comer's {{artifact}} flies over William and hovers {{above his}} head. Scully, realizing something is wrong, plans to drive William to somewhere safe. At the same time, Doggett notices the Overcoat Woman watching them nearby. As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts {{the woman at}} gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William {{under the care of}} The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, the woman opens <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> {{the house with a}} box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

6000|$|It was in Reno, Nevada, in {{the summer}} of 1892. Also, it was fair-time, and the town was filled with petty crooks and tin-horns, to say nothing of a vast and hungry horde of hoboes. It was the hungry hoboes that made the town a [...] "hungry" [...] town.

He would later bury her naked body in the yard close to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the flat, and although he remained adamant he had not dismembered this particular victim, a subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed at the hip (although this damage may {{have been caused by}} building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976). In addition, several bones—particularly patellae, finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones—were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this would prove to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).|$|E

An alley that serviced <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing and wholesale businesses, these businesses would open retail outlets out their <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> {{for one or two}} days a week. These retail operations grew into full-time businesses along four blocks and transformed the alley into a bazaar.|$|R

The first complete programme broadcast away from the studio was the same year, from the East of England Show in Peterborough, presented by Anne Bristow.|$|R
25|$|Jugan {{was born}} in Glassport, Pennsylvania on October 16, 1957. He became {{interested}} in pro wrestling as a child after attending a live event at the McKeesport Palisades. Jugan later became a regular studio audience member on the famed Saturday night television program Studio Wrestling. Although the show was restricted to people over 18, Jugan was often sneaked in through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the WIIC-TV studio by Bruno Sammartino's manager {{and sat in the}} back row of the bleachers. Jugan was studying photography in school at the time and began taking pictures at the matches.

He was also president of a fanclub for Luis Martinez.|$|E
25|$|The gang {{attempted}} to rob {{the bank in}} Northfield at about 2pm. To carry out the robbery, the gang divided into two groups. Three men entered the bank, two guarded the door outside, and three remained near a bridge across an adjacent square. The robbers inside the bank were thwarted when acting cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused to open the safe, falsely claiming that it was secured by a time lock even as they held a Bowie knife to his throat and cracked his skull with a pistol butt. Assistant cashier Alonzo Enos Bunker {{was wounded in the}} shoulder as he fled through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the bank. Meanwhile, the citizens of Northfield grew suspicious of the men guarding the door and raised the alarm. The five bandits outside fired into the air to clear the streets, driving the townspeople to take cover and fire back from protected positions. They shot two bandits dead and wounded the rest in the barrage. Inside, the outlaws turned to flee. As they left, one shot the unarmed cashier Heywood in the head. Historians have speculated about the identity of the shooter but have not reached consensus.|$|E
500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the house rushed around to the front. [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out the back door and escaped.|$|E

The four-story brownstone (after some $65,000 worth of improvements) had four servants, a wardrobe filled with dresses, and a jewelry case accented by real jewels. The {{home was a}} few doors down from Fisk's Grand Opera House and Erie Railroad headquarters at 359 W. 23rd, and Fisk had a covered passage built linking <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headquarters and Mansfield's brownstone.|$|R
500|$|While Korn {{was looking}} for a place to record their debut album, they asked {{producer}} Ross Robinson to produce their album. After accepting the offer, Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch, Malibu, California. The band would record the majority of the album there, while additional recording took place at Bakersfield's Fat Tracks. Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed to recording instruments separately. The [...] "distinctive" [...] sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments, rather than the production. The bagpipes on [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain-top. However, they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the studio while Jonathan Davis walked past outside playing. As he walked further from the microphone, this led to the sound naturally fading quieter. Korn finished recording their self-titled album by the end of June 1994.|$|E
500|$|The Battle of Noordhorn, {{fought on}} 30 September 1581, was a pitched {{battle of the}} Dutch Revolt, fought between a Spanish army {{commanded}} by Colonel Francisco Verdugo – consisting of Walloon, German, Spanish and Albanian soldiers – and a Dutch States rebel army under the Englishman John Norreys – comprising English, Scottish, Dutch and Walloon troops – {{in the province of}} Friesland. In 1580, the Dutch stadtholder of Friesland, George van Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg, had shifted its allegiance from the Dutch to the Spanish side. [...] This opened a new front at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch Republic, forcing the States-General to dispatch forces to the north. That year the Dutch, under the leadership of John Norreys, succeeded in relieving the town of Steenwijk. In July 1581, Rennenberg died and was replaced by the Spaniard Francisco Verdugo, whose arrival in Friesland with reinforcements changed the situation. On 30 September Verdugo forced Norreys to give battle using a strategy of attrition.|$|E
500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she opened the door, and told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said [...] "Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand." ...|$|E

"The sheer {{amount of}} surface that was grained {{indicates}} {{that this was}} probably not {{the work of an}} itinerant artist passing through town, but undertaken by a specialist like Jason Hamilton, a 'fancy painter' who lived in nearby Sanford and was listed in the Mercantile Union Business Directory in 1849," [...] notes the application for the House's nomination to the National Historic Places Register. [...] "Interestingly, the grain painting at the Leavitt house does not necessarily try to mimic natural wood, rather the combinations of patterns, such as birds-eye maple and tiger-maple, used together on the doors suggest a much more artistic approach to the application. This suggestion is further supported by the grained pictures of the rooster and the swan that appear on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> two cabinets." ...|$|R
6000|$|Another serious incident--to be {{also kept}} from the invalid--shortly followed. The {{article in the}} [...] "Clarion" [...] had borne its fruit.

2500|$|Shinwell, {{intent on}} the {{destruction}} of the Fitzwilliams and [...] "the privileged rich", decreed that the mining would continue to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> Wentworth, the family's East Front.

2500|$|There was {{a special}} case {{established}} under the State Management Scheme where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973, most notably in Carlisle. During the 20th century elsewhere, both the licensing laws and enforcement were progressively relaxed, and there were differences between parishes; in the 1960s, at closing time in Kensington at 10:30pm, drinkers would rush over the parish boundary {{to be in good}} time for [...] "Last Orders" [...] in Knightsbridge before 11pm, a practice observed in many pubs adjoining licensing area boundaries. Some Scottish and Welsh parishes remained officially [...] "dry" [...] on Sundays (although often this merely required knocking at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the pub). These restricted opening hours led to the tradition of lock-ins.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Boca was a grocer who was {{attacked}} {{in his bedroom}} as he slept, by an axe-wielding intruder on August 10, 1919.

Upon regaining consciousness, Boca ran to the street to investigate the intrusion, and found that his head had been cracked open. The grocer ran {{to the home of}} his neighbor, Frank Genusa, where he lost consciousness and collapsed. Nothing had been taken from the home, yet, once again, a panel on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the home had been chiseled away. [...] Boca recovered from his injuries, but could not remember any details of the trauma. [...] It should be noted that this attack took place after the emergence of the infamous axeman letter.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|R
50|$|In September 2015, Frankie goes to {{stay with}} her {{daughter}} Debbie and visiting her ex-husband Johnno. During this time, Jack sells the pub and the Osbornes move to a new home. They also adopt Jade Albright who eventually discovers she has cancer. When she eventually returns, Frankie is stopped by Lindsey Butterfield who, unbeknownst to her, has just been outed as a serial killer. She tells Frankie that there has been an accident and she needs to get to hospital. Frankie lets her get into the van and the two drive off. It is later revealed as a trap as Lindsey has kidnapped Frankie and has put her in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> van. Lindsey then phones Esther, who she later meets outside of the vans. Lindsey opens <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> van, revealing Frankie. Lindsey says that if Esther doesn't help her, she will kill Frankie.|$|R
50|$|At 15, {{while working}} at a local pub, Dru met an older drummer and was thrust into Baltimore’s Rock 'n' Roll and heavy metal scene. The {{resulting}} band, called Ex-Rate, was heavily influenced by the metal bands of the early 2000s (Deftones, Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down) and aggressive east coast hip hop (Wu-Tang Clan, Gravediggaz) YM mag, played countless shows around the Mid-Atlantic, sharing the bill with then-regional acts The Strokes, Good Charlotte and Pissing Razors, and recording an EP at the famous Omega Studios. The band would often have to sneak young Dru into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> bars and clubs where they played, but as he was the principal songwriter and somewhat of a secret weapon, it quickly became routine. Dru was expelled from high school on arson and reckless endangerment charges ref. and sought refuge in music and the band. But shortly thereafter they would break up, some of the relationships having soured over addiction, distance and diverging tastes.|$|R
2500|$|Synagogues {{and easily}} {{recognizable}} Jewish properties and symbols throughout Britain were targeted by attackers. In Hendon, London, {{windows of the}} Raleigh Close synagogue were smashed {{and a piece of}} paper was found with the words [...] "Jews are sin". Blackpool and St John's Wood synagogues received telephone calls threatening that they would be blown up, and the walls of Plymouth Synagogue were attacked and marked with anti-semitic signs and slogans: [...] "Hang all Jews" [...] and [...] "Destroy Judah". In other attacks on Jewish targets, gravestones in a Jewish cemetery were uprooted in Birmingham, [...] "Hitler was right" [...] was daubed on properties in North Wales, and Jewish property in Halifax, Pendleton, Lancashire, Bolton, Holyhead and Southend were also attacked. In a further incident, <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the JC representative's home in Cardiff was marked [...] "Jews—good old Hitler". On 5 August 1947, The Times and Jewish Chronicle reported that in Eccles near Manchester, a crowd of 700 people [...] "cheered each hit" [...] as missiles pelted Jewish properties smashing their windows.|$|E
2500|$|The 2/12th {{struggled}} {{over the}} river amidst heavy rain, and then established themselves on Canning's Saddle, the following day they attacked Prothero I. Advancing silently up the steep slopes, {{they were able to}} surprise the Japanese defenders, creeping to within [...] of the objective before they were noticed by the Japanese defenders, at which point the Australians charged the position. Heavy fighting followed with units to the flanks; however, by night fall on 21 January, the 2/12th had secured Prothero I, silencing a Japanese mountain gun which had fired at them at point blank range from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> a bunker, causing 50 casualties, including the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bourne. Later, they repelled a Japanese attempt to retake the position during the night. The plan then called for the 2/12th to push south-east along Shaggy Ridge to the Kankiryo Saddle. Elsewhere, the 2/9th took the central position, attacking north-west up Shaggy Ridge securing positions at Green Sniper's Pimple on the southern part of McCaughey's Knoll, with a frontal attack, as part of the first phase in their advance through to the Kankiryo Saddle.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 2006, {{despite the}} PRD's plans to prevent Calderón from taking office, the inauguration {{in front of}} Congress was able to proceed. Hours before Calderón's arrival, lawmakers from the PRD and PAN parties began a brawl, in which several representatives threw punches and pushed, while others shouted at each other. PRD representatives shouted [...] "Fuera Fox" [...] ("Out with President Fox") and blew whistles, while PAN representatives responded back with [...] "Mexico, Mexico". Minutes before Calderón and Fox walked into Congress, the {{president}} of the Chamber of Deputies announced a legal quorum, thus enabling Calderón to legally take the oath of office. At 9:45am CST, all Mexican media cut to the official national broadcast, where commentators discussed the situation and showed scenes inside the Palace of the Chamber of Deputies, Palacio de San Lázaro. At 9:50am CST, Calderón entered the chamber through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the palace and approached the podium, where he took the oath as required by the Constitution.

60|$|The truth was, that Jonas did {{not know}} that the boys were in the barn when he {{fastened}} it up. As they did not come back after they had gone to answer the bell, he supposed that they had gone into the house; and when he was ready to come in himself, he shut and fastened <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barn, as he usually did when he left the shop. He then came around to the front barn door, and although that was on the sheltered side, so that the wind did not blow in, he thought it possible that the wind might change, and so drive the snow in upon the barn floor; and therefore, to make all safe, he thought that he would shut them, too. He accordingly shut the great doors, and put the fid into the staple. The fid is a wooden pin, to be passed through the staple when the doors are shut, to fasten them. The doors cannot be opened again until the fid is taken out.|$|R
