40|$|In eras {{of declining}} {{interest}} rates, millions of residential mortgage loans may be refinanced. When this occurs, it is customary for the refinancing lender {{to require a}} <b>title</b> <b>examination</b> and a new mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s title insurance policy. This requirement is expensive, usually costing several hundred dollars or more, and the cost is invariably paid by the borrower. This Article proposes that {{in the vast majority}} of refinancings this expense can be substantially reduced or even eliminated. This result can be achieved through proper understanding, adoption, and use of the doctrine of equitable mortgage subrogation articulated in the Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages. The principle of subrogation comes into play when the proceeds of a new mortgage are used to pay off a preexisting mortgage; it allows the holder of a new mortgage to take the priority of the old mortgage. If subrogation is made available liberally, as the Restatement recommends, it can eliminate the risk that intervening liens, arising between the dates of the original and the refinancing mortgages, will take priority over the refinancing mortgage. Hence, the need for new title insurance protection can be largely or entirely avoided...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the association and impact of occupational exposure and diseases of the shoulder and neck. Prevalence rates, odds ratios, aetiological fractions, and their confidence intervals were computed for pooled and non-pooled data of previous published reports. By comparison with office workers and farmers, dentists had an increased odds ratio for cervical spondylosis (two studies) and for shoulder joint osteoarthrosis. Meat carriers, miners, and "heavy workers " also had significantly higher rates of cervical spondylosis compared with referents. Compared with iron foundry workers, civil servants had a significant odds ratio (4 - 8) of cervical disc disease and a 0 79 aetiological fraction. Whether this was due to exposure or healthy worker effect was not clear. In four occupational groups with high shoulder-neck load an odds ratio of 4 0 was found for thoracic outlet syndrome with an aetiological fraction of 0 75. Rotator cuff tendinitis in occupational groups with work at shoulder level (two studies) showed an odds ratio of 11 and an aetiological fraction of 0 91.

This paper is a critical examination of the subtitling process. The film {{that is the subject}} of this paper is Rurouni Kenshin (2012), a film adapted from the previous media of manga and anime. The examination of subtitles was done by selecting four short scenes and creating titles for them in order to answer the question of whether or not analysis and examination of the film caused the subtitles to differ from a basic translation edited to fit within the requirements of subtitles. The subtitles were created for an audience that was familiar either with the Kenshin franchise’s previous incarnations or with the Meiji Restoration and post-Meiji periods in Japan. The conclusion of the study is that analysis and examination of a film certainly does affect the subtitles.

5000|$|Laberinto de Fortuna (Labyrinth of Fortune) is {{the major}} work of Juan de Mena, who {{completed}} the poem in 1444. It is an epic poem written in “arte mayor” (verses of 12 syllables). Though the <b>title</b> implies an <b>examination</b> of Fortune, the work is essentially a propagandistic piece in favor of Castilian political unity behind Álvaro de Luna, the court favorite of King Juan II of Castilla. It includes considerable social satire criticizing corrupt nobles and urging the king {{to take action against}} them.

40|$|Background Professional sport {{occupies}} {{a prominent place}} in cultures across the globe. Commercial organisations often use this prominence {{as a vehicle to}} promote their brands and products. There are increasing concerns about the growing {{number of people who are}} overweight and obese and the contributory role that marketing of processed food and drink plays. We therefore undertook a scoping review to explore the relationship between professional sports clubs and food and drink marketing. Methods We searched six databases (CINALH Plus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) from database start dates to March 27 – 31, 2017, using Boolean operators and search terms around professional sports clubs, marketing, food and drink, and health impacts (appendix). Experts were also consulted. Only English language publications were included. We excluded mega events (eg, Olympics, football World Cup) because of the attention already given to them. We likewise excluded alcohol marketing and sport, in view of the established literature exploring that relationship. Findings We identi ed 18166 <b>titles</b> for <b>examination</b> after removing duplicates and 163 abstracts for reviews; and obtained the full text for 26 publications. We included six papers in the review; four were from Australia and New Zealand. The Australasian literature was concerned with the marketing of (unhealthy) food and beverages to children and the potential (negative) impact on eating patterns. Rugby league, Australian football, and cricket were sports that were identi ed. Single papers from Turkey and the USA explored issues around marketing and professional sports clubs. The Turkish paper analysed shirt sponsorship in football leagues internationally and showed that food and beverage (including alcohol) companies were the most common sponsors. The paper from the USA examined a mixed reaction to a football team named after an energy drink. Interpretation Given the current focus on how processed food is marketed to children, it is surprising that professional sports clubs have eluded the scrutiny of academic public health in the UK. Our review highlights the lack of public health research in this area. Research that explores the interdependent commercial practices of food and drink companies and professional sports clubs is urgently needed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Aggressive {{periodontitis}} (AgP) is {{a severe}} form of periodontal diseases with rapid {{destruction of the}} supporting bone around teeth. The efficacy of PDT in suppressing periodontal pathogens may be crucial in adopting new protocols {{for the treatment of}} AgP. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the possible role of PDT in the treatment of AgP as an adjunctive therapy or monotherapy. Material and Methods: A systematic search of the literature was performed. Additionally, the references from all the selected full-text studies were searched for relevant articles. Two reviewers screened independently titles and abstracts or full text copies. Quality assessment of all the included studies was held. Results: Initial screening of electronic databases yielded 418 potentially relevant publications. After screening of the <b>titles</b> and full-text <b>examination,</b> five studies were included in the systematic review. Four publications evaluated the effects of PDT adjunctive to SRP in patients with AgP: two of them compared the clinical outcomes of SRP and PDT with a control group that received therapy with SRP and antibiotics (metronidazole and amoxicillin); two publications included SRP and PDT in the test group, and SRP alone in the control group. In one study, PDT was tested as a monotherapy compared with SRP alone. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this review, PDT may exhibit a beneficial role in the therapy of aggressive periodontitis after repeated applications. In the future, more methodologically sound, long-term randomized clinical trials are needed to be conducte...|$|R
2500|$|Seven {{years after}} the {{establishment}} of the Trần dynasty, the Emperor Trần Thái Tông ordered the first imperial examination, in the second lunar month of 1232, for royal students with the purpose of choosing the best scholars in Đại Việt for numerous high-ranking positions in the royal court. Two of the top candidates in this examination were Trương Hanh and Lưu Diễm. After another imperial examination in 1239, the Trần emperor began to establish the system of 7-year periodic examinations in order to select royal students from all over the country. The most prestigious <b>title</b> of this <b>examination</b> was tam khôi (three first laureates), which was composed of three candidates who ranked first, second, and third in the examination with the names respectively of trạng nguyên ( [...] , exemplar of the state), bảng nhãn ( [...] , eyes positioned alongside) and thám hoa ( [...] , selective talent). The first tam khôi of the Trần dynasty were trạng nguyên Nguyễn Hiền, who was only 12 at that time, bảng nhãn Lê Văn Hưu who later became a royal historian of the Trần dynasty, and thám hoa Đặng Ma La. In the 1256 examination, the Trần dynasty divided the title trạng nguyên into two categories, kinh trạng nguyên for candidates from northern provinces and trại trạng nguyên for those from two southern provinces: Thanh Hóa and Nghệ An, so that students from those remote regions could have the motivation for the imperial examination. This separation was abolished in 1275 when the ruler decided that it was no longer necessary.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} Chinese {{medical literature}} provides a substantial resource for natural products research. When undertaking systematic searches, investigators need {{to assess the}} scope, content, and relevance of collections both singly and in comparison. Objectives: This study examines eight collections of pre-modern literature, develops an approach to quantitatively assess their content, and compares their relative inclusivity. Methods: All publications listed in each collection were collated and a uniform scoring system was developed to account for variant editions, incorporation of multiple books under a single title, addition of commentaries, and other factors affecting content. Comparisons were undertaken between collections to determine the degree of overlap, genres of literature represented, and relevance to natural products research. Results: Following adjustments for differences in how books were listed, duplications, and variant editions, Zhong Hua Yi Dian (Encyclopaedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine) (4 th edition CD) is the largest collection of complete books containing 1009 different books. Zhong Guo Ben Cao Quan Shu (The Complete Collection of Traditional Texts on Chinese Materia Medica) contains 2026 titles including multiple editions and extracts, so after adjustments the number of different complete books is approximately 740. No collection was fully inclusive of the others, but Zhong Hua Yi Dian includes between 52. 1 % and 91. 5 % of the books in the six smaller collections. Comparing traditional collections is complex due to variant editions and multiple <b>titles.</b> This necessitates <b>examination</b> of the text rather than title alone.
