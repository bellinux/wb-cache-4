40|$|In {{spite of}} {{the large amount of}} {{information}} about the events occurred on 15 th February 2012 off the coast of Southern India the fragmented and unverifiable data coming from various sources make very difficult to carry out <b>technical</b> <b>surveys</b> having legal validity. It is obvious that both the expert of each party and the assessor need to have access to all documents and exhibits. In the Italian judicial system and legal proceedings both assessors and experts of the claimant and of the defendant take part in the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> process because the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> can have probative force and tend to prove a matter at issue. In the case of the jailed Italian marines issue, the unilateral decision of the Indian authorities not to allow the Italian forensic experts (the experts of the defendant) {{to take part in the}} <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> process preventing them in this way from carrying out the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> together with the Indian experts (the experts of the claimant) violates the principles of a fair process. The Italian forensic experts were allowed to be just “observers ” of the survey and were excluded from decision-making. Against this background, I think that it is useful to carry out a technical analysis of the events based on the available information reported in the press, being aware that some elements may have been misrepresented and misreported in the available sources. In {{spite of the}} mentioned shortcoming, the method I used for the analysis is valid. This means that if one day you have access to verifiable evidences and exhibits coming from reliable sources other than those I took into consideration, it will be possible to replace the ones I used with the more reliable ones and repeat the analysis and the survey without changing the methodological structure of my analysis. Each <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> follows a reliable method of inquiry and analysis. In the following we will do so with the purpose of analysing the nature of the facts and where they happened...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{work has}} shown that {{effective}} <b>survey</b> nonresponse adjustment <b>variables</b> should be highly correlated with both the propensity {{to respond to a}} survey and the <b>survey</b> <b>variables</b> of interest. In practice, propensity models are often used for nonresponse adjustment with multiple auxiliary variables as predictors. These auxiliary variables may be positively or negatively associated with survey participation, they may be correlated with each other, and can have positive or negative relationships with the <b>survey</b> <b>variables.</b> Yet the consequences for nonresponse adjustment of these conditions are not known to survey practitioners. Simulations are used here {{to examine the effects of}} multiple auxiliary variables with opposite relationships with survey participation and the <b>survey</b> <b>variables.</b> The results show that bias and mean square error of adjusted respondent means are substantially different when the predictors have relationships of the same directions compared to when they have opposite directions with either propensity or the <b>survey</b> <b>variables.</b> Implications for nonresponse adjustment and responsive designs will be discussed. nonresponse bias adjustment, response propensity models, mean square error, survey participation...|$|R

It {{is possible to}} get total information about these <b>survey</b> <b>variables</b> such as their total population, mean or their variance. In most cases auxiliary information about X is provided. A simple approach to using this auxiliary information is to assume a working model that describes {{the connection between the}} study variable of interest and the auxiliary variables. Estimators are then derived {{on the basis of this}} model. The best estimators are the ones that have good efficiency if the model is true, and are consistent if the model is inappropriate. In this study, we derive a nonparametric artificial neural network estimator of finite population total. The estimator is design unbiased, design consistent and asymptotic normal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The widely {{automated}} {{analysis and}} evaluation of measurement processes is a still unsolved task in <b>technical</b> <b>surveying.</b> Complex measurement systems, increasing time pressure {{and more and more}} operators with non-academic background require the development of new strategies for a comprehensive and user-friendly presentation and explanation of quality information as part of the process. To solve these tasks, a possible way is the application of knowledge-based systems. The paper describes the development of a knowledge-based system for the automated evaluation of the quality of free stationing processes. One special focus is set on the complex knowledge acquisition and evaluation phase. A software prototype is presented that processes quality relevant information from hybrid sources and automati-cally reports the evaluation and explanation to the user. 1. AUTOMATION OF TECHNICAL SURVEYING PROCESSES- A DILEMMA When we look at the typical surveying processes taking place in many areas of <b>technical</b> <b>surveying,</b> we see reached a quite high degree of automation in data acquisition.

40|$|Background. The large {{increase}} {{in the size of}} patent collections has led to the need of efficient search strategies. But the development of advanced text-mining applications dedicated to patents of the biomedical field remains rare, in particular {{to address the needs of}} the pharmaceutical & biotech industry, which intensively uses patent libraries for competitive intelligence and drug development. Methods. We describe here the development of an advanced retrieval engine to search information in patent collections in the field of medicinal chemistry. We investigate and combine different strategies and evaluate their respective impact on the performance of the search engine applied to various search tasks, which covers the putatively most frequent search behaviours of intellectual property officers in medical chemistry: 1) a prior art search task; 2) a <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> task; and 3) a variant of the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> task, sometimes called known-item search task, where a single patent is targeted. Results The optimal tuning of our engine resulted in a top-precision of 6. 76 % for the prior art search task, 23. 28 % for the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> task and 46. 02 % for the variant of the <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> task. We observed that co-citation boosting was an appropriate strategy to improve prior art search tasks, while IPC classification of queries was improving retrieval effectiveness for <b>technical</b> <b>survey</b> tasks. Surprisingly, the use of the full body of the patent was always detrimental for search effectiveness. It was also observed that normalizing biomedical entities using curated dictionaries had simply no impact on the search tasks we evaluate. The search engine was finally implemented as a web-application within Novartis Pharma. The application is briefly described in the report. Conclusions We have presented the development of a search engine dedicated to patent search, based on state of the art methods applied to patent corpora. We have shown that a proper tuning of the system to adapt to the various search tasks clearly increases the effectiveness of the system. We conclude that different search tasks demand different information retrieval engines' settings in order to yield optimal end-user retrieval...|$|R

The final authenticated version is available online at: [URL] this study we use agents’ expectations {{about the state of the}} economy to generate indicators of economic activity in twenty-six European countries grouped in five regions (Western, Eastern, and Southern Europe, and Baltic and Scandinavian countries). We apply a data-driven procedure based on evolutionary computation to transform <b>survey</b> <b>variables</b> in economic growth rates. In a first step, we design five independent experiments to derive a formula using <b>survey</b> <b>variables</b> that best replicates the evolution of economic growth in each region by means of genetic programming, limiting the integration schemes to the main mathematical operations. We then rank <b>survey</b> <b>variables</b> according to their performance in tracking economic activity, finding that agents’ ‘‘perception about the overall economy compared to last year’’ is the <b>survey</b> <b>variable</b> with the highest predictive power. In a second step, we assess the out-of-sample forecast accuracy of the evolved indicators. Although we obtain different results across regions, Austria, Slovakia, Portugal, Lithuania and Sweden are the economies of each region that show the best forecast results. We also find evidence that the forecasting performance of the survey-based indicators improves during periods of higher growth.
