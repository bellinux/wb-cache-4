5|$|After {{completing}} a major tour of Australia and Europe as opening act for superstar Pink early 2010, the band <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> {{out of the}} spot light, stating on their official website and blog that they were currently writing and recording their next studio album. The band took 2011 {{as an opportunity to}} build a new recording studio, now named, The Stables Recording Studio, in regional Victoria, using it to record new material. In early 2011 the band took a portable recording studio on an elaborate round world writing trip.|$|E
5|$|During her trials, UB-7 {{developed}} a leak which <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to repair. In the meantime, she was assigned the Austrian number of U-7 and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since {{it was still}} the intent for UB-7 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons' {{family members}} that showed up <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to be made, but the staff enjoyed the results. All {{of the male}} Simpson family members that showed up were voiced by Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer. He had asked for the {{recording}} tape to be run for about 20 minutes, so he could do many different voice variations that would fit the different men, but still be close to Homer's voice.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E

5|$|As the peloton {{approached}} the Côte de la Redoute, {{there was a}} large crash. Among the riders to crash were two previous winners of the race, Dan Martin and Simon Gerrans, as well as Fränk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), Nicolas Roche (Sky), Mathias Frank (IAM) and Yukiya Arashiro (Europcar). Vincenzo Nibali was forced to unclip himself from his bike, but avoided crashing. The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders {{at the foot of the}} climb. Although there were no bad injuries in the crash, Roche and Arashiro <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to stand up, with Roche looking particularly dazed. Many of the riders who crashed attempted to get back into the peloton, with Gerrans and Martin among them. Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, {{and after}} {{returning}} to civilian life he <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before feeling ready to compose new works. He revised some earlier pieces, and {{turned his attention to}} other musical activities. In 1919 he accepted an invitation from Hugh Allen, who had succeeded Parry as director, to teach composition at the RCM; he remained on the faculty of the college for the next twenty years. In 1921 he succeeded Allen as conductor of the Bach Choir, London. It was not until 1922 that he produced a major new composition, A Pastoral Symphony; the work was given its first performance in London in May conducted by Adrian Boult and its American premiere in New York in December conducted by the composer.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of hostilities, the Australian government decided {{that it would not}} contribute to the proposed Allied occupation force in Germany and would begin the process of demobilisation of the AIF as soon as possible. Owing to the large number of soldiers deployed overseas, this process <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> and it was decided to progressively return men from each battalion, rather than send them home as a formed unit. As numbers dwindled, units were amalgamated for administrative purposes, and as a consequence the 9th and 10th Battalions were merged on 5 February 1919; the final contingent of troops from the 10th Battalion did not return home until September 1919 when they disembarked in Adelaide from the transport Takada.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Asama {{remained}} on blockade duty off Port Arthur {{and participated in}} a minor way in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. She was coaling when the Pacific Squadron sortied and <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to intercept the Russian ships. The battle was almost over by then and the ship only engaged them for the last hour {{or so of the}} battle. After the battle, the sisters were refitted and assigned to different units, escorting troop convoys to northern Korea and blockading the Tsugaru Strait until the Russian ships from the Baltic Fleet approached Japan in mid-1905.|$|E
5|$|Longren {{established}} his own firm, the Longren Aircraft Corporation of Topeka, and began offering his airplanes via mail order. He designed and sold ten different models, {{all of which}} were acknowledged for their high quality and durability. The company, however, had only moderate sales and fluctuating commercial success. In late 1915, he was seriously injured in a mishap at a flying demonstration in Abilene, Texas, and thereafter the barnstormer devoted most of his time to architecture and design. He also <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> off beginning in 1917 when America entered the First World War – for nearly two years, he served as chief inspector of aircraft at the nation's first military aviation research and development center, McCook Field in Ohio.|$|E

5|$|On 12 August, crusader scouts {{discovered}} {{the location of}} the Fatimid camp, which the crusaders immediately marched towards. According to most crusader and Muslim accounts, the Fatimids were caught unaware. Because of a somewhat ill-prepared Fatimid army, the battle was fairly short, although it still <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to resolve, according to Albert of Aix. al-Afdal Shahanshah and his army retreated into the heavily guarded and fortified city of Ascalon. The next day the crusaders learned that al-Afdal Shahanshah had retreated back to Egypt via boat, so they plundered what remained of the Fatimid camp. After returning to Jerusalem most of the crusaders returned to their homes in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Potassium metal {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile. Potassium {{was the first}} metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, it <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before this view was universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} mercury <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> – the latent period between {{ingestion}} {{and the first}} symptoms (typically paresthesia – numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.|$|E

5|$|It <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> {{before a}} Bishop of Lithuania was {{appointed}} because of various conflicts of interest. The Bishop of Gniezno appointed Vito (Lithuanian: Vitas), a monk of the Dominican Order, to this position, {{but he was}} not recognized by Mindaugas or accepted by the populace. The activities of Vito in Lithuania are unknown, although he is sometimes associated with Mindaugas' Cathedral. Finally, in 1254, Christian (Lithuanian: Kristijonas) from the Livonian Order was appointed. Mindaugas endowed him with some lands in Samogitia, but not much is known about his activities. Historical sources do not mention any sponsorship of missionaries, education of priests, or construction of churches during that time, and Bishop Christian went back to Germany in 1259, where he died in 1271. The establishment of Mindaugas' Cathedral remains problematic, but recent archeological research found the remains of a 13th-century brick building {{on the site of the}} present-day Vilnius Cathedral. The general assumption is that the remains are those of Mindaugas Cathedral, built to satisfy the agreement with the pope. However, as later events showed, Lithuanians resisted Christianization, and Mindaugas' baptism had only a temporary impact on further developments.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} buildings <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to finish; {{only the}} original gateway was lavished upon from the beginning. The buildings were only of a modest splendour: {{the hall was}} not completed {{until the end of}} the seventeenth century; the rooms economically decorated without wood panelling; the main quadrangle only of one storey and garrets. Although an earlier chapel is suspected, the area above Staircase I– now the Senior Common Room– was in use by 1521. It appears that the ecclesiastical furnishings promised by Smyth never arrived, and have been presumed taken by the College's first Visitor, Cardinal Wolsey. Although the chapel (or perhaps oratory) was plain, two chalices and two patens survived from the original three of each and have been identified as older than those of Corpus or Trinity, dating to the late fifteenth century. Similarly the Old Library, now staircase IV, room 4, was completed in 1520–1, was not intended to be permanent but kept a considerable collection of books, most attained from benefactors, of which the most valuable were those donated by Henry Mason during the reign of James I. The library remained in that location until 1663.|$|E
5|$|Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the {{amalgamation}} of {{the military}} forces controlled by the six separate, self-governing British colonies to form a unified force controlled by the Commonwealth was an inevitable, albeit slowly realised, consequence, given that the new Constitution of Australia assigned the defence power solely to the Commonwealth. Indeed, this process <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> as, to a large extent, matters of defence were not necessarily a priority of the new Australian legislature at the time, {{and there was also}} a considerable diversity in opinion regarding the composition and size of the new national army and role it would play at home and indeed within the wider Imperial defence system. Nevertheless, the official transfer of forces from the states to the Commonwealth occurred on 1 March 1901, and this date is today celebrated as the birthday of the modern Australian Army. At the outset, the bulk of the Commonwealth military force was to be made up of part-time volunteers. This was arguably due to two factors. Firstly, there was a widespread desire amongst Australian policymakers to keep defence expenditure low, while secondly there was a widespread mistrust or suspicion surrounding the idea of a large standing army.|$|E
