5|$|The Lusitani revolted {{again in}} 146 BC {{under a new}} leader called Viriathus, invading Turdetania (southern Iberia) in a guerrilla war. The Lusitanians were {{initially}} successful, defeating a Roman army at the Battle of Tribola and going on <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> nearby Carpetania, and then besting a second Roman army at the First Battle of Mount Venus in 146 BC, again going on <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> another nearby city. In 144 BC, the general Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus campaigned successfully against the Lusitani, but failed in his attempts to arrest Viriathus.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton nearly {{failed to}} make the trip. His {{newspaper}} editor Eric Baume ordered to write a column attacking the Australian Board of Control for vetoing players from going on a private tour of India, threatening <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> him if he refused—criticism of the board typically resulted in exclusion from selection. Fingleton was reluctant to comply, and was reprieved when the editor-in-chief overruled Baume.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Anzen or Dazimon {{was fought}} on 22 July 838 at Anzen or Dazimon (now Dazmana, Turkey) between the Byzantine Empire {{and the forces}} of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids had {{launched}} a huge expedition with two separate armies in retaliation for the Byzantine emperor Theophilos's successes the previous year, and aimed <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> Amorion, one of Byzantium's largest cities.

The delay proved fatal when the expedition met the warriors of the Miami tribe under Miami Chief Little Turtle along the Eel River, {{and the entire}} force was killed or captured. Clark organized another assault on Fort Detroit in 1781, but it was aborted when Chief Joseph Brant captured {{a significant part of}} Clark's army at a battle known as Lochry's Defeat, near present-day Aurora, Indiana.|$|E

5|$|The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) {{contemplated}} {{whether it}} would be better to cancel all matches in Guyana or <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> Sobers; neither prospect was attractive. The crisis ended when Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, wrote a letter of apology for Sobers to sign, which was relayed to the WICB and several governmental bodies in late October 1970. This was accepted, and the incident was soon largely forgotten. Sobers regained his overwhelming popularity with West Indian cricket fans, continued as team captain until 1972 and retired from cricket two years later. He thereafter retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport. His Rhodesian visit has been cited as precursoring the South African rebel tours controversy of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Then came {{a decline}} in his career {{at such a young}} age which began soon after the arrival of new manager Alex Ferguson in November 1986, the change of manager coming after a dismal start to the season led to the {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> Ron Atkinson. Whiteside, still only 21, was facing trouble from his right knee which was now beginning to require serious medical procedures to prevent it from causing his retirement. Ferguson put Whiteside back up front, and in turn he scored three times in his first four games back from injury. Ferguson did though have to rebuke Whiteside after some of his numerous drinking sessions. He ended the 1986–87 season with 10 goals in 37 appearances, however United could only manage an 11th-place finish.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany conquered Poland in September 1939, it {{was faced}} with the {{disposition}} of the large Jewish population.

5|$|Building for the 1975–76 {{campaign}} {{he signed}} Phil Boersma from Liverpool to replace Murdoch, but Boersma never settled {{at the club}} and was frequently injured. They finished in 13th place, {{and went on to}} win the Anglo-Scottish Cup with a 1–0 win over Fulham. They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, and took a 1–0 lead over Manchester City into the second leg at Maine Road, where they were soundly beaten 4–0. However teams had begun to learn how to combat Charlton's attack strategy and left their centre-backs on the outside of the penalty box to neutralise the threat of Foggon. Despite the team's steady progress the club's board voted <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> Charlton in July 1976 after becoming increasingly concerned that he was overstepping his authority in negotiating business deals on behalf of the club and choosing the club's strip. However, the club chairman overruled the decision and Charlton remained in charge.|$|E
5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian army {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> {{and burn}} Plataea and Thespiae, the Boeotian cities {{that had not}} submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens. Meanwhile, the Greeks (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolished the single road that led through it and built a wall across it. As at Thermopylae, making this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring {{the passage of the}} Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Salamis, which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|In 1566 the Burgundian Netherlands, Charles V of Habsburg's {{original}} realm, {{which had}} passed {{to his son}} Philip II of Spain on his abdication in 1556, were in disarray due to religious tensions between Protestants and Catholics and the nobility and cities' unwillingnes of funding Philip's wars and ceding its powers to the Royal administration. In 1567 Philip sent an army to the Netherlands under Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, to restore his authority, but Alba's persecution of the religious and political dissenters led William of Orange, {{the leader of the}} nobility, to exile into Germany and prepare an invasion of the Netherlands to expel Alba. Orange invaded the Netherlands twice, in 1568 and 1572, but in both occasions Alba defeated him. The second time, however, the revolt spread into the provinces of Holland and Zealand, and Alba was unable of quelling it. In 1576, the lack of an authority due to the death of Alba's successor Luis de Requesens, together with a Spanish general bankruptcy, led the Spanish mutinuous soldiers <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> several towns, including Antwerp. In reaction, the loyal and rebel provinces united to expel the foreign troops under the Pacification of Ghent.|$|E

5|$|In 860, {{along with}} Karbeas, ʿUmar {{launched}} a major raid into Anatolia which reached the Black Sea port of Sinope, returning with over 12,000 head of captured livestock. Three years later, {{he was part}} of a major Abbasid force that invaded Anatolia through the Cilician Gates. After splitting off from the main force and repulsing a Byzantine army under Emperor Michael III at Mardj al-Usquf ("Bishop's Meadow") in Cappadocia, ʿUmar with his men headed north <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> the port city of Amisos. On his return, however, he was encircled by the Byzantines and killed at the Battle of Lalakaon on September 3, 863. Only a splinter of his army escaped under his son, but was then defeated and captured by the commander of the Charsianon district. According to al-Tabari, when the news of ʿUmar's death, along with that of another celebrated leader, Ali ibn Yahya al-Armani, arrived in Iraq, they provoked riots among the populace of Baghdad, Samarra, and other cities, angry at the Abbasid government's perceived incompetence.|$|E
5|$|Morrell left Arsenal {{during the}} First World War and James McEwen served as {{caretaker}} manager, presiding over two matches. Both managers' work over 1914–15 resulted in Arsenal finishing in fifth place and aided the club's re-election to the First Division. When professional football resumed in 1919, Norris appointed Leslie Knighton as the club's manager. Arsenal remained under financial strain {{during this period}} and stagnated in the league; Kingston in his autobiography claimed he was under strict instruction to spend little on transfers. His working relationship with Norris moreover deteriorated and in 1925 he was dismissed. The decision <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> Knighton {{was said to have}} been made following Arsenal's defeat to West Ham United in the FA Cup, a competition which presented the club's only realistic chance of silverware.|$|E

Paul seeks to separate the hotel from the Lassiter's chain to enable him <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> Terese. However, Terese quits her job and Paul threatens to sue her. Lucy persuades Paul to re-hire Terese and he keeps the hotel within the Lassiter's chain.

5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to be debated by historians today, claimed this {{was a violation of}} the terms of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void. He allowed his troops <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> the town and destroy the church, acts that he had promised to prevent in the oral surrender agreement. He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed back to Boston, carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's welcome and was lavished with praise, although he was criticized in some circles (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E
5|$|While Busby was in {{hospital}} {{recovering from the}} injuries he sustained in the air crash, his managerial duties were left to his assistant, Jimmy Murphy. After Busby recovered, he set about rebuilding his side, and within five years, in 1963, he had won the FA Cup {{for the first time}} in 15 years. This was followed up by two league titles in three years, and then the greatest prize in European club football, the European Cup. He continued as manager for one more year after this success, leaving his managerial duties to club trainer Wilf McGuinness. McGuinness struggled in his new post, however, and Busby was convinced to return for the second half of the 1970–71 season. However, he retired from football permanently that summer, and was succeeded that summer by Frank O'Farrell. O'Farrell's stay was short-lived, though, as his inability to control George Best's extravagances forced the board <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> him with three years still to run on his contract.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce was {{generous with}} {{his time and}} money, believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a {{significant}} portion of their income to the needy.

He paid off the debts of others, supported education and missions, and in a year of food shortages, gave to charity more than his own yearly income. He was exceptionally hospitable, and could not bear <b>to</b> <b>sack</b> any of his servants. As a result, his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity. Although he was often months behind in his correspondence, Wilberforce responded to numerous requests for advice or for help in obtaining professorships, military promotions and livings for clergymen, or for the reprieve of death sentences.|$|E
