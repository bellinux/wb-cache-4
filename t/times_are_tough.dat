50|$|According to Carol Yung, {{board member}} and tour guide for the Camarillo Ranch Foundation, some of the land that Adolfo Camarillo owned was in the Mission Oaks and Leisure Village area {{of the city of}} Camarillo, California.

50|$|The {{following}} statement {{was released by}} the label as a description:All rock music {{is a sort of}} dramatic music. And since the <b>times</b> <b>are</b> <b>tough,</b> it makes sense to have that “drama” be something more like a version of Taxi than something like a version of Titanic. We like Taxi better than Titanic anyway. So we hope that some of the songs on this record can be used as theme songs to folk's own personal versions of Taxi. Because—ideally—the dramatic setting of the music isn't provided by the story or image of the given act or band. It's provided by {{the lives of the people}} who use—listen to—the music. That is pop music's promise and problem, or danger. So be careful and don't get canceled.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2004 interview, Guthrie {{spoke about}} spirituality {{and the role}} it plays {{in his life and}} on Outlasting the Blues. I'm not a big fan of overly happy spirituality ... Life ain’t happy all the time. For me, spirituality is not about being happy. It's about what to do when <b>times</b> <b>are</b> <b>tough,</b> not just for you {{personally}} but for everybody. There are times when disasters strike ... So, for me, spirituality is what to do about that, and then what to do in your own personal life when you're confronting things that hurt, things that ain't fun. Outlasting the Blues was about that. It was not about preachin', it was not about telling people what's right, although there's {{a little bit about what}} I found was right.|$|E
50|$|The Corvus corax {{can live}} {{in a wide range}} of habitats, it is very {{successful}} at adapting to different environments. Although the Corvus corax {{can live in}} many different habitats, the common raven is hyperosmotic to its habitat as it is always in a terrestrial habitat. Living in a terrestrial habitat causes a few problems for the common raven, it constantly must intake water and salts to balance its water/salt content in the blood. Since the terrestrial habitat is hyposmotic in relation to the Corvus corax it does not have to worry about water loss, it uses kidneys to regulate salt content in the blood and usually excretes a very dilute excrement. The common raven is a very experienced hunter and will hunt anything from bird eggs, to frogs, to the common field mouse and even up to a small chicken. When <b>times</b> <b>are</b> <b>tough</b> for hunting the Corvus corax will rely on its keen sense of smell and sight to scavenge for food. The Corvus corax is a master scavenger by trade and has an intake of salt by eating mostly carrion from dead animals though the common raven will easily eat human garbage if available to them.In the case of most of the populations of Corvus corax which live more in the northern parts of North America, harsh winters can be very advantageous with large death rate of herbivores allowing for easy meals for the raven. In fact food can be so bountiful that the common raven which is usually solitary in nature, only ever living with one partner to actually allow other scavengers such as bald eagles, magpies, crows, and other scavenger to fest with them on a dead pile with little to no competition. The difference in diet between the populations of Corvus corax near the sea compared to the boreal forest is immense; ravens near the more marine based terrestrial habitat prey primarily on gulls eggs and hatchlings as well as supplementing their diet with seaweed; note that the feces of these populations showed huge quantities of seaweed indicating that it was an essential source of nutrition even though it was largely indigestible.|$|E

Whether they were hardened by the boom-and-bust cycles of the construction industry or the tough fights to win middle-class wages and benefits, they were no more inclined to “organize thoroughly” in the 1950s and ‘60s, when work was plentiful, than big-city unions had been when the IA first started out.
