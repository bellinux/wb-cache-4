The first Studebaker wagon factory {{was built in the}} same year next to the home. On Bakers Lookout Peter, master of the German Cutler Guild, built the first Studebaker home, the first Studebaker wagon factory where he began forging and <b>tempering</b> <b>steel</b> and seasoning wood in the colonies. Peter Studebaker built the first Studebaker mill and a wagon road. Broadfording Wagon Road was built to run through the property. Peter owned property {{on both sides of the}} Conococheague creek, so he built a bridge over the creek in 1747. Peter began the family business on the Bakers Lookout property where he made his home, and built the first Studebaker wagon factory. In this factory Peter manufactured everything, all necessities including products he made in Solingen Germany and naturally wagons. Bakers Lookout, the 1740, 100-acre land patent, Hagerstown, Maryland, was the first of many land patents to be acquired by Peter Studebaker. Peter purchased approximately 1500 acres in what is now known as the state of Maryland. The home still stands today and is proof of the advanced technology of Peter Studebaker.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model and expressions for hardness prediction were established, where quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> hardness is predicted based on as-quenched hardness of steel. Hardenability properties of steel {{are included in}} the model to achieve a more precise prediction of quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> hardness. Prediction of the as-quenched hardness of steel is based on the relationship between as-quenched hardness and the characteristic cooling time from 1073 K to 773 K (800 °C to 500 °C) (t 8 / 5). The model was used to simulate the hardness of a quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> workpieces...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{computer}} simulation of mechanical properties of quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> was investigated. The established method of {{computer simulation}} was applied in prediction of mechanical properties of workpiece with complex form. Design/methodology/approach: The method of computer simulation of mechanical properties of quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> {{was established by}} theoretical analysis of relevant properties which have influence on hardness of quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel,</b> and by regression analysis based on experimental results. Findings: The new method of prediction of mechanical properties of quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> was established. Proposed method of computer simulation of mechanical properties of quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> is based on predicted steel hardness. Hardness distribution of quenched and tempered workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation of steel quenching using a finite volume method. It was found out that mechanical properties of quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> can be successfully predicted by proposed method. Research limitations/implications: The investigation was done on carbon and low alloyed steel. The further experimental investigations are needed for final verification of established model. Practical implications: The established method could be applied in industrial practice. Originality/value: As-quenched hardness distribution is predicted by involving the results of simple Jominy-test in numerical modelling of steel quenching. Estimation of hardness distribution is based on time, relevant for structure transforma- tion, i. e., time of cooling from 800 to 500 °C (t 8 / 5). The distribution of mechanical properties in quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> workpiece is estimated based on as-quenched <b>steel</b> hardness, <b>tempering</b> temperature and Jominy-test results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe controlled-forging and controlled-cooling {{has become}} the main process of the non-quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels</b> now. However, {{there is a problem}} that the {{unstable}} toughness and its lower values restrict the expanded application and the development of the steels. In this study, the process of the non-quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels</b> was optimized through the micro- alloying and the controlled-forging and controlled-cooling technology. The simulated rapid cooling followed by self tempering after forging was tried to control the microstructure and mechanical properties of the steels. A new process of the non-quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels</b> was proposed to ensure high strength and high toughness for the studied steels. The toughening and strengthening mechanism of the steels processed by the new process was discussed and evaluated, which could provide the fundamental theory, technical support and process parameters for the industrialized production of the high strength and high toughness non-quenched and <b>tempered</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} {{results on the}} fatigue damage of grade SAE 318 LN austenitic-ferritic duplex steel and a modified SAE 4150 <b>tempering</b> <b>steel</b> in the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the relation- ship between the crystallographic orientation of individual grains and grain patches that exhibit slip band formation, fatigue crack initiation and growth. Therefore, electrolytically polished bulk specimens have been fatigued under fully reversed loading in an ultrasonic fatigue testing machine while the surface has been observed in-situ by an optical microscope. The specimens were carefully analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in combination with automated electron back-scatter dif- fraction (EBSD). In case of the austenitic-ferritic duplex steel under VHCF loading conditions, slip band formation is limited to the softer austenite grains. Once being formed, the bands generate high stress concentrations where they impinge the austenite- ferrite (γ−α) phase boundaries, eventually, leading to the crack initiation. In case of the <b>tempering</b> <b>steel</b> crack initiation is caused by slip band formation within the martensitic laths structure. It was found that in both materials microcracks are sensitive to changing crystallographic orientations when crossing a grain or phase boundary...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{microstructure}} of a microalloying non-quenching and <b>tempering</b> <b>steel</b> developed {{recently was}} analyzed through OM, SEM and TEM, {{in order to}} find the strengthening and toughening mechanisms of the steel. All of the dislocations and subgrain boundaries in the grains, the martensite in the martensite-austenite islands of the grainy bainite structure, the dispersed phases in the grains and at the grain boundaries, and the grain size were observed and studied in our experiments. The results indicate that the strengthening results from phase transition, dislocation, subgrain structure, dispersion phase and fined grain, and the toughness relates with the ferrite matrix consisting of the grainy bainite and the grain size of the steel. The mechanisms between the hot-rolled-and-cooled and the tempered steel are slightly different...|$|E

In general, the rapid cooling causes residual stress field due to the dis-homogeneity {{of the distribution of}} temperature in the part and the different microstructural phases. In comparison with other conventional quenching methods, spray-quenching method could have a capability to control the temperature distribution through the surface. In order to gain entry the appropriate mechanical properties, the spray control valves need to adjust to the foundation of heavy forgings cross sections. In this situation, the modelling of the spray quenching operation necessarily deserves for more elaboration.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{friction}} welding of dissimilar base metals occurs an uneven heating {{in the outside}} and inside zones of materials what causes appearance of various structures in the joint zone. Considering that the objective is achieving of the homogeneous welded joint, an imperative is to analyze the microstructure of the realized welded joint. By the microstructure analysis, one can establish the relationship between {{the friction}} welding parameters and the structure that appears in each of the joint's characteristic zones. In addition, it is possible to analyze the potential appearance of flaws during the welding process and to discover the causes for their appearance in order to prevent those in the future. This paper presents a review and analysis of microstructures of the characteristic joint zones in the friction plane of the two different steels, the high-speed steel and carbon steel for tempering. The experiment consisted of varying the friction welding parameters (friction pressure and friction time) and monitoring of micro structure in the joint zone and its immediate vicinity, both {{from the side of the}} <b>tempering</b> <b>steel</b> and the HS steel, as well as defining the present phases and compounds.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} ultrasonic burnishing as {{a mechanical}} surface treatment {{for improving the}} quality of rotating shafts. Ultrasonic burnishing is a modern method for finishing workpieces to produce a good surface quality. This process improves the surface quality and increases the surface hardness of the workpiece, and the surface roughness of the workpiece improves. As a result, wear resistance and fatigue life increase. Furthermore, these improvements are achieved without expensive equipment or long processing times. In this paper the influence of the ultraburnishing technique on the change in diameter and its effects on the out-of-roundness of rotating shafts are investigated. This paper also {{takes a look at the}} magnitudes of the improvement of the surface roughness as a result of using ultrasonic burnishing. Three different materials, aluminium, 34 -CrNiMo 6 <b>tempering</b> <b>steel,</b> and S 355 J 2 structural steel, are examined. The results showed that ultrasonic burnishing is a treatment that improves the quality of components. Ultrasonic burnishing also has a reducing effect on the final diameter and out-of-roundness and increases the hardness of the workpiece. It can also be stated that the material of the workpiece does not have a significant effect on the magnitude of the reduced surface roughness values...|$|E

The test {{results indicate that the}} introduction of a transverse butt weld in this steel decreases the fatigue strength corresponding to 2, 000, 000 cycles by approximately 40 percent.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study pure rolling contact fatigue in 32 CrMoV 13 {{quenching}} and <b>tempering</b> <b>steel.</b> The study involves both experimental and numerical work. The influence of the roughness and the residual stresses on the mechanisms and zones of cracking were studied. The results show a rapid reduction in roughness during the first minute of test but even {{so there will be}} specimen deterioration. The residual stress profile after rolling contact tests have high compression values in the surface and at a depth of approximately 240 μm, which is related with the Hertzian maximal shear stress. The numerical simulation of the Hertzian loading was used both to determine the elastic shakedown of thematerial and to apply a high-cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion. The threedimensional finite element analysis used in the numerical calculation includes elastic-linear kinematic hardening plastic material and allows the introduction of an initial residual stress state. Taking into account the elastoplastic load induced by the Hertz pressure, low-cycle fatigue tests were used to characterize the mechanical properties of the material. In order to validate the numerical simulation, the results of the calculation after elastic shakedown were compared with the values measured by X-ray diffraction after rolling contact tests. The results showed a reasonable agreement between calculated and measured stresses. The Dang Van high-cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion showed a good relationship with the experimental findings...|$|E
