It has drawn criticism from various environmental groups who claim it will only serve to accelerate urban sprawl north of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The IND Concourse Line got funding <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> eastward past 205th Street, but Bronx {{residents}} {{wanted to}} rehabilitate the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway right-of way.

5|$|The {{southern}} {{termination of}} the line at Elephant & Castle presented the opportunity for the line <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> further, to serve Camberwell and other destinations in south-east London. In 1913, the Lord Mayor of London announced a proposal for the Bakerloo Tube <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to the Crystal Palace via Camberwell Green, Dulwich and Sydenham Hill, but nothing was done to implement the plan. In 1921, the LER costed an extension to Camberwell, Dulwich and Sydenham and in 1922 plans for an extension to Orpington via Loughborough Junction and Catford were considered. In 1928, a route to Rushey Green via Dulwich was suggested. Again, no action was taken, although the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee approved an extension to Camberwell in 1926.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been plans for Metrorail, the local heavy rail rapid transit system <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> west, with two {{proposed}} lines terminating at Florida International University's main campus.

5|$|Because {{it would}} be {{utilized}} in both directions, {{the capacity of the}} proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.|$|E

5|$|Madgwick's {{second term}} as {{chairman}} expired on 30 June 1973 and he hoped <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> for a third. McClelland, however, told Madgwick in early 1973 that Whitlam {{was concerned about}} Madgwick's age and therefore planned to replace him. Privately, Madgwick felt that Whitlam wanted him replaced because Whitlam suspected Madgwick and his vice-chairman of being biased in favour of the previous government. Madgwick, as with Darling, was not officially informed that would be replaced as chairman until shortly before his term expired. The new chairman was Richard Downing, Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne and a Labor supporter.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{the line}} {{have been made}} since the {{extension}} to Østerås. The current municipal master plan calls for the line <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to Bekkestua Station, where it would again intersect with the Kolsås Line. One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås Line and a new branch be built to Sandvika, the municipal center of Bærum. However, an extension {{has not been a}} priority for the municipal politicians, although the right-of-way has been secured, which will simplify construction.|$|E
5|$|Standard gauge rail {{services}} from Sydney {{came with the}} extension of the Main Southern line to Cootamundra and Junee in 1878 and the construction of the Murrumbidgee River Railway Bridge in 1881 allowed the line <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> past Wagga Wagga to Henty and Albury later that year. A branch line was constructed to Temora in 1893 and extended to Barellan in 1908, Griffith in 1916 and Hillston in 1923. Further south, a branch line was completed from Junee to Narrandera in 1881 and extended to Hay by 1882. Another branch pushed south from Narrandera toward the Victorian border reaching Jerilderie in 1884 and the Murray at Tocumwal in 1898.|$|E
