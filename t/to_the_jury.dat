Mr Gurney addressed the jury, explaining {{the circumstances of the}} disturbances carried out by the mob in Ely. Nine witnesses were called. Mr Justice Abbott spoke <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> for a long time. The jury retired for fifteen minutes. On returning, it pronounced as guilty Dennis, Jessop, Atkin, Layton, Hobbs, Pricke, Cooper, and Jefferson. It acquitted Freeman.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|E

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|Richard Ferguson QC, for the defence, {{argued that}} the ESDA test, which {{suggested}} that the disputed words had {{been added to the}} notes later, was not reliable. The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries, seven of them excerpts from Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry and seven from the original investigation in 1985, the latter read out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> as statements H to N. One of the 1985 statements said that Silcott had been carrying a knife with a two-foot-long blade {{on the night of the}} murder, and that he had attacked Blakelock.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{that the case}} in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E
5000|$|In English law, {{a special}} verdict is a verdict {{by a jury}} that makes {{specific}} factual conclusions rather than (or in addition <b>to)</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> declaration of guilt or liability.

5|$|Judicial oratory {{had become}} a {{significant}} literary genre by {{the second half of}} the fifth century, as represented in the speeches of Demosthenes' predecessors, Antiphon and Andocides. Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely on questions of probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches.* H. Yunis, Demosthenes: On The Crown, 263 (note 275).|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening {{statement}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she attempted to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E
5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E

5|$|The {{defendants}} argued: (1) {{that the}} indictment {{should have been}} quashed because {{of the absence of}} women from the grand jury; (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court; (3) that the indictment was duplicitous, inconsistent, and vague; (4) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (5) that the trial judge should have granted a continuance, rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske; (6) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants; (7) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay; (7) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> during its deliberations; (8) that Glasser had been cross-examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination; (9) that the cross-examination of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted; (10) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced; (11) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske; (12) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted; (13) that the admission of various prejudicial evidence had the cumulative effect of denying the defendants a fair trial; (14) that the trial judge's cross-examination of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy; and (15) that the trial judge should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women from the jury pool.|$|E

40|$|Despite <b>the</b> early American <b>jury’s</b> near-mythical {{role as a}} {{check on}} {{overreaching}} government agents, <b>the</b> contemporary <b>jury’s</b> role in constitutional adjudication remains opaque.

Should <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> apply constitutional doctrine in civil rights suits against government officers? Should courts of appeals defer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> application of constitutional law, or review it de novo?This Article offers the first holistic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> role in constitutional adjudication. It argues that the Constitution’s text, history, and structure strongly support <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> authority <b>to</b> apply constitutional law <b>to</b> <b>the</b> facts of a case and offer solid, though mixed, support for the longstanding doctrine against <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> right <b>to</b> nullify statutes {{on the basis of}} its own constitutional view. The Article furthermore makes a case for <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> unique “constitutional competence. ” Composed of a diverse group of lay people, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> brings popular values <b>to</b> bear on <b>the</b> application of constitutional law. By deferring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> reasonable constitutional judgments, courts make room for popular constitutional norms on a case-by-case basis without forgoing <b>the</b> responsibility <b>to</b> “say what <b>the</b> law is. ” The resulting constitutional construction is a middle ground between judicial supremacy and judicial abnegation that promises a more symbolically and substantively democratic constitutional law...|$|R
