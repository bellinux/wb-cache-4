25|$|Potato Dumpling Soup (Iron Chef Komei Nakamura), {{the smell}} of foie gras killed the aroma of <b>the</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> nobody was able to finish it. Both chefs in that match reached a no-decision, {{therefore}} the match was restarted.|$|E
25|$|Pesticides can {{be created}} that are {{targeted}} to a specific pest's lifecycle, which can be environmentally more friendly. For example, potato cyst nematodes emerge from their protective cysts {{in response to a}} chemical excreted by potatoes; they feed on <b>the</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> damage the crop. A similar chemical can be applied to fields early, before the potatoes are planted, causing the nematodes to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes.|$|E

60|$|They {{who were}} in the south of Ireland during the winter of 1846-47 will not readily forget the agony of that period.

60|$|Now you can {{understand}} their indignation when, one blowy July afternoon, as they were going up for a potato-roast, they saw somebody moving among the trees.

60|$|And {{presently}} he too {{was going}} out {{into a world of}} change and wonder, bowed beneath a load of potatoes and patriotic insecurity, that merged at last into a very definite irritation at the weight and want of style of <b>the</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> a very clear conception of the entire detestableness of Jessica.|$|E
60|$|Walter ate <b>the</b> <b>potatoes,</b> <b>and</b> {{drank the}} warm mixture.

25|$|Many berries are edible, but others, such as {{the fruits}} of <b>the</b> <b>potato</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> deadly nightshade, are {{poisonous}} to humans. Some berries, {{such as the}} white and red mulberry, are poisonous when unripe, but are edible in their ripe form.|$|R
60|$|Potatoes were seized, cut in halves, sopped in gravy, {{and taken}} one, two! Corn cakes went into great jaws like coal into a steam engine. Knives {{in the right}} hand cut and scooped gravy up. Great, muscular, grimy, but {{wholesome}} fellows they were, feeding like ancient Norse, and capable of working like demons. They were deep in the process; half-hidden by steam from <b>the</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> stew, in less than sixty seconds from their entrance.|$|E
60|$|Though the Bishop was warm, {{the poor}} swollen {{hands of the}} old woman were already {{cramping}} with the cold; and before we left her, the Bishop had built the fire, while I had peeled <b>the</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> put them on to boil.

6000|$|In 1871 I {{received}} a letter from Mr. Merrick, of Boston, U.S.A., who states that, [...] "Mr. Fearing Burr, a very careful experimenter and author of a much valued book, 'The Garden Vegetables of America' has succeeded in producing distinctly mottled and most curious potatoes--evidently graft-hybrids, by inserting eyes from blue or red potatoes into the substance of white ones, after removing the eyes of the latter.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>potato</b> aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) lays its eggs on weeds {{where they}} overwinter.

60|$|The lamp Rose lighted showed comfortless rooms, {{with but}} few {{articles}} of furniture.

Then presently she called her father to the meal. He ate in silence, having relapsed once more into the dull gloom natural to him. When he had finished he took up his hat and with slow steps left the room.|$|E
