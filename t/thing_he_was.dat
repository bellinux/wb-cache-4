25|$|As {{early as}} 1910, Foster {{started talking about}} {{reviving}} {{the concept of an}} all-black league. The one <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> insistent upon was that black teams should be owned by black men. This put him in direct competition with Strong. After 1910, Foster renamed his team the Chicago American Giants to appeal to a larger fan base. During the same year, J. L. Wilkinson started the All Nations traveling team. The All Nations team would eventually become one of the best-known and popular teams of the Negro leagues, the Kansas City Monarchs.|$|E

Kohta provides long-range cover when Takashi rescues Alice Maresato from approaching zombies after Alice's father is killed. At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses saying this is the one <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> good at and that he wants to protect Saya. The rest of the group, including Saya, support him.|$|E
500|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham, Surrey, to a prosperous Victorian family. He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, née Lea (1860–1940). The couple's {{youngest}} son, Clifford Lea Bax, became a playwright and essayist. Alfred Bax was a barrister of the Middle Temple, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead. Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country, the large gardens of the family house were the next best <b>thing.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a musical child: [...] "I cannot remember the long-lost day when I was unable to play the piano – inaccurately".|$|E
500|$|In April 1996, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco {{ruled that}} state trial judge Ito {{had given the}} jury faulty {{instructions}} [...] about the law regarding fraud.

Keating was freed after 4½ years in prison; he later said that staying tough during his incarceration was the <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> proudest of.

Quagmire and Brian are the final two contestants on The Bachelorette. Brooke's visits to the Griffin house is catastrophic, but not nearly as bad as the dinner she had with Quagmire and his mom. Brian wins her heart and the final rose, but when the cameras are turned off, Brooke tells Brian that it was nice [...] "working with him", and it is {{apparent}} that the show really is scripted, as Brian thought. Brian quickly becomes obsessed with Brooke and leaves several messages on her answering machine, even though she never gets back to him. Brooke gets angry at Brian for stalking her and throws her telephone at him when he attempts to serenade her outside her apartment. Brian is upset that he became the very <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mocking in the beginning.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 1960 {{the second}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened. As Hoxha recalled, [...] "In his speech Khrushchev {{expressed}} the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, {{as well as}} those who were going to follow these parties, but without mentioning any names... wanted to keep all the communist and workers' parties of the world under his conductor's baton, under his dictate." [...] On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which [...] "showed that no compromise between them was possible." [...] During the meeting Hoxha noted that [...] " [...] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." [...] Khrushchev replied, [...] "If our ambassador said such a <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> foolish." [...] Hoxha in turn replied, [...] "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." [...] The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base, which was the subject of a Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, [...] "We can dismantle the base if you like." [...] Hoxha replied, [...] "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." [...] As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, [...] "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." [...] The meeting ended after Kapo declared, [...] "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2013's Gangster Squad, a crime thriller, Gosling portrayed Sgt. Jerry Wooters, a 1940s LAPD {{officer who}} {{attempts}} to outsmart mob boss Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn). He was reunited with Emma Stone as his love interest, after their earlier pairing in Crazy, Stupid Love. Stone {{has said she}} hopes they will find more projects to work together on. A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film {{as an excuse for}} the cast [...] "to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing whatever sense of nuance they might possess." [...] Christy Lemire of the Boston Globe criticized Gosling's [...] "weird, whispery voice" [...] and his [...] "barely developed, one-note" [...] character. However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that there was [...] "a seductive power" [...] in the scenes shared by Gosling and Stone: [...] "But like too much else in the film, it's a scenario that is only half played out." [...] In The Place Beyond the Pines, a generational drama directed by Blue Valentines Derek Cianfrance, Gosling portrayed Luke, a motorcycle stunt rider who robs banks to provide for his family. The shoot was described by Gosling as [...] "the best experience I have ever had making a film." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times praised the performance: [...] "Mr. Gosling’s cool self-possession— the only <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> allowed to display in “Drive”— is complicated, made interesting, by hints of childlike innocence and vulnerability." [...] Scott Foundas of The Village Voice was unimpressed: [...] "Gosling's character verges on parody ... Gosling uses a soft, wounded half-whisper that tells us this is all some kind of put-on ... It's a close variation on the role Gosling played to stronger effect in Nicolas Winding Refn's existential Hollywood thriller, Drive, where it was clear the character was meant to be an abstraction." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker remarked that he [...] "reprises his inexorable-loner routine". The film has grossed $35 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.|$|E

[...] Beginning in June 2011, the show created a long-running gag that involved Colbert starting his own actual super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow, described by the character as [...] "100 percent legal and at least 10 percent ethical." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Phillip Gerard's {{appearance in the}} pilot episode was only originally {{intended to be a}} [...] "kind of homage to The Fugitive. The only <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gonna do was be in this elevator and walk out," [...] according to David Lynch. However, when Lynch wrote the [...] "Fire walk with me" [...] speech, he imagined Al Strobel, who played Gerard, reciting it {{in the basement of the}} Twin Peaks hospital—a scene that appeared in the European version of the pilot episode, and surfaced later in Agent Cooper's dream sequence. Gerard's full name, Phillip Michael Gerard, is also a reference to Lieutenant Phillip Gerard, a character in The Fugitive. Lynch met Michael J. Anderson in 1987. After seeing him in a short film, Lynch wanted to cast the actor in the title role in Ronnie Rocket, but that project failed to get made.|$|E
2500|$|Friday the 13th was Nelson's {{first feature}} film, {{and when he}} went in for his first {{audition}} the only <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize {{what was going on}} until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, [...] "It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it." [...] Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from polio, and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular. Ned is believed to have given birth to the [...] "practical joker victim" [...] of horror films. According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in John Carpenter's Halloween, or Bob Clark's Black Christmas before that. He served {{as a model for the}} slasher films that would follow Friday the 13th.|$|E
