5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E

5|$|On October 19, <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company {{was about}} 110 miles (177 km) further east, making its last {{crossing}} of the North Platte River near present-day Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after completing the crossing, the blizzard struck. Many members of the company suffered from hypothermia or frostbite after wading through the frigid river. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unable to continue forward through the snow. Meanwhile, the original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at Devil's Gate, {{where they had been}} instructed to wait {{for the rest of the}} rescue party if they had not found <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company. When the main rescue party rejoined them, another scouting party consisting of Joseph Young, Abel Garr, and Daniel Webster Jones was sent forward. <b>The</b> <b>Martin</b> company remained in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts finally arrived on October 28. By the time the scouts arrived, 56 members of the company had died. The scouts urged the emigrants to begin moving again. Three days later the main rescue party met <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies and helped them on to Devil's Gate.|$|E
5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage {{carried in the}} wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company so the wagons {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate.|$|E

5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with sand <b>martins</b> of <b>the</b> genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than <b>the</b> sand <b>martin</b> and brown-throated sand <b>martin,</b> and have <b>the</b> white tail spots which are absent from <b>the</b> Riparia <b>martins.</b> Where <b>the</b> ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, <b>the</b> Eurasian crag <b>martin</b> is darker, browner and 15% larger than <b>the</b> rock <b>martin,</b> and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than <b>the</b> dusky crag <b>martin.</b> <b>The</b> white tail spots of <b>the</b> Eurasian crag <b>martin</b> are significantly larger than those of both its relatives. In the east of its range, <b>the</b> rock <b>martin</b> always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than <b>the</b> dusky crag <b>martin.</b>|$|R
5|$|In April 1949, Northwest Airlines {{sued the}} Glenn L. Martin Company, {{manufacturers}} of <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> 2-0-2, for $725,000.

Glenn Martin, president of the aircraft manufacturing corporation, dismissed the lawsuit as a mere formality, a bit of meaningless legal maneuvering to appease disagreeing insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|In early October the two {{companies}} reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. The companies had to cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. To lighten their loads, <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.|$|E

Soon afterward, <b>the</b> <b>Martins</b> moved to Northern Quebec. <b>The</b> <b>Martins</b> were killed in an accident several years later and Jean-Paul was placed in a foster home, unaware that he had a sister.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, {{the company}} met {{to debate the}} wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were {{unfamiliar}} with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and Church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women and young children would lead to suffering, sickness and even death. All of the other Church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, {{perhaps as many as}} 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> Company.|$|E

5|$|The Mascarene {{martin has}} a heavy flight with slow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides, and may repeatedly {{return to a}} favourite perch.

Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds, such as blue-cheeked bee-eaters in the Seychelles.|$|E

5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> winery estate. <b>The</b> <b>Martin</b> family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned <b>the</b> <b>Martin</b> family, but they claimed the girls had left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.|$|E

Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Martín</b> Fierro, the Clarín awards do not distinguish between lead and supporting actors.
