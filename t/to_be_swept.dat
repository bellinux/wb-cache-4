5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Belgrade on 11 October and the initial {{clearance}} of mines and other obstacles, the flotilla sailed downstream to Orșova near the Hungarian–Romanian border {{and waited for the}} lower Danube <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> for mines. Commencing on 30 October 1915, they escorted a series of munitions convoys down the Danube to Lom where the munitions were transferred to the Bulgarian railway system for shipment to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|The dam catalyzed {{improved}} upstream {{wastewater treatment}} around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007 more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84million tonnes per day, 65% {{of the total}} need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5tonnes of solid waste every day. Over onebillion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which was more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.|$|E
5|$|The {{makeshift}} raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, {{while the men}} are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.|$|E
5|$|More of {{a concern}} to Dracula's planners, however, were the {{land-based}} threats to the landing craft carrying the assault troops of 26th Indian Division. Air support was deemed to be vital to the operation's success, {{and a number of}} Japanese airfields around Toungoo were captured {{in the days leading up}} to Dracula. There was also the problem of the defences in and around the River Rangoon, up which the landing craft were to sail. The river itself was heavily mined, a result of Japanese defensive measures as well as RAF offensive operations earlier in the conflict, and it would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> and cleared of mines before any amphibious assault could take place. Before this could occur, however, the coastal defences along the banks of the river would have to be neutralized; a particular worry was the presence of an artillery battery at Elephant Point on the west bank of the river. The geography of the area ensured that the battery could not be destroyed through artillery bombardment or airstrikes, and weather conditions precluded an early amphibious assault. As such, it was decided that a day before Dracula began on 2 May, a parachute battalion would be dropped near Elephant Point with the task of assaulting and destroying the battery.|$|E

25|$|After {{losing to}} the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS, the Red Sox debuted new road uniforms similar to their old 1986 road uniforms. The {{following}} offseason had the Red Sox sign Rocco Baldelli, John Smoltz, and Brad Penny. The Red Sox saw a postseason berth via the winning of the AL Wild Card, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> away {{in the first round}} by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.|$|E

25|$|It is {{very hard}} to come up with another process that would produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after {{no more than a few}} minutes. It would also be necessary for the deuterium <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> away before it reoccurs.|$|E
25|$|At about 11 h. 30 m. pm {{the four}} divisions, who {{had crossed the}} Channel tied together, put off from the Medusa in good order, but they lost touch with each other because of the {{darkness}} of the moonless night. The tidal current and the half-tide separated them further, causing Robert Jones’s division <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> past the French vessels and saw no action. The other three divisions attacked different parts of the French line separately and at different times.|$|E

25|$|Entering {{the playoffs}} as the seventh seed and matched with the {{defending}} champion Boston Celtics, critics and observers expected the Bulls <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept.</b> However, in a series that featured the scoring exploits of Gordon (42 points in game 2) and Ray Allen (51 points in game 6), as well as five games decided by a single basket, the Bulls pushed the series to seven games before finally losing. Gordon led the Bulls in scoring for the season and playoffs, averaging 20.7 and 24.3 points respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} trade and wealth in the colonies caused {{increasing}} political tensions as frustration grew with the improving but still restrictive trade with Spain. Malaspina's recommendation to turn the empire into a looser confederation to help improve governance and trade so as to quell the growing political tensions between the élites of the empire's periphery and centre was suppressed by a monarchy afraid of losing control. All was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> away by the tumult that was to overtake Europe {{at the turn of}} the 19th century with the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
25|$|That morning, an {{estimated}} 20 to 30 {{feet of water}} rushed {{down from the top}} of North Ponil Canyon moving towards the campsite of Crew 380 in the camp Indian Writings, causing four members of the crew, including Alden Brock, the ranger assisting the crew, and two other youth Scouts, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> away from their campsite by the flood at approximately 4:30 AM. Staff at Philmont were able to quickly locate and retrieve the two other Scouts and the ranger alive, but were unable to find Alden. The entire campsite in which Crew 380 was situated was washed away.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the event, it is hard to {{determine}} if limnic eruptions have happened elsewhere. A third lake, Lake Kivu, exists on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and contains massive amounts of dissolved CO2. Sample sediments from the lake were taken by professor Robert Hecky from the University of Michigan, which showed that an event caused living creatures in the lake to go extinct approximately every thousand years, and caused nearby vegetation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> back into the lake. Limnic eruptions can be measured on a scale using the concentration of CO2 in the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Borough {{bridge and}} Corporation Street, which crosses it, {{were laid out}} {{as part of the}} same development, and named to {{celebrate}} the incorporation of Sheffield as a borough. Samual Worth and Samual Furness Holmes were responsible for its design, and the foundation stone carries the date 12 March 1853. The bridge is built of stone, has three segmental arches, and was completed in 1856. It is a grade II listed structure. During the Great Flood, large quantities of debris built up behind it, and then caused the iron bridge below it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> away. Corporation Street is now part of the A61, and the bridge forms {{the west side of the}} inner relief road roundabout.|$|E
25|$|Quadrupole mass analyzers use {{oscillating}} electrical {{fields to}} selectively stabilize or destabilize {{the paths of}} ions passing through a radio frequency (RF) quadrupole field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow {{a wide range of}} m/z values <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>swept</b> rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the quadrupole ion trap, particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.|$|E
