5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E
5|$|The festive {{kindling}} of the badnjak commemorates {{the fire}} that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem {{built in the}} cave where Jesus Christ was born, to warm the Baby Jesus and his mother throughout the night. The badnjak may {{also be seen as}} a symbol of the cross upon which Christ was crucified, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other South Slavic peoples have similar traditions, and the custom <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.|$|E

25|$|The {{society in}} which Christianity {{expanded}} was one in which abortion, infanticide and exposition were commonly used {{to limit the number}} of children (especially girls) <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> had to support. These methods were often used also when a pregnancy or birth resulted from sexual licentiousness, including marital infidelity, prostitution and incest, and Bakke holds that these contexts cannot be separated from abortion in early Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Parents {{and family}} members are {{frequently}} stressed by a child's bedwetting. Soiled linens and clothing cause additional laundry. Wetting episodes can cause lost sleep if the child wakes and/or cries, waking the parents.

25|$|The {{first three}} people accused and arrested for {{allegedly}} afflicting Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, 12-year-old Ann Putnam, Jr., and Elizabeth Hubbard, were Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba. Some historians {{believe that the}} accusation by Ann Putnam Jr. suggests <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> feud {{may have been a}} major cause of the witch trials. At the time, a vicious rivalry was underway between the Putnam and Porter families, one which deeply polarized the people of Salem. Citizens would often have heated debates, which escalated into full-fledged fighting, based solely on their opinion of the feud.|$|E
25|$|George Orwell {{tried his}} hand at hop-picking at Blest's Farm, somewhere near West Malling, in September 1931, {{travelling}} down from London disguised as a tramp. He spent his time living in a Hopper Hut made of tin (corrugated iron), thus discovering that fruit and hop picking was not quite the idyllic life described by many scholars and writers of the time. Orwell earned 9/- in a week, and observed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of gypsies who had picked every year since birth earned 14/- each.

It’s Elementary—Talking About Gay Issues in School (1996) illuminates how all young people are affected by anti-gay stigma, and has helped schools all over the world address anti-gay prejudice in the classroom 71. <b>That’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>Family!</b> (2000) highlights <b>a</b> wide range of family structures such as multiracial families, families with same-sex parents, and single parent families 7. This film examines diversity from a child’s perspective and was screened at the White House to an audience of more than 100 leaders of national children's, family, education and civil rights organizations in December 2000 18. <b>That’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>Family!</b> has been widely praised by those supporting its role in diversity education but also widely attacked by conservative organizations that consider it to be gay propaganda and inappropriate for a young audience 5. Let’s Get Real (2003) is an exploration of bullying in middle schools released in 2003 7. It’s STILL Elementary (2007) considers the effects and political history of It’s Elementary 7.

25|$|Two weirs {{impede the}} flow of the river at Durham, both {{originally}} created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring sea trout and salmon, and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994, it may not be surprising <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).|$|E

25|$|Forced begging is a {{profitable}} practice in which exploiters {{are motivated by}} economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked {{for the purpose of}} begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise. In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer. Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary. Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing capabilities. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families. UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.|$|E

When Leslie goes to city planner Mark (Paul Schneider) to vent about her situation and seek help, she is stunned to learn that he has taken a buyout and plans to join a construction company, partially in response to Ann (Rashida Jones) having broken up with him; she angrily calls him [...] "Mark Brendana-Quits". Meanwhile, Ann is struggling with her redeveloping feelings for her ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt). Later, Ann suggests to Leslie she should hold the concert at Lot 48, as it is not a park and therefore not shut down. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy finally reveal their feelings to each other, but April still rejects him, believing Andy still has feelings for Ann.|$|E

500|$|The custom <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> solemnly {{brings a}} log {{into the house}} and lights it on the hearth on Christmas Eve has been {{recorded}} in various parts of Europe. In England, a Yule log used to be festively kindled on the domestic hearth so [...] "that sweet luck may come while the log is a-teending", as described by 17th-century poet Robert Herrick. In France, the log had different regional names: chalendal, calignaou, tréfoir, and tréfouet. In Provence, it had to be cut from a fruit tree; it was brought in by the whole family while they sang a carol praying for blessing on the house, that the women might bear children, the nanny-goats kids, and the ewes lambs, and that their grain and wine might abound. Before the log was placed on the fire, the youngest child in the family poured wine on it. Logs were devotionally laid on the domestic fire on Christmas Eve in various parts of Italy; in Tuscany, Christmas is called Festa di Ceppo, literally [...] "feast of log". In the Val di Chiana, the children of the family were blindfolded and commanded to beat the burning log with tongs. Traces of Christmas-log customs can also be found in Germany and Scandinavia. In Thuringia the family placed a Christklotz (Christ log) on the fire before going to bed, so that it might burn all through the night.|$|E
500|$|In October 1861, Foraker {{left his}} parents' home {{to go to}} the county seat of Hillsboro where he was to live with his uncle, James Reece, auditor of Highland County, and work as a clerk in his office. [...] He was sent to replace his older brother, Burch, by then enlisted in the Union Army as the American Civil War was raging. [...] Foraker noted in his memoirs that while his time as auditor's clerk greatly {{improved}} his penmanship, it also brought him into contact with many county officials, teaching him how a government worked. [...] The young clerk was impressed by his brother's letters home, and was anxious to join the army despite his youth. [...] Soon after his 16th birthday, Joseph Foraker learned <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> friend was organizing a volunteer company, and sought to enlist. [...] His uncle gave reluctant consent, and on July 14, 1862, Foraker was mustered in Company [...] "A", 89th Ohio Volunteer Infantry; in late August, after training, he became second sergeant. [...] With Confederate forces moving through Kentucky and threatening Cincinnati, the 89th was hurried into defenses set up across the Ohio River in Newport, Kentucky. [...] The Confederates did not reach the Ohio, having been forced back well to the south, and the 89th moved to Fort Shaler, near Newport. [...] While Foraker was at Fort Shaler, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation; Foraker recounted in his memoirs that he and his comrades felt that the proclamation meant that they were fighting for the end of slavery, not just to preserve the Union.|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{praised the}} film with the {{following}} statement, [...] "Two years ago, Walt Disney Pictures reinvented the animated feature, not only {{with an eye toward}} pleasing children, but also with an older, savvier audience in mind. Disney truly bridged a generation gap with The Little Mermaid... Now, lightning has definitely struck twice with Beauty and the Beast." [...] Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers, musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> audience deserves great entertainment, too." [...] In 2001 Ebert again gave the IMAX re-release a full 4 out of 4 stars. James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as [...] "the finest animated movie ever made", writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly-perfect mix of romance, music, invention, and animation." [...] The use of computer animation, particularly in the ballroom sequence, was singled out in several reviews as one of the film's highlights. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling the film [...] "A delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents..... But the film has little of the technical facility, vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past." ...|$|E
