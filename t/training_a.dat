5|$|In November 2013, UNSOA (United Nations Support Office for AMISOM) was {{required}} by the UNSC to support the SNA across South Central Somalia. Their mandate consisted in consolidating and <b>training</b> <b>a</b> force of 10,900 Somalis, officially to fight al Shabab forces. The SNA force would initially be trained by the AMISOM contingents. On the passing of specific UN requirements, designated SNA battalions would then participate in joint operations with AMISOM. UNSOA's support during the period comprised food supplements, shelter, fuel, water and medical support.|$|E
5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with <b>{{training}}.</b> <b>A</b> Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, {{it tends to be}} highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.|$|E

5|$|Other {{problems}} faced by the ZNG included a shortage of trained officers, inadequate troop <b>training,</b> <b>a</b> shortage of weapons and especially a shortage of ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in civilian clothes. The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifty years the {{division}} would see numerous changes to its structure as its training roles changed and subordinate units shifted {{in and out}} of its command.

5|$|A {{number of}} outside donor {{countries}} are also carrying out separate training programmes for {{various parts of}} the Forces du Terrestres (Land Forces). The People's Republic of China has trained Congolese troops at Kamina in Katanga from at least 2004 to 2009, and the Belgian government is training at least one 'rapid reaction' battalion. When Kabila visited U.S. President George W. Bush in Washington D.C., he also asked the U.S. Government to train a battalion, and as a result, a private contractor, Protection Strategies Incorporated, started <b>training</b> <b>a</b> FARDC battalion at Camp Base, Kisangani, in February 2010. The company is being supervised by Special Operations Command-Africa Command. The various international training programmes are not well integrated.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force in November 1941 in the artillery. He was sent to Warwick Farm, then on the western {{outskirts}} of Sydney, for <b>training.</b> <b>A</b> non-conformist known for being forthright, Fingleton did not enjoy military discipline. In May 1942, he went AWOL from his post at Double Bay {{on the shores of}} Sydney Harbour to visit his wife. As a result, he was missing when a Japanese midget submarine launched an attack in the harbour. Soon after, he was deployed to Townsville in northern Queensland in anticipation of a Japanese land invasion, which never materialised. He was then transferred to the Press Relations unit. There he did work in intelligence analysis and censorship.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, Amador Valley offered its 2,500students 20Advanced Placement courses, 23varsity sports, {{a program}} to study local aquatic wildlife, and {{vocational}} <b>training.</b> <b>A</b> monthly school publication, the Amadon, reports on athletics, academic and extracurricular issues, and news {{of the school and}} community.

The Amador Theater has remained a part of the Amador Valley campus since the 1930s, despite major school construction in 1968, 1997, and 2004. Amador is the rival of Foothill High School, across town.|$|E
5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men {{had been}} returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in <b>training.</b> <b>A</b> further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing their course.|$|E

5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical <b>training</b> <b>a</b> half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require <b>training).</b> <b>A</b> single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E

5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and anti-armour weapon. However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy and awkward to manhandle, particularly over rough ground and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high curved trajectory, making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for <b>training,</b> <b>a</b> problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Vijayanagara empire {{maintained}} the well-functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms, to govern their territories and made changes only where necessary. The King was the ultimate authority, assisted by a cabinet of ministers (Pradhana) headed by the prime minister (Mahapradhana). Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary (Karyakartha or Rayaswami) and the imperial officers (Adhikari). All high-ranking ministers and officers were required to have military <b>training.</b> <b>A</b> secretariat near the king's palace employed scribes and officers to maintain records made official by using a wax seal imprinted with the ring of the king. At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords (Goudas) supervised accountants (Karanikas or Karnam) and guards (Kavalu). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments (Niyogas), each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{returned}} with The Hawk Is Dying (2007), also starring Michael Pitt. It {{tells the story}} of George (played by Paul Giamatti), trying to find meaning in his life by <b>training</b> <b>a</b> wild red-tailed hawk. Williams portrayed Pitt's girlfriend, the only person who understands George's growing obsession. The film earned $7,000 domestically playing at one theater. Five months after giving birth, Williams was back, appearing in The Hottest State, a film by Ethan Hawke, adapted from his 1996 book. Critics panned it for being too pretentious and self-aware. Variety writer Leslie Felperin believed the film underused Williams as a former lover of one of the main characters. It did a limited theatrical run beginning August 24, ultimately grossing $137,340. Williams played Edie Sedgwick, muse of Andy Warhol, {{as a part of the}} biographical ensemble piece I'm Not There, inspired by the musician Bob Dylan.|$|E
