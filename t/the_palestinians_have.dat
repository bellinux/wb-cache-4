25|$|Due to {{the first}} Arab-Israeli war, a {{significant}} number of Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes inside what is now Israel. These refugees numbered approximately 711,000 to 725,000 at the time. Today, they and their descendants number about four million, comprising about half the Palestinian people. Since that time, <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> demanded full implementation of the right of return, meaning that each refugee would be granted the option of returning to his or her home, with property restored, and receive compensation. Israelis asserted that allowing a right of return to Israel proper, rather than to the newly created Palestinian state, would mean an influx of Palestinians that would fundamentally alter the demographics of Israel, jeopardizing Israel's Jewish character and its existence as a whole.|$|E

2500|$|Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak {{said the}} speech was [...] "direct, {{significant}} and brave appeal in which President Obama elucidated his vision and important universal principles, which he wishes {{to share with the}} Muslim world".

The idea of peace was born in the Middle East as the basis of the three monotheistic religions – Christianity, Judaism and Islam – and the sons of Abraham must join hands in order to take on this challenge together, a sustainable peace in the Middle East." [...] Other government officials criticized the speech for what they saw as glossing over Palestinian terrorism.

2500|$|Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu {{responded to}} the debate, in {{particular}} Abbas' speech, in saying: [...] "The world watched a defamatory and venomous speech that was full of mendacious propaganda against the Israel Defense Forces and the citizens of Israel.

By going to the U.N., <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>have</b> violated the agreements with Israel and Israel will act accordingly." [...] Israeli critics of the resolution, said it enshrined the principle of a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 borders, a position rejected by the Israeli government, while upholding the Palestinian claim for refugees' right of return. An unnamed official said: [...] "They got a state without end of conflict. This sets new terms of reference that will never allow negotiations to start.

[...] The church responded to criticism by saying that [...] "The Church has never and is not now denying Israel's right to exist; on the contrary, it is questioning the policies that continue to keep peace a dream in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This report is against the injustices levelled against the Palestinian people and how land is shared.
