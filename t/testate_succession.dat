50|$|The law of {{succession}} comprises two branches, namely the common law {{of succession}} and the customary {{law of succession}}. These enjoy equal status and {{are subject to the}} Constitution of South Africa and other legislation. The common law of succession is divided into the <b>testate</b> law of <b>succession</b> and the intestate law of succession, whereas the customary law of succession only operates intestate.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the time}} of Bracton, despite the {{generality}} of the writ, the bailor of a chattel could only bring this action against the bailee of the chattel, or those who represent the bailee by <b>testate</b> or intestate <b>succession.</b> Only two actions were available. The plaintiff could claim, [...] "I lost the goods and you found them."; or [...] "I bailed the chattel to you." [...] The first of these was called detinue sur trover.|$|R
50|$|Where the {{deceased}} dies leaving a valid will, {{the rules of}} <b>testate</b> <b>succession</b> apply. These are derived from common law and the Wills Act. <b>Testate</b> <b>succession</b> is governed by the general premise that the assets of {{the deceased}} are distributed in accordance with the provisions of the will. If specified property is left to a person, the disposition is termed a “legacy.” Legacies are distributed first; any residue in the estate is given to the person, if any, who is appointed as heir. If the will appoints more than one heir, the residue is divided among them.|$|E
50|$|Legatees are {{beneficiaries}} in <b>testate</b> <b>succession</b> only. They inherit {{a specific}} or determinable asset (like a car) or a specified {{amount of money}} (exactly R10,000, for example). A legatee may be nominated only in a will or in an ante-nuptial contract. It is not possible for legatees to exist where the deceased died intestate.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a valid will which sets out {{the wishes of the}} testator, the estate is {{administered}} in terms of the law of <b>testate</b> <b>succession.</b> A will is a unilateral declaration regarding how the estate is to be apportioned. A person may make also bequests in terms of an ante-nuptial contract. Both natural and juristic persons may be beneficiaries in terms of a will.|$|E

50|$|Customary {{law does}} not have a similar fiction, but some {{communities}} have customs that are meant to produce heirs for a husband after his death. Ukungena, for example, is a custom which expects a widow to marry one of her husband’s brothers after his death. If a man dies childless, the custom of ukungena allows for the continuation of his family line. Another custom, ukuvusa, allows for the natural heir of the deceased (for example, his brother) to take the deceased’s property and then to take a wife who will be regarded as the deceased’s wife and whose children will be known as the deceased’s children. It is, however, difficult to determine to what extent these customs are still followed by indigenous communities. In addition, the nasciturus fiction has been codified in the <b>testate</b> law of <b>succession</b> by section 2D(l)(c) of the Wills Act, which provides that any benefit allocated to the children of a deceased shall vest in such children as are alive {{at the time of the}} devolution of the benefit, or as have already been conceived at the time of the devolution of the benefit and who are later born alive.|$|R
40|$|Heterotrophic {{protozoa}} have {{a global}} distribution in terrestrial habitats. The functional groups significantly represented are zooflagellates, cillates, gymnamoebae and testate amoebae. Their range extends into the Antarctic zone, but the species {{richness of the}} communities is rarely of the same order of magnitude as those in temperate latitudes. Species diversity is usually very low owing to dominance of the communities by single, or a few, species which are best adapted to the Antarctic terrestrial environment. This is characterized by seasonal, diurnal or unpredictable fluctuations in moisture, temperature and bacterial food supply of high amplitude. The fauna shows pauperization with latitude and climatic severity. Nearly all records of species distribution {{are consistent with the}} model that community composition is determined by local conditions. An important exception is the distribution of the testate amoeba genus Nebela whose species distribution is influenced by biogeographical factors. Successional changes in community composition in fellfield habitats are characterized by the sequence: pioneer microflagellate colonizers, larger flagellates and small ciliates, and finally <b>testate</b> amoebae. The <b>succession</b> is most closely correlated with the accumulation of organic matter. A model of the strategies of dominant microflagellate species can be constructed by ordinating them on a two-dimensional habitat template of A-r-K selection continuum. The globally ubiquitous microflagellate Heteromita globosa emerges as the most strongly A-selected and K-selected. The occurrence of terrestrial protozoa near their latitudinal limits of distribution can serve as sensitive indicators of the biological effects of climatic change. Having short generation times and effective means of cyst dispersal, changes in the gross distribution can provide rapid warning of critical changes in thermal regimes...|$|R

On somebody's decease there is come to gaining inheritance in the same point. The inheritance proceedings begin ex offo subsequently. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse the institution of <b>testate</b> <b>succession.</b> Actually there are two possibilities of inheritance succession. The first is an intestate succession and the alternative is constituted by a <b>testate</b> <b>succession.</b> Although in the Civil Code there is mentioned the intestate succession in the first place, <b>testate</b> <b>succession</b> holds the first position in practice. In fact legal heirs succeed if a deceased doesn't leave any testament. The exception is represented by forced heirs. The legal grounds to the testamentary succession there is a testament, sometimes called a will of deceased, too. It is necessary to write a testament in compliance with provisions of the Civil Code to be valid. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of <b>testate</b> <b>succession.</b> Chapter One is introductory and there is also explained the historical context of <b>testate</b> <b>succession.</b> Chapter Two is named "Preconditions {{of succession}}", at first it defines basic terminology used in the thesis, for example the subjective {{law of succession}} and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{critically}} analyses the English {{choice of}} law rules for testamentary trusts. After outlining the research context (Chapter 1), the key concepts and terms for testamentary trusts in cross-border estates are introduced (Chapter 2). The dual system of {{choice of law}} rules (one for <b>testate</b> <b>succession</b> {{and the other for}} the trust) are discussed with reference to reads 'rocket and rocket-launcher' illustration that has been favoured by legislators and commentators alike. Thus, the current choice of law rules for <b>testate</b> <b>succession</b> matters are analysed in Chapter 3 and the choice of law rules for trusts are examined in Chapter 4. This leads to Chapter 5 concluding that the choice of law rules for the creation of testamentary trusts (the rocket-launching aspects) are particularly problematic. The discussion thereafter focuses on how the choice of law rules for the rocket-launching aspects of testamentary trusts could be improved with reference to the international and European reform attempts to legislate on succession and trusts, including the Hague Succession Convention and the European Succession Regulation (Chapter 6). Moreover, the limited UK reform attempts relevant to the choice of law rules for testamentary trusts are discussed in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 proposes recommendations for reform...|$|E
40|$|The law of {{succession}} is a branch of civil law that deals with devolution of property rights and duties of a decedent to his heirs. The new Civil Code that came into force in 2014 brought considerable changes {{in the field of}} the law {{of succession}}. Finally, the legal regulation pays proper attention to the {{law of succession}} and <b>testate</b> <b>succession.</b> After more than sixty years, there were restored legal institutions such as Clauses of lesser importance in a testament (condition, determination of time or a mandate), inheritance contract, privileged wills, legacy, vulgar substitution or fideicommissum. Not only because of these institutions can a testator finally organize freely and according to his own will his property situation mortis causa. The purpose of my diploma thesis is to analyze the <b>testate</b> <b>succession</b> according to the Czech Civil code that became effective on the 1 st of January 2014. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part is split into five chapters that deal with individual prerequisites of succession. The prerequisites of succession are as follows: the death of a testator, the existence of a decedent's estate, the capacity of an heir to inherit, the legal ground of succession and the acceptance/non-refusal of inheritance. Meeting all prerequisites of succession is crucial to [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The South African {{concept of}} freedom of testation {{is one of the}} most {{absolute}} concepts {{of freedom of}} testation in westernised legal systems. It is suggested that the South African concept of freedom of testation is a memento of capitalist patriarchy. As the South African legal system practices a nearly absolute concept of freedom of testation, capitalist patriarchy has maintained masculine control of property in South Africa and perpetuated the systems of male dominance prevalent in South Africa. Freedom of testation allows for wealth to pass from one male to another. It also allows entrenched gender roles to continue by excluding women from inheriting. Thus the South African law of <b>testate</b> <b>succession</b> and its central concept of freedom of testation allows for discrimination on the ground of gender. JurisprudenceLL. ...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates and {{analyzes}} the nature, content, character, scope of operation, and relationship, between Islamic and statutory Laws of <b>testate</b> <b>succession</b> {{with a view}} to demonstrating the implications for family and social stability in a Muslim society. It probes the awareness, perception, preferences and satisfaction of Muslim citizens in Zaria town (in Kaduna State of Nigeria) with the two laws. The research problem revolves around {{the relationship between the two}} bodies of law, what happens in case of conflict, and the citizen’s preferences in matters of succession. The study employs essentially doctrinal (review of statutory and case laws) methods supplemented by an empirical survey (interviews). Among the major findings is that the respondents prefer Islamic laws of succession and would prefer that it is given pre-eminence over statutory law. The paper recommends inter alia, that government should embark on a massive public awareness to sensitize citizens on rules of succession, even while retraining lower court judges for a better exercise of judicial discretion in succession matters...|$|E
40|$|The law of {{succession}} has been changed a lot by enacting the new Civil Code in many ways but its main purpose is still to regulate the succession of inheritance from testator to heirs and related problems. This thesis makes an analysis of <b>testate</b> <b>succession,</b> {{which is one of}} the three possibilities of inheritance succession. The second is an intestate succession, which applies in the situation, when testator did not wrote last will. The last possibility is a contract between testator and heirs distributing inheritance between the latter. This contract has bigger legal force than last will and intestate succession is used, if there is none of them. The thesis consists of five chapters. Chapter One provides a brief introduction to history of the law {{of succession}} in our territory and presents the purpose of the thesis. Chapter Two deals with the questions common to the whole {{law of succession}}, it is divided in three subchapters, which talk about the main principles of the law of succession and legal rules regulating it and also about preconditions of succession, which include death of testator, subjective law of succession, existence of inheritance and legal ground to the succession. It also names possibility of heirs to reject inheritance. Chapter Three is concerned with the main theme of the thesis, which is [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Freedom of testation is a {{foundational}} {{principle of}} South African <b>testate</b> <b>succession,</b> {{and there are}} relatively few restrictions on a testator’s sudden and impulsive change of heart. Two requirements need to be met, namely a person must have testamentary capacity and the prescribed formalities must be complied with. The requirement for testamentary capacity is assumed if one complies with the formalities. Testamentary capacity has a minimum age but is not restricted by old age. However, it calls for the testator to be of an unsound mind and therefore to have mental capacity {{at the time of}} executing a will. World statistics show that there is {{an increase in the number}} of older and often also wealthier people as modern research and medicine allow people to live longer and healthier lives, resulting in the increase in the average lifespan. Cognitive impairments such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease often arise with the elderly which have become more prevalent over the last 30 years. This article explores testamentary capacity of the elderly against the backdrop of cognitive impairments and the ability to accumulate wealth, which means that old people often have more assets that can devolve (often to their relatives) upon their demise. In the contest of wills testamentary incapacity of the testator (at the time of the execution of the will), has become the most frequent reason for challenging a will. In this contribution, recent case law from South African and other jurisdictions relating to testamentary capacity, from which we can gain knowledge, are discussed to establish how the courts deal with old age combined with cognitive impairments such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. The focus is on impairments affecting the mental status of older testators and to observe to what degree these aspects influence or negate testamentary capacity. The conduct of another person, such as undue influence, fraud and duress are distinguished from the testamentary capacity of an individual and is not the focus of this contribution. In conclusion the question is considered whether elderly people, who are vulnerable due to age and other impairments, enjoy freedom of testation and if their testamentary capacity is sufficiently protected by the common-law principles.
