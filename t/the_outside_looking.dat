5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation {{about the idea of}} re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, King {{said that}} Flagg {{had been a}} {{presence}} in his writing {{since the beginning of}} his career, with the idea coming to him in college. He first wrote a poem, [...] "The Dark Man", about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape; written {{on the back of a}} placemat in a college restaurant, the one-page poem was published in 1969, but the character never left King's mind. To the author, what made Flagg interesting was [...] "the idea of the villain as somebody who was always on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in, and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends".|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing the U.S. {{government}} enacted several pieces of legislation including the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. In response to passing the legislation, Clinton stated that [...] "when someone is a victim, he or she should {{be at the center of}} the criminal justice process, not on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in." ...|$|E
500|$|In summer 2005, {{the band}} {{received}} a phone call from major label Fueled by Ramen founder John Janick, who wished to see the group perform live. The group had a meeting with Janick, before leaving to record demos in New York City. Eager to hear the material, Janick visited the group while they were recording in late July with Shep Goodman. On November 29, it was announced that the band had signed to Fueled by Ramen. Vocalist Shaant Hacikyan said of the label: [...] "There's such an amazing sense of community about the label. ... From <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in, I just wanted to be a part of it so bad." [...] In December, the band mentioned that they were writing material for their debut album and were planning to record later in winter.|$|E

500|$|Bustles Tracy Dye wrote that, in {{addition}} to [...] "7 Lessons About Life & Facing Fear", the song also reinforces the importance of pursuing other opportunities, the belief that [...] "material items don't lead to fulfillment", building new relationships and friendships, exploring new environments, {{and the concept of}} girl power. BuzzFeed's Aylin Zafar described [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "an anthem for anyone who has ever felt they were on <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>looking</b> into a place ... that they yearned to be a part of." [...] The Daily Dots Aja Romano believes that the ballad mirrors [...] "every young girl’s wish to get away from her over-protective parents and explore the world", a sentiment shared by Rebecca Rose of Cosmopolitan who dubbed it [...] "every young girl's lament about wanting to be part of something she idolizes." [...] Donna Dickens of HitFix concurred that the song's lyrics are about [...] "yearning to break free from suffocating parental expectations". Writing for Billboard, Taylor Weatherby identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song about [...] "fantasizing over living a life you can’t," [...] to which he believes many people are able to relate. Derrick Gill of KXKX believes that the song is also based around the traditional saying [...] "Is the grass greener on the other side?" ...|$|E

2500|$|David Ansen of Newsweek {{said the}} film [...] "is lushly, impeccably mounted—perhaps too much so. Mendes, a superb stage director, has an {{innately}} theatrical style: everything pops {{off the screen}} a little bigger and bolder than life, but the effect, rather than intensifying the emotions, calls attention to itself. Instead of losing myself in the story, I often felt on <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in, appreciating the craftsmanship, but one step removed from the agony on display.

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1920s his {{etchings}} began to receive public recognition. They expressed {{some of his}} later themes, as in Night on the El Train (couples in silence), Evening Wind (solitary female), and The Catboat (simple nautical scene). Two notable oil paintings of this time were New York Interior (1921) and New York Restaurant (1922). He also painted two of his many [...] "window" [...] paintings to come: Girl at Sewing Machine and Moonlight Interior, both of which show a figure (clothed or nude) near a window of an apartment viewed as gazing out or {{from the point of}} view from <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in.|$|E

The church itself takes up the whole of the ground floor; above this are offices, a manse, and a broad roof terrace with views over the Vatican City.|$|R
