5|$|After {{meeting with}} Caine and Forte, White {{was taken to}} the grill {{restaurant}} at <b>the</b> <b>Hyde</b> Park Hotel. Forte was interested if White could transfer the Michelin stars from Harveys; White was open to this since Raymond Blanc had previously transferred two stars to Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons when he moved his restaurant from Summertown, Oxford. Following the agreement of Michelin, White left Harveys in July 1993; The Restaurant was opened at <b>the</b> <b>Hyde</b> Park Hotel less than two months later, on 14 September. The interior was decorated with paintings from White's own collection.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century, the St John {{family of}} Lydiard Tregoze had the {{predominant}} influence in the borough, and could usually return their chosen candidates without difficulty, the main competing interest being that of <b>the</b> <b>Hydes.</b> After Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke fled abroad in 1715 following the Jacobite Rebellion the St John influence was weakened, and a wealthy local landowner and clothier, Robert Neale of Corsham, was able to secure election in 1741. Neale then began to strengthen his interest, hoping to gain control of the second seat in alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Hydes,</b> and this led to a vigorous contest for control of the borough in the 1750s.|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the area}} was {{originally}} known as Wrangthorn, and this is still used in the Church of England parish name [...] "Benefice of Woodhouse and Wrangthorn", and <b>the</b> Church at <b>Hyde</b> Park Corner is Wrangthorn Church. <b>The</b> name <b>Hyde</b> Park {{seems to have been}} extended to the present area from the name of <b>the</b> road junction <b>Hyde</b> Park Corner, itself apparently named in the nineteenth century on <b>the</b> inspiration of <b>Hyde</b> Park, London.

5|$|At the Port of San Francisco, Steilberg {{inspected}} each {{shipment of}} stones, several thousand crates in all. The Haslett warehouse, between Fisherman's Wharf and <b>the</b> <b>Hyde</b> Street Pier, {{was used for}} storage. With groundbreaking set for July 1931 and the last freighter carrying stones still in transit, Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were too far reduced from the Great Depression. The stones stayed in the warehouse, incurring annual storage fees of $15,000 in 1930s dollars.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and <b>the</b> <b>Hyde</b> Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Preckwinkle {{and four}} others {{challenged}} Evans for the 4th ward alderman's position. In {{the first round}} of voting on February 26, 1991, she won nearly one-third popular vote in the ward by winning 20 of 58 precincts (all in <b>the</b> <b>Hyde</b> Park-Kenwood community). Evans and Preckwinkle again advanced to a runoff election, as they had in 1983, but this time the majority of the eliminated candidates endorsed Preckwinkle. On April 2, 1991, Preckwinkle performed better {{in the northern part of}} the ward and was elected by a 109-vote margin, defeating the 17-year incumbent alderman Evans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, student {{applications}} declined {{as a result}} of increasing crime and poverty in <b>the</b> <b>Hyde</b> Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan. During this period the university, like Shimer College and 10 others, adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college; in addition, students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.|$|E
5|$|It was the Stones' {{first public}} concert in over two years, and was planned as an {{introduction}} of new guitarist, Mick Taylor, though circumstances inevitably changed {{following the death of}} former member Brian Jones two days earlier. The band rehearsed at the Beatles' studio in the basement of Savile Row, and Jagger and Richards came up with a 14-song set; <b>the</b> <b>Hyde</b> Park concert would be the first time many of the songs had been played before a public audience. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who had already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows.|$|E
