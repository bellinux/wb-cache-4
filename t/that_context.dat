5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, including the swollen and fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to have}} played a role in intraspecific competition, although their exact function within <b>that</b> <b>context</b> is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
30|$|Repast Simphony {{contexts}} are hierarchically nested {{and named}} containers that hold model components. The model components {{can be any}} type of Java object, including other contexts, but are typically agent objects. It should be noted <b>that</b> <b>contexts</b> can be agents as well. Each model component can be present in as many contexts as the modeler desires. The hierarchical nesting means that a model component that is present in a context is also present in all of <b>that</b> <b>context’s</b> parent contexts. Of course, the converse is not true in the general case. The hierarchical nesting structure can be declaratively or imperatively specified by the modeler. In addition, the contents of components within contexts (e.g., agent properties) can be declaratively logged at runtime.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, there have been debates over what is context and how {{computers}} should act upon it. Two disparate camps of thought can be recognized. First, Realism, having its roots in natural sciences, believes <b>that</b> <b>contexts</b> exist out there and that, if properly instrumented and programmed, computers can correctly recognize and adapt to them. Second, Constructivism, having its roots in human and social sciences, believes <b>that</b> <b>contexts</b> are human creations, mental and social, and that computers ought to provide resources for managing them. We reveal some fundamental {{differences between the two}} in three different application domains. We show that despite the deep-going controversies, both camps benefit from considering the alternative approach and a middle ground can be found...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{detailed}} placement technique {{that accounts for}} systematic through-pitch variations to reduce leakage. Leakage depends nearly exponentially on linewidth (gate length), and even small variations in linewidth introduce large variability in leakage. A substantial fraction of linewidth variation is systematic {{with respect to the}} device layout context. Detailed placement changes context of the devices that are near the cell boundaries and can be used to reduce leakage. Our approach modifies the placement of cells in small windows such <b>that</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>that</b> reduce leakage are created. During this optimization, cells are partitioned into rows and then placed in rows using a traveling salesman problem formulation...|$|R

40|$|There is now general {{agreement}} about the optionality of scalar implicatures: the pragmatic interpretation will be accessed {{depending on the}} context relative to which the utterance is interpreted. The question, then, is what makes a context upper- (vs. lower-) bounding. Neo-Gricean accounts should predict <b>that</b> <b>contexts</b> including factual information should enhance the rate of pragmatic interpretations. Post-Gricean accounts should predict <b>that</b> <b>contexts</b> including psychological attributions should enhance the rate of pragmatic interpretations. We tested two factors using the quantifier scale : (1) the existence of factual information that facilitates the computation of pragmatic interpretations in the context (here, the cardinality of the domain of quantification) and (2) the fact <b>that</b> the <b>context</b> makes the difference between the semantic and the pragmatic interpretations of the target sentence relevant, involving psychological attributions to the speaker (here a question using all). We did three experiments, all of which suggest that while cardinality information may be necessary to the computation of the pragmatic interpretation, it plays a minor role in triggering it; highlighting the contrast between the pragmatic and the semantic interpretations, while {{it is not necessary to}} the computation of the pragmatic interpretation, strongly mandates a pragmatic interpretation. These results favor Sperber and Wilson’s (1995) post-Gricean account over Chierchia’s (2013) neo-Gricean account. Overall, this suggests that highlighting the relevance of the pragmatic vs. semantic interpretations of the target sentence makes a context upper-bounding. Additionally, the results give a small advantage to the post-Gricean account...|$|R
