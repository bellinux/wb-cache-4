5|$|On 17 May Gustavus {{landed with}} 8,000 reinforcements. On {{the night of}} 22–23 May, while {{crossing}} the Vistula near Kieżmark and Danzig, Gustavus encountered Polish forces. Wounded in the hip, {{he was forced to}} retreat. Koniecpolski then decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> Gniew and devised a diversionary plan. Polish forces were sent to attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> Braniewo, forcing Gustavus to relieve the siege; then Gustavus followed the retreating Polish army and laid siege to Orneta. Koniecpolski, who had foreseen this, responded with a sudden attack on Gniew, his primary objective, which he captured. Gustavus was reported to be impressed with the speed of Koniecpolski's reaction.|$|E
5|$|An {{operation}} is {{launched by the}} task force <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> the site from Zakhaev’s forces via halo jump. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E

50|$|Rather than {{tarnishing}} his reputation, {{the attack}} revealed Toni Abela's honourable course which saw him firing {{the guy and}} refusing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him <b>back,</b> even {{when he started to}} make puerile excuses. Toni Abela took no chances and unhesitatingly fired the person concerned and refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him <b>back.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the First Battle of Frenchtown on January 18, 1813, the American forces under Lt. Colonel William Lewis were {{successful}} in forcing the retreat of the small British force stationed there. The British commander of the Fort Malden garrison in Amherstburg, Colonel Henry Procter, made plans <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> Frenchtown and he ordered troops to the area.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{with the}} Chicago Spire site for sale by Ireland's National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), {{interest}} resumed, drawing {{in at least}} a half-dozen offers for the property.

5|$|In the 1830s, the District's {{southern}} {{territory of}} Alexandria went into economic decline {{partly due to}} neglect by Congress. The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade, and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> the land it had donated to form the District, through {{a process known as}} retrocession.|$|E
5|$|Russia has a {{long history}} of {{reprocessing}} spent fuel for military purposes, and previously planned to reprocess imported spent fuel, possibly including some of the 33,000 metric tons of spent fuel accumulated at sites in other countries who received fuel from the U.S., which the U.S. originally pledged <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back,</b> such as Brazil, the Czech Republic, India, Japan, Mexico, Slovenia, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the European Union.|$|E

5|$|Henry's chief minister, Hubert de Burgh {{fell from}} power in 1232. His old rival, Peter des Roches, {{returned}} to England from the crusades in August 1231 and allied himself with Hubert's {{growing number of}} political opponents. He put the case to Henry that the Justiciar had squandered royal money and lands, and was responsible {{for a series of}} riots against foreign clerics. Hubert took sanctuary in Merton College Chapel, but Henry had him arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Des Roches took over the King's government, backed by the Poitevin baronial faction in England, who saw this as a chance <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> the lands which they had lost to Hubert's followers in the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} leg in Lyon, Barcelona fell behind to a seventh-minute free kick from Juninho, only for Thierry Henry to equalise halfway through the second half, giving Barcelona an away goal <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> to the Camp Nou. They needed a win or a no-score draw to {{guarantee}} passage, but a 4–1 half-time lead {{set the stage for}} a convincing 5–2 win. Two first-half goals from Henry and one each from Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o were followed by goals from Jean Makoun and Juninho either side of the interval to reduce Lyon's deficit. However, a goal from Seydou Keita in the fifthminute of injury time secured a 6–3 aggregate win and passage to the next round.|$|E
5|$|One notorious tengu {{from the}} 12th century was himself {{the ghost of}} an emperor. The Hōgen Monogatari {{tells the story of}} Emperor Sutoku, who was forced by his father to abandon the throne. When he later raised the Hōgen Rebellion <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> the country from Emperor Go-Shirakawa, he was {{defeated}} and exiled to Sanuki Province in Shikoku. According to legend he died in torment, having sworn to haunt the nation of Japan as a great demon, and thus became a fearsome tengu with long nails and eyes like a kite's.|$|E

5|$|The {{breakaway}} {{was eventually}} caught {{at the bottom}} of the final climb. Valverde, who had crashed earlier in the day, was the first to attack. As soon as he was caught, his teammate Nairo Quintana put in his own attack. These attacks dropped Chris Froome from the front group. Dumoulin was the next to attack, seeking <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> the race lead from Chaves. Chaves and Quintana initially followed him, but were soon dropped. Valverde was also unable to follow the pace, but Froome had kept a steady pace and by this point was leading the chase of Dumoulin.|$|E
5|$|The harder line now {{developing}} in Russian politics led Quisling {{to distance himself}} from Bolshevism. The Soviet government had rejected outright his Armenian proposals, and obstructed an attempt by Nansen to help with the 1928 Ukrainian famine. Quisling took these rebuffs as a personal insult; in 1929, with the British now keen <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> control of their own diplomatic affairs, he left Russia. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to Britain, an honour revoked by King George VI in 1940. By this time, Quisling had also been awarded the Romanian Crown Order and the Yugoslav Order of St. Sava for his earlier humanitarian efforts.|$|E

5|$|A counterattack <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> the {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised {{for the following}} day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and {{had to take a}} quick nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the other participants. Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E
5|$|Farleigh Hungerford Castle was {{captured}} by a Royalist unit in 1643, following a successful campaign by the King's forces across the south-west. The castle was taken without a fight by Colonel John Hungerford, a half-brother of Edward, who installed a garrison that then supported itself by pillaging the surrounding countryside. Several Parliamentary raids against Farleigh Hungerford were undertaken during 1644, but they failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> the castle. By 1645, however, the Royalist cause was close to military collapse; Parliamentary forces began to mop up the remaining Royalist garrisons in the south-west, and on 15 September they reached the castle. Colonel Hungerford immediately surrendered on good terms, and Sir Edward Hungerford peacefully reinstalled himself in the undamaged castle. As {{a result of this}} process, the castle escaped being slighted, or deliberately destroyed, by Parliament, unlike many other castles in the region, such as Nunney.|$|E
5|$|In most {{variations}} Black has {{the opportunity}} to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates the loss of the bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E
