5000|$|A {{new steel}} company, Bokaro Steel Limited (Bokaro Steel Plant), was {{incorporated}} on 29 January 1964 [...] {{to construct and}} operate the steel plant at Bokaro. The 1 MT phases of Bhilai and Rourkela Steel Plants were completed {{by the end of}} December 1961. The 1 MT phase of Durgapur Steel Plant was completed in January 1962 after commissioning of the Wheel and Axle plant. The crude steel production of HSL went up from 1.58 MT (1959-60) to 1.6 MT. The second phase of Bhilai Steel Plant was completed in September 1967 after commissioning of the Wire Rod Mill. The last unit of the 1.8 MT phase of Rourkela - the Tandem Mill - was commissioned in February 1968, and the 1.6 MT stage of Durgapur Steel Plant was completed in August 1969 after commissioning of the Furnace in SMS. Thus, with the completion of the 2.5 MT stage at Bhilai, 1.8 MT at Rourkela and 1.6 MT at Durgapur, the <b>total</b> <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> production capacity of HSL was raised to 3.7 MT in 1968-69 and subsequently to 4 MT in 1972-73.

40|$|Lack of {{international}} comparability in <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> prices presents {{a problem in}} constructing an econometric model of the global steel market. The commonly used measures of <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> prices are the weighted average of the prices of steel products and the index of the weighted average of prices based on a certain year. But {{in the context of}} constructing an econometric model of the global steel market, these measures are not comparable internationally. If the various product prices are cointegrated, it is appropriate to use the price of the most widely produced and traded product in the model (uncoated steel sheet) as an indicator of the general movement of <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> prices. This paper concludes that the price of uncoated steel sheet cointegrates with the prices of other steel products in France and Germany. The same is not true of the United States, which may point to quality problems with the price data. Use of the price data of uncoated steel sheet as the indicator of <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> prices in the global steel model would thus seem appropriate for capturing long-term price movements of various steel products. Using cointegration tests, this paper also investigates the relationship between macroeconomic variables and steel product prices.

40|$|Production of {{iron and}} steel is an {{energy-intensive}} manufacturing process. The energy efficiency of steel production has {{a direct impact on}} overall energy consumption and related carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop a methodology for accurately comparing the energy-related CO 2 emissions intensity of steel production in different countries and to demonstrate the application of this methodology in an analysis of the steel industry in China, Germany, Mexico, and the U. S. Emissions intensity values are often sought by policy makers who must decide questions related to energy, greenhouse gases, and competitiveness. Our methodology addresses the industry's boundary definition, conversion factors, and industry structure. The results of our analysis show that, for the entire iron and steel production process, the base-case (2010) CO 2 emissions intensity was 2, 148 kilogram (kg) CO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> in China, 1, 708 kg CO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> in Germany, 1, 080 kg CO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> in Mexico, and 1, 736 kg CO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel</b> in the U. S. One of the main reasons that Mexico has the lowest CO 2 emissions intensity is Mexico's large share of steel production using electric arc furnaces (EAFs) (69. 4 %). EAF steel production has lower CO 2 emissions intensity than production using blast furnaces/basic oxygen furnaces. China, by contrast, has the smallest share of EAF production among the four countries – 9. 8 % in the base-case year 2010. In one scenario, we applied the Chinese share of EAF production to the other three case-study countries; the result was an increase in CO 2 emissions intensity of steel production of 19 % (2, 036 kgCO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel)</b> in Germany, 92 % (2, 074 kgCO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel)</b> in Mexico, and 56 % (2, 703 kgCO 2 /tonne <b>crude</b> <b>steel)</b> in the U. S. compared to these countries' base-case analyses. In another scenario, we applied the Chinese national average grid electricity CO 2 emissions factor from 2010, which is the highest emissions factor among the four countries, to the other three countries. In that scenario, the CO 2 emissions intensity of steel production increased by 5 % in Germany, 11 % in Mexico, and 10 % in the U. S. Additional scenarios were analyzed showing that when comparing the CO 2 emissions intensities of the steel industry in different countries, it is necessary to take into account the industry structure, especially the share of EAFs and the effect of electricity grid CO 2 emissions factors.
