25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E
2500|$|He went {{to school}} in Turku and in 1939, {{at the age of}} 19, he moved to Helsinki to study advertising. In his spare time he also started drawing erotic images for his own pleasure, based on images of male laborers he had seen from an early age. At first he kept these {{drawings}} hidden, but then destroyed them [...] "at least by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> serve the army." [...] The country became embroiled in the Winter War with the USSR, and then became formally involved in World War II, and he was conscripted in February 1940 into the Finnish Army. He served as an anti-aircraft officer, holding the rank of second lieutenant. He later attributed his fetishistic interest in uniformed men to encounters with men in army uniform, especially soldiers of the German Wehrmacht serving in Finland at that time. [...] "In my drawings I have no political statements to make, no ideology. I am thinking only about the picture itself. The whole Nazi philosophy, the racism and all that, is hateful to me, but of course I drew them anyway—they had the sexiest uniforms!" [...] After the war, in 1945, he returned to studies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tour was}} among the first concerts {{attended}} by Britney Spears, who commented [...] "I remember the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> her show, I was just like 'Oh my God,' I wanted to be her." [...] Spears added, [...] "she just has this presence that you're so drawn to her, you can't keep your eyes off her." [...] Spears' rendition of [...] "Stronger" [...] on the Dream Within a Dream Tour referenced Jackson's performance of [...] "You", performing in a similar vein among masked dancers wearing one-piece attire. Several performances and themes of Spears' Onyx Hotel Tour drew comparisons for its choreography and sensuality, as well as a reworked lounge version of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] sonically reminiscent of Jackson's [...] "Rope Burn." [...] Spears' following tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears used a circus theme, observed to be partially inspired by segments of the tour. During [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] on the Femme Fatale Tour, Spears performed a lap dance for a selected fan while wearing a boa after a pole dance, considered a direct reference to Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn." [...] An analysis of Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour observed there was [...] "definitely a Janet vibe", particularly comparing Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn", [...] "in which she tied an audience member to a bed and proceeded to seduce them", to Rihanna's rendition of [...] "Skin." [...] The critique added, [...] "Fast forward 13 years later, and there was Rihanna, writhing around on a lucky audience member at the conclusion of Skin off her current Loud album." [...] New Zealand's Stuff.co.nz praised Lady Gaga's Born This Way Ball as the best [...] "pop-star show" [...] since Jackson's Velvet Rope Tour.|$|E

6000|$|The {{next year}} came more tidings {{of a sort}} I did not understand.

60|$|I {{was not so}} {{honest in}} former days as I am now, but I have always been {{reasonably}} honest. Well, you know how a man is influenced by his surroundings.

60|$|With that {{he flung}} {{himself on his}} horse, and rode away.

For it was autumn, the woods all red and yellow against the green of the pines. I sat down beside the old beaver dam to gather courage to tell my father. But he only smiled bitterly when he heard it. Nor would he {{tell me what the}} word ARISTOCRAT meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not," [...] pursued Freddie, [...] "that I {{mean to say}} {{anything}} in the least derogatory and so forth to your jolly old mater, if you understand me, {{but the fact remains}} she scares me pallid.
