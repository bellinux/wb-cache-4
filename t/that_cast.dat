5|$|The {{cast for}} Planet B {{comes from the}} Radio Drama Company, a {{repertory}} radio company. This is because they cost nothing to use and the budget for the show is small. The cast of the Radio Drama Company changes around every six months, which means <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> of Planet B changes every series.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the Box Office Attractions {{name was}} replaced with the newly incorporated Fox Film Corporation. Edwards remained one of the studio's most important directors and one of William Fox's closest advisers. He became known for his epic filmmaking and for a permissive approach to directing his starring cast, an attitude that led Bara's biographer to compare him to Alfred Hitchcock. Often, <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> included Bara, whose films with him include Under Two Flags (1916), the epic historical drama Cleopatra (1917), and A Woman There Was (1919).|$|E

5|$|Many of Grant's {{associates}} {{were able}} to capture his confidence through flattery and brought their intrigues openly to his attention. One of these men, Orville E. Babcock, was a subtle and unscrupulous enemy of reformers, having served as Grant's personal secretary for seven years while living in the White House. Babcock, twice indicted, gained indirect control of whole departments of the government, planted suspicions of reformers in Grant's mind, plotted their downfall, and sought to replace them with men like himself. Grant allowed Babcock to be a stumbling block for reformers who might have saved the President from scandal. Grant's secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, who was often at odds with Babcock, made efforts to save Grant's reputation by advocating that reformers be appointed to or kept in public office. Grant also unwisely accepted gifts from wealthy donors <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> doubts on his reputability.|$|E
5|$|Paramount Pictures has {{produced}} thirteen Star Trek feature films, {{the most recent}} being released in July 2016. The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of The Original Series; the seventh film, Generations {{was designed as a}} transition from <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> to The Next Generation television series; the next three films, 8–10, focused completely on the Next Generation cast. Starting with the eleventh film, the movies take place in an alternate timeline with a new cast playing the original series characters. Leonard Nimoy portrays an elderly Spock in these films, providing a physical link to the original timeline. This alternate timeline has been named by CBS, for the computer game Star Trek Online, the Kelvin Timeline.|$|E

25|$|US and Soviet {{experiments}} {{had also}} given off similar neutron bursts at temperatures {{that were not}} high enough for fusion. This led Lyman Spitzer to express his scepticism of the results, but his comments were dismissed by UK observers as jingoism. Further experiments on ZETA showed that the original temperature measurements were misleading; the bulk temperature was too low for fusion reactions to create the number of neutrons being seen. The claim that ZETA had produced fusion had to be publicly withdrawn, an embarrassing event <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> a chill over the entire fusion establishment. The neutrons were later explained as being the product of instabilities in the fuel. These instabilities appeared inherent to any similar design, {{and work on the}} basic pinch concept as a road to fusion power ended by 1961.|$|E

25|$|Culture {{not only}} {{influences}} {{the age at}} which the reminiscence bump appears but also the content of the memories found within the bump. Western cultures often value individuality, agency, and distinctiveness, where individuals are encouraged to develop and maintain their private beliefs, attitudes, and personality traits. Alternatively, Asian cultures often value group solidarity, communion, and interconnectedness, where individuals are encouraged to develop a sense of self that is aligned with social roles, duties, and responsibilities. The differences in societal norms expressed by Western and Asian cultures influence the focus of memories. Individuals from Western cultures have memories <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> the individual as the central character and often have self-focused autobiographical memories. Individuals from Asian cultures have memories that express a strong group orientation and often have relation-centered autobiographical memories.|$|E
25|$|Pointed foot spades: This type {{has pointed}} feet, and a square crutch; the {{shoulders}} can be pointing upwards or straight. They are a clear {{descendant of the}} pointed shoulder hollow handled spade. The weight {{and size of the}} larger specimens is compatible with the one jin unit of the arched foot flat handled spades; smaller specimens sometimes specify the unit as one jin or more often as a half jin, but frequently do not specify a unit. This seems to imply that the half jin unit became the norm. They are associated with the State of Zhao, and their find spots are usually in Shanxi or Hebei provinces. They frequently have numerals on their reverses. The two character mint names mean that the cities <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> these coins can be identified with more certainty than those of earlier series.|$|E
25|$|Actor Andrew Buchan said {{cast members}} were told {{little about the}} plot, except on a {{need-to-know}} basis as they prepared for their performances in each episode. The actors also received only parts of scripts and only two scripts {{at a time to}} ensure {{that they did not know}} story details too far in advance. Cinematographer John Conroy said the cast and crew did not know how series two ended until three weeks before shooting began on the final two scripts. Two former Coldstream Guards were hired to stand in front of news reporters when they visited the set, to block possible photographs of the filming. Several different endings for series two were filmed, the cast was not permitted to see completed episodes of the series, and Chibnall said <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> members will remain in the dark about the programme's outcome until the final episode airs.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading <b>that</b> <b>cast</b> market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the prospectuses written by the mutual fund companies strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to do it anyway. So, the problem was not with the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on fundamental analysis of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, those decisions involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E
