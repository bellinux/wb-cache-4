In 1880 a statue of Queen Louise was erected in the Tiergarten in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only <b>those</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E

25|$|Early-term {{surgical}} abortions {{are generally}} available around Australia for <b>those</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> seek them.

25|$|This {{is below}} the {{replacement}} rate of 2.1, and also lower than in previous years. A 2002 study reported that urban women averaged 2.1 children per woman, with women living in rural areas having more children, at 2.9.

25|$|Mixing {{of fetal}} cells {{carrying}} paternal RhD antigens into maternal blood {{may result in}} the sensitization of an RhD-negative mother. Rhesus blood group (D antigen) is {{used to determine the}} risk of hemolytic disease in the fetus. In hemolytic disease, the maternal antibodies destroy RhD-positive fetal red blood cells. This leads to lethality for the fetus. A significant amount of blood can be exchanged between mother and infant during birth, CVS, amniocentesis and accidents. 50 defined antigens on the surface of red blood cells indicate Rhesus blood group and E antigens {{are one of the most}} important. RHD gene determines the Rhesus D status. Chinen et al. 2010 shows that 15% of Caucasian females, 3-5% of black African females and <3% of Asian females are RhD-negative. In the United Kingdom and other countries, cffDNA tests are now routinely being offered to RhD-negative patients at increased risk of isoimmunization. Anti-RhD immune globulin, a blood derivative, is only offered in the event of a RhD-positive fetus for these women (21, 48, 54). In United States, prophylactic treatment is recommended for all RhD-negative pregnant women to prevent isoimmunization in case of RhD incompatibility. In the United States, amniocentesis still serves as the gold standard diagnostic tool for <b>those</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> require antenatal fetal blood genotyping, but it has been suggested that technology using cell-free fetal DNA may ultimately replace this invasive procedure.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate as}} to whether the higher rate of breast cancer {{associated}} with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific studies in the United States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to <b>those</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese {{women are more likely to}} list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding mammograms. Other reasons obese women may avoid mammography are due to lack of insurance, low income, or embarrassment at the procedure, although when these factors are accounted for, the effect of lower rates of screening are still significant. In contrast, other studies have shown that mammography patterns did not differ among women who were obese compared to those at a healthy weight indicating that there may be biological differences in cancer presentation between these groups.|$|E

500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on <b>those</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards equivocation. [...] Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by [...] "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards [...] "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" [...] apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. [...] Mrs Russell, attractive to [...] "a number of clients among the youth, who are fond of beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her [...] "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". [...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated {{so as not to}} be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E
