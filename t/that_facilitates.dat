5|$|In many bathhouses the {{customer}} has {{a choice between}} renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), {{some or all of}} the rooms are freely available to all patrons.|$|E

Holley determined the structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> the process of translating RNA into protein. This work was based upon Ochoa's earlier studies, yielding the latter the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for work on the enzymology of RNA synthesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> the knowing of Christ.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes of {{californium}} {{with mass}} numbers 237–256 are formed in nuclear reactors; californium-253 is a β-emitter {{and the rest}} are α-emitters. The isotopes with even mass numbers (250Cf, 252Cf and 254Cf) have {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, especially 254Cf of which 99.7% decays by spontaneous fission. Californium-249 has a relatively long half-life (352 years), weak spontaneous fission and strong γ-emission <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> its identification. 249Cf is not formed in large quantities in a nuclear reactor because of the slow β-decay of the parent isotope 249Bk and a large cross section of interaction with neutrons, but it can be accumulated in the isotopically pure form as the β-decay product of (pre-selected) 249Bk. Californium produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of 250Cf and 252Cf, the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences, and its study is hindered by the strong neutron radiation.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{acoustic}} {{system is a}} distributed sound reinforcement system, which allows musicians on stage to hear each other clearly in a way <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> ensemble play. In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces {{as well as being}} reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E

5|$|With {{insensitive}} or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways {{of coping with}} fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of social relationships <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> both the giving and the receiving of care from others.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{primates}} in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged salivary glands, a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it to feed on nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.|$|E
5|$|The schoolboys {{sections}} of Shamrock Rovers and Tallaght Town merged in 1997 {{to form a}} new section to serve the Tallaght area of South West Dublin. Tallaght Town initially remained in operation with three intermediate teams participating in the Leinster Senior League. Two of these teams continue to compete, but under the name of Shamrock Rovers. Tallaght Town exists as a limited company and as trustee of a training facility used by the youth teams at Shamrock Rovers. There are sixteen of these teams, composed of over 200 players and 35 managers and coaches. They cater for players in the six to nineteen years of age group. The club's youth teams have participated in the Milk Cup and Dallas Cup. The club operates scholarships covering all levels of education. In conjunction with IT Tallaght, they offer third level education to players and have introduced a scholarship scheme <b>that</b> <b>facilitates</b> primary school students through the Junior Certificate cycle.|$|E
