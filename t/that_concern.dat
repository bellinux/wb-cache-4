5|$|Being {{the capital}} and largest city of the Republic of Macedonia, Skopje enjoys a {{particular}} status granted by law. The last revision of its status was made in 2004. Since then, the City of Skopje has been divided into 10 municipalities which all have a council and a mayor, like all the municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia. Municipalities only deal with matters specific of their territory, and the City of Skopje deals with matters <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> all of them, or that cannot be divided between two or more municipalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{neuroscience}} encompasses all approaches {{that seek to}} understand the brain {{and the rest of}} the nervous system. Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|It was alleged by medieval chroniclers that Edward II and Piers Gaveston were lovers, a rumour {{that was}} {{reinforced}} by later portrayals in fiction, such as Christopher Marlowe's late 16th-century play Edward II. This assertion has received the support of some modern historians, while others have questioned it. According to Pierre Chaplais, {{the relationship between the}} two was that of an adoptive brotherhood, and Gaveston served as an unofficial deputy for a reluctant king. Other historians, like J. S. Hamilton, have pointed out <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> over the two men's sexuality was not at the core of the nobility's grievances, which rather centred on Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage.|$|E

5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E

After interrupting regular Saturday morning cartoons on January 19 to broadcast a military briefing from Saudi Arabia, Jennings and ABC became concerned about the emotional impact of the war coverage on children. Out of <b>that</b> <b>concern,</b> Jennings hosted a 90-minute special, War in the Gulf: Answering Children's Questions the next Saturday morning; the program featured Jennings, ABC correspondents, and American military personnel answering phoned-in questions and explaining the war to young viewers.|$|E

25|$|Hodge's {{literary}} {{powers were}} seen {{at their best}} in his contributions to the Princeton Theological Review, {{many of which are}} acknowledged masterpieces of controversial writing. They cover a wide range of topics, from apologetic questions <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> common Christianity to questions of ecclesiastical administration, in which only Presbyterians have been supposed to take interest. But the questions in debate among American theologians during the period covered by Hodge's life belonged, for the most part, to the departments of anthropology and soteriology; and it was upon these, accordingly, that his polemic powers were mainly applied.|$|E

25|$|The {{most widely}} {{reported}} effect of culture on performance is that strong cultures result in high performance. The three {{reasons for this}} are goal alignment, motivation, and the resulting structure provided. Goal alignment {{is driven by the}} proposed unified voice that drives employees in the same direction. Motivation comes from the strength of values and principles in such a culture. And structure is provided by these same attributes which obviate the need for formal controls that could stifle employees. There are questions <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> researchers about causality and the veracity of the driving voice of a strong culture.|$|E
25|$|Some skills {{also have}} a Tech Level (TL) rating {{attached}} to them, to differentiate between Skills <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> similar concepts, but whose tasks are accomplished in different ways when used with differing levels of technology. This helps during time traveling scenarios, or when characters are forced to deal with particularly outdated or advanced equipment. For instance, a modern boat builder's skills will be of less use if he is stuck on a desert island and forced to work with primitive tools and techniques. Thus, the skills he uses are different when in his shop (Shipbuilding/TL8) and when {{he is on the}} island (Shipbuilding/TL0).|$|E
