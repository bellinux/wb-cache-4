5|$|Although {{adequate}} for the town's residents the new stations were {{a long way}} from the seafront attractions, which were at the foot of a steep hill. The day-trippers on whom Ramsgate's tourist industry depended were therefore increasingly attracted to Margate, where the station was next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disaster Transport {{originally}} {{opened on}} May 11, 1985 as Avalanche Run and was entirely outdoors. It was built next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> {{on the former}} spot of Jumbo Jet and later, WildCat. Many other rides also had to be relocated. The original ride cost $3.4 million: $1.9 million to manufacture and $1.5 million to install.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next two days, the {{battalion}} withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they went. In the confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00pm on 24 April when the final move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.|$|E

40|$|Ongoing {{research}} by Ashford and Driscoll suggests that {{erosion of the}} sea cliffs is {{an important source of}} sand <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> (50 %) in the Oceanside Littoral Cell. This hypothesis is in marked contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> established paradigm that rivers supply the majority of sand (up to 85 %) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> in <b>the</b> Oceanside Littoral Cell and the cliffs are an unimportant source of sand...|$|R
5|$|The visitor centre {{and shop}} are open daily except Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Most {{of the reserve}} and its {{facilities}} are wheelchair accessible, but {{the last part of}} the path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> is rough, and accessed via a steep bank.|$|E
5|$|US113 {{serves as}} an {{important}} route carrying local and through traffic along with tourist traffic bound for the Delaware Beaches and Ocean City, Maryland to the east; as such the highway experiences congestion in the summer months when tourism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> areas is at its highest. Access from US113 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> areas is provided by US9 and DE404 toward Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach; DE26 toward Bethany Beach; DE54 toward Fenwick Island; MD90 toward northern Ocean City; US50 toward downtown Ocean City; and MD376 toward Assateague Island. US 113 {{also serves as a}} part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the beach communities to inland areas to the north. All of US113 is part of the National Highway System.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Oka's {{troops had}} moved into {{position}} to completely cut off the Marines on Hill 84 from the coast. Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began to blast a path between the ridge and the beach. After about 30 minutes of firing by the destroyer, the way was clear for the Marines to escape <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Despite taking some casualties from their own artillery fire, most of the Marines made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> near Point Cruz by 16:30. Oka's troops put heavy fire on the Marines at the beach in effort {{to keep them from}} successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. landing craft responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal. Under fire, the Marines boarded the landing craft and successfully returned to the Lunga perimeter, ending the action. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of Higgins boats—was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration.|$|E
5|$|Carly and Kate travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> where Kate has a {{run-in with}} Amber, {{and the two}} women inform her that Mark has been {{cheating}} on all of them. All three women then decide to take revenge on him together. Kate spikes his smoothies with an estrogen to swell his nipples, has their dog lick his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet, and adds hair-removal cream into his shampoo; Carly spikes his water with a laxative to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea; Amber has an ugly fake three-way sexual partner against him.|$|E
5|$|GateKeeper's {{entrance}} plaza {{is located}} {{along the beach}} {{next to one of}} Wicked Twister's towers. A sculpture with the GateKeeper logo is {{in the center of the}} plaza. The queue runs parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> under the lift hill and station. Once under the station, riders can choose which side of the train they would like to ride. GateKeeper uses the Fast Lane queuing system; visitors can buy a wristband that allows them to wait in a shorter line.|$|E

5|$|Max {{leaves the}} house when Ray reappears and Tim accuses Ray of ruining his night. Lee and Ben make their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and share a kiss. Tim returns to the {{backyard}} and uncovers a ring and {{what appears to be}} a human hand before he decides to stop digging. He throws everything he has found back into the hole he has dug before starting to fill it in. He walks back up to the house and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her. The next morning, they pack up their belongings and go to pick up Jude.|$|E
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} the end of the war, the Republic of South Maluku (RMS) {{declared}} its independence from the nascent Indonesia. Rijadi was sent to the frontline on 10 July 1950 as part of Operation Senopati. To retake the island of Ambon, Rijadi took half his forces and invaded the eastern shores, while the other half was tasked with invading from the northern coast. Although the second group experienced heavy resistance, Rijadi's group was able to take <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> in native canoes unopposed; they later landed more infantry and armour.|$|E
5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the Northern bottlenose whale and Atlantic White-sided Dolphin. The Northern bottlenose whale is mainly killed when it accidentally swims too close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and cannot return to the water. When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Saien {{was pressed}} {{immediately}} into Japanese service. During the Japanese invasion of Taiwan later in 1895, she was assigned together with six other ships to bombard the coastal defences of Takow (Kaohsiung). The fleet arrived {{off the coast}} on 12 October, warning foreign vessels that the attack would begin at 7am the following morning. The Japanese ships attacked on schedule, firing on the defenses until they stopped returning fire after half an hour. At 2pm, the ships closed the distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and began launching boats into the water with troops. Their forces had successfully captured the coastal fort by 2:35pm.|$|E
