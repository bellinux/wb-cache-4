5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack <b>to</b> <b>compute</b> snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors <b>to</b> <b>compute</b> Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors <b>to</b> <b>compute</b> six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E
