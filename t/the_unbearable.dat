The Czech musical film, Rebelové from Filip Renč, also depicts the events, the invasion and subsequent wave of emigration.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring is {{featured}} in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel <b>The</b> <b>Unbearable</b> Lightness of Being during the Prague Spring. It follows {{the repercussions of}} increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. The Liberators, by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, {{from the point of}} view of a Soviet tank commander. Rock 'n' Roll, a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution. Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.|$|E

25|$|Kundera's best-known work is <b>The</b> <b>Unbearable</b> Lightness of Being. Prior to the Velvet Revolution of 1989 the Communist régime in Czechoslovakia banned his books. He lives {{virtually}} incognito {{and rarely}} {{speaks to the}} media. A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, he {{is believed to have}} been nominated on several occasions.|$|E
25|$|Kundera's {{most famous}} work, <b>The</b> <b>Unbearable</b> Lightness of Being, was {{published}} in 1984. The book chronicles the fragile nature of an individual's fate, theorizing that a single lifetime is insignificant in the scope of Nietzsche's concept of eternal return. In an infinite universe, everything is guaranteed to recur infinitely. In 1988, American director Philip Kaufman released a film adaptation.|$|E

25|$|Winters are {{generally}} wet, windy and overcast, while summers are {{hot and humid}} with relatively little wind.

25|$|After {{his death}} his sister Ethel {{destroyed}} {{most of his}} papers and wrote her own account of their childhood, which appeared {{at the beginning of}} The Square Egg and Other Sketches (1924). Rothay Reynolds, a close friend, wrote a relatively lengthy memoir in The Toys of Peace (1919), but aside from this, the only other biographies of Munro are Saki: A Life of Hector Hugh Munro (1982) by A. J. Langguth, and <b>The</b> <b>Unbearable</b> Saki (2007) by Sandie Byrne. All later biographies have unfortunately had to draw heavily upon Ethel's account of her brother's life.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{his short}} stories (which were first {{published}} in newspapers, as was customary at the time, and then collected into several volumes), he wrote a full-length play, The Watched Pot, in collaboration with Charles Maude; two one-act plays; a historical study, The Rise of the Russian Empire, the only book published under his own name; a short novel, <b>The</b> <b>Unbearable</b> Bassington; the episodic The Westminster Alice (a parliamentary parody of Alice in Wonderland); and When William Came, subtitled A Story of London Under the Hohenzollerns, a fantasy about a future German invasion and occupation of Britain.|$|E
40|$|On 13 September 1994, a loose {{collective}} of Downtown poets {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Unbearables</b> {{lined up on}} the Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian walkway, all the way from Manhattan to Brooklyn. During rush hour, they simultaneously ranted erotic poems in six-minute loops, so that, at least theoretically, "a few words from each reader would have reached each pedestrian's ear, and the whole string of phrases would add up to a single 'stochastic' poem, a different version for each and every passerby" (Bey 1994, n. p.). The Unbearables' thirty-minute performance was repeated in six consecutive years with only minor variations. The current article reconstructs the annual Brooklyn Bridge readings on the basis of previously unpublished sources that include personal interviews with <b>the</b> <b>Unbearables</b> and archival material from New York University's Fales Library Downtown Collection and the SUNY of Buffalo Poetry Collection. On the basis of this reconstruction, the article analyzes the event as a poetic implementation of anarchist philosopher Hakim Bey's theories on the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Poetic Terrorism and Artistic Disappearance...|$|R

25|$|Pomponius {{is unique}} among ancient geographers in that, after {{dividing}} the earth into five zones, of which two only were habitable, he asserts {{the existence of}} antichthones, inhabiting the southern temperate zone inaccessible to the folk of the northern temperate regions from <b>the</b> <b>unbearable</b> heat of the intervening torrid belt. On the divisions and boundaries of Europe, Asia and Africa, he repeats Eratosthenes; like all classical geographers from Alexander the Great (except Ptolemy) he regards the Caspian Sea as an inlet of the Northern Ocean, corresponding to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea on the south.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his early}} poetic works are staunchly pro-communist, his novels escape ideological classification. Kundera has {{repeatedly}} insisted on being considered a novelist, {{rather than a}} political or dissident writer. Political commentary has all but disappeared from his novels (starting specifically after <b>The</b> <b>Unbearable</b> Lightness of Being) except in relation to broader philosophical themes. Kundera's style of fiction, interlaced with philosophical digression, is greatly inspired by the novels of Robert Musil and the philosophy of Nietzsche, and is also used by authors Alain de Botton and Adam Thirlwell. Kundera takes his inspiration, as he notes often enough, {{not only from the}} Renaissance authors Giovanni Boccaccio and Rabelais, but also from Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, Denis Diderot, Robert Musil, Witold Gombrowicz, Hermann Broch, Franz Kafka, Martin Heidegger, and perhaps most importantly, Miguel de Cervantes, to whose legacy he considers himself most committed.|$|E
25|$|In August 1986, Binoche began filming Philip Kaufman's {{adaptation}} of Milan Kundera's novel <b>The</b> <b>Unbearable</b> Lightness of Being, portraying {{the young and}} innocent Tereza. Released in 1988, this was Binoche's first English language role and was a worldwide success with critics and audiences alike Set against the USSR's invasion of Prague in 1968, the film {{tells the story of}} the relationships a Czech surgeon, Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), has with his wife Tereza and his lover Sabina (Lena Olin). Binoche has stated that at the time her English was very limited and that she relied on a French translation to fully grasp her role. After this success, Binoche decided to return to France rather than pursue an international career. In 1988, she filmed the lead in Pierre Pradinas's Un tour de manège, a little-seen French film opposite François Cluzet. She has stated that her attraction to this film was that it gave her the opportunity to work with close friends and family. Pradinas is the husband of her sister Marion Stalens who was set photographer on the film and appeared in a cameo role. In the summer of 1988, Binoche returned to the stage in an acclaimed production of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull directed by Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky at Théâtre De L'odéon in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Notable winning streaks {{during the}} Shula-era in the Orange Bowl include a 13–0 streak against the Buffalo Bills and a 15–0 streak against the New England Patriots, Also of note, the Miami Dolphins enjoyed a record 31-game home winning streak from 1971–75. This 31-game streak {{includes}} four playoff wins and the perfect season of 1972. The Dolphins have not enjoyed {{the same level}} of success in Sun Life Stadium. While much of this lack of success in Sun Life Stadium is obviously attributable to a diminished level of talent and organizational stability, it is also widely recognized that the homefield advantage that the Dolphins enjoyed in the Orange Bowl was exponentially greater than in their newer home. This was in great part due to the atmosphere of the Bowl. The closeness of the seats to the field, along with the closed West End Zone, metal bleachers, and steel structure (and of course the team's success and its status as Miami's only professional sports team for so many years), gave the venue one of the loudest and most electric homefield environments in the NFL. Visiting team quarterbacks often complained to referees or were forced to call time out as their teammates could not hear them barking out the signals due to <b>the</b> <b>unbearable</b> noise, especially when the Dolphins were making a goal-line stand in the closed West End Zone. While Sun Life Stadium is much newer and cleaner and {{is considered one of the}} top facilities in the NFL, with top-notch amenities, the seats are much farther from the field, and even at its loudest, Sun Life Stadium doesn't come close to comparing to that of the Orange Bowl.|$|E
