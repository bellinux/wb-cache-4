40|$|Abstract—Tube bending is {{a widely}} used {{manufacturing}} process in the aerospace, automotive, and various other industries. Cold bending of metal tubes is very important production method considering that metal tubes are widely used in {{a great variety of}} engineering products, such as automobile, aircraft, air conditioner, air compressor, exhaust systems, fluid lines. During tube bending, considerable in-plane distortion and thickness variation occurs. This paper deals with the study of Rotary Draw Tube Bending process and the Finite Element Analysis and Simulation of Rotary Draw Tube Bending of a seamless metal tube for the analysis of spring back effect. Mathematical and Experimental analysis of spring back are carried out and results are compared. By applying the theory on pure beam bending deformation, the mathematical model of spring back for pipe bending deformation is established. The Simpson's rule is applied for solving the radius in spring back.

Such mathematical simplifications cause that the obtained strain fields do not satisfy the condition of consistency of displacements and strain continuity. The simplified methods determine safer values of the wall thickness than those from the generalized continuous strain scheme.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new flexible <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> and its practical applications. The proposed machine uses a new method. When tubes are {{fed into the}} fixed and mobile dies, they are bent by shifting the relative position of the mobile die.

A change of the expected bending shape will need no change in the tooling system but only a new definition of the motion of the active die and the length of the fed tube. The active die movements are controlled by a 6 -DOF parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM) with hydraulic servo drive. Making use of the PKM serves not only to achieve a complete motion along six axes but also to obtain a high dynamic motion of the <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> Application examples show that the <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> can be applied to designer's interiors, universal designed products, and automotive parts.
