5|$|The {{origins of}} Humberto {{are from the}} {{remnants}} of a frontal trough—the same that spawned Tropical Storm Gabrielle—that moved offshore south Florida on September 5. The combination of a weak surface trough and an upper-level low pressure system produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms from western Cuba into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Tracking slowly west-northwestward, unfavorable wind shear initially inhibited tropical cyclone development. By late on September 11, environmental conditions became more favorable, and the following morning convection increased over the disturbance. Tracking around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge, the system <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> slow northwest drift and quickly organized. Radar imagery reported loose banding features, and buoy data indicated the presence of a surface circulation; based on the observations, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Depression Nine, while located roughly 60miles (100km) southeast of Matagorda, Texas.|$|E

If the bar staff have merely <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tap, or are just resting their hand on a very small handle with no pump action, then this is a keg beer. Exceptions are some pubs (in the north and occasionally elsewhere) which use electric pumps or the pubs in Scotland that use traditional air-pressure founts on cask ale.|$|E
25|$|For Mallinson, this dive was {{additionally}} fatiguing as he {{had spent}} over a day previously repairing a broken manipulator on the sub. During the repair he changed the oxygen tank for a full one. During each dive the pilots had to ensure that after every 40 minutes they <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lithium hydroxide fan to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and also add additional oxygen. Additionally, they maintained a video commentary record during every dive.|$|E
25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E

25|$|A Windsor {{chair is}} a chair built {{with a solid}} wooden seat into which the chair-back and legs are round-tenoned, or pushed into drilled holes, in {{contrast}} to standard chairs, where the back legs and the uprights of the back are continuous. The seats of Windsor chairs were often carved into a shallow dish or saddle shape for comfort. Traditionally, the legs and uprights were usually <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pole lathe. The back and sometimes the arm pieces (if arms are present) are formed from steam bent pieces of wood.|$|E
25|$|A {{common problem}} with antenna systems {{of this sort}} {{is that it is}} not {{possible}} to know if the signal is being received by the front or back of the antenna, which are equally sensitive. To address this, once a null was seen, the bearing operator <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sensing switch which connected a second antenna located slightly behind the main one. The mixed output of the two clearly indicated which side the target lay on, front or rear. However, this led to problems in the phasing systems that were never wholly cured.|$|E

With Arsenal dropping a point at Southampton, Liverpool duly closed out the title with a final game 0-0 draw against Leicester City. This was their first major trophy since seven years before in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Tracking southwest, {{the storm}} was named Tropical Cyclone Ami at {{approximately}} 0000UTC on January 12 under favorable upper-level diffluence facilitated by the nearby ridge of high pressure. Influenced by an upper-level trough, Ami slowed in forward movement and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more southerly course. With minimal wind shear and a good outflow pattern, Ami achieved severe tropical cyclone intensity at 0600UTC on January 13. A poorly defined eye feature became visible on satellite imagery, at which point {{the storm was}} situated around 160mi (260km) north-northeast of Labasa. The cyclone made landfall on Vanua Levu with a minimum barometric pressure of 960mbar (28.4inHg) before subsequently crossing the western tip of Taveuni. Broadly turning toward the southeast, Ami traversed the Lau Islands. While located about 60 miles south of Lakeba– at 0600UTC on January 14– the storm reached its peak intensity with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 90mph (140km/h) and a pressure of 950mbar (28.0inHg). At the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm with 1-minute winds of 125mph (201km/h).|$|E

500|$|The turret {{was first}} used in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862, with a type of turret {{designed}} by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson. A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cowper Coles with a prototype of this installed on HMS Trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes. Ericsson's turret <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> central spindle, and Coles's <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ring of bearings. Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s. [...] The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean-going ironclads. [...] The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. [...] Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret (guns and armor protection) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. [...] The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armor. [...] Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage—and therefore range of the vessel. [...] In many respects, the turreted, low-freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an 'Ironclad' was all about. [...] The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or 'squaring this circle', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles: HMS Captain, a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half-sister [...] was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams. The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was [...] of 1876, which carried two turrets {{on either side of}} the centre-line, allowing both to fire fore, aft and broadside.|$|E
