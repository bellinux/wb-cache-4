40|$|To {{expand its}} {{production}} capacity for high quality, high alloyed cast iron, a Dutch iron foundry decided to install an Oxy-fuel melting furnace {{rather than a}} more conventional electric furnace. The investment for such a furnace proved to be much lower, while {{the use of an}} oxygen/gas burner in combination with a <b>tilting</b> <b>furnace</b> has reduced the production losses inherent to the use of electric furnaces.

40|$|Rotary <b>tilting</b> <b>furnace</b> (RTF) is a {{new type}} of fuel furnaces, that provide the most {{efficient}} heating and recycling of polydisperse materials. The paper describes results of the investigations on thermal processes in the RTF, movement of materials and non-isothermal gas flow during kiln rotary process. The investigations have been carried out while using physical and computer simulations and under actual operating conditions applying the pilot plant. Results of the research have served as a basis for development of recommendations on the RTF calculations and designing and they have been also used for constructional design of a rotary <b>tilting</b> <b>furnace</b> for heating and melting of cast iron chips, reduction smelting of steel mill scale, melting of aluminum scrap, melting of lead from battery scrap. These furnaces have a high thermal efficiency (~ 50 %), technological flexibility, high productivity and profitability. Proven technical solutions for recycling of ferrous and non-ferrous metals develop the use of RTF in the foundry and metallurgical industry as the main technological unit for creation of cost-effective small-tonnage recycling of metal waste generated at the plants. The research results open prospects for organization of its own production for high-quality charging material in Belarus in lieu of imported primary metal. The proposed technology makes it possible to solve environmental challenge pertaining to liquidation of multi-tonnage heapsÂ of metal-containing wastes...|$|E

50|$|It was {{established}} in 1930 by {{the decision of the}} Presidium of Supreme Soviet of the National Economy (BCHX) (USSR) in Mariupol, Ukrainian SSR (Soviet Union) and finally entered the production line in 1933 when its blast furnace put out the first iron.

50|$|The AJAX furnace was a {{modification}} of the <b>tilting</b> open hearth <b>furnace</b> that used blown oxygen to improve productivity. The process {{was used in the}} UK during the 1960s at a time of transition from open hearth to oxygen based steel making.|$|R
50|$|After merger the {{adjacent}} Appleby and Frodingham works both produced pig iron, with the Frodingham works specialising in bars and sections, and the Appleby works plates and slabs. In 1937 each site had four blast furnaces each, each with two relatively modern builds, {{with a maximum}} diameter of 17 ft in three; capacities of the four modern furnaces were two at 2,300 tons, one at 2,000 tons and one at 1,650 tons per week. Blast furnace gas was used at both sites to power electrical generators, and further energy recovery from the residual hot gas obtained from water tube boilers heated by the gas, or for heating in the steel works. Both works contained similar melting shops - the Appleby works had five <b>tilting</b> <b>furnaces</b> (open hearth) of 250 or 300 ton capacity. Employment over both sites was 6,500 in 1937. In {{the context of the}} wider United Steel group, rationalisation during the 1930s led the Appleby Frodingham works to be specialised in plates and heavy sections, whilst lighter section, bars, rod and wire were produced at the group's Steel, Peech and Tozer and Samuel Fox works in Yorkshire, with rails and ferroalloys at the Workington site., In 1945 the works was the largest in Britain, with a capacity of 700 million tons pa (5.5% national production), and occupied a 1700 acre site.|$|R

50|$|The hearth may be {{hemispherical}} in shape, or in {{an eccentric}} bottom tapping furnace (see below), the hearth has {{the shape of a}} halved egg. In modern meltshops, the furnace is often raised off the ground floor, so that ladles and slag pots can easily be maneuvered under either end of the furnace. Separate from the furnace structure is the electrode support and electrical system, and the tilting platform on which the furnace rests. Two configurations are possible: the electrode supports and the roof <b>tilt</b> with the <b>furnace,</b> or are fixed to the raised platform.|$|R
5000|$|The furnace {{is built}} on a tilting {{platform}} so that the liquid steel can be poured into another vessel for transport. The operation of <b>tilting</b> the <b>furnace</b> to pour molten steel is called [...] "tapping". Originally, all steelmaking furnaces had a tapping spout closed with refractory that washed out when the <b>furnace</b> was <b>tilted,</b> but often modern furnaces have an eccentric bottom tap-hole (EBT) to reduce inclusion of nitrogen and slag in the liquid steel. These furnaces have a taphole that passes vertically through the hearth and shell, and is set off-centre in the narrow [...] "nose" [...] of the egg-shaped hearth. It is filled with refractory sand, such as olivine, when it is closed off. Modern plants may have two shells with a single set of electrodes that can be transferred between the two; one shell preheats scrap while the other shell is utilised for meltdown. Other DC-based furnaces have a similar arrangement, but have electrodes for each shell and one set of electronics.|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} experimental investigation of 250 MW coal based thermal power plant to predict the performance of tangential fired (TF) boiler and to determine the flow patterns of the gas and coal particles, with an emphasis on increasing the flame stability in combustion zone at low load conditions at which thermal plants are forced to operates owing to number of practical limitations in this region. The effects of four parameters that are experimentally investigated are Coal air velocity through burner, Burner outlet temperature, Burner <b>tilt</b> & <b>Furnace</b> draft. The experimental results show considerable increase in flame stability at low load conditions while operating at Coal air velocity of 19. 19 m/sec, Burner outlet temperature of 70 Â°C, furnace draft of- 10 mmwc and burner tilt of + 20 Â°. The work has been validated with the help of CFD code Fluent. The results obtained from the present work are directly relevant to coal-fired Utilities for not only demonstrating the effectiveness of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based tools in combating operational issues but also provides an alternative to conventional remediation strategies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis regards on {{designing}} and manufacturing the gearing and burning {{system of the}} diesel furnace which include several specifications. The gearing and burning system of a diesel furnace can be various from type of furnace to {{the scale of the}} furnace itself. The furnace body or methods of transfer are which affects most on this project. It is by <b>tilting</b> the <b>furnace</b> body to pour the molten metal into a transferring cup which made existed such a system. To hold the furnace body into a pouring position, a gearing system must be made to tilt or move the furnace body. It is also crucial to hold it within its pouring position which enquires a locking mechanism. In this type of furnace application, the burner plays it part as a blower which transfers heat into the furnace body. This burner is attached to fuel pipeline from a source. Regarding this project, the matter is designing the frame to hold the entire components. The frame has been design so that it can withstand weight even pressure and also able to function properly when in use. The frame also consists of resistance materials which can overcome heat during its period of heating. From many analysis and references on frame design has result in a stable and durable frame to hold the entire components and able to function properly as a platform...|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{temperature}} and chemistry are correct, the steel is tapped out into a preheated ladle through <b>tilting</b> the <b>furnace.</b> For plain-carbon steel furnaces, as soon as slag is detected during tapping the <b>furnace</b> is rapidly <b>tilted</b> back towards the deslagging side, minimising slag carryover into the ladle. For some special steel grades, including stainless steel, the slag is poured into the ladle as well, to be treated at the ladle furnace to recover valuable alloying elements. During tapping some alloy additions are introduced into the metal stream, and more lime is added {{on top of the}} ladle to begin building a new slag layer. Often, a few tonnes of liquid steel and slag is left in the furnace in order to form a [...] "hot heel", which helps preheat the next charge of scrap and accelerate its meltdown. During and after tapping, the furnace is [...] "turned around": the slag door is cleaned of solidified slag, the visible refractories are inspected and water-cooled components checked for leaks, and electrodes are inspected for damage or lengthened through the addition of new segments; the taphole is filled with sand at the completion of tapping. For a 90-tonne, medium-power furnace, the whole process will usually take about 60-70 minutes from the tapping of one heat to the tapping of the next (the tap-to-tap time).|$|R
5000|$|The Steel Corporation of Bengal was {{incorporated}} on 20 April 1937 with Burn & Co. as managing agents. SCOB established steel making facilities at Napuria, {{adjacent to the}} Hirapur Works of IISCO. The new steel plant had an annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes of ingot steel, another 100,000 tonnes were added later. The steel works consisted of three 225-tonne <b>tilting</b> open hearth <b>furnaces,</b> soaking pits, a 40â blooming mill of one million tonne capacity, a 34â heavy structural mill and a 18â light structural mill. A sheet mill was added in 1940. The first heat of steel was tapped on 10 November 1939 and rolled subsequently. A duplex plant initially with two Bessemer converters (and subsequently another) was added. The first blow of the Bessemer converter was made on 6 February 1946. Martin and Burn companies formally merged in 1946 to form Martin Burn Limited.|$|R
40|$|Aluminium melt {{transfer}} operations {{can lead to}} significant amounts of dross formation {{as a result of}} chemical oxidation and physical entrapment processes. It has been suggested that these activities may contribute up to 50 % of the total metal loss of &# 8764; 1 % in a typical primary aluminium smelter (i. e. 2, 500 tonne/annum (tpa) in a smelter of 500, 000 tpa output). This is a large financial loss to any company, and also, in the new CO 2 -conscious era, it also represents a significant carbon footprint to ameliorate. A significant proportion of this metal loss may be prevented by adopting more efficient melt transfer strategies that reduce splashing and turbulence thereby resulting in reduced oxide and therefore dross formation. Optimisation of such systems is normally achieved by trial-and-error approaches, however a clear opportunity exists for rapid optimisation by employing computational modelling to explore the effects of changed equipment design and process conditions, such as tilt speed, spout height, spout geometry, etc. In the present paper, the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) modeling method is used to predict the amount of oxide generated during molten metal transfers from a 500 kg capacity <b>tilting</b> crucible <b>furnace</b> into a heated sow mould. Various conditions were tested. An oxidation model based on skimming trials performed in a laboratory-scale (8 kg) oxidation rig is employed in the simulation. The predicted oxide from the simulations is compared against those of the experimental pours. It is anticipated that the validated model will be used for modifying the design and optimizing the operation of various melt {{transfer operations}} occurring in the aluminium industry...|$|R
