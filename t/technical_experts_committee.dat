40|$|All sufficiently-complex {{engineered}} systems require oversight by <b>committees</b> of <b>technical</b> <b>experts.</b> Decision-making {{by these}} <b>expert</b> <b>committees</b> is poorly understood. A {{number of social}} dynamics might impact the sharing of information among expert specialists. Some of these could be beneficial to the decision process but some could lead to decisions that are not well-informed {{by all of the}} specialties represented. This research presents a quantitative empirical methodology for the study of <b>technical</b> <b>expert</b> <b>committees</b> based upon computational linguistic analysis of meeting transcripts. The Food and Drug Administration advisory panels are used as a case study. Output results include meaningful social network data that might potentially be used to gain insight into how the social dynamics of expertise interact with technical device attributes, ultimately leading to a committee decision. Keywords â€“ Group Decision-Making, Bayesian Analysis...|$|R

5000|$|Scott, {{together}} with Walter Rautenstrauch formed the Committee on Technocracy in 1932, which advocated a more rational and productive society headed by <b>technical</b> <b>experts.</b> The <b>Committee</b> disbanded in January 1933, {{after only a}} few months, largely because of different views held by Scott and Rautenstrauch as well as widespread criticism of Scott. Scott had [...] "overstated his academic credentials", and he was discovered not to be a [...] "distinguished engineer".|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the reasons and results {{that led to}} the greatest recognition that a scientist can achieve, his name Tesla given to a unit in the field of electricity and magnetism in the International System of Units (SI).

Some examples for the usage of the "tesla" unit are mentioned...|$|R
50|$|On 8 October 2010 Election Commission {{appointed}} an <b>expert</b> <b>technical</b> <b>committee</b> {{headed by}} Prof PV Indiresan (former Director of IIT-M) when at an all-party meeting majority {{of political parties}} backed the proposal to have a VVPAT in EVMs to counter the charges of tampering. The committee was tasked to examine the possibility of introduction of a paper trail so that voters can get a printout that will show symbol of the party to which the vote was cast. After studying the issue, the committee recommended introduction of VVPAT system.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Part of the {{responsibility}} of maintaining the sanitary quality of individual water supply systems {{has been placed on}} the local sanitarian of Oregon. Because of this, he must be knowledgeable about individual water supply systems. One such source of knowledge has been the supply of written reference materials available in his office. There have been no publications concerning individual water supply systems which have been directed to the sanitarian in Oregon. Materials used have been general in nature. Considering this lack of a specific material concerning individual water supply systems in Oregon, the following hypotheses were formed: 1) There will be less than 100 percent uniform reference materials concerning individual water supply systems in each of the offices of the local sanitarians. 2) Utilizing their available references, the local sanitarians {{will not be able to}} document 70 percent or more of the specific statements on water supply systems. 3) The local sanitarians will agree with an <b>expert</b> <b>technical</b> <b>committee's</b> opinion on the basic knowledge a sanitarian should have concerning individual water supply systems. Several assumptions concerning the design of this study were also made and are as follows: 1) Each member of the <b>expert</b> <b>technical</b> <b>committee</b> is an <b>expert</b> in individual water supply system construction, operation and maintenance. 2) The <b>expert</b> <b>technical</b> <b>committee</b> is competent to determine the basic knowledge of the sanitarians of Oregon concerning individual water supply systems. 3) All local sanitarian staffs are equally competent in using their reference materials to complete the survey. 4) The local sanitarians will respond to the survey accurately and honestly. 5) The survey form is a valid instrument. A committee of seven professional persons familiar with individual water supply systems and the work of the sanitarian was formed for the purpose of determining a list of basic knowledge that a sanitarian in Oregon should have concerning individual water supply systems. From each item on the list of basic knowledge, a corresponding statement of fact was derived. Each statement of fact was determined by the <b>expert</b> <b>technical</b> <b>committee</b> to be a fair representation of its corresponding item on the list of basic knowledge. A three section survey form based on the list of basic knowledge was sent to each local sanitarian staff of the health departments in Oregon. In the first section, the sanita_rians catalogued the reference materials in their offices. In the second section, the sanitarian staffs documented the list of specific statements utilizing their available references. In the third section, the sanitarian staffs gave their opinions on each item on the list of basic knowledge. The results were limited by the size of the sample and by the number of completed sections on the survey forms. Based upon the 71. 4 percent return of the survey forms with Section I completed, a total of 71 different references were determined to be available in the offices of the participating health departments. The most common references had a frequency of availability of 42. 9 percent. Based upon the 50. 0 percent return of the survey forms with Section II completed, the average number of documentations of the specific statements was 51. 6 percent. Based upon the 75. 0 percent return of the survey forms with Section III completed, the sanitarian staffs agreed with the <b>expert</b> <b>technical</b> <b>committee</b> on the list of basic knowledge that a sanitarian should have concerning individual water supply systems. A recommendation was made that a manual concerning individual water supply systems be written for sanitarians in Oregon, and that this study of the propriety of reference materials be carried over to other aspects of the sanitarians' work...|$|R
50|$|On 18 February 2010, the Supreme Court {{decided to}} {{constitute}} a five-member empowered committee to study all the issues of Mullaperiyar Dam and seek a report from it within six months. The Bench in its draft order said Tamil Nadu and Kerala would {{have the option to}} nominate a member each, who could be either a retired judge or a <b>technical</b> <b>expert.</b> The five-member <b>committee</b> will be headed by former Chief Justice of India A. S. Anand to go into all issues relating to the dam's safety and the storage level. However, the then ruling party of Tamil Nadu, DMK, passed a resolution that it not only oppose the apex court's decision to form the five-member committee, but also said that the state government will not nominate any member to it.|$|R

There was, however, sufficient interest expressed to recommend that investigations be encouraged to follow up these preliminary findings. To that end, the <b>Expert</b> <b>Committee</b> urged countries to use the provisions of Article 7 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances to facilitate research on this interesting substance.|$|R
