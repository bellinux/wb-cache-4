60|$|After dinner {{they went}} out on to the terrace to have coffee. They sat there long, the evening was so lovely, {{watching}} the summer night come very slowly on. It was still warm and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> lime blossom--early this summer. Two bats were flighting with the faint mysterious little noise they make. He had placed the chairs {{in front of the}} study window, and moths flew past to visit the discreet light in there. There was no wind, and not a whisper in the old oak-tree twenty yards away! The moon rose from behind the copse, nearly full; and the two lights struggled, till moonlight conquered, changing the colour and quality of all the garden, stealing along the flagstones, reaching their feet, climbing up, changing their faces.|$|E
6000|$|And Ashurst puffed his pipe. Awaken her! That fool had {{the best}} opinion of himself! He threw up the window and leaned out. Dusk had {{gathered}} thick. The farm buildings and the wheel-house were all dim and bluish, the apple trees but a blurred wilderness; <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> woodsmoke from the kitchen fire. One bird going to bed later than the others was uttering a half-hearted twitter, as though surprised at the darkness. From the stable came the snuffle and stamp of a feeding horse. And away over there was the loom of the moor, and away and away the shy stars which had not as yet full light, pricking white through the deep blue heavens. A quavering owl hooted. Ashurst drew a deep breath. What a night to wander out in! A padding of unshod hoofs came up the lane, and three dim, dark shapes passed--ponies on an evening march. Their heads, black and fuzzy, showed above the gate. At the tap of his pipe, and a shower of little sparks, they shied round and scampered. A bat went fluttering past, uttering its almost inaudible [...] "chip, chip." [...] Ashurst held out his hand; on the upturned palm {{he could feel the}} dew. Suddenly from overhead he heard little burring boys' voices, little thumps of boots thrown down, and another voice, crisp and soft--the girl's putting them to bed, no doubt; and nine clear words [...] "No, Rick, you can't have the cat in bed"; then came a skirmish of giggles and gurgles, a soft slap, a laugh so low and pretty that it made him shiver a little. A blowing sound, and the glim of the candle which was fingering the dusk above, went out; silence reigned. Ashurst withdrew into the room and sat down; his knee pained him, and his soul felt gloomy.|$|E
5000|$|Starhaven is {{mentioned}} {{on the television}} series Supergirl. In the season 1 episode [...] "Truth, Justice and the American Way", the character Alphonse Luzano, prisoner #2445, reveals that he was born on Starhaven, to which Supergirl remarks that she visited Starhaven with her father, as a child, and that <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> cinnamon. In the season 2 episode [...] "Mr and Mrs Mxyzptlk", the alien Lyra says she is from Starhaven, and that once [...] "the blight" [...] hit the planet, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> death.|$|E

The explosion occurred at lunchtime in a crowded cafeteria in the Frank Sinatra International Student Center on the university's Mount Scopus campus. In the minutes after the explosion, dazed, blood-spattered students emerged from the building; <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> smoke and burnt flesh.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>air</b> {{was soft}} and grey and mild and evening was coming. There was the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> evening in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the fields {{in the country where}} they digged up turnips to peel them and eat them when they went out for a walk to Major Barton's, the smell there was in the little wood beyond the {{pavilion}} where the gallnuts were.|$|R
60|$|A {{half hour}} later a naked giant, {{swinging}} easily through the lower branches of the trees, paused, and with raised head, and dilating nostrils sniffed <b>the</b> morning <b>air.</b> <b>The</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> blood fell strong upon his senses, and mingled with it was the scent of Numa, the lion.

60|$|My dearest Fanny,--A {{letter from}} me will have crossed yours and told {{you of all}} our misadventures. It has been a summer to me full of blots, vexations, anxieties; and if, in spite of everything, I am {{physically}} stronger for <b>the</b> fresh <b>air</b> and <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> green leaves, that's a proof that soul and body are two.|$|R
60|$|Comely beeches send {{up their}} white, straight, {{clustered}} branches, barred with green moss, {{like so many}} fingers from a half-clenched hand. Mighty oaks stand to the ankles in a fine tracery of underwood; thence the tall shaft climbs upward, and the great forest of stalwart boughs spreads out into the golden evening sky, where the rooks are flying and calling. On the sward of the Bois d'Hyver the firs stand well asunder with outspread arms, like fencers saluting; and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> resin all around, {{and the sound of}} the axe is rarely still. But strangest of all, and in appearance oldest of all, are the dim and wizard upland districts of young wood. The ground is carpeted with fir-tassel, and strewn with fir-apples and flakes of fallen bark. Rocks lie crouching in the thicket, guttered with rain, tufted with lichen, white with years and the rigours of the changeful seasons. Brown and yellow butterflies are sown and carried away again by the light air--like thistledown. The loneliness of these coverts is so excessive, that there are moments when pleasure draws to the verge of fear. You listen and listen for some noise to break the silence, till you grow half mesmerised by the intensity of the strain; your sense of your own identity is troubled; your brain reels, like that of some gymnosophist poring on his own nose in Asiatic jungles; and should you see your own outspread feet, you see them, not as anything of yours, but as a feature of the scene around you.|$|R
6000|$|We {{climbed the}} {{staircase}} where dim light lay so invitingly, and came presently {{to a little}} darker chamber. Green, blunt things had pushed and burst through <b>the</b> casement. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> faintly-sour <b>of</b> brier, and was as still as boughs of snow. There the not-unhappy Princess reclined before a looking-glass, whither I suppose she had run to view her own alarm when the sharp needle pierced her thumb. All alarm was stilled now on her face. She, one might think, of all that company of the sleepy, {{was the only one}} that dreamed. Her youthful lips lay a little asunder; the heavy beauty of her hair was parted on her forehead; her childish hands sidled together like leverets in her lap. [...] "Why!" [...] I cried aloud, almost involuntarily, [...] "she breathes!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} low inside the house, and so dim, with the closed blinds, {{that they could}} {{scarcely}} see one another: Editha tall and black in her crapes which filled <b>the</b> <b>air</b> with <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> their dyes; her father standing decorously apart with his hat on his forearm, as at funerals; a woman rested in a deep arm-chair, {{and the woman who}} had let the strangers in stood behind the chair.|$|R

But for my Lord, thy mother, and my poor folk, I would gladly go with thee to strike honest downright blows at a foe I could see and feel, rather than be nothing better than a warder, and be driven distracted with women's tongues. Why, they have even set {{division}} between my Lord and his son Gilbert, who was ever the dearest to him. Young as he is, methinks Diccon would be better away with thee than where <b>the</b> very <b>air</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> plots and lies." ...|$|R
6000|$|Darkness had enveloped us at supper time. I {{was tired}} out, but the red-embered camp-fire, <b>the</b> cool <b>air,</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> wood-smoke, {{and the white}} stars kept me awake awhile. Romer {{had to be put}} to bed. He was wild with excitement. We had had a sleeping-bag made for him so that once snugly in it, with the flaps buckled he could not kick off the blankets. When we got him into it he quieted down and took {{exceeding}} interest in his first bed in the open. He did not, however, go quickly to sleep. Presently he called R.C. over and whispered: [...] "Say, Uncle Rome, I coiled a lasso an' put it under Nielsen's bed. When he's asleep you go pull it. He's tenderfoot like Dad was. He'll think it's a rattlesnake." [...] This trick Romer must have remembered from reading [...] "The Last of the Plainsmen," [...] where I related what Buffalo Jones' cowboys did to me. Once Romer got that secret off his mind he fell asleep.|$|R

6000|$|All that long, silent jog {{home with}} Winton in fading daylight, she felt very happy--saturated with <b>air</b> and elation. <b>The</b> trees and fields, the hay-stacks, gates, and ponds beside the lanes grew dim; lights {{came up in}} the cottage windows; <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>smelled</b> sweet <b>of</b> wood smoke. And, for the first time all day, she thought of Fiorsen, thought of him almost longingly. If he could be there in the cosy old drawing-room, to play to her while she lay back--drowsing, dreaming by the fire in the scent of burning cedar logs--the Mozart minuet, or that little heart-catching tune of Poise, played the first time she heard him, or a dozen other of the things he played unaccompanied! That would be the most lovely ending to this lovely day. Just the glow and warmth wanting, to make all perfect--the glow and warmth of music and adoration! ...|$|R

60|$|So I {{was driven}} back to Argueil, the red-tiled, sleepy old town, with its great gaunt church, whose windows, as the lumbering cart descended the hill, were stained blood-red by the dying sunset. Behind, on the hillside, was the convent, with its avenue of stunted elms, its close-barred windows, its terrible prison-like silence. As I looked behind, {{holding on to}} the sides of the springless cart to avoid being jostled into the road, I found myself shivering. The convent boarding-schools which I had heard of had been very {{different}} sort of places. Even after my brief visit there this return into <b>the</b> fresh country <b>air,</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the fields, the colour and life of the rolling landscape, were blessed things. I was more than ever satisfied with my decision. It was not possible to send the child back to such a place.|$|R

Walking to her provisions she is immediately met by her cousin who tells her that they will not let him on board the ship. He assures her that Captain Shore will attempt to calm down his crew and will return in the morning to take them both on board. Unca and her cousin sit down to eat and he relates the fantastical claim of the crew: that they had seen her fly, filling <b>the</b> <b>air</b> with <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> brimstone. Captain Shore challenged their claims saying that they are mutineers, but the crew insists that they are not, they just refuse to have the She-Devil or her friends on board.

6000|$|The portals were {{at length}} unbarred and lugged apart over the gravel, and Maitland {{followed}} the cook (for {{she was no}} one less) and the candle {{up to the front}} door. He gave his card, and was ushered into the chamber reserved for interviews with parents and guardians. The drawing-room had <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and faint <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> a room very seldom occupied. All the chairs were so elegantly and cunningly constructed that they tilted up at intervals, and threw out the unwary male who trusted himself to their hospitality. Their backs were decorated with antimacassars wrought with glass beads, and these, in the light of one dip, shone fitfully with a frosty lustre. On the round table in the middle were volumes of [...] "The Mothers of England," [...] "The Grandmothers of the Bible," [...] Blair [...] "On the Grave," [...] and [...] "The Epic of Hades," [...] the latter copiously and appropriately illustrated. In addition to these cheerful volumes there were large tomes of lake and river scenery, with gilt edges and faded magenta bindings, shrouded from the garish light of day in drab paper covers.|$|R
6000|$|But Noel was gone. She walked towards Charing Cross; and, to kill time, {{went into}} a {{restaurant}} and had that simple repast, coffee and a bun, which those in love would always take if Society did not forcibly feed them on other things. Food was ridiculous to her. She {{sat there in the}} midst of a perfect hive of creatures eating hideously. The place was shaped like a modern prison, having tiers of gallery round an open space, and in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> was <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> viands and the clatter of plates and the music of a band. Men in khaki everywhere, and Noel glanced from form to form to see if by chance one might be that which represented, for her, Life and the British Army. At half-past eight she went out and made her way: through the crowd, still mechanically searching [...] "khaki" [...] for what she wanted; and it was perhaps fortunate that there was about her face and walk something which touched people. At the station she went up to an old porter, and, putting a shilling into his astonished hand, asked him to find out for her whence Morland's regiment would start. He came back presently, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|As long as I was on {{the path}} I walked hard, but when I came to the black beach I had to run. For the tide was now nearly flowed; and to get through with my powder dry between the surf and the steep hill, took all the quickness I possessed. As it was, even, the wash caught me to the knees, and I came near falling on a stone. All this time the hurry I was in, and <b>the</b> free <b>air</b> and <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea, kept my spirits lively; but when I was once in the bush and began to climb the path I took it easier. The fearsomeness of the wood {{had been a good}} bit rubbed off for me by Master Case's banjo-strings and graven images, yet I thought it was a dreary walk, and guessed, when the disciples went up there, they must be badly scared. The light of the lantern, {{striking}} among all these trunks and forked branches and twisted rope-ends of lianas, made the whole place, or all that you could see of it, a kind of a puzzle of turning shadows. They came to meet you, solid and quick like giants, and then span off and vanished; they hove up over your head like clubs, and flew away into the night like birds. The floor of the bush glimmered with dead wood, the way the match-box used to shine after you had struck a lucifer. Big, cold drops fell on me from the branches overhead like sweat. There was no wind to mention; only a little icy breath of a land-breeze that stirred nothing; and the harps were silent.|$|R
50|$|As {{the palace}} {{became the center}} of {{administration}} and justice in France, the kings began to spend less and less time there. Between 1190 and 1202, Philip II built the massive fortress of the Louvre, designed to protect the Right Bank of the Seine against an English attack from Normandy. The fortress was a great rectangle, 72 by 78 meters, surrounded by four towers and a moat. In the center was a circular tower thirty meters high. It was the anchor on the Right Bank of the new wall he built around the city. Philip began to use the new castle for recreation and also for ceremonial functions; the vassals of the king took their oath of loyalty at the Louvre rather than the city palace. Between 1361 and 1364, Charles V, distrustful of the turbulent Parisians and offended by <b>the</b> foul <b>air</b> and <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval city, decided to move his residence permanently from the Île de la Cité to a safer and healthier location. He built a new residential complex in the Saint-Antoine quarter between the wall built by Philip II and the Bastille, the most powerful fortress of the new wall that he was building around the city. The new residence, called the Hôtel Saint-Pol, covered a large area between the Rue Saint Antoine and the Seine and the Rue Saint-Paul and Rue du Petit-Musc. It was the site of the notorious Bal des Ardents in 1393, when the elaborate costumes of four dancers, all members of the nobility, caught fire and burned them to death, while Charles VI, one of the dancers, barely escaped. Charles VII abandoned it when he fled Paris in 1418. By 1519, the buildings were in ruins and torn down soon afterwards. The church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis was built on the site.|$|R
