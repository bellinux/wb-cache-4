The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controller,</b> which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controller,</b> are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E

50|$|To achieve {{such a high}} {{specific}} impulse and pressure in combustion chamber as RD-270 has, two circuits of full-flow staged combustion cycle were applied. The pair of turbines with preburners turns the fuel into the gaseous form and circulates all of the fuel components. One of the turbines uses the fuel-rich gas to power a fuel pump, another one uses the oxidizer-rich gas to power the oxidizer pump. As a result, the main combustion chamber (MCC) burns only generator gas. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> regulates {{the functions of the}} two independent fuel and oxidizer circuits.|$|E
50|$|Jet engines produce reduced thrust as {{the ambient}} air {{temperature}} increases. The flex temp {{is the highest}} air temperature at which the engines would produce the required thrust. The crew finds that temperature and enters it into the flight management system (FMS) â effectively telling the computer to assume the specified air temperature instead of the actual temperature. When flex (FLX) thrust is selected during take off, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> produces maximum thrust for the assumed (flex) temperature. If necessary, the crew can push the throttles into the Take Off/Go Around (TOGA) detent and request full power.|$|E

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAV) require {{intelligent control}} of their power source. Small UAV are typically powered by electric motors or small two-stroke internal combustion (IC) engines. Small IC engines allow for longer flight times but {{are more difficult to}} control and cause significant ground noise. A hybrid operation that uses <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at high altitudes and the electric motors at low altitudes is desired. This would allow for extended flight with acceptable ground noise levels. Since <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> can not be restarted in the air it must be able to remain at idle for an extended time without stalling. A feedback controller is created for an OS 160 FX carbureted two-stroke <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>controller</b> implements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithm to regulate the rotational speed of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> shaft. <b>The</b> <b>controller</b> also monitors the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and is capable of monitoring the altitude of the aircraft.

50|$|A {{flameout}} {{is believed}} to be most likely to occur when flying through certain weather conditions at a low power setting such as flight idle (e.g. during the descent).

Alternatively, <b>the</b> FADEC <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> will select ignition automatically if it detects specific changes in engine parameters. It will also perform a relight if necessary.

50|$|GlidingÂ is an {{energy-efficient}} driving operating mode of a motor vehicle, turning off theÂ internal combustion engineÂ when driving to save fuel. CoastingÂ is disengaging the engine from the wheels in idle mode by disengaging the clutch or setting the transmission or gearbox to neutral position,Â using the acceleratedÂ kinetic energyÂ to keep the vehicle going, but lose speed {{to the existing}} drag. In hybrid electric vehiclesÂ this functionality {{is part of the}} concept and performed automatically by <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controller.</b> Vehicles with a conventional internal combustion engine, coasting can be performed manually, gliding when having a gear box.Â It is illegal in some states. An extra button to stop the engineÂ was shown in 1979 on International Motor Show Germany,Â but newer standard in any vehicle.Â A so-calledÂ eClutch (electronic controlled clutch) uses an actuatorÂ to disengage the clutch when the driver leaved the accelerator.|$|E

40|$|A Hybrid Power Lab is {{established}} at the Marine Technology Centre by MARINTEK, ABB and NTNU. This is a DC-grid system where variable speed generators are essential {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions. The traditional constant speed controller does not have the flexibility to use the full potential of this system. Therefore {{it would be interesting to}} create a platform for testing different controller concepts in the Hybrid Power Lab. In this thesis such a control platform is designed and implemented for a 255 kW Perkins diesel <b>engine</b> in <b>the</b> Hybrid Power Lab. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> offers a flexible platform for testing different controller concepts with its hydraulic/electrical controlled fuel system. The main objective is to develop an <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> for <b>the</b> Perkins <b>engine</b> and test it on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> with variable speed and zero generator load. Method used for creating the controller is a review of diesel engine performance parameters and diesel engine control. In addition a reverse-engineering method is used to collect data from <b>the</b> original <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> at different speed and load levels. The behavior of the original controller is then mirrored into the developed controller for testing on <b>the</b> Perkins <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> collected data include all the parameters important to engine speed control: engine speed and angular position of crankshaft, injector control oil pressure, injector current, start of injection and injection duration. <b>The</b> developed <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> algorithms calculate <b>the</b> crankshaft speed and angular position to determine at what point fuel shall be admitted into the cylinders. The algorithms also control fuel injection pressure, injector current by a pulse width modulated signal, start of injection and injection duration. Test runs for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> have been done with the new controller. In running mode <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> speed is automatically controlled by the controller at a desired setpoint. The test confirms that the developed controller is able to control <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> speed by changing the amount of fuel injected into the cylinders. A too late injection resulted in white smoke from the exhaust and by starting the injection earlier the white smoke disappeared. Recommendations for further work are listed at the end of the document. One item that will be mentioned here is <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> coolant temperature, which has a large influence on the controlled parameters and should therefore be studied further to improve the control algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft engines can be {{effective}} actuators to help pilots avert or recover from emergency situations. Emergency control modes are being developed to enhance the engines performance to increase the probability of recovery under these circumstances. This paper discusses a proposed implementation of an architecture that requests emergency propulsion control modes, allowing the engines to deliver additional performance in emergency situations while still ensuring a specified safety level. In {{order to determine the}} appropriate level of engine performance enhancement, information regarding the current emergency scenario (including severity) and current engine health must be known. This enables the engine to operate beyond its nominal range while minimizing overall risk to the aircraft. In this architecture, the flight controller is responsible for determining the severity of the event and the level of engine risk that is acceptable, while <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> is responsible for delivering the desired performance within the specified risk range. A control mode selector specifies an appropriate situation-specific enhanced mode, which <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> then implements. The enhanced control modes described in this paper provide additional engine thrust or response capabilities through the modification of gains, limits, and the control algorithm, but increase the risk of engine failure. The modifications made to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> to enable the use of the enhanced control modes are described, as are the interaction between the various subsystems and importantly, the interaction between the flight controller/pilot and the propulsion control system.
