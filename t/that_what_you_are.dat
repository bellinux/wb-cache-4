500|$|The Allied fleet {{sailed to}} Salamis, {{off the coast}} of Attica, to assist with the {{evacuation}} of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Florida Department of Children and Families {{has been}} heavily criticized for their {{handling}} of the Barahona case. Judge Cindy Lederman expressed outrage at the actions of Andrea Fleary, a DCF worker assigned to the case. On Thursday, February 10, Fleary visited the Barahona home to investigate an abuse hotline call, but despite not making contact with the children, she reported they were safe. When Fleary told the judge about 11-year-old Jorge's attempts to alert her to abuse on Friday, she said the conversations had taken place late in the evening. Judge Lederman responded [...] "So we don't do investigations on weekends? Is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> telling me?" [...] Fleary responded that she had stopped her investigation at 9pm because [...] "we don't do investigations on weekends." ...|$|E

60|$|AN OLD RESIDENT: You're {{a credit}} to your country, sir, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Prosecutor: In other words, {{it never}} {{occurred}} to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> doing was a crime? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're very considerate. But if <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going for, <b>you</b> {{might as}} well stay. I'm {{not going to do}} {{anything}} whatever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give her the chance," [...] Grizel continued, [...] "and if {{you find}} it hard, you must {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing is for her good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. You {{need not}} be afraid that {{anything}} very great will be thrust upon you. But {{it seems to me}} <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> most fitted for is a lawyer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jim said he {{knew the}} road and the lamps would burn until he got home; and Bernard resumed: [...] "I expect you know <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing at the marsh won't make you popular." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve been {{watching}} from the back window," [...] he said, nodding. [...] "You’re a wonder; <b>that’s</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Come and look at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said Mr. Carter. [...] "You're mistaking me for {{somebody}} else, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing. <b>What</b> am I {{supposed to have}} done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "High-strung but reasonable, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Killeny Boy, high-strung but reasonable," [...] he {{continued}} to mumble as Kwaque helped to roll him into his bunk.|$|R
6000|$|Then he of the mallet began again. [...] "You do most solemnly swear <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{about to}} give before the court shall be the truth, the whole truth, {{and nothing but the}} truth, so help you God?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{is a long}} word, Allan, and I {{dare say}} <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> so sure is {{impossible}} will happen after all," [...] words that made me angry enough at the time, though in after years I often thought of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{does the}} white lord do that?" [...] asked Babemba. [...] "Now I {{see that you}} are truly deceiving me, and <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> giving me to swallow is nothing but hot mwavi, which in the {{innocent}} causes vomiting, but that in those who mean evil, death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! drat your {{conscience}} and blow your duty. You're a spy and a backbiting tell-tale, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Did <b>you</b> never kiss a girl yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{thinking}} of," [...] Iris said, [...] "when you {{allowed me}} to translate English into French for you, and never told me the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{think your}} flowers <b>are</b> wonderful! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> a real genius, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are!</b> I am only a common girl; I can't do things as you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, my dear child. I {{mean that}} you cannot fail to remember, if you reflect for a single moment, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> pleased to {{compliment}} me upon feeling {{in the case of}} Mr Boffin, you have yourself confided to me as your own feeling in the case of Mrs Boffin.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{man with}} the mallet raised {{his right hand and}} said glibly, [...] "You do most solemnly swear <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> about to give before the court--" [...] He {{abruptly}} stopped and glowered at the man before him. [...] "Take off your hat!" [...] he roared, and a snicker went up from the crowd as the man obeyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Esmond {{is willing}} to promise {{that if you go}} home {{straightway}} no proceedings will be taken against any man for his share in this night's work. He will promise you nothing further, and I may say that in this I quite concur with him. I must warn you <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing is a very serious thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ll put you ashore at Bystermouth," [...] {{said the}} skipper, with a grin. [...] "You’re a deserter, <b>that’s</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> and I’ll take care you’re took care of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that all? Is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> whimpering on {{your knees}} about?" [...] says the old lady, growing angry. [...] "You might have kept the news till to-morrow." ...|$|R
60|$|STRAKER. I dunno {{about the}} bee and the spider. But the marked down victim, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and no mistake; and a jolly good job for you, too, I should say.|$|R
6000|$|... "With all my heart, sir! This is the point. I attach {{considerable}} importance--if {{nothing else}} can be done--to having Miss Gwilt privately looked after, {{as long as}} she stops at Thorpe Ambrose. It struck me just now at the door, Mr. Armadale, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not willing to do for your own security, you might be willing to do for the security of another person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} I quite understand," [...] {{she said after}} a moment or two, whilst he waited calmly until her out-break of hysterical mirth had subsided. [...] "You want my husband--the Scarlet Pimpernel, citizen--to deliver the little King of France to you after he has risked his life to save the child out of your clutches? Is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> trying to say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--I am {{sure you}} do. It is <b>that,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> convinces me you do. Even the {{remarkable}} and sensible explanation you gave of it when you interpreted {{the parable of the}} talents is not so powerful as the impression that you yourself believe after thinking it out for yourself--not accepting the old explanations. And then," [...] she added, with a note as of surprise, [...] "you are willing to sacrifice everything for it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{know and}} don't care. Don't care <b>what</b> anybody thinks--but <b>you.</b> You're my only {{landmark}} these days. You're my sun, moon, and stars, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> I set my watch by you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But what proof have I? Was <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} say? None. But I had the {{information}} from the man himself. He told me in the train that night going to London.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then why don't {{you make}} your fortune by hiring {{yourself}} out to a museum as the biggest human clam in captivity? <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> sit there just saying [...] "Thanks," [...] and [...] "Bai Jawve, thanks awf'lly," [...] while a girl's telling you nice things about your eyes and hair, and you don't do a thing!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{if you go}} into this, young man, you go into it {{with your}} eyes open. You go into it with a full {{understanding}} of the risks--because you think the reward, if you are successful, makes the taking of those risks worth while. You and I know <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing isn't really stealing; it's simply a tactful way of getting back my own property. But the judge and jury will have different views." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wolf (to the Chair, in a stentorian voice which cleaves its {{way through}} the storm). 'It is by such brutalities as these that you drive us to extremities! Are you waiting till someone shall throw into your face the word that shall {{describe}} what you are bringing about?(1) (Tempest of insulted fury from the Right.) Is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> waiting for, old Grayhead?' (Long-continued clatter of desk-boards from the Left, with shouts of 'The vote! the vote!' An ironical shout from the Right, 'Wolf is boss!') ...|$|E
60|$|THE COUNT. [smiling as he recovers {{from his}} alarm] I understand. She {{has taken the}} costumes into her own hands. She {{is an expert in}} {{beautiful}} costumes. I venture to promise you, Mr Savoyard, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> about to see will be like a Louis Quatorze ballet painted by Watteau. The heroine will be an exquisite Columbine, her lover a dainty Harlequin, her father a picturesque Pantaloon, and the valet who hoodwinks the father and brings about the happiness of the lovers a grotesque but perfectly tasteful Punchinello or Mascarille or Sganarelle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you 'elped {{me start}} it," [...] said the other. [...] "You're afraid, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> afraid. <b>You</b> can let the boy go down there, {{but when it}} comes to yourselves you turn chicken-'arted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So! <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> after," [...] he said, {{laying a}} heavy hand on Babalatchi's {{yielding}} shoulder. [...] "You thought I {{came here to}} murder him. Hey? Speak! You faithful dog of an Arab trader!" ...|$|R
6000|$|MINNIE. Why wouldn't I have a {{good time}}? <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> having,--a good time with me,--wasn't it? And say, did you ever stop to think what one day of a working girl's life was like? ...|$|R
