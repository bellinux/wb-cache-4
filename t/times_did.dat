The delegation included two track and field athletes, Benjamín Enzema and Bibiana Olama who both qualified for the Games via wildcard places because their fastest <b>times</b> <b>did</b> not meet the required qualification standards.

5|$|Rubidium, like {{sodium and}} potassium, almost always has +1 {{oxidation}} state when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions {{as if they}} were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's intracellular fluid (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 <b>times</b> <b>did</b> not show negative effects in test persons. The biological half-life of rubidium in humans measures 31–46days. Although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible, when more than 50% of the potassium in the muscle tissue of rats was replaced with rubidium, the rats died.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium {{in the body}} mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 <b>times</b> <b>did</b> not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E

25|$|The same year, Ryan {{was cast}} in the action thriller Proof of Life with Russell Crowe, {{directed}} by Taylor Hackford. In the film, she portrayed the distraught wife of a kidnapped engineer, played by David Morse, while relying on a resourceful troubleshooter who makes a profession of dealing with international bandits. While the film became a lukewarm critical and commercial success, grossing $63million worldwide, it garnered much reportage in the tabloid press in association with Ryan and Crowe's affair. Stephen Holden, film critic for The New York <b>Times,</b> <b>did</b> not think the film worked well and opined that the actors did not connect.|$|E
25|$|Her tenure is {{credited}} with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the Kennedy and Johnson administration, working to ensure that The New York <b>Times</b> <b>did</b> not surpass its Washington reporting of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate scandal. During this time, Katharine Graham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40 million in 1984. Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the Post newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan {{accounted for more than}} 60% of the entire company revenue stream.|$|E
25|$|Roberts in 1996 {{passed the}} hundred-novel mark with Montana Sky and in 2012 doubled that with The Witness. In both 1999 and 2000, {{four of the}} five novels that USA Today listed as the best-selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first {{appearance}} on The New York Times Bestseller List came in 1991, and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 New York Times Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. The New York <b>Times</b> <b>did</b> not review any of those novels. In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to Publishers Weekly, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, as her romance Time and Again was number one, and her J.D. Robb release Seduction in Death was number two.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} bodies at {{multiple}} times at Key West {{has led to}} confusion over how many bodies from the Maine are buried there. The New York <b>Times</b> <b>did</b> not report the number of dead at Key West, but said only two had been identified. In 1912, the Army Quartermaster Corps reported that there were just 19 bodies at Key West. But other published sources vary quite widely. The National Geographic Society reported 22 bodies in 2012. A number of sources cite 24 bodies. In May 1898, the Washington Post reported 24 bodies buried at Key West. It said two were identified, an African American and a Japanese mess attendant. In 1997, the Associated Press also that 24 bodies were buried at Key West, of whom seven were identified. In 2009, the Key News newspaper also reported 24 bodies at Key West, including that of Coal Passer John Ziegler. A wide range of other sources have also cited 24 bodies at Key West. Some sources say 25 bodies are buried there, others 26, and several others 27.|$|E
