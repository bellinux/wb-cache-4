METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiograms were acquired in 247 healthy volunteers (139 women, 44 years [standard deviation, 16 years old] (range, 18 - 80 years).

50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{non-invasive}} bubble detection include <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography,</b> but Doppler {{appears to be}} more sensitive and picks up smaller bubbles. Two dimensional imaging can provide a cross-sectional view along a single plane of all four chambers of the heart, and therefore, unlike Doppler, which assesses blood prior to primary filtration by the lungs, can also assess blood which will be circulated systemically. Echocardiography equipment has developed from bulky laboratory equipment to portable battery-powered with sufficient resolution suitable for field studies. Transthoracic echocardiography is suitable for the sampling used in decompression studies to identify highly reflective gas bubbles. Detection of venous gas bubbles by ultrasound imaging is a sensitive, but not specific, predictor of adverse effects of decompression, similar to the published relationship between Doppler detected bubbles and decompression sickness.|$|E
50|$|Surgery is {{not always}} an option when the anatomy of the {{malformation}} creates {{too much of a}} risk. Recent improvements in endovascular procedures have made many cases, which were not surgically accessible, treatable. Endovascular treatments involve delivering drugs, balloons, or coils {{to the site of the}} malformation through blood vessels via catheters. These treatments work by limiting blood flow through the vein. There is, however, still risk of complications from endovascular treatments. The wall of the vein can be damaged during the procedure and, in some cases, the emboli can become dislodged and travel through the vascular system. <b>Two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> with color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate one fetus and five neonates with a Vein of Galen malformation. Color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography provided anatomical and pathophysiological information regarding cardiac hemodynamics and intracranial blood flow; with the patient's clinical status, these methods provided a reliable, noninvasive means to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and the need for further treatment in neonates with Vein of Galen malformations.

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> is {{superior}} to M-mode echocardiography for estimation of left ventricular mass when left ventricular shape is markedly abnormal. Left ventricular mass measurement by <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> depends on careful experimental calibration of the echocardiographic instrument using either a standard phantom or actual heart slices, an appropriate geometric algorithm, and short axis images to determine myocardial cross-sectional. area. Several well-validated algorithms are available, of which the short-axis area-length technique is the simplest. In hypertensive heart disease, in which left ventricular shape is usually close to normal, <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> may offer a smaller standard error than M-mode, but this issue requires further evaluation. Further, it is uncertain whether the incremental accuracy of <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> in hypertensive heart disease would offset its increased cost and complexity relative to M-mode echocardiography.

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare three-dimensional echocardiography, <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> and cineventriculography for the purpose of measuring left ventricular volume in vitro. Background. Three-dimensional echocardiographic systems {{have been shown to be}} highly accurate in measuring the volumes of balloon phantoms, However, three-dimensional techniques have not been compared with standard <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> in vitro or with cineventriculography, the clinical standard for left ventricular volume measurement. Methods. Excised porcine hearts were prepared with an internal latex sheath that could be filled and maintained with a known (“true”) volume of liquid. Each heart was then imaged by cineventriculography, standard <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> and three-dimensional echocardiography. Left ventricular volumes were calculated from 15 hearts at 25 volumes ranging from 50 to 280 ml by the following methods: 1) biplane cineventriculography using the area-length method; 2) <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> by the apical biplane method using a summation of discs algorithm in 15 cases and the single-plane, four-chamber method using a summation of discs algorithm in 10 cases; and 3) three-dimensional echocardiography using a polyhedral surface reconstruction volume computation algorithm based on multiple nonparallel, nonevenly spaced short-axis cross sections. Results. Results were compared with true volume, and a nonparametric analysis of variance was performed. Both measurement bias (systematic error) and imprecision (random error) were assessed. All methods tended to underestimate the true volume (<b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> − 6. 1 ± 17. 6 %, three-dimensional echocardiography − 4. 7 ± 5. 0 % and biplane cineventriculography − 3. 9 ± 8. 2 %), although differences were not significant. Although there was a significant correlation between the magnitude of measurement bias and the size of the volume being measured for <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> and cineventriculography, the bias of three-dimensional echocardiography was fairly constant over the range of volumes. When bias was accounted for, <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>echocardiography</b> was significantly less precise than cineventriculography and three-dimensional echocardiography in terms of percent error (15. 3 ± 11. 9 %, 5. 6 ± 5. 7 % and 3. 9 ± 3. 4 %, respectively). Conclusions. Three-dimensional echocardiography using a polyhedral surface reconstruction algorithm for volume computation provides accuracy comparable to that of biplane cineventri-culography in this in vitro model. Standard two-dimensional echocardiographic volume computation is significantly less accurate than the other two methods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Amyloidosis is {{a disease}} caused by {{deposits}} of insoluble fibrils in extracellular spaces. The {{most common type of}} familial amyloidosis is mediated by mutation of transthyretin, especially Val 30 Met. Symptoms and ejection fraction decrease may occur in cardiac amyloidosis only in case of poor prognosis. Myocardial strain detected by <b>two-dimensional</b> speckle tracking <b>echocardiography</b> can indicate changes in myocardial function at early stages of the disease. Objective: To determine the accuracy of left ventricular longitudinal strain by <b>two-dimensional</b> speckle tracking <b>echocardiography</b> in patients with familial amyloidosis caused by Val 30 Met transthyretin mutation. Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients, carriers of transthyretin mutation, were evaluated by <b>two-dimensional</b> speckle tracking <b>echocardiography,</b> by which myocardial strain curves were obtained, following the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations. Results: Patients were divided into three groups: 1 - Val 30 Met with cardiac amyloidosis; 2 -Val 30 Met with extracardiac amyloidosis; 3 - Val 30 Met without evidence of disease. As the three groups were compared by the Mann-Whitney test, we found a statistically significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in the mean longitudinal tension (p= 0. 01), mean basal longitudinal strain (p= 0. 014); in mean longitudinal tension and mean longitudinal strain between groups 1 and 3 (p= 0. 005); and in the ratio of longitudinal strain of apical septum segment to longitudinal strain of basal septum (p= 0. 041) between groups 2 and 3.
