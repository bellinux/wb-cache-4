40|$|For several decades, the key {{challenge}} {{associated with}} <b>thermochemical</b> <b>hydrogen</b> generation {{has been the}} achievement of water splitting and catalyst regeneration at low temperatures while maintaining a reasonably high conversion efficiency over many cycles. Herein, we report low-temperature <b>thermochemical</b> <b>hydrogen</b> generation using hierarchically assembled iron oxide nanoarchitectures.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} two {{technology}} and policy issues {{directly related to}} hydrogen economy. The first issue concentrates on the end-use application of hydrogen as a transportation fuel, and deals with the following question: what is the place of {{hydrogen fuel cell vehicles}} among the new, more-efficient advanced vehicle technologies. Our analysis indicates that fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen from fossils fuels offer no significant energy efficiency advantage over hybrid vehicles in urban driving cycle. Therefore, there is a strong justification for federal support for hybrid vehicles that will achieve similar results, quicker. The second issue focuses on another important technology and policy question related to large scale hydrogen production: are there any comparative efficiency, cost and/or political advantages of using an advanced nuclear reactor coupled to a thermochemical conversion plant to produce hydrogen with respect using a conventional nuclear reactor coupled to an electrolysis plant? The results suggest that given the existing technical and cost uncertainties, developing an advanced nuclear reactor technology solely for the use of <b>thermochemical</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production is not good energy (R&D) policy. Electrolysis is a more promising alternative provided a more efficient electrolysis technology can be coupled to an advanced nuclear energy (i. e. electricity) source at a reasonable cost. Therefore, large R&D investment in <b>thermochemical</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production should be balanced with a similar R&D in large scale electrolysis technologies that are relatively easier to deploy and have lower engineering risks. by Nurettin Demirdöven.

With commitments for a hydrogen village, a hydrogen airport and a hydrogen corridor, Ontario has already begun to move toward a hydrogen-fueled economy. However, a key missing element is a large-scale method of hydrogen production. As a carbon-based technology, the predominant existing process (steam-methane reforming (SMR)) is unsuitable.

This exothermal reaction {{can be divided into}} two steps: firstly, the evaporation of liquid sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) at about 400 °C forming sulfur trioxide (SO 3), and secondly, the decomposition of SO 3 to sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and oxygen (O 2) at 800 – 1000 °C. While the first sub-reaction has fast kinetics, the second one is rather slow and requires the introduction of catalysts to achieve sufficient conversion.

40|$|As {{renewable}} energy production becomes more prevalent, the challenge of producing renewable dispatchable fuel for the transportation sector remains unresolved. One promising approach is to produce hydrogen from solar energy with a two step thermochemical cycle which utilizes an oxygen storage material (OSM) to split water through two reversible reactions. Due to the strong coupling between reactor design, operational parameters, and OSM properties, the direct comparison of two OSMs is not straightforward. In order to guide the designs of OSMs for two-step <b>thermochemical</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production, a methodology is developed to model the max performance possible for a two-step thermochemical cycle. The novel contribution of this model considers the strong coupling between reactor operation, OSM properties, and reactor performance. Next, a method for screening and evaluating new OSMs which utilizes thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is proposed. With this data, the modeling method previously developed is applied to determine maximum reactor efficiency possible with new materials. This allows many materials to be evaluated quickly, and facilitates further characterization new OSMs. Additionally, by comparing the predicted maximum efficiency of a new material with the efficiency of current ones, this method facilitates the comparison of two different OSMs on equal footing.

40|$|Decomposition of {{sulphuric acid}} {{is a key}} step of sulphur based <b>thermochemical</b> cycles for <b>hydrogen</b> {{production}} by thermal splitting of water. The Hybrid Sulphur Cycle (HyS) consisting of two reaction steps [1] is considered {{as one of the}} most promising cycles: Firstly, sulphuric acid is decomposed by high temperature heat of 800 - 1200 °C forming sulphur dioxide (SO 2), which in a second step is used to electrochemically split water. Compared to conventional water electrolysis only about a tenth of the theoretical voltage is required making the HyS one of the most efficient processes to produce hydrogen by concentrated solar radiation [2]. As a result, this thermochemical cycle has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of energy required for water splitting and to efficiently generate hydrogen free of carbon dioxide emissions.
