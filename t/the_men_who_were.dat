5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 {{were found}} guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court martial of the Korean War. The Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the {{sentences}} and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> court martialed were pardoned, there is currently a campaign for a formal exoneration.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August 1861, a {{nomination}} meeting {{was held for}} {{the election of a}} Canterbury Superintendent, and to fill the four positions on the Provincial Council available in the City of Christchurch electorate. Moorhouse was returned unopposed as Superintendent, and ten candidates were nominated for the Provincial Council. The election was held the next day, and Brittan topped the polls with 140 votes, followed by Isaac Thomas Cookson with 139, Frederick Thompson with 114, and Richard Westenra with 100, these being <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> elected. Isaac Luck, Edward Reece, George Wilmer, William Barnard, John Cracroft Wilson, and Richard Taylor were defeated.|$|E

5|$|Prior to World War II, {{traditional}} Hispanic {{cultural values}} expected {{women to be}} homemakers, thus they rarely left the home to earn an income. As such, women were discouraged from joining the military. Only {{a small number of}} Hispanic women joined the military before World War II. However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to change. With the creation of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, women such as Corporal Maria (Torres) Maes could attend to certain administrative duties left open by <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> reassigned to combat zones. After completing boot camp at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, she was sent to Quartermaster School and assigned to the Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{breakdown}} of the 65th resulted {{from a number of}} factors: a shortage of officers and non-commissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactical doctrine that led to high casualties, a shortage of artillery ammunition, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of Continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights. Though <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> court martialed were pardoned, a campaign for a formal exoneration was launched.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the cathedral, {{including}} the chapter house, was finished in 1306, {{it was already too}} small for the developing liturgy, and unable to accommodate increasingly grand processions of clergy. Bishop John Droxford initiated another phase of building under master mason Thomas of Whitney, during which the central tower was heightened and an eight-sided Lady chapel was added at the east end by 1326. Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed, continuing the eastward extension of the choir and retrochoir beyond. He oversaw the building of Vicars' Close and the Vicars' Hall, to give <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> employed to sing in the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town and its temptations. He had an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes, and he surrounded his palace with crenellated walls, a moat and a drawbridge.|$|E

5|$|Daily {{routine of}} life in the {{trenches}} began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, {{it was time for the}} men to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive, sleep deprivation was common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E
5|$|The Plum River raid was a bloodless {{skirmish}} {{that occurred}} at present-day Savanna, Illinois, on May 21, 1832, {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. Most of the settlement's inhabitants, except for a few defenders, had fled for Galena, Illinois, before the raid happened. A small band of Native Americans, either Sauk or Fox, attacked the settlement while only three of the six defenders were present. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> present fell back to the blockhouse and a firefight ensued for about one hour, after which the attackers withdrew. No one was killed or injured during the attack, but in its aftermath Colonel James M. Strode dispatched a detachment of militia to Savanna. They returned to Galena without incident and the settlement at Savanna was temporarily abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On July 3, Pemberton sent {{a note to}} Grant {{regarding}} the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, {{as he had done}} at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. But Grant reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 hungry Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute state, dejected and starving, he never expected them to fight again; he hoped they would carry home the stigma of defeat {{to the rest of the}} Confederacy. In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. Most of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges during the war except for hardship cases.|$|E

However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to change. With the creation of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), predecessor of the Women's Army Corps (WAC), and the U.S. Navy Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES), women could attend to certain administrative duties left open by <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> reassigned to combat zones. While most women who served in the military joined the WAACs, a smaller number of women served in the Naval Women's Reserve (the WAVES). One of the first Hispanic women to serve in the USAAF was Staff Sergeant Eva Romero Jacques. Romero Jacques, who spoke Spanish and English and had three years of college spent two years in the Pacific Theater, 1944 in New Guinea and 1945 in the Philippines, as an administrative aide. She survived a plane disaster when the craft in which she was on crashed in the jungles of New Guinea.|$|E

25|$|Stilwell {{also ordered}} that all Marauders {{evacuated}} from combat due to wounds or fever first {{submit to a}} special medical 'examination' by doctors appointed by his headquarters staff. These examinations passed many ailing soldiers as fit for duty; Stilwell's staff roamed hospital hallways in search of any Marauder with a temperature lower than 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Some of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> passed and sent back into combat were immediately re-evacuated as unfit {{at the insistence of}} forward medical personnel.

25|$|The British Army {{also raised}} units in territories that were allied to Britain or or that British troops occupied. These {{included}} the Royal Sicilian Volunteers and two battalions of Greek Light Infantry. Initially the 1st Greek Light Infantry was formed, then by 1812 The Duke of York's Greek Light Infantry Regiment and in 1813 a second regiment composed of 454 Greeks 2nd Regiment Greek Light Infranty) which occupied Paxoi islands.

Because it was a federal building, the RCMP led the assault, {{and the leader of}} these protesters, Steve Brodie, was reputed for his infectious militancy.

The RCMP entered the building and forcibly ejected <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> subjected to a cordon of police armed with batons upon leaving the building.

25|$|Policies were {{established}} {{to cope with}} men unable to pass physical examinations.
