5|$|After tricking {{his wife}} Marge {{into believing that}} the model for <b>the</b> <b>Burly</b> paper towel {{corporation}} Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the {{events leading up to}} the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are hiking in the woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.|$|E

25|$|Walker stole {{a single}} to mid-off {{and with his}} eye fixed {{exclusively}} on the swooping fieldsman, Denness, hurtled blindly towards the bowler's wicket. Umpire Brooks, too, was concentrating on the ball and fieldsman whilst moving towards the off side and was skittled by the batsman who flung himself {{in the direction of}} safety with little or no consideration for the safety of others. Walker beat Denness's return to the wicket, but at the cost of a collision between the immovable mass and the irresistible force. Umpire Brooks, having been a first class bowler in his day was a man of some substance, and pound for pound was a good match for <b>the</b> <b>burly</b> Walker. Umpire and bowler toppled slowly to the ground and...resumed their upright position slowly...|$|E
25|$|Jones {{set about}} his innings in a workman-like fashion {{and kept the}} {{scoreboard}} ticking over. He and Boon put on 96 for the fourth wicket, before the different pace at running between the wickets of <b>the</b> <b>burly</b> Tasmanian and greyhound-like Jones led to Boon's run out for 38. This brought Steve Waugh to the wicket for the Australians, who so far had not been dismissed all series. Jones had edged past fifty and was looking very confident as the day wore on. The pair added a further 31, and despite day one ending with an almost biblical-scale lightning storm and flash flood, Australia ended day one on 234 for 4, with Dean Jones 71 not out, and Steve Waugh 17 not out.|$|E
25|$|Ian Redpath and Rick McCosker {{came out}} to open for Australia on another wet wicket, but this time {{failed to make the}} stand that saved Australia at Adelaide. They were not even able to claim that their wickets fell because of the damp patch on a fast bowler's length. Lever had {{increased}} his pace with age and was thought to be fast than Willis, but had dropped the ball short at Brisbane for figures of 0/111. Back in the England team he pitched the ball up and moved it in the heavy atmosphere to have both men caught by Greig at second slip. The English fielding perked up, Mike Denness set aggressive fields and it took 25 minutes for Australia to score their first run. In the Melbourne heat Geoff Arnold was replaced by Old after four overs, but Lever stayed on for seven overs and was rewarded with figures of 4/13 as Greg Chappell was caught in the covers by Denness, Ross Edwards was taken by Dennis Amiss at leg-slip for 0 and Australia were 23/4. The ball was now leaping dangerously, Ian Chappell had to fend a ball off his head and Greg had been hit on the chin. The captain decided that attack was the best form of defence and made 43 of his team's 66/5 by lunch, with Doug Walters popping the ball off Old to Edrich in gully with a frightful stroke. The exhausted Lever only managed two overs after lunch and Chappell and Rod Marsh hit 54 runs for the sixth wicket. Chris Old (3/50) has Chappell (65) caught behind after making a too fine a glance and bowled Marsh (29) for 115/7. Max Walker and Lillee hit out a few more runs, even turning down bad light so that they could continue play and get England in. <b>The</b> <b>burly</b> Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out they were both sent to the ground. Lever returned to remove Lillee and Mallett and Greig ended the innings by having Dymock out for a duck, with Walker 20 not out. Lever's 6/38 was his best bowling in Tests and Australia were out four minutes before tea for 152, easily their lowest score of the series.|$|E

500|$|... 1UP.com {{praised the}} game's story, stating that [...] "despite the {{predictability}} {{of the overall}} narrative, the details are frequently surprising and consistently entertaining," [...] and additionally found that the game tended to flaunt convention in its characters: [...] "Yet within this morass of overly familiar plot devices, Legendia tries to rise above its limitations by twisting conventions.

500|$|No. 4 Squadron was {{operating}} its Sopwith Camels in hazardous, low-altitude support of Australian ground troops when King arrived in France, {{and he had}} little opportunity for air-to-air combat. <b>The</b> <b>burly</b> [...] King—nicknamed [...] "Bo", [...] "Beau", or [...] "Bow"—also had problems landing the Camel; crammed into its small cockpit, [...] his large frame impeded control stick movement. [...] The resulting rough landings annoyed his commanding officer, Major Wilfred McCloughry, brother of ace Edgar McCloughry. King's friend and fellow No.4 Squadron pilot, Harry Cobby, recalled that [...] "there was some speculation that he might go home—but he proved himself an impressive pilot". Cobby often took King on [...] "special missions" [...] to make mischief with the Germans; No.4 Squadron found that two-man patrols were generally able to lure enemy aircraft into a fight, whereas larger formations tended to deter engagements. On 14May 1918, King shot down a two-seat German scout that was spotting for artillery between Ypres and Bailleul, but clouds prevented him from confirming its destruction. By 20May, he had been credited with his first aerial victory, over a PfalzD.III near Kemmel–Neuve Église. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1June. On 20June, he destroyed a German balloon over Estaires; although vulnerable to attack with incendiary bullets, these large observation platforms were generally well protected by fighters and anti-aircraft defences, and were thus considered a dangerous but valuable target. Later that month he shot down two more aircraft, a Pfalz and a two-seat LVG, in the Lys region.|$|E

2500|$|In the Third Test at Melbourne Tony Greig was {{controversially}} run {{out when}} England were 157/6.

In the Fifth Test at the Adelaide Oval Max Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee as Mike Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee tried to walk to keep Walker in as he was the better batsman, but Dennis Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go as Lillee has not left his ground and the umpire agreed.

2500|$|Five years later, Arthur {{sits with}} Guinevere in his study, debating {{about what to}} do. He {{explains}} that he wishes {{to create a new}} kind of knight—one that does not pillage and fight, but tries to uphold honor and justice. He is eventually inspired, with Guinevere's help, to establish the Round Table with the motto [...] "might for right." [...] Five years later, Arthur's idea has led to the Knights of the Round Table being renowned all over the country, and their fame has even spread to France. A young, pretentious and over-religious Frenchman from Joyous Garde named Lancelot du Lac has heard of the Round Table, and is determined to come to Camelot and join Arthur's knights, confident that he is perfect for the post, ("C'est Moi"). King Pellinore, an elderly man who was a friend of Arthur's family, also comes to Camelot to witness Arthur's greatness for himself, and it later seems that he {{has become part of the}} family. Guinevere organizes a May Day festival on the castle grounds ("The Lusty Month of May"), where Arthur introduces his wife to Lancelot. Guinevere takes an instant dislike to Lancelot. Time passes, and he makes an enemy of most of the knights. Guinevere incites three of them; Sir Dinadan, Sir Sagramore and <b>the</b> <b>burly</b> Sir Lionel, to challenge him to a joust, ("Then You May Take Me to the Fair"). Arthur (who, unlike everybody else, is friendly with Lancelot), is dismayed by this, and is at a loss to understand a woman's way- though he cannot be angry with Guinevere, ("How to Handle a Woman").|$|E
