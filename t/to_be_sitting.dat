5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area {{during most of the}} Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression and World War II created {{significant}} {{challenges for}} Hamline. The most difficult were {{the years in}} the early 1930s, in which the repercussions of the depression were intensified by conflicts over internal reorganization. Increased enrollments reflected the belief {{that it was better}} for students to be in college than <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> at home in idleness and despair. The college tried to help by providing jobs and financial aid, and by lowering charges for tuition and room and board. Jobs of any kind were at a premium, with the most prized being board jobs in the Manor House and at the Quality Tea Room on Snelling Avenue. Also in top demand were board and room jobs for women in private homes. In the meantime, the portion of the college endowment invested in farmlands turned unproductive, and the university's income fell following reductions in tuition. All of this led to annual deficits and substantial cuts in faculty salaries. It was not until 1935 that Hamline began to recover from the depression. During the war years, Hamline’s enrollment held above 600, except in 1943 and 1944. Although males registrations dropped as men entered the armed services, women's enrollment increased as nursing students arrived.|$|E

At Government House, the Chief Justice berated Gibbs for [...] "dragging the Queen into the political argument". To the Governor's astonishment, Beadle conceded that for some time he had no longer considered himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> under the 1961 constitution, but had not made this clear as he had not fully accepted the 1965 constitution as valid. Gibbs told him to leave Government House forthwith. They never met again.|$|E

500|$|Tomahawk is {{a musical}} {{supergroup}} consisting of Mike Patton, vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle; Duane Denison, guitarist for The Jesus Lizard; Kevin Rutmanis, bass player for Melvins; and John Stanier, drummer for Helmet. Mit Gas was recorded after they toured {{with the band}} Tool, whose fans frequently booed Tomahawk off stage during their performances. Denison has likened the experience of playing to the unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to [...] "being pro-choice at a [...] Bush rally {{and trying to make}} your point". Subsequently, the band opted to organize their own tour in support of the album, choosing to work with Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Speaking about the planning required to stage a four-act tour, Patton stated [...] "that's a lot of music. That's a lot of time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> in some stinking-ass club with some guy puking in your purse". Tool's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video, but the offer was declined by the band. Reports suggested that a cover of the theme from the movie Flashdance What a Feeling was going to be included on the album, although the song was not on the final track listing.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Battlefield" [...] was {{directed}} by Philip Andelman [...] and filmed at the Golden Oak Ranch in California. On June 3, 2009, a thirty-second preview of the video was released online. The complete video premiered online on June 7, 2009. The video begins with a shot of a black car parked {{in the middle of}} a field. Sparks appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> in a car, dressed in black, as she sings the first verse. Intercut scenes of Sparks laying down in the field wearing a white dress are then shown. During the second verse, she exits the car and walks towards the camera. As the second chorus kicks in, Sparks is surrounded by smoke. During the song's bridge, she warns her love interest to get his armour, as she appears to be surrounded by flashing lights and smoke. Then intercut scenes of Sparks singing into the camera in front of a black backdrop are shown. The video then shows Sparks lifting her right arm in the air as missiles shoot up into the sky. The video ends by showing Sparks covered in smoke. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the video shows that Sparks is [...] "definitely growing up". Maura of Idolator wrote that the video [...] "is a simple affair that allows her to get into maximum drama mode." ...|$|E
500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} start of the final, a spectator threw a plastic beer bottle at the {{competitors}} in the starting blocks. Though the race was unaffected, he was arrested. The man, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> next to Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, who promptly struck him with her hand on the back of his head after the toss. LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: [...] "I'm not suggesting vigilantism but it was actually poetic justice that they happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> next to a judo player". Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court. He was later found guilty.|$|E
