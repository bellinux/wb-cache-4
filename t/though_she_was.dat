5|$|Deutschland {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1896, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted {{with the exception of}} the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean, often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits. Deutschland was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an armored cruiser, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too slow to perform satisfactorily in this role. Nevertheless, she spent three years in the East Asia Squadron before returning to Germany in 1900. She was used in secondary roles after 1904, until 1908 when she was sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|<b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{paid only}} $10.50 per week, her {{discovery}} {{of a way to}} accurately measure distances on an inter-galactic scale paved the way for modern astronomy’s understanding of the structure and scale of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the repair}} work, Westfalen briefly {{went into the}} Baltic Sea for training, before {{returning}} to the North Sea on 4 October. The fleet then advanced as far as the Dogger Bank on 19–20 October. The ship remained in port for the majority of 1917. The ship did not actively take part in Operation Albion in the Baltic, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> stationed off Apenrade to prevent a possible British incursion into the area.|$|E

There <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> the type, the blood, the likeness, of no end of Massachusetts families, the very same stuff indeed, and yet <b>she</b> <b>was</b> different....|$|R

50|$|Elisa is {{of mixed}} heritage, African-American on her mother's side, and Native American (mostly, but not exclusively, Hopi) on her father's side, ("Cloud Fathers") <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a {{born and bred}} New Yorker. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> tall and athletic, as well as quick-witted, and she can hold her own against almost any adversary, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> often impulsive.|$|R
5|$|Frank was {{introduced}} to Lucille Selig shortly after he arrived in Atlanta. She came from a prominent, upper-middle class Jewish family of industrialists who, two generations earlier, had founded the first synagogue in Atlanta. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> less devout in her Jewish faith than Frank, they married in November 1910. Frank described his married life as happy.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, he met Grace Hartley, a well-off twenty-year-old {{who was on}} {{vacation}} with her mother at one of Saratoga's sanitariums. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> initially unimpressed with him, Howe courted her assiduously for two years, and the couple became engaged in 1898, marrying the following year. The pair had three children, one of whom died in infancy.|$|E
5|$|In England, Anne {{shifted her}} {{energies}} from factional politics to patronage {{of the arts}} and constructed her own magnificent court, hosting one of the richest cultural salons in Europe. After 1612, she suffered sustained bouts of ill health and gradually withdrew from the centre of court life. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> reported to have been a Protestant {{at the time of her}} death, evidence suggests that she may have converted to Catholicism sometime in her life.|$|E

5|$|In spring 1907, Ethel Hedgeman led {{efforts to}} create a sisterhood at Howard University. Howard faculty member Ethal Robinson {{encouraged}} Hedgeman by relating her own observances of sorority life at the Women's College at Brown University, even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{not a member of}} any sorority while a student at Brown. Hedgeman was also inspired by her mentors at Howard. To implement her idea, Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1896, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted {{with the exception of}} the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels.

Kaiser was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an armored cruiser, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too slow to perform satisfactorily in this role. Nevertheless, she spent several years as the flagship of the East Asia Squadron before returning to Germany in 1899. She was used in secondary roles after 1904, until after the end of World War I in 1919, when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 343 and 340BC, Neaira {{was brought}} to trial by Theomnestus {{on behalf of his}} {{father-in-law}} Apollodorus, accused of xenias (representing herself as a citizen when in fact she was not). If she was convicted, the maximum penalty Neaira faced was being sold into slavery and having her property sold. Neaira herself would not have been permitted to speak at her trial, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> probably present.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is unclear}} when or by whom Hayes {{was called the}} [...] "First Lady of the Theatre". Her friend, actress Katharine Cornell, also held that title, and each thought the other {{deserved}} it. One critic said that Cornell played every queen as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a woman, whereas Hayes played every woman as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a queen.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with her}} four sister ships, , , , and , König Albert participated {{in most of}} the major fleet {{operations}} of World War I, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in drydock for maintenance during the Battle of Jutland between 31 May and 1 June 1916. As a result, she was the only battleship actively serving with the fleet that missed the largest naval battle of the war. The ship was also involved in Operation Albion, an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, in late 1917.|$|E
5|$|As Ezri Tigan was {{the only}} unjoined Trill {{available}} on board, she agreed to be joined to the symbiont even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unprepared and did not previously seek to be joined to one. Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Mackensens, the three ships of the Ersatz Yorck class were never completed. This was {{primarily}} due to shifting wartime construction priorities; U-boats were deemed more important to Germany's war effort, and so work on other types of ships was slowed or halted outright. The lead ship, Ersatz Yorck, was the only vessel of the three to have construction begin, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> over two years from completion by the time work was abandoned. With the hull incomplete, the ship could not be launched and towed to ship-breakers; as a result, Ersatz Yorck was broken up in situ.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, O'Hara {{joined the}} Abbey Theatre. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> mentored by playwright Lennox Robinson, she found her time at the theatre disappointing. In 1934, {{at the age of}} 15, she won the first Dramatic Prize of the {{national}} competition of the performing arts, the Dublin Feis Award, for her performance as Portia in The Merchant of Venice. She trained as a shorthand typist, working for Crumlin Laundry before joining Eveready Battery Company, where she worked as a typist and bookkeeper. She later put her skills to use when she typed the script of The Quiet Man for John Ford.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Mary II from {{smallpox}} in 1694, William III restored Anne’s honours, as she was then become next in line to the throne, and provided her with apartments at St. James's Palace. He also restored the Earl of Marlborough to all his offices and honours, and exonerated him from any past accusations. However, fearing Sarah’s powerful influence, William kept Anne out of government affairs, {{and he did not}} make her regent in his absences <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now his heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|Foster and Eddy {{finally arrived}} at Truckee Lake on March 14, {{where they found}} their {{children}} dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and she could have walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E

5|$|Hessen {{was one of}} the few {{obsolete}} battleships Germany {{was permitted}} to retain under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. She served as a coastal defense ship in the 1920s and early 1930s, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn from front-line service in 1934. The following year, the ship was converted into a radio-controlled target. During World War II Hessen served in this capacity, while also working as an icebreaker in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946 after the end of the war and, renamed Tsel, served until scrapped in 1960.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April, Lorraine and her {{two sisters}} were {{transferred}} to Alexandria. On 10 June, Italy declared war on France; by that time, both Bretagne and Provence had {{moved back to the}} western Mediterranean. Lorraine was the only French capital ship in the eastern Mediterranean, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> joined by four British battleships and an aircraft carrier. On the night of 20–21 June, Lorraine formed the center of an Anglo-French task force, with the cruisers , , and , for a bombardment of Italian positions at Bardia. The operation, which caused only minimal damage, was the last combined British and French naval operation before the French surrender.|$|E
5|$|Preussen {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1891, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. She cruised the Mediterranean Sea several times during her service, including during a mission in 1877 after unrest in the Ottoman Empire threatened German citizens living there. The ship was withdrawn from service {{at the end of}} 1891 and used as a harbor guard ship until 1896, when she was relegated to being a supply ship in Wilhelmshaven. She ended her career as a coal hulk for torpedo boats. In 1903, she was renamed Saturn so her name could be reused. The ship was ultimately sold to shipbreakers in 1919.|$|E
