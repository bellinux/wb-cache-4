5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, Ernulf de Hesdin was given <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Ruislip, which {{included}} the woods, in recognition of his service to William the Conqueror. In 1087, Ernulf de Hesdin passed <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> to the Bec Abbey. During the Abbey's ownership, timber from the woods {{was used in the}} construction of the Tower of London in 1339, Windsor Castle in 1344, the Palace of Westminster in 1346 and <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of the Black Prince in Kennington. Locally, the Great Barn on <b>the</b> <b>Manor</b> Farm site was constructed of oak from the woods. King's College, Cambridge became lords of <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> in 1451.|$|E
5|$|In 1309 Sir Nicholas de Boys granted <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Shalden to Robert de Kendale and his wife, Margaret, {{along with}} her heirs. <b>The</b> <b>manor</b> was then held by Ralph le Mareschal indefinitely. He was still holding it in 1310, however it had passed to Robert de Kendale {{sometime}} before 1316. Robert died in 1330, and his son Edward succeeded to <b>the</b> <b>manor,</b> but it was held by his widow Margaret until her death in 1347. Sir Edward de Kendale died in 1373, leaving a widow and a son as his heir for <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Shalden. Edwards's son and his brother, Thomas, both died without issue in 1375. Sir Robert Turk and his wife, Beatrice, conveyed <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> in 1376–7 to Sir William Croyser and William Bukbridge, trustees of Sir Edward de Kendale, to whom they transferred {{it in the same}} year. Edward's widow Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Croyser, soon married Sir Thomas Barre, and died in 1420. Her heir was her grandson, but <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Shalden passed to John de Kendale, who held it in 1428.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{total of}} 15 manors in Mäntsälä, 4 of which {{are open to the}} public, the rest being private residences. Russian czar Alexander I visited as guest of Ulla Möllersvärd in 1809 in <b>the</b> Mäntsälä <b>manor</b> lying in <b>the</b> city center. <b>The</b> <b>manors</b> emerged in <b>the</b> 17th century as noblemen feoffs. Traditionally the land belonged to <b>the</b> <b>manors.</b> There were many crofts in Mäntsälä and new {{legislation}} in 1918 enabled the crofters to claim the land for themselves. In <b>the</b> 1920s <b>the</b> <b>manors</b> were still a sizable land owner in the parish.|$|R
50|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Baron Scales came into possession of <b>the</b> <b>manors</b> of Newsells, Hertfordshire and Rivenhall, Essex in 1255 by the marriage of Sir Robert de Scales to Alice de Rochester (or de Roffa/Rossa), whose family had held <b>the</b> <b>manors</b> since 1210. Robert died in 1256.|$|R
5|$|In 1451, {{ownership}} of the farm passed {{with the rest of}} Ruislip to King's College, Cambridge who remain titular Lords of <b>the</b> <b>Manor.</b> King's completed two surveys of <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> during their ownership, in 1565 and 1750.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after <b>the</b> <b>manor,</b> and he may have been related to or a {{follower}} of the de Masseys. He may have also held <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> at some point. The de Bromales held <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the sixteenth}} century, <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Boughton Monchelsea passed by {{marriage}} or sale through {{the ownership of}} several families of minor gentry. From 1214, <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> was {{in the possession of}} the Hougham family. On the death of Robert de Hougham in 1317, it passed to his daughter Benedicta, wife of John de Shelving. On her death in 1349 without a male heir, <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> was divided between her daughters Helen and Joan.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>manor</b> {{house of}} Westleigh was at Higher Hall and existed in Richard I's time (1189–1199). In 1292 Sigreda, the heiress of <b>the</b> <b>manor,</b> married Richard de Urmston, and <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> {{passed to the}} Urmston family and {{remained}} there until {{the last of the}} male Urmstons died in 1659. It was later abandoned because of mining subsidence and Westleigh Old Hall became <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> by repute. The Ranicars and the Marsh families lived here. Westleigh Old Hall was another Leigh hall that had a moat.|$|E
5|$|The tenants of <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> {{apparently}} {{took their}} name from it; a Gregory de South Stoneham (or Gegory de Stoneham) is recorded there in 1236 and 1249, and in 1315 <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> {{was held by}} Nicholas de South Stoneham (son of Guy de South Stoneham). In 1348 Thomas de Stoneham and his wife Alice were lord and lady of <b>the</b> <b>manor,</b> and five heiresses of theirs– possibly daughters– held <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> in 1367. However, that year they quitclaimed it to Adam le Chaundle.|$|E
5|$|William Mauditt left {{a son and}} heir, Warin, a minor, whose custody was {{assigned}} by Henry III to his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall. During this time, Richard temporarily held <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Shalden from Henry until his death 1272. Consequently, Warin Mauditt held <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> {{until his death in}} either 1299 or 1300. Interest in <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> passed down to his son Thomas, in which he granted a sum of land at Shalden to a Knight named Walter Stoner and his freeman, in gratitude for his homage and services. At that time Sir Nicholas de Boys held <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Shalden as a tenant for life. In 1297 the Earl of Cornwall, in consideration of the services of Sir Nicholas, granted <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> to him and his heirs indefinitely. Sir Nicholas paid nothing for <b>the</b> <b>manor,</b> though his heirs were to pay £12 a year.|$|E
50|$|In 1545 <b>the</b> <b>manors</b> of Sunningwell and Bayworth {{were granted}} to Robert Browne (a goldsmith), Christopher Edmondes and William Wenlowe. They {{seem to have}} been speculators who bought them for a quick profit, as they alienated <b>the</b> <b>manors</b> in 1546. <b>The</b> buyer was John Williams, later Baron Williams of Thame. Baron Williams died in 1559 without a male heir, and <b>the</b> <b>manors</b> passed to his elder {{daughter}} Margery and her husband Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys. In 1583 Margery sold Sunningwell and Bayworth to her younger sister Isabel and her second husband Richard Huddleston. By 1589 Richard and Isabel were dead and had left <b>the</b> two <b>manors</b> mortgaged to a Richard Martin.|$|R
50|$|Odo de Barry was the grantee of <b>the</b> immense <b>manor</b> of Manorbier in Pembrokeshire, which {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>manors</b> of Jameston and Manorbier Newton, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>manors</b> of Begelly and Penally. He built the first motte-and-bailey at Manorbier. His son, William FitzOdo de Barry, is the common ancestor of the Barry family in Ireland. He rebuilt Manorbier Castle in stone and the family retained the lordship of Manorbier until the 15th century.|$|R

5|$|A charter for {{a weekly}} market was granted to Bartholomew de Badlesmere in 1315–16; this {{increased}} {{his status as}} Lord of <b>the</b> <b>Manor</b> and improved local industry. During the Middle Ages the town was visited by King HenryI and in 1324 by EdwardII. Evidence of Eastbourne's medieval past can seen in the 12th century Church of St Mary, and <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> house called Bourne Place.|$|E
5|$|A descendent of John de Charlton, {{the first}} Sir Thomas de Charlton, died in 1448 whereupon Swakeleys passed to his son, also named Sir Thomas, who became Speaker of the House of Commons and Member of Parliament for Middlesex. He died in 1465, {{at which point}} his son Sir Richard became owner of <b>the</b> <b>manor.</b> Sir Richard was killed {{fighting}} {{on the side of}} Richard III during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The victor of the battle, Henry VII, named him in his Act of Attainder, though he granted Sir Richard's wife Elizabeth a life interest in <b>the</b> <b>manor.</b> However, Sir Thomas Bourchier was subsequently granted <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Swakeleys and Covelhall (Cowley). Upon Sir Thomas' death in 1510, <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> passed to Sir John Peeche as his executor. Sir John had no children, so Swakeleys passed to the Earl of Devon, Henry Courteney in 1521. The Earl granted a licence to control Swakeleys to Sir William Fitzwilliam in 1531, who was acting as trustee for Ralph Pexall.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman conquest <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> {{was held}} by the Bishop of Coutances and later reverted to the crown, after which William II gave it to a {{merchant}} from Bristol known as Harding and then to his son Robert Fitzharding who became Lord of Berkeley. The Berkeley family held it for generations until it passed by marriage to the Cokes of Holkham in Norfolk. In the 14th century it belonged to Everard le Frenshe. In 1621 the Bristol Corporation purchased large portions of land in Portishead and revived <b>the</b> <b>Manor</b> Court. The rights of the corporation over <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> was disputed but they held it until 1836 when they sold it for £8,050. The parish of Portishead {{was part of the}} Portbury Hundred.|$|E

50|$|During the 18th century, urban Leicester encroached <b>the</b> <b>manors,</b> {{with some}} large houses, {{complete}} with extensive grounds and orchards built. These were demolished in the 19th century when new high-density housing was built that totally obliterated the rural aspect of Bromkinsthorpe. <b>The</b> <b>manors</b> were thus subsumed into the rapidly expanding Borough of Leicester.|$|R
5|$|Although Wigan is not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book, possibly because it was included in the Neweton barony (now Newton-le-Willows), it is thought that the mention of a church in <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Neweton is Wigan Parish Church. The rectors of the parish church were lords of <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> of Wigan, a sub-manor of Neweton, until the 19th century. Wigan was incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a charter by King Henry III to John Maunsell, the local church rector and lord of <b>the</b> <b>manor.</b> The borough was later granted another charter in 1257–1258, allowing the lord of <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> to hold a market on every Monday and two annual fairs. The town is recorded on the earliest-surviving map of Britain, the Gough Map made around 1360 which highlights its position on the main western north-south highway with distance markers to Preston and Warrington.|$|E
5|$|Despite such inaccuracies, {{the tale}} has been {{frequently}} repeated. Individual privileges that did exist {{have fallen into}} disuse—for example the Lord of <b>the</b> <b>Manor</b> of Worksop (which is not a peerage) was extended the privilege and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> was under corporate ownership at the time.|$|E

5|$|In the 1670s, part of Donck's land {{passed to}} Frederick Philipse, who {{was rewarded with}} , {{including}} the lower river, for declaring his loyalty to the new British rulers of New Netherlands. Philipse named <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> Philipsborough and ran it as a quasi-feudal farm, hiring tenants to work the land. Around 1682, he built Philipse Manor Hall, a mansion along the Saw Mill River that is today a National Historic Landmark. When Philipse died around 1702, <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> was divided between his son Adolph and grandson Frederick II. In 1750, his great-grandson Frederick III inherited the whole property and moved from his New York City townhouse to <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> hall, previously used as the family's summer home. Frederick sat in the Colonial Assembly, {{where he was a}} strong supporter of the British government that had given his family everything it owned, but he was primarily interested in managing the land. He improved <b>the</b> <b>manor</b> hall and worked to attract tenant farmers to the land. The family was known for its relaxed approach to its tenants, and the farm was very profitable.|$|E
