25|$|As part of {{a project}} to {{regenerate}} Bletchley as a whole, Milton Keynes Council has proposed {{the creation of a}} new eastern pedestrian access to the station by extending the existing platform overbridge across the tracks to reach Saxon Street. The proposed eastern entrance is <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>out</b> into a new station square and a transport interchange where an at-grade pedestrian crossing across Saxon Street would give access to the town centre and bus station. In the longer term it is planned to construct an underground concourse to link the eastern and western station entrances.|$|E

[...] "While film inserts were being used in television drama from the early 1950s, Nineteen Eighty-Four represented the most extensive use {{of them in a}} TV play up to that time, and signalled Cartier's determination to extend the boundaries of TV drama." [...] Similarly, his Times obituary stated that: [...] "At a time when studio productions were usually as static as the conventional theatre, he was widely respected for a creative contribution to British television drama which gave it a new dimension." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review published in 1989, Steve Lamacq wrote in NME that Join Hands was [...] "a more absorbing, haunting LP" [...] than the band's debut album. Lamacq rated it 8 out of 10, though {{he said that}} the version of [...] "The Lord's Prayer" [...] was [...] "out of place". AllMusic's David Cleary considered [...] "Icon" [...] the best track on the album, commenting that it [...] "survives an unpromising beginning <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>out</b> into a faster main section with fuller vocal sound and gutsier guitar work", but Cleary panned the rest of Join Hands, describing it as [...] "almost uniformly grim, with dragging tempos, bleak lyrics, long and wandering free-form structures, static and often unfocused harmony and thick, colorless arrangements".|$|E

2500|$|The LF-Gh {{which stands}} for Lexus Future Grand-touring Hybrid is Lexus's latest LF concept vehicle which debuted at the 2011 New York International Auto Show. [...] The LF-Gh is a rear wheel drive hybrid {{platform}} powered by a Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain. The LF-Gh also provide a hint of what future Lexus models, mainly the Lexus GS which was scheduled for late 2011, might look like. The front {{and the back of}} the LF-Gh is equipped with LED headlights, daytime running lights, and taillights. To improve aerodynamics the LF-Gh's door handles are sealed into the door panel and could be pushed <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>out.</b> the large spindle grille {{on the front of the}} LF-Gh brings out the aggressiveness of the design. Though the interior has been teased online, Lexus never once opened the doors of the LF-Gh to reveal the full interior, which is why most critics are rumoring that the LF-Gh is a nutshell concept, in which only the exterior has purpose, and the inside components are not made up.|$|E

50|$|The Beacon Tunnel was {{completed}} by 11 January 1862 and on 28 August 1862 a trial run for the directors was undertaken between Pant and Talyllyn.

50|$|Due to its congestion, the TTC has had {{to expand}} the station.

The TTC does not intend to proceed with that plan.|$|R
