Under her leadership, the National Bureau of Statistics carried out a rebasing exercise; the first in 24 years, which saw Nigeria emerge as the largest economy in Africa. She took a lot of heat, more-so than any other government official for the fuel subsidy removal policy by the Nigerian government which led to protests in January 2012. In May 2016, the new Nigerian administration eventually removed the fuel subsidy after it became apparent that it was unsustainable and inefficient.|$|E
25|$|The First Year of Studies {{program was}} {{established}} in 1962 to guide incoming freshmen {{in their first year}} at the school before they have declared a major. Each student is given an academic advisor from the program who helps them to choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested. The program also includes a Learning Resource Center which provides time management, collaborative learning, and subject tutoring. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recognized previously, by U.S. News & World Report, as outstanding. The program is designed to encourage intellectual and academic achievement and innovation among first year students. It includes programs such as FY advising, the Dean's A list, the Renaissance circle, NDignite, the First year Urban challenge and more.|$|E

Most Village Phone participants are women living in remote areas. Village Phone works as an owner-operated GSM payphone whereby a borrower takes a BDT 12,000 (USD 200) loan from Grameen Bank to subscribe to Grameenphone and is then trained on how to operate it and how to charge others to use it at a profit. As of September 2006, there are more than 255,000 Village Phones in operation in 55,000 villages around Bangladesh. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> replicated also in some other countries including in Uganda and Rwanda in Africa.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, the {{government}} encouraged {{the production of}} basic crops (mainly corn and beans) by maintaining support prices and controlling imports through the National Company for Popular Subsistence (CONASUPO). With trade liberalization, however, CONASUPO was to be gradually dismantled and two new mechanisms were implemented: Alianza and Procampo. Alianza provides income payments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems. Procampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers. This support program provides 3.5million farmers who produce basic commodities (mostly corn), and which represent 64% of all farmers, with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of area of cropland. This subsidy increased substantially during president Fox's administration, mainly to white corn producers {{in order to reduce}} the amount of imports from the United States. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> successful, and in 2004, roughly only 15% of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in Mexico– as opposed to 85% of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock, and which is barely produced in Mexico.|$|E

According to the Strategic Plan for railway infrastructures developed by the Spanish Ministerio de Fomento (Ministry of Public Works), called PEIT, and published in 2005, a second expansion program is planned to start when the last lines of the first program still under construction begin operation. This plan initially had a ten-year scope, ending in 2020, and its ambition {{was to make the}} [...] network reach [...] {{by the end of that}} year. However, <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> now postponed to indefinite time frame since the first expansion program is still on going.

2500|$|EMTs newly {{entering}} {{the field are}} now recommended to have two years of training at Vocational school followed by two-year internships. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> offered since 2003, and is inspired by American EMS training. [...] The system currently has individuals working at the Basic, Intermediate and Advanced levels, and for vehicles providing ALS service, the crew configuration is typically 1-ILS, 1-ALS.

Only those EMTs completing this education process are permitted to use the title [...] "Paramedic". [...] While the program is not yet mandatory on a national level, it {{is considered to be a}} prerequisite for employment in the Oslo region.

2500|$|Alternative {{certificate}} {{programs were}} introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states {{in response to the}} dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> very controversial. It is, [...] "booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success. there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since {{they are more likely to}} end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations." [...] Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation.

2500|$|Mathematical Reviews {{was founded}} by Otto E. Neugebauer in 1940 as an {{alternative}} to the German journal Zentralblatt für Mathematik, which Neugebauer had also founded a decade earlier, but which under the Nazis had begun censoring reviews by and of Jewish mathematicians. The goal of the new journal was to give reviews of every mathematical research publication. As of November 2007, the Mathematical Reviews database contained information on over 2.2 million articles. The authors of reviews are volunteers, usually chosen by the editors because of some expertise in the area of the article. It and Zentralblatt für Mathematik are the only comprehensive resources of this type. (The Mathematics section of Referativny Zhurnal is available only in Russian and is smaller in scale and difficult to access.) Often reviews give detailed summaries of the contents of the paper, sometimes with critical comments by the reviewer and references to related work. However, reviewers are not encouraged to criticize the paper, because the author does not have an opportunity to respond. The author's summary may be quoted when it is not possible to give an independent review, or when the summary is deemed adequate by the reviewer or the editors. Only bibliographic information may be given when a work is in an unusual language, when it is a brief paper in a conference volume, or when it is outside the primary scope of the Reviews. Originally the reviews were written in several languages, but later an [...] "English only" [...] policy was introduced. Selected reviews (called [...] "featured reviews") were also published as a book by the AMS, but <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> discontinued.|$|E
