5|$|Following his January 1860 {{resignation}} from Parliament, Ollivier spearheaded a requisition, broadly {{supported by}} influential people, to have Brittan make himself {{available for the}} resulting by-election in the Christchurch Country electorate. Brittan declined the requisition, mostly because he was opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> tunnel scheme which had overwhelming support by the population, {{and he could not}} see himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion. Isaac Thomas Cookson, who had earlier supported the Brittan requisition, was elected.|$|E
25|$|A sleeper is a {{rectangular}} object on which <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> are supported and fixed. The sleeper has two main roles: <b>to</b> transfer <b>the</b> loads from <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> track ballast {{and the ground}} underneath, and <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correct width apart (<b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> gauge).

5|$|On May 24, {{the strikers}} seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> station and left town.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was designed to provide affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a self-contained community close enough <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line {{with the principles of}} the Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, no public houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E
5|$|Past Pokagon, M-51 {{turns back}} northeasterly toward Dowagiac. Once the highway reaches that city, it merges with M-62. The two {{highways}} run concurrently eastward along Spruce, Main and Division streets through downtown. M-51 {{turns to the}} north along Front Street, separating from the concurrency and leaving downtown. North of town in rural Cass County, M-51 intersects M-152 near location where the highway crosses the Dowagiac River. North of that intersection, the trunkline crosses into Van Buren County and turns to the east again. M-51 passes south of Knickerbocker Lake before turn northeasterly parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line along Delaware Street in Decatur. after which is heads due north to I-94.|$|E

5|$|Central Basingstoke has two further {{shopping}} areas: The Malls and the Top of Town. The Malls {{area had}} declined since {{the opening of}} Festival Place and the closure of its Allders department store, though still home to several major retailers. The leasehold was purchased in 2004 by the St Modwen development group {{in partnership with the}} Kuwait property investment company Salhia Real Estate, with provision for redevelopment The redevelopment of The Malls started in late 2010, and the shopping centre was given a major facelift. The existing canopies were removed and a clear roof canopy installed, to protect the centre from bad weather, but still allow natural light and air in. The whole shopping centre has been repaved and new street furniture installed. A new gateway entrance to The Malls links it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> station. The redevelopment was completed {{in the last quarter of}} 2011. The redevelopment work has been carried out by Wates Group using a variety of subcontractors.|$|E
5|$|MD 170 {{continues}} {{north as}} Aviation Boulevard and joins the Airport Loop. The highway parallels the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, which carries MARC's Penn Line, and the hiker-biker BWI Trail. MD 170 meets {{the eastern end}} of Stoney Run Road, which heads east and immediately loops back west and crosses over the state highway and the railroad {{on its way to the}} BWI Car Rental Facility. The highway intersects unsigned MD 995 (Amtrak Way), which leads to the BWI Rail Station, as it gradually curves to the east. MD 170 crosses Kitten Branch immediately before its partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern terminus of I-195 and the northern terminus of MD 995A (Metropolitan Boulevard). The highway passes under the BWI Trail and expands to a divided highway before its intersection with Terminal Road and an at-grade intersection with the Baltimore Light Rail. Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line's BWI Business District station is via Elkridge Landing Road at the next intersection. MD 170 leaves the Airport Loop at its intersection with MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), where the highway turns north onto Camp Meade Road.|$|E

5|$|Passenger {{services}} at the station declined following the Second World War, and the Beeching Report recommended the complete closure of the Portishead line. Passenger {{services at}} Clifton Bridge ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services following on 5 July 1965, although the line saw occasional traffic until 1981. Most of the station was demolished, leaving some remains of the platforms, a retaining wall and the footbridge. Regular freight trains through the station began to run again in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock was connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> network. The line is due to be reopened to passenger traffic in 2019 as part of MetroWest, {{but there are no}} plans to reopen the station.|$|E
5|$|Railway traffic {{throughout}} the state was paralyzed, as some train bridges collapsed, and extensive damage {{was found in the}} track ballast in multiple rail lines. Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. The damage to the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> track damage. The damage to the road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E

This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, Red Gremlin, nor his regular crew, which included bombardier Thomas Ferebee and navigator Theodore Van Kirk, who later flew with him in Enola Gay. On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of Lille. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.|$|E
