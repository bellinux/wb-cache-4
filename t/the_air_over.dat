5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>over</b> 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E
5|$|In November 1984, Larson {{learned about}} a local radio show {{promotion}} promising a $30,000 prize for matching a $1bill's serial number with a random number read out on <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Over</b> several days, he withdrew his remaining winnings in $1bills, examined each dollar, and (upon discovering {{that he did}} not have the winning number) re-deposited roughly half of the money. Larson left about $50,000 in his house, which was stolen in a burglary while he was attending a Christmas party. The case remains unsolved to this day.|$|E
5|$|Sitting in Padmasana (lotus) posture, {{the text}} {{states that the}} pranayama or {{breathing}} must be gradual, both inhalation, holding and exhalation should be slow, steady and deep. The text introduces a series of time measures (matras, musical beats) to aid self monitoring and to measure progress, wherein the beat is created by the yoga student with fingers self circumambulating and using one's own knee for the beat pulse. A sequential gradual inhalation over sixteen Matras (digits), holding the air deep within for sixty-four Matras and gradually exhaling <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>over</b> thirty-two Matras is suggested as {{the goal of the}} breathing exercise.|$|E

5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India {{and air pollution}} from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern margins of the sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern margins of the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E
5|$|Chris pays a visit {{during his}} nightly jog, and Ann leaves with him {{so they can}} clear <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Over</b> dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while {{discussing}} the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is back on and tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to get some sleep. With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas that are well received by Chris.|$|E
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>over</b> long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, German aircrew carried small {{containers}} of fluorescein. In {{the event of}} parachuting into the sea after being shot down, the dye would be released into the water.

25|$|At room {{temperature}} and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium when <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>over</b> {{the water has}} a humidity of about 3%.

25|$|On 1 April 1, 1918 {{preparations}} got underway for {{the opening}} of a new gunnery school. Instructors were borrowed from the French, British and Canadian flying corps. By July 1918, Selfridge had reached its peak performance in gunnery training. Over 250 students were enrolled at one time, and on one occasion 52 planes were in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the field simultaneously. Classes were so filled that 150 Lewis air guns, 60 Lewis ground guns, 80 Marlin air guns, 90 camera guns and 10 aerial cameras were in use daily. By the end of World War I, the young base had 1,028 enlisted men and 200 officers. It had trained 72 pilots and 700. mechanics, and 1,002 men had attended gunnery school.|$|E

25|$|When on {{approach}} to land, the pilot would push the stick forward to gain speed for the flare and landing. As speed built up, the rear wing, operating at a greater {{angle of attack}} would gain lift and pitch the aircraft's nose further downward. The pilot's normal reaction would be to pull back on the stick. This action would increase the angle of attack on the front wing by lowering {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. Because the trailing edge of the front wing was close to {{the leading edge of the}} rear wing, the front wing's downwash would accelerate <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>over</b> the rear wing and cause it to gain lift more quickly than the front wing, resulting in an ever-increasing nose pitch-down and flight directly into the ground.|$|E
