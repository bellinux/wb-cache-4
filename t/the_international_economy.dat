25|$|It {{had been}} {{recognized}} in 1944 {{that the new}} system could only commence after a return to normality following the disruption of World War II.

25|$|These loan {{conditions}} {{ensure that}} the borrowing country {{will be able to}} repay the IMF and that the country will not attempt to solve their balance-of-payment problems {{in a way that would}} negatively impact <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy.</b> The incentive problem of moral hazard—when economic agents maximise their own utility to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than providing collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess internationally valuable collateral anyway.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{founding}} of the IMF, its three primary functions were: to oversee the fixed exchange rate arrangements between countries, thus helping national governments manage their exchange rates and allowing these governments to prioritise economic growth, and to provide short-term capital to aid the balance of payments. This assistance was meant {{to prevent the spread of}} international economic crises. The IMF was also intended to help mend the pieces of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> after the Great Depression and World War II. As well, to provide capital investments for economic growth and projects such as infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|From 1947 until 1958, the U.S. {{deliberately}} encouraged an outflow of dollars, and, from 1950 on, the United States ran {{a balance}} of payments deficit {{with the intent of}} providing liquidity for <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy.</b> Dollars flowed out through various U.S. aid programs: the Truman Doctrine entailing aid to the pro-U.S. Greek and Turkish regimes, which were struggling to suppress communist revolution, aid to various pro-U.S. regimes in the Third World, and most important, the Marshall Plan. From 1948 to 1954 the United States provided 16 Western European countries $17 billion in grants.|$|E
25|$|The new {{economic}} system required an accepted vehicle for investment, trade, and payments. Unlike national economies, however, <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use. In the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard, but {{the architects of}} Bretton Woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy. Instead, {{they set up a}} system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the U.S. dollar (which was a gold standard currency for central banks) as a reserve currency.|$|E
25|$|Hotan {{is a city}} of 360,000 people, 96% Uyghur and 3% Han, in Hotan Prefecture, China. Hotan Prefecture is a {{predominantly}} agricultural county and the poorest in Xinjiang, so it is a frequent source of migrant workers to wealthier Xinjiang cities like Ürümqi. Uyghurs tend to have less wealth than their Han counterparts; as a result, many Uyghurs are unemployed and subsist on Chinese social welfare benefits. The city receives few domestic tourists because of terrorism fears, but southern Xinjiang officials are trying to integrate the region into <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> by creating a special economic zone in nearby Kashgar. Hotan had recently been celebrating the opening of the city's first passenger-train service in June.|$|E

40|$|My thesis traces and {{assesses the}} {{engagement}} of Africa in <b>the</b> <b>international</b> political <b>economy</b> through examining Mauritian activism and co-operation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiating and decision-making process. Using the illustrative {{case study of}} Mauritius I investigate the increased engagement of Africa in <b>the</b> <b>international</b> political <b>economy</b> beyond <b>the</b> political elite interests and client-patronage relationships. This is done by establishing that those Mauritian elites involved in trade policy-making and activism and co-operation in the WTO are constrained {{by the process of}} deliberation and negotiation with other societal actors, ensuring that they act in accordance (to an extent) with the wider societal aspirations/interests (whether intended or otherwise) and act to advance the development of Mauritius’ political <b>economy</b> within <b>international</b> political <b>economy.</b> Using <b>the</b> Strategic Relational Approach (SRA) I explain the centrality of human actors in exercising agency in relationship with both <b>the</b> domestic and <b>international</b> contexts in which they find themselves – contexts which are uneven and which also constrain their activities. This allows me to interrogate the marginalisation and engagement approaches in their explanation of Africa’s position in <b>the</b> <b>international</b> political <b>economy</b> as I highlight their interrelated structural and agential dimensions and in the process provide an alternative lens to explain Mauritius’ domestic policy-making processes and engagement in <b>the</b> <b>international</b> political <b>economy.</b> My adopted alternative approach allows the thesis to develop a more complex understanding of the engagement of African countries in <b>the</b> <b>international</b> political <b>economy</b> than is currently provided by pre-existing literature...|$|R

25|$|In {{an angry}} {{response}} to Smoot–Hawley, Canada welcomed the British introduction of trade protectionism {{and a system}} of Commonwealth preference {{during the winter of}} 1931-32. It helped Canada avoid external default on their public debt during the Great Depression. Canada had a high degree of exposure to <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy,</b> which left Canada susceptible to any international economic downturn. The onset of the depression created critical balance of payment deficits, and it was largely the extension of imperial protection by Britain that gave Canada the opportunity to increase their exports to the British market. By 1938 Britain was importing more than twice the 1929 volume of products from Australia, while the value of products shipped from Canada more than doubled, despite the dramatic drop in prices. Thus, the British market played a vital role in helping Canada and Australia stabilize their balance of payments in the immensely difficult economic conditions of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|According to Rapid Assessment surveys {{conducted}} by the World Bank Group in 2011 and 2012, business managers rank informal gifts or payments, anticompetitive practices and regulatory policy uncertainty {{high on the list}} of obstacles to creating and growing a business. These impediments have a chilling effect on foreign investment in Egypt which means that local businesses cannot be competitive in <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> because of the high costs of raising capital. In addition, the amount of paperwork required for construction, imports, and exports is burdensome and the time for the government to process this paperwork is lengthy. Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to import—as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports. The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment. Egypt's unemployment rate reached 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.9 percent in the first quarter (although higher than last year's 8.96 percent). Additionally, there is no bankruptcy law in Egypt and entrepreneurs that fail to pay debts can face prison sentences.|$|E
500|$|By 1937 Bruce's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} {{to social and}} economic cooperation, which he believed had far greater potential for success and was of greater importance to humanity at large. He had taken {{a leading role in}} promoting agriculture, nutrition and economic cooperation through the League of Nations, working intensively with Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr throughout the decade. In 1937 he presented a plan of [...] "economic appeasement", which built on this work and aimed to ease international tensions by reviving international trade and improving living standards in Europe through better working conditions, lower food prices, rural credits and housing assistance. Barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy.</b> In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential. Foreshadowing the logic of the Marshall Plan, Bruce argued that unrelieved economic and social hardship threatened to push other nations towards fascism or communism.|$|E

This debt crisis would lead to neoliberal reforms that would instigate many social movements in the region. A [...] "reversal of development" [...] reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes. Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social security, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and informalization of labor.

2500|$|John Bolton, then U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations on 31 August 2006, said that he expected action to impose sanctions to begin immediately after the deadline passes, with meetings of high-level officials in the coming days, followed by negotiations on {{the language of the}} sanctions resolution.

[...] The five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany, previously offered Iran a package of incentives aimed at getting the country to restart negotiations, but Iran refused to halt its nuclear activities first. Incentives included offers to improve Iran's access to <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> through participation in groups such as the World Trade Organization and to modernize its telecommunications industry.
