5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E

Hipparchus must have been the first {{to be able to do}} this. A rigorous treatment requires spherical trigonometry, thus those who remain certain that Hipparchus lacked it must speculate that he may have made do with planar approximations.

Fonseca and Atwell discussed keeping their characters as friends, rather than falling to [...] "jealousy or cattiness. There's nothing but just support and interest and friendship, {{because a lot of}} times it's more complicated than that on shows." [...] By July 2015, Fonseca was negotiating to return for the second season, and that December she was revealed to be returning for a dream sequence in [...] "A Little Song and Dance". Fazekas said that Angie's appearance in the sequence is her acting as Carter's conscience, [...] "speaking the things that Peggy maybe can’t say to herself.

500|$|Fleming {{planned to}} drive {{most of his}} second tour of cities, which {{concentrated}} on places he wanted to visit in Europe. For the trip he took his own car, a Ford Thunderbird convertible, crossing the channel and journeying through Ostend, Antwerp and Bremen before arriving at his first destination: Hamburg. He stayed only briefly in the city, praising the sex industry by writing [...] "how {{very different from the}} prudish and hypocritical manner in which we so disgracefully mismanage <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> England". Fleming moved on to Berlin, where he was shown round the city by The Sunday Times correspondent Anthony Terry and his wife Rachel. Terry took Fleming into East Berlin and told him many of the details about Operation Stopwatch, the Anglo-American attempt to tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters. In comparison to Hamburg, Fleming thought Berlin was [...] "sinister".|$|E
500|$|Tender Mercies {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Richard Corliss of Time {{declared it}} the [...] "best American {{movie of the}} new year". Carol Olten of The San Diego Union-Tribune declared Tender Mercies the best movie of 1983, and [...] "the most poignant, but forthright, film of the year, with a brilliant performance by Robert Duvall". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals with all of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> equal measure. Still, {{the absence of a}} single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively {{small price to pay for}} the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined." [...] She also praised Beresford's direction, which she said lent the movie a light touch. The Times Canby wrote, [...] "In all respects Tender Mercies is so good that it has the effect of rediscovering a kind of film fiction that has been debased over the decades by hack moviemakers, working according to accepted formulas, frequently to the applause of the critics as well as the public." [...] Leonard Maltin gave it three out of four stars, applauding Duvall in particular and describing it as a [...] "winning but extremely low-key film", though he characterized Foote's screenplay as [...] "not so much a story as a series of vignettes". David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor praised the film for its values, for underscoring the good in people and for avoiding flashiness and quick cuts in favor of a subtle and deliberately paced story, while maintaining a PG rating and omitting sex, drugs and violence. He also felt, however, that it tended toward melodrama on a few occasions and that the soundtrack had [...] "a bit of syrupy music ... especially at the end".|$|E

500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> <b>in</b> 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E

Eventually Glenn said to me, 'Ruud, {{it would be better if}} you do <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> midfield.'" [...] His adjustment, however, was rapid and he ended the season by being named runner-up to Eric Cantona as Footballer of the Year.|$|E
2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} that [...] "the New Testament contains no explicit {{record of a}} transmission of Peter's leadership; nor is the transmission of apostolic authority in general very clear," [...] it considers that its doctrine has a developmental history and that its teaching about matters such as the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and the union of his two natures in a single person developed {{as the result of}} drawing out from the original revealed truth consequences that were not obvious at first: [...] "Thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of both the realities and the words of the heritage of faith is able to grow {{in the life of the}} Church 'through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> their hearts'; it is in particular 'theological research [...] deepens knowledge of revealed truth'".|$|E

Joseph and Mary then returned to Nazareth. There [...] "the child grew and became strong, and was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him." [...] Each year his parents went to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover, and when Jesus {{was twelve years old}} they found him in the Temple listening to the teachers and asking questions so that all who heard him were amazed. His mother rebuked him for causing them anxiety, because they had not known where he was, but he answered that he was in his Father's house. [...] "Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them, but his mother treasured all <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> her heart, and Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man." ...|$|E

He said, 'Now, you have to learn how to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it!

2500|$|Gibson {{originally}} {{announced that}} he would use two old languages without subtitles and rely on [...] "filmic storytelling". Because the story of the Passion is so well-known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: [...] "I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'" [...] The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a [...] professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic. Gibson chose to use Latin instead of Greek, which was the lingua franca of that particular part of the Roman Empire at the time, since there is no source for the Koine Greek spoken in that region. The street Greek spoken in the ancient Levant region of Jesus' day is not the exact Greek language used in the Bible. Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles.|$|E

2500|$|In a September 23, 2005 {{front-page article}} on The Wall Street Journal, Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin, who had overall {{responsibility}} for the development and delivery of Windows, explained how development of Longhorn was [...] "crashing into the ground" [...] {{due in large part}} to the haphazard methods by which features were introduced and integrated into the core of the operating system, without a clear focus on an end-product. In December 2003, Allchin enlisted the help of two other senior executives, Brian Valentine and Amitabh Srivastava, the former being experienced with shipping software at Microsoft, most notably Windows Server 2003, and the latter having spent his career at Microsoft researching and developing methods of producing high-quality testing systems. Srivastava employed a team of core architects to visually map out the entirety of the Windows operating system, and to proactively work towards a development process that would enforce high levels of code quality, reduce interdependencies between components, and in general, [...] "not make things worse with Vista". <b>These</b> <b>things,</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the fact that many of Microsoft's most skilled developers and engineers had been working on Windows Server 2003, led to the decision to [...] "reset" [...] development of Longhorn, building on the same code that would become Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, instead of the older Windows.NET Server Release Candidate 1 (Build 3663).|$|E
2500|$|Several {{reviews of}} the time made much of {{the manner in which}} each {{production}} approached the appearance of Lavinia after the rape; [...] "At Shakespeare's Globe, the groundlings are fainting at the mutilations in Lucy Bailey's coarse but convincing production. To Stratford-upon-Avon, Yukio Ninagawa brings a Japanese staging so stylised that it keeps turning the horror into visual poetry." [...] Speaking of Bailey's production, Eleanor Collins of Cahiers Élisabéthains, said of the scene, [...] "audience members turned their heads away in real distress." [...] Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph called Lavinia [...] "almost too ghastly to behold." [...] Michael Billington of The Guardian said her slow shuffle onto the stage [...] "chills the blood." [...] Sam Marlowe of The Times saw Bailey's use of realism as extremely important for the moral of the production as a whole; [...] "violated, her hands and her tongue cruelly cut away, she stumbles into view drenched in blood, flesh dangling from her hacked wrists, moaning and keening, almost animalistic. It's the production's most powerful symbolic image, redolent of the dehumanising effects of war." [...] Of Ninagawa's production, some critics felt the use of stylisation damaged the impact of the scene. Benedict Nightingale of The Times, for example, asked [...] "is it enough to suggest bloodletting by having red ribbons flow from wrists and throats?" [...] Similarly, The Guardians Michael Billington, who had praised Bailey's use of realistic effects, wrote [...] "At times I felt that Ninagawa, through stylised images and Handelian music, unduly aestheticised violence." [...] Some critics, however, felt the stylisation was more powerful than Bailey's realism; Neil Allan and Scott Revers of Cahiers Élisabéthains, for example, wrote [...] "Blood itself was denoted by spools of red thread spilling from garments, limbs and Lavinia's mouth. Cruelty was stylised; the visceral became the aesthetic." [...] Similarly, Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent, wrote [...] "Gore is represented by swatches of red cords that tumble and trail from wounded wrists and mouths. You might think that this method had a cushioning effect. In fact it concentrates and heightens the horror." [...] Ninagawa himself said [...] ""The violence is all there. I am just trying to express <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> a different way from any previous production." [...] In her 2013 essay, [...] "Mythological Reconfigurations on the Contemporary Stage: Giving a New Voice to Philomela in Titus Andronicus", which directly compares the depictions of the two Lavinias, Agnès Lafont writes of Ninagawa's production that Lavinia's appearance functions as a [...] "visual emblem"; [...] "Bloodshed and beauty create a stark dissonance [...] Distancing itself from the violence it stages thanks to [...] "dissonance," [...] the production presents Lavinia onstage {{as if she were a}} painting [...] Ninagawa's work distances itself from cruelty, as the spectacle of suffering is stylised. Ribbons that represent blood [...] are symbolic means of filtering the aching spectacle of an abused daughter, and yet the spectacle retains its shocking potential and its power of empathy all the while intellectualizing it." ...|$|E
