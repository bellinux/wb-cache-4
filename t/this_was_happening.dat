5|$|While all of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> Arledge, who {{was also}} the {{president}} of the network's sports division, was presiding over ABC's telecast of Monday Night Football in his capacity as its executive producer. At the exact moment he received word of Lennon's death, the game between the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins was tied with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots were driving toward the potential winning score.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E
5|$|As <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> General Dean arrived {{south of}} the town with Lieutenant General Walton Walker to observe the conflict, and the final {{elements}} of the 34th leave Chonan. Dean ordered the 34th Infantry Regiment to retreat to the Kum River. 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry, now down to 175 men, had lost two thirds of its strength in Chonan, around 350 men. Most of the battalion's heavy equipment including mortars and machine guns were also lost. The North Korean radio reported 60 Americans were taken prisoner in the town. The regiment began its retreat in the late afternoon, with North Korean forces moving on ridges parallel to the regiment. Most of the battalion moved out on foot and by truck, resting {{on the evening of}} July 8 before arriving at the Kum River July 9 and setting up new defensive positions.|$|E

5|$|While <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> Philip {{attacked}} and occupied the cities in Thrace which still belonged to Ptolemy, Maroneia, Cypsela, Doriscos, Serrheum and Aemus. The Macedonians then advanced on the Thracian Chersonese where they captured {{the cities of}} Perinthus, Sestos, Elaeus, Alopeconnesus, Callipolis and Madytus. Philip then descended {{to the city of}} Abydos, which was held by a combined Pergamese and Rhodian garrison. Philip started the siege by blockading the city by land and sea to stop attempts to reinforce or supply the city. The Abydenians, full of confidence, dislodged some of the siege engines with their own catapults while some of Philip's other engines were burnt by the defenders. With their siege weaponry in tatters, the Macedonians started undermining the city's walls, eventually succeeding in collapsing the outer wall.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Norway, training started for Operation Puma, {{the occupation of}} the Canary Islands. The operation was planned following intelligence that Spain was going to join the war {{on the side of}} the Axis forces. The intention was to prevent Germany using the islands as a U-Boat base. The force assembled included five commando units, an army brigade, two Royal Marine brigades and supporting arms. Training for Operation Puma culminated in landing exercises in the Hebrides from the Landing Ship, Infantry HMS Royal Scotsman. The operation was renamed Operation Pilgrim and after a number of delays was put on hold by the Chiefs-of-Staff. On 13 September a token force including a troop from No. 4 Commando was dispatched to West Africa. The troop was based in Sierra Leone and Nigeria until returning to Britain in February 1942, after the cancellation of the operation. While <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> a new second in command (2IC) was appointed, Major Charles Vaughan, and a Captain Lord Lovat joined the unit as the training officer. Lovat had been attached to the Lofoten raid as an observer and had applied for a posting to the commandos.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time since the start of free agency, the average major league salary declined. The average free-agent salary dropped by 16 percent, while MLB {{reported}} revenues increasing by 15 percent. This prompted the MLBPA to file a second grievance (Collusion II) on February 18, 1987. Even as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> Ueberroth ordered the owners to tell him personally if they planned to offer contracts longer than three years.|$|E
25|$|In February 1942 the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{escaped from}} Brest, France in the Channel Dash, undetected {{until they were}} well into the English Channel. German ground forces had {{gradually}} increased the jamming of British radar {{over a period of}} weeks, and British operators had not realised <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> In the aftermath, Lord Mountbatten and Winston Churchill approved plans for a raid on the German radar station at Bruneval, near Le Havre. The Biting raid captured a German Wurzburg radar system and a radar operator.|$|E

As <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> Salomon soon targeted the lead ship and began to find its target. The lead galleys sheared away almost violently with the first suffering damage that ultimately forced it to withdraw. Soon the other English ships began to fire; Minion and Margaret and John shielded the lighter armed vessels. Centurion, the biggest ship, was held back in reserve.|$|E
25|$|While <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> the Lancastrian loyalists were {{rallying}} and arming in {{the north}} of England. Faced with the threat of attack from the Percys, and with Margaret of Anjou trying to gain the support of the new king of Scotland James III, York, Salisbury and York's second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, headed north on 2 December. They arrived at York's stronghold of Sandal Castle on 21 December to find the situation bad and getting worse. Forces loyal to Henry controlled the city of York, and nearby Pontefract Castle was also in hostile hands.|$|E
25|$|In the Permian, the new {{continent}} and another terrane, Armorica which included Iberia, drifted in from Gondwana, trapping Avalonia {{between it and}} the continent so adding Iberia/Armorica to Euramerica. This was followed up by the arrival of Gondwana. The effects of these collisions are seen in Europe as the Variscan folding. In North America it shows as later phases of the Acadian orogeny. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> at around the Equator during the later Carboniferous, forming Pangaea {{in such a way that}} Avalonia was near its centre but partially flooded by shallow sea.|$|E

But while <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> USAF fighter-bombers arrived with close air support for the Royalists. Among the casualties they inflicted were the destruction of one tank and the damaging of the final one. An estimated 700 PAVN soldiers were killed.|$|E

She also verified his birthmarks which seemed identical to those she noted on the young Dauphin {{at the request of}} Marie Antoinette. She fought a long battle to attest to his rights, enduring searches of her home where police seized a number of documents, files, and even presents presented to her from the Royal family.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> Gilani resumed work as a DEA {{informant}} in New York City and participated in an undercover operation that reportedly led to the seizure of one kilo of heroin. Yet despite working for a U.S. government agency, Gilani actively raised money and recruited new members for LeT, a group that swore allegiance with Al-Qaeda. Gilani would later testify that he discussed his views regarding Kashmir—the focus of LeT's militant activities —with his DEA handlers. The DEA has insisted that it was unaware of Gilani's political and religious radicalization.|$|E

As a result, the rebels began to surrender their arms and release the hostages. However, as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in Dhaka, revolts by other members of the BDR started in at least 12 other towns and cities. Fighting and takeovers by the BDR was reported in Chittagong, at Feni, on the eastern border with India, in Rajshahi in the northwest and Sylhet in the north.|$|E
25|$|Within 48 {{hours of}} war being declared, the Corps {{was able to}} entirely staff all of Scotland's {{military}} hospitals, freeing the regular staff for service. In addition to this, St Andrew's were also able to assemble two Foreign Service Units (which served in France and in hospital ships), a Military Nursing Service (derived from females Corps members) and a transport service alongside the British Red Cross attending to wounded soldiers from hospital trains. Whilst all of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> St Andrew's usual civilian work of first aid training and casualty transportation continued unabated (albeit the additional services placed strain on the Association's funds).|$|E

Kyle Herrman, a friend of the band, accompanied them for several days and filmed the documentary, Mass Appeal Madness.
