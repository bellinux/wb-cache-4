25|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} by the Afrikaans Daily newspaper, Beeld, that on 23 March 2013 when the Séléka rebel group attempted to take power in the Central African Republic by invading the capital of Bangui, four armed Gripen Fighter aircraft from 2 Squadron SAAF were sent along with a C-130BZ transport aircraft (reportedly carrying a stock of bombs) {{in order to provide}} close air support to the 200-strong South African garrison who were still fighting in the city. The aircraft were, however, recalled shortly after, as the South Africans and the rebels agreed to a ceasefire and rather opted to withdraw peacefully from the country. Several flights made by C-130BZ aircraft evacuated the bodies of the 13 South African soldiers who were killed and the 27 who were wounded during the Séléka offensive and also the remainder of the deployed soldiers and their equipment after the ceasefire was declared.

25|$|However, {{evidence}} of historical and recent protests {{suggests that the}} backbone of the protests are of peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanians disfranchised by liberal economic policies instituted in the country during the last decades. Specifically, previous mass protests include protests in 1989 in the city of Karak and other southern towns in the country known as April 1989 uprising (هبة نيسان) that led to reintroduction of democratic life. In 1996, bread riots erupted in Ma'an and other southern cities in Jordan as well. Both are predominantly of peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanian origins. More recently, the 2011–2012 uprising started with movements all over the country specially in towns with a predominantly east-Jordanian population known locally as Al-Hirak. Therefore, according to many analysts while protests in Amman might generates a media buzz about a revolution in Jordan, but discontent in rural Jordan among peninsular Arabic speaking Jordanians is what would really tip the scales. Regardless of identity and demographic sensitivities both groups tend to agree on the need for a more robust economy and a cure for Jordan’s crippling unemployment. However, many argue that the sensitive demographic balance in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>will</b> ultimately decide how wide and deep political reforms will go.|$|E

We also analyze policies under a global per capita emissions based contraction and convergence regime with emission trading: When China joins the regime, <b>the</b> developing <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> benefit, while <b>the</b> industrialized <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> be almost unaffected. When China does not join the regime and instead a carbon content based border tax is imposed, <b>the</b> industrialized <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> significantly benefit, while China will be significantly worse off. The effect of the border tax adjustment on the global carbon price and on global emissions seems negligible...|$|R
