In this paper we effectively compute an improved upper bound for the number of prolongations needed to guarantee the existence of such realizations, which ultimately produces solutions to many types of systems of partial differential equations. This bound has several applications, including an improved upper bound for the order of characteristic sets of prime differential ideals. We obtain our upper bound by proving a new result on the growth of the Hilbert-Samuel function, which may be of independent interest...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} capital controls and financial development, {{with an emphasis on}} the empirical aspects of the linkage. Financial development is interpreted broadly as increasing the efficiency of allocating financial resources and monitoring capital projects. In empirical <b>terms,</b> <b>this</b> <b>translates</b> into an increasing volume of bank intermediation and an increasing role for equity capital. Hence, this paper investigates a substantially broader set of proxy measures of financial development than has heretofore been analysed. Moreover, in addition to the IMF’s measures of exchange restrictions, the Quinn (1997) index of financial openness is used as a measure of capital controls. The econometric results suggest that the rate of financial development, as measured by private credit creation and stock market activity, is linked to the existence of capital controls. However, the strength of this relationship varies with the empirical measure used and the level of economic development. Equity market activity appears to be linked to capital controls in both the full sample and in a restricted sample of developing countries. The possibilities for work at a more disaggregate level on banking and equity markets are also discussed. The results pertaining to equity market development are particularly important, as recent work suggests that new technologies may not be effectively supported by bank-directed finance. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{how large}} fiscal-policy changes {{have to be}} to solve the U. S. government deficit problem. This question is complicated in part because of endogeneity issues. A fiscal-policy change designed to decrease the deficit has effects on the macro economy, which in turn affects the deficit. Any analysis of fiscal-policy proposals must take these effects into account: one needs a model of the economy. This paper uses a macroeconometric model of the world economy to examine the deficit problem. A base run is first obtained in which there are no major changes in U. S. fiscal policy. This results in an ever increasing debt/GDP ratio. Then net taxes (taxes minus transfers) are increased by an amount sufficient to stabilize the longrun debt/GDP ratio. The increases are linearly phased in over a three-year period beginning {{in the first quarter of}} 2012. The estimates of the needed net tax increases are large. Compared to values in the base run, net taxes after the phase in need to be about $ 650 billion higher each year in 2011 dollars.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a space-time finite-volume formulation for the Euler equations, {{which allows for}} the use of spatially non-uniform time-steps. The formulation also inherently accounts for the effect of dynamically deforming computational meshes. The space and time dimensions are treated in a unified manner so as to per-mit the variation of control volume sizes in both dimensions. The primary goal is to maintain solution accuracy while reducing the number of unknowns in the overall solution process and potentially lower computational expense. While the formulation presented here is capable of simultaneously handling non conformal meshes in both space and time, the scope of the paper is limited to conformal spatial meshes with non conformal temporal meshes. At any slice in time, the number of spatial elements remains the same, but across any slice in space, the number of time-steps is allowed to vary. In traditional <b>terms,</b> <b>this</b> <b>translates</b> to non-uniform temporal advance-ment of spatial elements in an unsteady problem. Two unsteady problems, one where an isentropic vortex is convected through a rectangular domain and one of a pitching NACA 64 A 010 airfoil in transonic conditions are presented to demonstrate the algorithm. A local temporal error indicator is used to identify space-time elements which require higher resolution in the time dimension, thus marking them for temporal refinement. The results indicate that significant reduction in the overall degrees-of-freedom required to solve an unsteady problem can be achieved using the proposed algorithm. Modest improvements in computational expense for specific problems are also observed. I...|$|R

Biofilms often resist standard therapies {{and the need to}} develop new means of intervention provides an opportunity to fundamentally rethink our strategies. Conventional approaches to working with biological systems are, for the most part, “brute force”, attempting to effect control in an input and effort intensive manner and are often insufficient when dealing with the inherent non-linearity and complexity of living systems. Biological systems, by their very nature, are dynamic, adaptive and resilient and require management tools that interact with dynamic processes rather than inert artefacts. I present an overview of a novel engineering philosophy which aims to exploit rather than fight those properties, and hence provide a more efficient and robust alternative. Based on a combination of evolutionary theory and whole-systems design, its essence is what I will call systems aikido; the basic principle of aikido being to interact with the momentum of an attacker and redirect it with minimal energy expenditure, using the opponent’s energy rather than one’s own.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Demand Side Management (DSM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} viable and {{sustainable}} short term methods to address the shortfall in electricity generation in South Africa. This is because DSM projects can be implemented relatively quickly and inexpensively when compared with alternative generation options. This specifically applies to the mining industry. South African mines presently consume 15 % of Eskom-generated electricity. Mine compressed air systems are some of the biggest users, consuming approximately 21 % of mine electricity consumption. Electricity savings on compressed air systems are therefore important. With this study, various Energy Efficiency methods on compressed air systems were investigated. These methods include variable speed drives on compressor motors, temperature control of compressor discharge, minimising pressure drops in the air distribution systems, eliminating compressed air leaks, and optimising compressor selection and control. The most efficient strategies were identified, taking into account factors such as financial viability, sustainability, and ease of implementation. The best strategies were found to be the optimised control and selection of compressors, minimising compressed air leaks, and the optimal control of system pressure. These strategies were implemented and tested on large compressed air systems in gold and platinum mines. Savings of between 10 % and 35 % on the maximum demand of the systems were achieved. In present monetary <b>terms</b> <b>this</b> <b>translates</b> to as much as R 108 million savings for the mines per year at the end of 2009 tariffs. If total mine compressed air electricity consumption can reduce by 30 %, it will result in nearly a 1 % reduction in total Eskom demand. This shows that mine compressed air savings can make a significant contribution to the drive for Energy Efficiency in South Africa. Master...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — TE (Traffic engineering) {{tools are}} applied to design a set of paths, e. g., using MPLS, in the network {{in order to achieve}} global network utilization. Usually, paths are {{guaranteed}} long-term traffic rates, while the short-term rates of bursty traffic are not guaranteed.

Given a set of paths and bandwidth allocation along them, the suggested algorithm finds a special collection of bottleneck links, which we term the first cut, as the optimal buffering location for bursts. In these locations, the buffers act as an additional resource to improve the network shortterm behavior, allowing traffic to takes advantage of the under-used resources at the links that precede and follow the bottleneck links. The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB. The resulted provisioning parameters were simulated using NS- 2 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. I...|$|R
40|$|Believing at Work {{asks what}} {{difference}} religious faith makes in business. It suggests that professionals who infuse {{their work with}} transcendent, religious purposes may experience a shift in their mental models, which can become a marketplace advantage. This shift moves individuals from being internally focused on pursuing happiness to being externally, other-focused, driven to improve the world. In business <b>terms,</b> <b>this</b> <b>translates</b> to a shift from profit-centrism to Corporate Social Responsibility. While some modern theorists maintain that business' only responsibility is to maximize shareholder value, this is increasingly a minority view. In the modern, global economy, decisions by individuals and firms are widely recognized to have deep impacts the world over-not only on shareholder value, but on the environment, and on human rights. In this context, firms are finding that Corporate Social Responsibility is not only politically expedient, but strategically necessary. To effectively make this shift, firms must become more externally focused, recognizing and acting upon their potential to impact the world for good or ill. (cont.) As this same external focus is fundamental {{to many of the}} world's religions, this thesis argues that those who are grounded in such values can realize marketplace advantage over their secular peers. To develop this argument, we begin with a survey of modern business literature. This highlights both the obstacles to integrating religious faith and business, and the range of views for how they can and should (or shouldn't) come together. From there, we search for historical precedent for these views. Anchored in Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments and Max Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, we explore the fundamental dynamics driving human behavior in capitalist systems, in addition to the tensions and possible synergies between religious faith and secular work. We then synthesize these concepts in a causal loop diagram, which allows us to suggest the perspectives and behaviors that may manifest when faith-work integration is low, moderate, or high. Finally, we test and refine these hypotheses against experiences of contemporary businesspersons and religious leaders. These allow us to examine and articulate real examples of faith-based marketplace advantage. by Stefan G. Lanfer. Thesis (M. B. A.)

Adequate use of this resource will define the economical and environmental future of the region. Current irrigation systems, even under best management practices, over-apply water, as they do not account for spatial variability of crop water needs in fields. Over-application of water is wasteful and has environmental and economical repercussions. Water requirements are determined by crop evapotranspiration (ET). Key factors affecting ET in Canterbury are wind and solar radiation. Both of these are significantly affected by windbreaks, resulting in variability in ET and water requirements across a field. Understanding the variability in ET caused by windbreaks will enable for the correct application of water through precision irrigation systems. A theoretical model was developed to estimate savings in irrigation by accounting for windbreaks in the Canterbury region. Windbreaks reduce evapotranspiration and therefore crops/pasture behind windbreaks needs less water than those {{in other parts of the}} field. Results for a case study in Canterbury show that windbreaks can potentially reduce the annual on-farm water consumption by 10 to 20 %, while still maintaining ideal crop/pasture yields.

40|$|Extract] At face value, {{the concept}} of {{biological}} diversity, or biodiversity, is an objective measure used by scientists to describe ecosystem characteristics. Biodiversity {{is defined by the}} United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) as variability among living organisms at a number of levels ranging from the members of individual species through to ecosystems and bioregions (UNEP 1992). In lay <b>terms</b> <b>this</b> may be <b>translated</b> as the number of genetically distinct plants, animals and micro-organisms present in any given territory. Biodiversity is also, however, an inherently social concept. This is not so much in the sense that science and the creation of scientific knowledge are themselves social activities (involving institutions, collaboration, conventions on the use of evidence etc.), but in the sense that humans and human activities are intimately implicated in the ecosystem processes through which biodiversity is reproduced and transformed. The CBD and related conventions recognise the social dimensions of biodiversity in a variety of ways: acknowledging the roles of indigenous people and farmers in managing biodiversity; identifying biodiversity as the foundation of food security and poverty alleviation; and defining plant genetic resources as a 'common heritage of mankind' (FAO 1989, p. 8) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to promoting energy efficiency, China has actively pursued alternative energy {{development as a}} strategy to reduce its energy demand and carbon emissions. One area of particular focus has been to raise the share of alternative energy in China’s rapidly growing electricity generation with a 2020 target of 15 % share of total primary energy. Over the last ten years, China has established several major renewable energy regulations along with programs and subsidies to encourage the growth of non-fossil alternative energy including solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, geothermal and biomass power as well as biofuels and coal alternatives. This study thus seeks to examine China’s alternative energy {{in terms of what}} has and will continue to drive alternative energy development in China as well as analyze in depth the growth potential and challenges facing each specific technology. This study found that despite recent policies enabling extraordinary capacity and investment growth, alternative energy technologies face constraints and barriers to growth. For relatively new technologies that have not achieved commercialization such as concentrated solar thermal, geothermal and biomass power, China faces technological limitations to expanding the scale of installed capacity. While some alternative technologies such as hydropower and coal alternatives have been slowed by uneven and often changing market and policy support, others such as wind and solar PV have encountered physical and institutional barriers to grid integration. Lastly, all alternative energy technologies face constraints in human resources and raw material resources including land and water, with some facing supply limitations in critical elements such as uranium for nuclear, neodymium for wind and rare earth metals for advanced solar PV. In light of China’s potential for and barriers to growth, the resource and energy requirement for alternative energy technologies were modeled and scenario analysis used to evaluate the energy and emission impact of two pathways of alternative energy development. The results show that China can only meets its 2015 and 2020 targets for non-fossil penetration if it successfully achieves all of its capacity targets for 2020 with continued expansion through 2030. To achieve this level of alternative generation, significant amounts of raw materials including 235 Mt of concrete, 54 Mt of steel, 5 Mt of copper along with 3 billion tons of water and 64 thousand square kilometers of land are needed. China’s alternative energy supply will likely have relatively high average energy output to fossil fuel input ratio of 42 declining to 26 over time, but this ratio is largely skewed by nuclear and hydropower capacity. With successful alternative energy development, 32 % of China’s electricity and 21 % of its total primary energy will be supplied by alternative energy by 2030. Compared to the counterfactual baseline in which alternative energy development stumbles and China does not meet its capacity targets until 2030, alternative energy development can displace 175 Mtce of coal inputs per year and 2080 Mtce cumulatively from power generation by 2030. In carbon <b>terms,</b> <b>this</b> <b>translates</b> into 5520 Mt of displaced CO{sub 2 } emissions over the twenty year period, with more than half coming from expanded nuclear and wind power generation.
