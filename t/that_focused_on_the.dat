5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} <b>that</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E
5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} {{in the last couple}} of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums. Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center <b>that</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E

5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics <b>that</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E

25|$|After Giotto, Fra Angelico {{and others}} {{systematically}} developed uncluttered images <b>that</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> depiction of Jesus with an ideal human beauty, in works like Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, arguably the first High Renaissance painting. Images of Jesus now drew on classical sculpture, {{at least in}} some of their poses. However Michelangelo was considered to have gone much too far in his beardless Christ in his The Last Judgment fresco in the Sistine Chapel, which very clearly adapted classical sculptures of Apollo, and this path was rarely followed by other artists.|$|E
25|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a {{separate}} dissent <b>that</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> selective {{enforcement of the}} law against homosexuals. The Georgia statute could not be applied to married heterosexuals, as consensual sexual activity {{within the bounds of}} marriage was protected under Griswold v. Connecticut. Nor could the law be applied to unmarried heterosexuals, as Eisenstadt v. Baird had extended Griswold to unmarried people. Since heterosexuals could never be prosecuted for sodomy, Georgia should have the burden of proving that selective enforcement against homosexuals was constitutional.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} of rolling stock in Montreal went beyond just adopting the MP 59 car from Paris. North American cities building subway systems in the 1960s and 1970s (Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Atlanta) were in search of modern rolling stock that not only best fitted their needs but also encompassed a change in industrial design <b>that</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aesthetics and performances. The Montreal trains are now among the oldest North American subway trains in service - the Canadian Vickers MR-63 {{dating back to the}} system's opening in 1966 - but extended longevity is expected of rolling stock operated under fully sheltered conditions.|$|E

25|$|Kano's {{vision for}} judo {{was one of}} a martial way that could be practiced realistically. Randori (free practice) was a central part of judo {{pedagogy}} and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo. Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques <b>that</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in ukemi (break falls) and practiced on tatami (rice straw mats).|$|E
25|$|While in Yan'an, Helen {{suffered}} from severe dysentery and became extremely ill. Despite her illness, Helen completed her book's manuscript {{in less than}} one year.

This specific trip to Yan'an provided Helen with the material to produce at least five other books. Helen used experiences from this trip to write her most successful book, The Song of Ariran. She also drew upon her interviews with a Kim-San, Korean independence leader she met in Yan'an.|$|E
