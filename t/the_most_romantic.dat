500|$|The journal is also {{threaded}} {{through with}} {{elements of the}} medieval and Gothic romance tradition: [...] "accounts of ruined castles, enchanting valleys, and sublime views". In fact, in [...] "The English in Italy", Mary Shelley writes of the journey that [...] "it was acting in a novel, being an incarnate romance". However, these romantic descriptions are often ambiguous. Often single sentences contain juxtapositions between [...] "romance" [...] and [...] "reality": [...] "Many villages, ruined by war, occupied <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>romantic</b> spots". She also references Don Quixote, but he was [...] "famous for his delusions of romance", as Labbe points out. Mary Shelley's allusions to Cervantes's Don Quixote (1605) not only places her text in a romance tradition, they would also have hinted at its radicalism to contemporary readers. During the 1790s, Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin, connected {{his support for the}} French Revolution with the romance tradition, specifically Don Quixote and any allusion to the novel would have signalled Godwinian radicalism to readers at the time. It would also have suggested support for reform efforts in Spain, which was rebelling against Napoleon. The beginning of the journal is dominated by romance conventions, but this style disappears when the travellers run out of money. However, romance conventions briefly return during the trip down the Rhine. As Labbe argues, [...] "it would appear that while [...] seems to be industriously salting her narrative with romance in order, perhaps, to garner public approval, she also... exposes the falsity of such a scheme." ...|$|E
