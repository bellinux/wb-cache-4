In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E

5|$|The cuisine of Slavonia {{reflects}} {{cultural influences}} on the region through the diversity of its culinary influences. The most significant among those were from Hungarian, Viennese, Central European, as well as Turkish and Arab cuisines brought by series of conquests and accompanying social influences. <b>The</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> traditional dishes are pickled vegetables, dairy products and smoked meats.

Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E

5|$|The 8 March Revolution {{has often}} been viewed as a mere {{military}} coup, but it had many of <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> national revolts from below. The revolution was led by an anti-oligarchical alliance of a radicalised lower middle class, strategic members of the officer corps, marginalised minorities and {{a significant number of}} peasants who were mobilised for agrarian conflict. In an international context, the revolution took place because the state boundaries established by France were artificial and the hostility within the newly established Syria to the creation of Israel. The traditional elite that took power in Syria when the country gained independence had come to power during the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The external imposition of arbitrary state boundaries on Syria with no corresponding popular acceptance led to discontent. The national struggle was shaped by ideologies such as Arab nationalism, pan-Islamism and Greater Syrianism. The plebeian character of the struggle, and the radical ideologies, spawned radical solutions to the agrarian problem.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E

25|$|In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, {{adopted the}} Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food {{regulation}} {{still in use}} through the 20th century (the Reinheitsgebot passed formally from German law in 1987). The Gebot ordered that <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> beer be restricted to water, barley, and hops; yeast {{was added to the}} list after Louis Pasteur's discovery in 1857. The Bavarian law was applied throughout Germany as part of the 1871 German unification as the German Empire under Otto von Bismarck, and has since been updated to reflect modern trends in beer brewing. To this day, the Gebot is considered a mark of purity in beers, although this is controversial.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, breakfast was served between 6:00 and 7:30 am, lunch around 11:00 am and dinner at about 6:30 pm. From {{the start of}} their captivity, the food posed a problem for prisoners, who complained of a diet that was too {{inconsistent}} to ward off hunger. Soup became the symbol of this regimen: it might be made with beans, oats, prunes, beets, codfish. Bread was replaced by “KK bread” (from the German “Kleie und Kartoffeln”: bran and potatoes), <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> which remain unclear: potato flour, sawdust or ox blood. Malnutrition became a daily affair for the prisoner; after the war, many suffered serious digestive problems and adapted with difficulty to a new dietary regimen.|$|E
