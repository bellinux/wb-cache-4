5|$|This {{increase}} in population caused many adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, {{ran out of}} phone numbers and <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries. Electric demand was so high that the power company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent brownouts. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.|$|E

40|$|<b>Waiting</b> <b>lists</b> for {{elective}} surgery {{are considered a}} major health policy concern in most countries of the world. The most common reason to explain this phenomenon is that demand exceeds supply. Traditionally, <b>the</b> management of <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> {{has been focused on}} timeliness of medical attention. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> management model that includes the concepts of timeliness and justice simultaneously. We designed a prioritization method based solely on medical criteria. We developed a computer software to register patients, to prioritize and monitor <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>lists.</b> <b>The</b> system was implemented in 2013 and is currently used in all surgical specialties at a public hospital. The results show that timeliness does not suffice to manage <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> for {{elective surgery}}, and therefore it should be complemented with an indicator of justice. Under this management model, hospitals should attempt to balance justice with timeliness of care and prioritize initiatives that improve both indicators at the same time. In addition, we propose using this model to manage <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> of other hospital processes...|$|R

50|$|Colleges mailing out <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> offers {{generally}} advise {{students to}} reserve a spot {{at a college}} they have been accepted to by sending in a deposit, usually several hundred dollars to guarantee that the student will have a place at any college in the fall. Later, if a student is accepted by a college from a <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> and {{if he or she}} chooses to accept <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> offer, it usually entails sacrificing that earlier deposit. In the United States, for students applying by regular admission, the month of April is a time when much activity happens; colleges email offers of acceptance and rejection, and students select a college by sending a deposit. In May, after receiving deposits, colleges know how many spots will be open, and will usually begin to offer admission to students on their <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> as positions become open.

25|$|The Packers have an {{exceptionally}} loyal fan base. Regardless of team performance, every game played in Green Bay {{has been sold}} out since 1960.

They also have one of the longest season ticket waiting lists in professional sports, 86,000 names long, more than there are seats at Lambeau Field. The average wait is said to be over 30 years, but with only 90 or so tickets turned over annually it would be 955 years before the newest name on the list got theirs.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{issue of}} <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> for {{surgical}} procedures {{is not only}} highly political but of significant concern to the general public. In addition, in acute-care hospitals, {{large amounts of money}} are consumed by the theatre units, which is a key feature in <b>the</b> surgical <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> problem, so there are important financial issues associated with <b>waiting</b> <b>lists.</b> " Watson and Landman (1994) ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues facing hospital management today is the need to bring efficient and sufficient services to patients at the right time. One {{of the most}} disturbing problems affecting patient satisfaction is <b>the</b> long <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for non-urgent surgery. Since Saudi Arabian (SA) policy is to provide free, comprehensive and universal health care services to all citizens, 1 there is great demand on the health services resulting in long <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> for non-urgent surgical cases in hospitals. The adverse effects of these long <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> include: major adverse medical consequences, even in non-urgent cases; dissatisfaction among both patients and hospital staff, improper utilization of health resources, a decline in the quality of patients’ care and loss of the reputation of the hospital. 2 In their evaluation of <b>the</b> coronary bypass <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> Mulgan and Logan, confirmed that usually some of the less severe cases on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> deteriorate into more serious conditions that could have been prevented. Also, <b>the</b> average <b>waiting</b> period is unacceptably long for surgical services...|$|R
25|$|Increasing {{regional}} {{growth in}} the 1990s led to frequent traffic jams on the bridge and swamped parking lots at the train station. Interest grew in reviving ferry service, especially after MTA's successful 2000 restoration of the Haverstraw–Ossining Ferry across a similarly wide portion of the river further south. However, plans never quite seemed to materialize despite considerable appropriations of money, and in the interim commuters had to be content with a shuttle bus across the bridge from the park and ride lot on NY 17K near its connection to the New York State Thruway. Meanwhile, MTA began {{for the first time}} to require parking permits at Beacon, and <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> swelled to at least 600 more than capacity, even after the lots were enlarged in the early 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{capacity}} {{has more than}} doubled since Lambeau Field was opened, demand for tickets remains high. The Packers have sold out every game since 1960, and at least 115,000 names are on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> (with a reported average wait time of 30 years). The sell-out streak has had the effect (intended or not) of ensuring that all Packers home games are televised in Green Bay and Milwaukee, a streak that started in 1973 (prior to that time, local telecasts of home games were disallowed regardless of how many tickets were sold); the Packers are one of four NFL teams (the others being the Washington Redskins, Denver Broncos, and Pittsburgh Steelers) that have not had a home game blacked out since the 1973 blackout rules were put into place.|$|E
25|$|If a seat is not available, {{then the}} ticket {{is given a}} wait listed number; else the ticket is confirmed, and a berth number is printed on the ticket. A person {{receiving}} a wait listed ticket must wait until there are enough cancellations to enable him {{to move up the}} list and obtain a confirmed ticket. If his ticket is not confirmed on the day of departure, he may not board the train. Some of the tickets are assigned to the RAC or Reservation against Cancellation, which is between <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and the confirmed list. These allow the ticket holder to board the train and obtain an allotted seat decided by a ticket collector, after the ticket collector has ascertained that there is a vacant (absentee) seat.|$|E
40|$|Hospital <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> are {{a feature}} of public health care {{services}} that result when demand appears to exceed supply, and serve as mechanisms to ration health care resources. While <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> are usually conceptualised as rational queues, <b>the</b> dynamics of <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> especially radiology <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> are more complex and still poorly understood. The present study has attempted to better understand a problematic <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> by adopting a systems approach known as boundary critique. A case study of an ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> was undertaken in which in-depth and semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a variety of stakeholders. Viewing <b>the</b> ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> systemically highlighted <b>the</b> role that a radiologist boundary surrounding the detection and confirmation of abnormal pathology played in constructing <b>the</b> ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> as a problem. This boundary was enacted through the process of double scanning, a symbol of radiologist expertise. General practitioners and patients employed a wider boundary, which focused on the management of clinical uncertainty. When the system in focus was widened to include this boundary, the process of double scanning became problematic. Double scanning contributed to the growth of <b>the</b> ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and exacerbated <b>the</b> difficulty faced by general practitioners and waiting patients in managing diagnostic uncertainty. To manage the tension created between radiologist and general practice boundaries, non-radiologist stakeholders undertook unrecognised and under-valued work that helped maintain the radiologist-centred systems of process and structure. Radiologists also employed a discourse of inappropriateness that downplayed the significance of delayed general practitioner referrals, which served to reinforce the primacy of the radiologist boundary. Conflicting boundaries highlighted that <b>the</b> ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> was managed in a way that did not act in the interests of non-radiologist stakeholders such as general practitioners and waiting patients. Stakeholders proposed a number of interventions to manage <b>the</b> growing ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list.</b> However, these primarily served to further strengthen the radiologist boundary and viewed as such represented a narrow improvement in terms of the interests of non-radiologist stakeholders. The process of boundary critique helped to reframe <b>the</b> ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> in terms of radiologist dominance. Interventions based on the boundary judgements of general practitioners, waiting patients and sonographers were developed. The present study argues that <b>the</b> ultrasound <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> can be better understood in terms of the role that boundary judgements play in constructing notions such as expertise, illness and appropriateness, which underlie a common-sense understanding of need, demand and supply...|$|R
