The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate interoperability issues related to integrating design and analysis tools, specifically BIM models and cost models. Previous efforts to generate cost estimates from BIM models have focused on developing two necessary but disjoint processes: 1) extracting accurate quantity <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>data</b> from BIM models, and 2) manipulating cost analysis results to provide informative feedback. Some recent efforts involve developing detailed definitions, enhanced IFC-based formats and in-house standards for assemblies that encompass building models (e. g. US Corps of Engineers). Some commercial applications enhance the level of detail associated to BIM objects with assembly descriptions to produce lightweight BIM models that can be used by different applications for various purposes (e. g. Autodesk for design review, Navisworks for scheduling, Innovaya for visual estimating, etc.). This study suggests the integration of design and analysis tools by means of managing all building data in one shared repository accessible to multiple domains in the AEC industry (Eastman, 1999, Eastman et al., 2008, authors, 2010). Our approach aims at providing an integrated platform that incorporates a quantity take off extraction method from IFC models, a cost analysis model, and a comprehensive cost reporting scheme, using the Solibri Model Checker (SMC) development environment. Approach As part of the effort to improve the performance of federal buildings, GSA evaluates concept design alternatives based on their compliance with specific requirements, including cost analysis. Two basic challenges emerge in the process of automating cost analysis for BIM models: 1) At this early concept design stage, only minimal information is available to produce a reliable analysis, such as space names and areas, and building gross area, 2) design alternatives share a lot of programmatic requirements such as location, functional spaces and other data. It is thus crucial to integrate other factors that contribute to substantial cost differences such as perimeter, and exterior wall and roof areas. These are extracted from BIM models using IFC data and input through XML into the Parametric Cost Engineering System (PACES, 2010) software to generate cost analysis reports. PACES uses this limited dataset at a conceptual stage and RSMeans (2010) data to infer cost assemblies at different levels of detail. Functionalities Cost model import module The cost model import module has three main functionalities: generating the input dataset necessary for the cost model, performing a semantic mapping between building type specific names and name aggregation structures in PACES known as functional space areas (FSAs), and managing cost data external to the BIM model, such as location and construction duration. The module computes building data such as footprint, gross area, perimeter, external wall and roof area and building space areas. This data is generated through SMC in the form of an XML file and imported into PACES. Reporting module The reporting module uses the cost report generated by PACES to develop a comprehensive report in the form of an excel spreadsheet. This report consists of a systems-elemental estimate that shows the main systems of the building in terms of UniFormat categories, escalation, markups, overhead and conditions, a UniFormat Level III report, and a cost breakdown that provides a summary of material, equipment, labor and total costs. Building parameters are integrated in the report to provide insight on the variations among design alternatives. ...|$|E

40|$|A 48 -microphone planar {{phased array}} system {{was used to}} acquire noise source {{localization}} data on a full-scale Williams International FJ 44 turbofan engine. Data were acquired with the array at three different locations relative to the engine, two {{on the side and}} one in front of the engine. At the two side locations the planar microphone array was parallel to the engine centerline; at the front location the array was perpendicular to the engine centerline. At each of the three locations, data were acquired at eleven different engine operating conditions ranging from engine idle to maximum (<b>take</b> <b>off)</b> speed. <b>Data</b> obtained with the array {{off to the side of}} the engine were spatially filtered to separate the inlet and nozzle noise. Tones occurring in the inlet and nozzle spectra were traced to the low and high speed spools within the engine. The phased array data indicate that the Inflow Control Device (ICD) used during this test was not acoustically transparent; instead, some of the noise emanating from the inlet reflected off of the inlet lip of the ICD. This reflection is a source of error for far field noise measurements made during the test. The data also indicate that a total temperature rake in the inlet of the engine is a source of fan noise...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{internet}} <b>took</b> <b>off</b> as a <b>data</b> network for sending email and browsing websites. The option of putting voice traffic {{on to the}} net has been in consideration ever since internet was able to transmit media. This is otherwise called Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). VoIP is implemented in Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANET) but its range is considerably small. This leads to congestion and improper Quality of Service (QoS). Current implementation of VoIP over MANET has issues like hidden and exposed terminal problems. In order for MANET to expand its connectivity, there {{should be at least}} one node within its range. As the range of MANET is a disadvantage, distant connectivity is an issue. In this paper, a method has been proposed to use mobile Wireless – Fidelity (Wi-Fi) hotspot instead of MANET for VoIP. For this, mobile nodes are connected within a range of a hotspot network (100 ft.) for audio transmission. This scenario would be simulated using both mobile hotspot and MANET and the results are compared for better understanding. Main aspects like efficient data transmission, QoS and security are taken into account...|$|R
