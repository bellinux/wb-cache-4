40|$|Formal {{theories}} for real-time systems (such as timed pro-cess algebra, timed automata and timed petri nets) {{have gained}} great {{success in the}} modelling of concurrent tim-ing behavior and {{in the analysis of}} real-time properties. However, due to the ineliminable <b>timing</b> <b>differences</b> between a model and its realization, synthesising a software real-ization from a model in a correctness-preserving way is still a challenging research topic. In this paper, we tackle this problem by solving a set of sub-problems. First, we introduce property relations between real-time systems {{on the basis of their}} absolute and relative <b>timing</b> <b>differences.</b> Second, we bridge the <b>timing</b> <b>differences</b> between a model and its realization by a sequence of (absolute and relative) <b>timing</b> <b>differences.</b> Third, we propose two parameterised hypotheses to capture the <b>timing</b> <b>differences</b> between the model and its realization. The parameters of both hypothe-ses are used to predict the real-time properties of the re-alization from those of the model. Finally, we introduce a synthesis tool, which shows that the two hypotheses can be satisfied during software synthesis. ...|$|R

Interestingly, the latencies in the medial and lateral OB decreased at different rates as odorant concentration increased, causing the <b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> between them to also diminish. As a result, output neurons in the medial and lateral OB fired with greater synchrony at higher odorant concentrations.

30|$|The {{temperature}} drift of the etalon gap spacing can be monitored using the observed airglow fringes {{as shown in}} Eq. (3). This drift causes systematic offset on the horizontal wind velocities, because the horizontal wind is estimated from the difference of the fringe peak location between north and south. However, this systematic offset seems to be small. For example, {{even if there is}} a large etalon gap drift that corresponds to 100 m s− 1 in one hour, it causes systematic offset of only 2 m s− 1 for FP 01 (<b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> of 1.25 min between north and south) and 6 m s− 1 for FP 02 –FP 04 (<b>timing</b> <b>difference</b> of 3.45 min between north and south). However, this etalon gap drift directly affects the vertical wind measurements, as shown in Figs. 7 (e) and 8 (e). This effect may be avoided by installing a slow feedback heater around the etalon box or by considering the fact that the {{temperature drift}} is a rather slow effect compared with that of auroral vertical winds.|$|E

30|$|One feature {{known to}} be over-simplified {{in the most recent}} model of the full {{swimming}} circuit [34] is the mechanism for initiating rhythm following a brief stimulus. Fundamentally, the requirement is simply that oscillations on both sides (in each half-centre) need to be initiated and coordinated. In the reduced model, the process is also much more simplified: the triggering stimulus to each side is sufficient to initiate oscillation and this allows us to focus attention on the effect of <b>timing</b> <b>differences</b> between stimuli to the two sides. We have illustrated effects of changing the stimulus duration, but we do not consider these further here. Running multiple simulations showed that stimuli {{are much more likely to}} initiate swimming than synchrony. To produce synchrony, <b>timing</b> <b>differences</b> between stimuli to the two sides must be very small. This would suggest that, in biological terms, an initiation mechanism that avoids such near-simultaneous activation of the two sides (see below) is required.|$|R

In the current study, we used magnetoencephalography to measure the brain responses of 10 autistic children as they listened passively to dichotic pitch stimuli, in which an illusory tone is generated by sub-millisecond inter-aural <b>timing</b> <b>differences</b> in white noise. Relative to control stimuli that contain no inter-aural <b>timing</b> <b>differences,</b> dichotic pitch stimuli typically elicit an object related negativity (ORN) response, associated with the perceptual segregation of the tone and the carrier noise into distinct auditory objects.

More striking, the autistic children demonstrated a significant differential response to the pitch stimulus, peaking at around 50 ms.
