5|$|Baker created four {{distinct}} {{stages of}} makeup design so that West would appear <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate stages of editing, these makeup stages were ultimately {{eliminated from the}} final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor Rebar was impatient and uncooperative with the extensive makeup sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all of the facial appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, {{might have been an}} additional factor in the lack of makeup effect stages in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused his body <b>to</b> <b>melt.</b> Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation.|$|E

5|$|Annual world {{production}} of yttrium oxide had reached 600tonnes by 2001; by 2014 it had increased to 7,000 tons.

Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with calcium magnesium alloy.

5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has {{the reputation of being}} a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly as much attention as Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E

Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> the steel.

40|$|We {{consider}} laminar compositional convection of buoyant melt {{released by}} ablation of a vertical solid surface into a two-component fluid.

5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented {{the process in}} the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E

Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E
5|$|Successful mining {{took time}} and capital, {{particularly}} once {{most of the}} timber around the Klondike had been cut down. A realistic mining operation required $1,500 ($1.2 million) for wood to be burned <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> the ground, along with around $1,000 ($800,000) to construct a dam, $1,500 ($1.2 million) for ditches and up to $600 ($480,000) for sluice boxes, a total of $4,600. The attraction of the Klondike to a prospector, however, was that when gold was found, it was often highly concentrated. Some of the creeks in the Klondike were fifteen times richer in gold than those in California, and richer still than those in South Africa. In just two years, for example, $230,000 ($184 million) worth of gold was brought up from claim 29 on the Eldorado Creek.|$|E

5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, <b>to</b> <b>melt,</b> shock and eject granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would {{have led to a}} sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E
