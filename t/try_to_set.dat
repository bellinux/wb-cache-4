5|$|Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{invites the}} entire office staff to {{a celebration of}} Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, which Michael Scott (Steve Carell) mistakenly {{believes}} to be an Indian version of Halloween. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) fails to make a favorable impression on Kelly's parents, who in turn <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up Kelly with a young doctor. Initially reluctant to attend the festival, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) gives in and ends up enjoying herself. Inspired by a conversation with Kelly's parents about Hindu marriage customs, Michael publicly proposes to Carol (Nancy Carell). Uncomfortable, Carol declines his offer and leaves the room. She later explains that this is only their ninth date, and drives home, leaving Michael to find a ride.|$|E

25|$|The {{game between}} Ireland and Italy was played first. At half-time, Ireland {{led by a}} single point, but they {{extended}} their lead in the second half. As time ran out, Ireland were in possession and could have kicked the ball into touch, ending the game and leaving France requiring a 30-point margin in their game; instead, they opted to seek another <b>try,</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> France a bigger target, only for Italy to regain possession and score a converted try, reducing France's target to 23 points.|$|E
25|$|Despite his troop’s {{failure to}} {{overcome}} Hodges’ small force, Humières decided to attack Walcourt itself, which had since been occupied by 600 men. The ground was not favourable to the French – although the defences {{of the town}} were antiquated, it stood on a hill partly covered by a river. Nevertheless, several attacks were pressed home, but the French suffered heavy casualties from the Allied enfilading guns. Despite the losses Humières persisted, and sent a party of Gardes Françaises to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> alight Walcourt’s gates. The attempt failed, {{and the safety of}} the garrison was assured after Brigadier-General Thomas Tollemache brought the Coldstream Guards and a German Battalion into the town around 14:00.|$|E

500|$|Nebulous is a post-apocalyptic {{science fiction}} comedy radio show written by Graham Duff and {{produced}} by Ted Dowd from Baby Cow Productions; it {{is directed by}} Nicholas Briggs. The series premiered in the United Kingdom on BBC Radio 4.

As well as being a parody of a number of famous science fiction programmes, including Doctor Who, Quatermass and Doomwatch, Nebulous is considered a cult radio programme, attracting a number of guest appearances from famous actors.|$|E

The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> you straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, you can even say it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb".

500|$|The Hartford Courant {{points to}} 1980 {{as a year}} when Adams started to gain greater {{attention}} for his achievements. A share of the New York Mets was purchased by a publishing company led by Nelson Doubleday Jr. that year, and claims that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839, which are considered flawed by modern researchers, were reported by the media. After the Doubleday reports in 1980, The New York Times {{received a letter from}} the great-grandson of Adams that the Courant said attempted [...] "to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the record straight." [...] The newspaper ran the letter in its April 13 issue, and added a 1939 piece by Roger Adams. In 1993, Thorn published research on Adams' contributions in the encyclopedia Total Baseball. The New York Times published an article on Adams on September 23, 2015.|$|E

After the release of Icewind Dale II, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the Icewind Dale series, saying that, [...] "I wasn't particularly thrilled with how my work on [...] came out..." [...] and, [...] "... managed to actually be worse than my Icewind Dale stuff." [...] In regards to Icewind Dale II he said, [...] " [...] came out better than I expected, but still, not exactly awe-inspiring." [...] Chris Avellone later said, [...] "Icewind Dale was a fun series, but it didn't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the bar for {{anything other than a}} fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls." [...] A Collector's Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. Icewind Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E
500|$|A lone [...] rider {{formed the}} day's breakaway. Daniel Sesma slipped {{ahead of the}} peloton after only [...] Given the stage's flat profile and the limited power one rider can muster on his own, he was allowed an {{advantage}} of nearly ten minutes at one point, before the chase began. When he was caught, at the [...] to go mark, the [...] team took {{to the front of}} the field to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up an attack by their leader Giovanni Visconti. Visconti never had much of an advantage, but the work done by his team did put sprinters like Mark Cavendish into more difficulty than anticipated on the short climb that preceded the finish. For the second day in a row, Cavendish had to chase back on to the main field prior to the mass sprint finale. In the sprint, world champion Thor Hushovd again led out race leader Tyler Farrar, but may have been too strong in so doing, as he briefly opened up a gap on his team leader. Cavendish lost the wheel of his leadout man Mark Renshaw, and again failed to factor into the finish. Hushovd's early leadout left Farrar to go for the finish line from [...] out, which proved too far as Juan José Haedo was able to come around the American at the last moment and just pip him at the line for the victory. Farrar, however, retained the race leadership for another day.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} in the episode, the Springfield {{residents}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the record for largest human pyramid, which fails when the pyramid collapses, causing the people to roll into a giant ball. According to director Kirkland, the scene, which the staff members refer to as the [...] "people ball", was very difficult to animate, and it [...] "almost gave [...] a migraine" [...] determining how to implement it in the episode. While {{trying to figure out how}} to animate the [...] "people ball", Kirkland spray-painted a globe with white primer and assigned layout artist Paul Wee to draw the Springfield citizens on it with black ink. Normally, the Simpsons animators each draw ten scenes per week, but because he drew the [...] "people ball", Wee was excused from these duties. Since drawing the [...] "people ball" [...] by hand would have [...] "murdered" [...] the animators, they soon decided to photograph it for each frame of the scene. The photographs were taken in Kirkland's garage and were then photocopied using a Xerox photocopier. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean stated that the technique for animating the [...] "people ball" [...] was [...] "extremely interesting", [...] although it has never been used again in the series. The [...] "master drawing" [...] of the human pyramid, which Kirkland also stated was very complicated, took animator Matthew Schofield a couple of days to draw. The drawing then became a reference for the other animators to use when animating the scene.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the coup}} was a {{political}} success for Khánh, {{it was not enough}} to stabilize his leadership in the long run. During the dispute over the HNC, Khánh had tried to frame the dispute in nationalistic terms against what he saw as overbearing US influence. In the long run, this failed, as South Vietnam and the senior officers' careers and advancement were dependent on US aid. Taylor hoped Khánh's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without US funding. The Americans were aware of Khánh's tactics and exploited it by persistently trying to scare his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding. After the December coup, Taylor felt the fear of US abandonment [...] "raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking" [...] Khánh, as many were seen as beholden above all to their desire for personal advancement. In January and February 1965, Khánh sensed he could no longer work with Taylor and the Americans, and that his support in the junta was unreliable, so he began to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up secret peace talks with the communists. Planning for discussions was only beginning, but this was unacceptable to the Americans and hardline anti-communists in the junta, as it meant the bombing campaign against North Vietnam would not be possible. When Khánh's plans were discovered, US-encouraged plotting intensified. On February 19–20, a coup occurred, and after the original plot was put down by the Young Turks, they forced Khánh into exile as well. With Khánh out of the way, the bombing campaign started.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "John Halifax, an orphan, trudges to town to make his fortune. There he is befriended first by Ursula March, {{the daughter of the}} richest man in town, who gives him food, and later by Abel Fletcher, a rich Quaker. Fletcher's invalid son takes a great fancy to John, and through his influence John is employed in his father's mill. After five years of faithful work, John has risen to the position of foreman. He and Fletcher's son, Phineas, had become fast friends. Against the wishes of his father, Phineas persuades John to take him to a theatre. The trip proves too much for the invalid, and John carries him home from the theatre in a fainting condition. Fletcher is furious with John, and drives him from the house. About this time there is a great discontent at the mill, among the workmen. Fletcher decides to close it down. After six weeks of starvation, the workmen and their families come in a crowd to the mill and demand that they be given the grain which is stored there. Rather than accede to their demands, Fletcher hurls the bags of grain into the river. This so infuriates the mob that they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> fire to the mill {{and put an end to}} Fletcher. Unable to control the mob, John helps Fletcher, his son and Ursula, to escape. Finally he wins Fletcher's consent to compromise with the men. Realizing that he owes his property and life to John, Fletcher asks his forgiveness for his former harsh treatment. John becomes Fletcher's adopted son and wins Ursula for his bride." ...|$|E
