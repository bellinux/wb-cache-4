5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> {{proposed}} negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E

Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave it a new sense of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State.

5|$|In Germany, {{there were}} major {{issues to be}} decided. Germany was still {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, {{made up of the}} zones occupied by the three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E
5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration,</b> who {{were worried about}} the lack of industrialization. The corruption that permeated the initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were unaffected by the aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in them when they observed the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year of}} its operation.|$|E
50|$|In 1953 {{at the end}} of the Korean War, <b>the</b> {{incoming}} <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>Administration</b> established <b>the</b> Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as {{an independent}} government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s, as {{intercontinental}} ballistic missiles (ICBMs) replaced bombers, {{the development of}} Soviet ICBMs prompted fears of strategic vulnerability in <b>the</b> West. <b>The</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration?s</b> decision to deploy Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs) on the territory of NATO allies sought to redress the perceived vulnerability until American ICBMs were ready. British deception planners considered how to enhance {{the threat posed by}} the IRBMs. An outline plan codenamed Celestial was intended to persuade the Soviets that the otherwise vulnerable missiles could not be readily neutralized. This article explores this deception and how such planning also sought to convey accurate information alongside disinformation. It also suggests that deception planners appear to have given little heed to the potentially counterproductive consequences of such an operation. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Smith was a consultant at the Special Projects Office (Disarmament) in the Executive Office of the President from 1955 to 1956. He also served as Chairman of the Advisory Council of the President's Committee on Fund Raising, and as a member-at-large from 1958 to 1961.

5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration,</b> little else could be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a step {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> under great public pressure to act on the deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. The proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
50|$|He later {{served as}} U.S. deputy {{postmaster}} general from 1955-1957, in <b>the</b> Dwight <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration.</b> He served as deputy director Bureau of the Budget (as OMB was known before 1970) 1957-1958, {{and director of the}} Bureau of the Budget 1958-1961, still under <b>Eisenhower.</b> He joined <b>the</b> Nixon administration as Secretary of Commerce 1969-1972.

50|$|<b>The</b> American <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>Administration</b> {{responded to}} <b>the</b> request for {{aid from the}} ROC {{according}} to its obligations in the mutual defense treaty that had been ratified in 1954.

50|$|During <b>the</b> Truman and <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administrations,</b> <b>the</b> 319th served three {{periods in}} the {{continental}} United States as a reserve organization.

5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had {{close ties to the}} United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the economists}} in <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> became {{frustrated}} with Diem's refusal to devaluate the piaster once the Republic of Vietnam {{had become a}} stable nation. Diem refused to make the CIP exchange rate equivalent to the free market exchange rate for the two currencies. Although the fixed exchange rate meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods for their money, the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market. Diem was reluctant to cut the currency rate, arguing that it would diminish the value of US aid to South Vietnam and undermine the urban middle class support for his regime as they would resent {{the loss of their}} cheap consumer and luxury goods. In 1963, the US Ambassador Frederick Nolting and his economic advisers exhorted Diem to spend more of the CIP funds on rural development in an attempt to shore up peasant support in the face of increasing communist pressure, but were rebuffed.|$|E

25|$|Nixon's {{victory is}} often {{considered}} a realigning election in American politics. From 1932 to 1964, the Democratic Party was undoubtedly the majority party, winning {{seven out of}} nine presidential elections, and their agenda influenced policies undertaken by <b>the</b> Republican <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration.</b> <b>The</b> 1968 election reversed the situation completely. From 1968 until 2004, Republicans won seven out of ten presidential elections, and its policies clearly affected those enacted by the Democratic Clinton administration via the Third Way.|$|R
5|$|Árbenz's {{enactment}} of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFORTUNE, a covert operation to overthrow Árbenz. The plan {{had originally been}} suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who {{said that if he}} were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use military tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These connections made <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government.|$|E
5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's foreign {{exchange}} reserves had declined from $42million {{at the end of}} 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 <b>the</b> <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn import licences to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption. When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.|$|E

The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people in hopes of removing Castro from power. Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.|$|R
