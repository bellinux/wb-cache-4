500|$|Issue #1 {{received}} an average score of 7.3/10 based on 26 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Greg McElhatton of CBR gave it four stars writing, [...] "Overall, Civil War II #1 {{is a good}} launching point for this miniseries, even as it integrates the information from Civil War II #0 and the Free Comic Book Day special. I'm curious to see if Bendis and Marquez can maintain this level of tension and what they'll add into the mix to keep the conflict burning strong. For now, though, it's {{more than enough to}} get readers coming back for more." [...] Schedeen gave it a 7.1 saying, [...] "This first issue cleanly establishes the conflict and delivers a nonstop stream of gorgeous artwork. However, it offers few surprises for those not already familiar with the basics of this crossover, and it often fails to elicit a strong emotional response in the way the first issue of Civil War did ten years ago." [...] Richard Gray of Newsarama gave it a 7 and said, [...] "At this early stage, Civil War II suffers {{some of the problems that}} have beleaguered similar narratives in recent years, principally in seeing heroes all too quick to take sides against comrades on a possible future. Yet this is also just the beginning of something much larger, and while it may seem at <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> is an extended version of the 'zero' issue that preceded it, all the pieces are now in place for the 'war' proper to commence." ...|$|E

But, after thinking over the matter, she changed her mind, and concluded that at <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> we should all be pleasant and good-natured towards one another; so she sat down and wrote a letter to Miss Calthea, which she sent to the expectant bride that very afternoon.

6000|$|... "We've got each other, Anne. I don't {{know what}} I'd {{do if you}} weren't here--if you'd never come. Oh, Anne, I know I've been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe--but you mustn't think I didn't love you as well as Matthew did, for all that. I {{want to tell you}} now when I can. It's never been easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> it's easier.

60|$|The back {{parts of}} the town were just now abounding with apple-gatherings. They stood in the yards in carts, baskets, and loose heaps; and the blue, {{stagnant}} air of autumn which hung over everything was heavy with a sweet cidery smell. Cakes of pomace lay against the walls in the yellow sun, where they were drying {{to be used as}} fuel. Yet it was not the great make of the year as yet; before the standard crop came in there accumulated, in abundant <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> a large superfluity of early apples, and windfalls from the trees of later harvest, which would not keep long. Thus, in the baskets, and quivering in the hopper of the mill, she saw specimens of mixed dates, including the mellow countenances of streaked-jacks, codlins, costards, stubbards, ratheripes, and other well-known friends of her ravenous youth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see how I'm {{going to}} eat breakfast," [...] said Anne rapturously. [...] "Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an {{exciting}} moment. I'd rather feast my eyes on that dress. I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable. It did {{seem to me that}} I'd never get over it if they went out before I had a dress with them. I'd never have felt quite satisfied, you see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel that I ought {{to be a very good}} girl indeed. It's at <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> I'm sorry I'm not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will be in future. But somehow it's hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|When they {{returned}} to the caravansary they found the sheik with several of the native shop-keepers engaged with him in conversation. At his orders Rupert and Ibrahim at once began to undo some of the bales and held up the goods for inspection. The sheik named the prices he required. These were at once declared by the natives to be impossible. The sheik simply ordered his assistants to fasten up the bales again. [...] "I have brought them all the way from Egypt and I am not going to give them away. It is not every one in <b>times</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> who will risk his beasts and his goods on such an adventure. The traders have all gone down the river with the white men. It may be months or years before a caravan route is open again. Who is going to bring up goods to sell when there is nothing for his camels to carry down again and when the whole country is disturbed? There is neither law nor order in the land. I shall journey on to El-Obeid or Kassala; I shall get what price I like to ask there." ...|$|E
