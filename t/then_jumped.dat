Following the disqualification, Big Daddy V attacked CM Punk.|$|E

Wee <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> over Morse while continuing to juggle the items.

5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|On {{the front}} side, on the Rokin, the rescue {{operations}} of the fire department were also hampered. There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did not know who to save first. Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage in the life net and <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell {{to the side of}} the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{encounter}} was a Six Sides of Steel Tables {{match between}} Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a {{table by the}} other. At one point during the contest, Hardy laid Raven on a table then ascended {{to the top of}} the cage. Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a front-flip towards Raven, who moved out of the way and caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a stack of four tables. Hardy <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> off the top of the cage onto Raven in a seated position, forcing him through all the tables and winning the encounter.|$|E

5|$|Owing to his keen {{interest}} in the type he followed, with interest, the exploits of Kommando Nowotny, the all jet fighter unit. Although it had low serviceability rates, its aircraft achieved considerable success. To see how new aircraft performed in action, Galland often visited the front line airfields close {{to the scene of}} the fighting. On 8 November 1944, he was present when ace Walter Nowotny took off with a force of Me 262s in an overcast to engage a USAAF raid. Galland listened to it over the radio waves. Nowotny claimed a bomber but his Me 262 was damaged. He was <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> by USAAF fighters and crashed close to the airfield. Galland heard the firing but did not see the event. It did not dissuade him from believing in the capabilities of the aircraft as a fighter.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to London in April 1795, seeking Imlay, but he rejected her; {{the next month}} she attempted to commit suicide, but he saved her life (it is unclear how). In a last attempt to win him back, she embarked upon a hazardous trip to Scandinavia from June to September 1795, with only her one-year-old daughter and a maid, in order to conduct some business for him. Wollstonecraft's journey was daunting not only because she was travelling to what some considered a nearly uncivilized region {{during a time of}} war, but also because she was travelling without a male escort. When she {{returned to}} England and realized that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide a second time. She went out on a rainy night, walked around to soak her clothes, and <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> into the River Thames, where a stranger rescued her.|$|E
5|$|Monster's Ball II {{was held}} at Bound for Glory. Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Jeff Hardy all participated in the match. James Mitchell {{accompanied}} Abyss to the ring. In a Monster's Ball match, pinfalls and submissions count anywhere. There are no disqualifications or count-outs and weapons are supplied and welcomed. It is called Monster's Ball because in the storyline each wrestler has supposedly been locked {{in a dark room}} for the preceding 24 hours without food or water. In the very beginning, Sabu started bleeding from his right eye, while Hardy had blood coming out of a cut on his arm. Midway through the bout, Rhino also started to bleed. Hardy laid Abyss on a table and then ascended {{to the top of the}} Bound for Glory set. He <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> off in a somersault and landed on Abyss. Eventually both Abyss and Hardy recovered, leading to Rhino tackling Abyss through a table with his signature Gore maneuver. Afterwards, Rhino drove Hardy's head into the mat with his signature Rhino Driver maneuver from the second ring rope and followed with a pin to win the match at 12 minutes and 20 seconds. After this match, Larry Zbyszko announced that a Ten-Man Gauntlet match would be held later in the show to determine who would face Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kaz and Scott SteinerSteiner was {{accompanied}} by Petey Williams and Rhaka Khan. At {{the beginning of the}} bout, Joe placed Kaz and Steiner in various holds and submission maneuvers. Steiner countered this by placing Joe in his signature Steiner Recliner submission maneuver, which Joe escaped by lifting him in the air on his shoulders. Kaz <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> off of a turnbuckle and dropkicked Steiner. Later, Joe dove through the second rope onto Steiner. However, Steiner countered by hitting Joe {{in the head with a}} steel pipe while the referee was distracted by Khan. Near the end of the match, Kaz tried to perform his signature Flux Capacitor maneuver on Steiner from a turnbuckle, but Steiner countered by pushing him off to the ringside area. Joe then kicked Steiner in the head and then performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver, driving Steiner neck- and back-first into the mat, at fourteen minutes and thirty seconds to win the contest and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

25|$|By 2006 China {{had become}} the world's third largest {{automotive}} vehicle manufacturer (after US and Japan) and the second largest consumer (only after the US). Automobile manufacturing has soared during the reform period. In 1975 only 139,800 automobiles were produced annually, but by 1985 production had reached 443,377, <b>then</b> <b>jumped</b> to nearly 1.1million by 1992 and increased fairly evenly each year up until 2001, when it reached 2.3million.

China has become the number-one automaker {{in the world in}} 2009. Domestic sales have kept pace with production. After respectable annual increases in the mid- and late 1990s, passenger car sales soared in the early 2000s. In 2006, a total of 7.22million automobiles were sold, including 5.18million units of passenger cars and 2.04million units of commercial vehicles.|$|E
