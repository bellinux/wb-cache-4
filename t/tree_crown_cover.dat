The maximum tree species richness (10 spp.) was observed in Rhododendron arboreum Sm. dominated mixed forest and minimum in Quercus leucotrichophora A. Camus. forest (8 spp.). Maximum tree density (170 trees/ha) and high importance value index (89. 68) was found in Q. semecarpifolia Sm. forest. Mixed Rhododendron arboreum Sm. forest showed high tree diversity (H= 0. 96), while shrub were found highest in Quercus leucotrichophora A.

However, in the tropical regions, images can be severely contaminated by clouds {{during the rainy season}} and fires during the dry season, with possible effects to seasonal features. In this study, we evaluated the performance of seasonal features based on an annual Landsat time series (LTS) of 35 images for land cover characterization in West Sudanian savanna woodlands. First, the burnt areas were detected and removed. Second, the reflectance seasonality was modelled using a harmonic model, and model parameters were used as inputs for land cover classification and <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> prediction using the random forest algorithm. Furthermore, to study the sensitivity of the approach to the burnt areas, we repeated the analyses without the first step. Our results showed that seasonal features improved classification accuracy significantly from 68. 7 % and 66. 1 % to 76. 2 %, and decreased root mean square error (RMSE) of <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> predictions from 11. 7 % and 11. 4 % to 10. 4 %, in comparison to the dry and rainy season single date images, respectively. The burnt areas biased the seasonal parameters in near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and decreased the accuracy of classification and <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> prediction, suggesting that burnt areas should be removed before fitting the harmonic model.

Carbon dioxide is one of the six greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol, contributing to global warming. Research is conducted to gain knowledge on how to maximise forest carbon storage capacity, albeit, there are some constraints and limitations to both the role of forests in CO 2 mitigation efforts and the estimation and comparison of forest carbon stocks. Forests provide multiple services which might be in conflict to a management strategy solely addressing carbon storage. The estimation and comparison of forest carbon stocks is insofar limited as for instance studies use different definitions for dead wood and different soil depth.

Assessing the VCF's performance near the northern limits of the boreal forest can help quantify {{the accuracy of the}} product within this vegetation transition area. The circumpolar region was divided into longitudinal zones and validation sites were selected in areas of varying tree cover where Quickbird imagery is available in Google Earth. Each site was linked to the corresponding VCF pixel and overlaid with a regular dot grid within the VCF pixel's boundary to estimate percent <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> in the area. Percent <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> was estimated using Quickbird imagery for 396 sites throughout the circumpolar region and related to the VCF's estimates of canopy cover for 2000 - 2005. Regression results of VCF inter-annual comparisons (2000 - 2005) and VCF-Quickbird image-interpreted estimates indicate that: (1) Pixel-level, inter-annual comparisons of VCF estimates of percent canopy cover were linearly related (mean R(sup 2) = 0. 77) and exhibited an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 10. 1 % and an average root mean square difference (RMSD) of 7. 3 %. (2) A comparison of image-interpreted percent <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> estimates based on dot counts on Quickbird color images by two different interpreters were more variable (R(sup 2) = 0. 73, RMSE = 14. 8 %, RMSD = 18. 7 %) than VCF inter-annual comparisons. (3) Across the circumpolar boreal region, 2005 VCF-Quickbird comparisons were linearly related, with an R(sup 2) = 0. 57, a RMSE = 13. 4 % and a RMSD = 21. 3 %, with a tendency to over-estimate areas of low percent tree cover and anomalous VCF results in Scandinavia. The relationship of the VCF estimates and ground reference indicate to potential users that the VCF's tree cover values for individual pixels, particularly those below 20 % tree cover, may not be precise enough to monitor 500 m pixel-level tree cover in the taiga-tundra transition zone...|$|E

Box-Cox regression based on 895 increment cores that showed current basal area and the relative size of the <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> were significant variables. Models to link basal area changes over time with <b>tree</b> height and <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> were developed to provide initial estimates of stand structure dynamics. Relative <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> characteristics, site index, and diameter at breast height (DBH) were significant variables in predicting tree height.

This article presents a digital image processing procedure for automated delineation and classification of forest and non-forest vegetation which is solely using full waveform laser scanner data as input. The delineation of regions covered by vegetation {{is based on the}} assumption that many laser reflections will be found inside of vegetation from different vegetation layers between the top of the canopy and the bare earth which particularly applies to multiple echoes from full waveform data. The vegetation regions are classified into forest and nonforest vegetation based on criteria which are generally used for vegetation mapping such as height of the vegetation, <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover,</b> size and width of vegetation objects. Non-Forest vegetation is further classified into single tree objects or connected groups of trees based on geometrical features.

The identification and extraction of information about <b>tree</b> <b>crowns</b> is one such use. <b>Tree</b> <b>crown</b> or canopy <b>cover</b> is one parameter of vegetation structural classification.

Here, our objective was to compare the various field and ALS based CC estimates across multiple land cover types in the Taita Hills, Kenya. The field data was measured from a total of 178 sample plots (0. 1 ha) in 2013 and 2014. The most accurate field measurement method, line intersect sampling using Cajanus tube, was used in 37 plots. Other methods included CC estimate based on the tree inventory data (144 plots), crown relascope (43 plots) and hemispherical photography (30 plots). Three ALS data sets, including two scanners and flying heights, were acquired concurrently with the field data collection. According to the results, the first echo cover index (FCI) from ALS data had good agreement with the most accurate field based CC estimates (RMSD 7. 1 % and 2. 7 % depending on the area and scan). The agreement with other field based methods was considerably worse. Furthermore, we observed that ALS cover indices were robust between the different scans in the overlapping area. In conclusion, our results suggest that ALS provides a reliable method for continuous CC mapping across tropical land cover types although dense shrub layer and tree-like herbaceous plants can cause overestimation of CC. * Corresponding author 1...|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} relationships between LAI and the included stand parameters depend on {{the positive or negative}} effect of these stand parameters on the LAI. Particularly, the stand basal area, site index, and stand number of trees have positive effect, while the stand age has negative effect on the LAI. This positive effect of the stand basal area and number of trees on the LAI {{can be explained by the}} increase or crowding of trees in any forest stands, because increasing basal area and number of trees result in further trees in a forest stand and so increasing <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> with further LAI values in these stands. In addition to stand parameters including the stand basal area and number of trees, the site index has a significantly positive effect on the LAI, since forest areas of high site quality with higher site index values are more favorable areas for growth of forest species, especially tree crown growth, and thus more LAI in these stands. However, the stand age showed a negative relationship with the LAI, since the number of trees decreases with increasing age due to age-related tree mortality and thus these decreases of stand number of tress result in less LAI values in forest stands. Khosravi et al. (2012) tried to determine the relations between LAI values and some stand parameters and found that there were moderate relationships (R 2 [*]=[*] 0.36 for stand mean diameter, R 2 [*]=[*] 0.36 for stand basal area, R 2 [*]=[*] 0.45 for stand mean height) when the results obtained were evaluated. Some studies showed that LAI values decreased as the stand age increased (Sonohat et al. 2004; Homolova et al. 2007; Pokorny and Stojnic 2012). Bequet et al. (2012) also showed that the stand age was an important parameter in estimating stand LAI.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the annual}} land cover {{products}} to be made from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data is the vegetation continuous fields layers. Of these fields, one is a global percent tree cover map. Using field measurements, IKONOS data, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data, and ancillary map sources, a tree cover map was made and validated for two WRS path/rows in Western Province, Zambia. This map {{will be used in}} validating the 500 -m global MODIS tree cover product. The map was made at the 30 -m Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) resolution and also scaled up to 250 - and 500 -m resolutions. Five IKONOS images were classified into crown cover/no crown cover maps at 4 -m resolution. These maps were aggregated to 30 m to create a continuous training data set of percent crown cover. Three dates of ETM+ data were acquired to predict percent crown cover using a regression tree algorithm. Comparisons of training accuracies and field data to ETM+ tree estimates yielded root mean square errors (rmse) of fF 10 % crown cover. When aggregating the 30 -m map to 250 - and 500 -m MODIS cell sizes, the training errors are more than halved. The final 250 -m map was assessed using a structural vegetation map of the area and an overall rmse of 8. 5 % is estimated. The 250 -m map was sampled and used to derive a tree cover continuous field product using 3 Level 1 B MODIS time slices, approximating the acquisitions of the ETM+ data. The results are promising as an overall root mean square error between the ETM+ derived <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> map and an aggregated MODIS 500 -m map was 5. 2 %.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the capability of}} SPOT 5 HRG and IRS-P 6 LISS-III in separating the pollarding areas of northern Zagros forests and preparing the map of this area, some parts of pollarded forests located at Baneh city were selected. The pollarding areas (Shan, Kurpe, Khert and Koor) were determined as ground truth in a 3 year alternation period using a global positioning system (GPS). Assessing the radiometric quality, no radiometric error was observed in these data. SPOT 5 data which had been already geometrically corrected was used as basis for geometric correction of IRS-P 6 color image and IRS- 1 C panchromatic image. Nonparametric method was used to do geometric correction with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0. 54 and 0. 75 pixels for these tow images, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) and various spectral rationing methods were used to prepare artificial bands used in data analysis. Likewise, for more image enhancement, HRG and LISS-III multi-spectral bands were fused with IRS- 1 C pan image. The data was classified using a maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. This classification was applied using 4 and 6 classes for the studying area and a classification with 3 classes was used for each northern and southern aspects. The separability of classes was studied using Bhuttacharrya Distance Criteria. Result showed that separability of different classes of northern aspect was better than southern aspect. Likewise, northern Khert and agriculture classes were completely separated from other classes. The vegetation indices showed lower results compare to the original bands. Fused bands of SPOT 5 images showed the highest overall accuracy is equal to 65. 3 % and the highest Kappa coefficient is equal to 0. 63. The highest overall accuracy (70 %) and Kappa coefficient (0. 60) was obtained using the first component analysis resulted from PCA in combination to bands 1 and 4 IRS-P 6 data. According {{to the results of}} classifying of these two images, the data obtained before pollarding and during of vegetation growth season, showed better results. Regardless of spectral interference between soil and <b>trees</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover,</b> the results showed the high capability of above mentioned images to separate the pollarding areas and to prepare the map of the area...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{attributes}} and floristic composition of vegetation communities {{was investigated in}} the Kpashimi Forest Reserve, Niger State, Nigeria. The aim {{of the study was}} to describe the floristic composition and structure of the plant communities found in the study area. Biometric field inventory method; involving morphometric measurements, enumeration and application of allometric equations was employed for data collection. Vegetation variables including tree density, species diversity, tree girth, basal area, <b>tree</b> height, <b>crown</b> <b>cover,</b> shrub cover, and grass cover were measured within forty-eight sampling plots of 0. 4096 hectares; distributed over the six vegetation physiographic units found in the area including riparian forest, savannah woodland, degraded forest, scrubland, grassland, and bare surface. For data analysis, the mean and coefficient of variation were determined from the data collected for each of the six vegetation physiographic units. The result showed that the Riparian forest is characterised by mean values of girth (1. 16 metre), basal area (26. 9 m 2 ha- 1) tree height (26. 6 metre) and <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> (68 %). Savannah woodland recorded density of tree stand (0. 0129 / m 2) and diversity (13. 75 Simpson’s diversity index), while Grassland and Bare surface classes are characterised by mean values of grass cover (89. 9 % and 51. 1 % respectively). Scrubland is characterised by mean value of shrub cover (64. 8 %); but with comparatively low trunk diameter, <b>crown</b> <b>cover,</b> <b>tree</b> height and tree density. The study area is thus characterised by a mixture of plant communities that vary in composition, diversity, heterogeneity, structure and complexity. This study presents acquired baseline information on the landscape vegetation structure and composition which could be useful for characterizing a typical savannah vegetation structure and composition.

40|$|Land use changes {{associated}} with {{agriculture and forestry}} are a significant component in Australia’s carbon budget. In response {{to the need to}} quantify the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, the capability for continental monitoring of land cover changes using Landsat data has been developed through collaboration between the Australian Department of Climate Change (DCC), the CSIRO, and other partners. The project, called the National Carbon Accounting System- Land Cover Change Project (NCAS-LCCP) uses some 5000 Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+ images to monitor land cover attributes including the presence/absence of perennial vegetation, plantation types and urban extent, at 25 m resolution for fifteen time periods since 1972. The derived information is used to inform carbon accounting, environmental reporting and management. The original demands for the spatial and temporal resolution used arose from the development of the reporting rules (Marrakech Accord) guiding the implementation of accounting procedures for the Kyoto Protocol. However the remote sensing program evolved to more broadly cover interests in monitoring land use change generally. To meet Australia’s current definition of forest, a land cover must have 20 % <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> and the potential to reach greater than 2 m in height. However, there are large areas of Australia where vegetation communities do not meet this canopy density threshold, such as the drier rangeland regions or within agricultural regions. Increasingly there is a requirement to map and monitor current and historical changes in such areas, at regional and national scales, to provide information for conservation and natural resource management questions. Landsat Thematic Mapper data from 1989 to the present is being used. Sparse perennial vegetation cannot be reliably discriminated from other ground cover types based solely on the spectral information in this data; however b...|$|E
40|$|The {{tropical}} rainforests {{in southeast}} Asia are classified into several types by Peter Ashton (1991). Their species composition {{is not yet}} clarified {{because of the high}} species richness. In this report several types of tropical rain forest were recorded based on phytosociology: 1. dipterocarp forests on mesic sites; 2. swamp forests on wet sites; 3. heath forests (kerangas) on dry sites; 4. secondary Macaranga forests. Very tall, developed tropical forests are now very few around Kuching and Bintulu. They were surveyed only in Similajau National Park and the experimental forest in Universiti Pertanian Malaysia (UPM), Bintulu Campus. These well developed tropical rainforests are Dryobalanops aromatica (kapur) and Cotylelobium burckii forest. When the tropical rainforests have an emergent tree layer, the cover values {{are similar to those of}} the tree crowns of the tree- 1 layer. Forests without an emergent tree layer have about the same <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> as the tree- 1 and tree- 2 layer. This is because of the selective cutting of big trees before. The various Macaranga secondary forests have similar species composition, number of layers and community height. The forest composition and site conditions are related to the growth of the seedlings to be planted in abandoned shifting-cultivated fields. The growth of these tropical forest species was compared with the growth of species in experimental plantation since 1990 at the abandoned shifting-cultivation area on the UPM campus. Seedlings of kerangas canopy species grow very well (1. 5 - 2 m/year) on the abandoned shifting-cultivation fields. The growth of kerangas species is better that of mesic and swamp species. Tropical species grow two times faster than warm-tempera especies in Japan which were planted as seedlings of native canopy species, in dense plantations (1 - 3 individuals/㎡).

40|$|This thesis applies object-based image {{analysis}} (OBIA) to mapping spectrally variable land cover from moderate to high resolution satellite imagery. The study was undertaken over a 2600 ha area within tropical northern Australia. The region {{is dominated by}} typical savanna vegetation characterised by continuous grass cover and discontinuous woody overstorey. The first objective examines the advantages of OBIA over per-pixel methods for mapping land cover. A comparison found object-based {{image analysis}} to be statistically superior (z= 2. 285 (p= 0. 01), McNemar’s χ 2 = 8. 966 (p= 0. 0028)). The second objective developed a rule-set for land cover classification of QuickBird data. For {{a subset of the}} study area the overall accuracy was 94 % and K^ = 0. 92. Applied to the entire area, accuracies were lower with error associated with burnt vegetation. The third objective investigated mapping vegetation structural attributes using OBIA. A tree crown extraction process was developed for QuickBird data. Accuracies over 75 % were obtained, despite savanna Eucalypts exhibiting canopy characteristics hindering delineation. The fourth objective compared canopy cover estimates from extracted tree crowns to pixel-based and manually derived methods. <b>Tree</b> <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> shows relationships (p= 0. 001) with vegetation indices from QuickBird (r 2 = 0. 93) and ASTER (r 2 = 0. 22) imagery, and manually interpreted estimates from aerial photographs (r 2 = 0. 43). The final objective implemented area-based measures quantifying the spatial and thematic accuracy of OBIA. Results show these measures provide valuable thematic and geometric accuracy information provided appropriate reference data are available. This study has demonstrated OBIA is suitable for mapping land cover in spectrally variable landscapes at multiple scales. More specifically, OBIA has better accuracy over per-pixel methods, transferrable rule sets can be used to map land cover from high spatial resolution data, and OBIA methods can extract dominant vegetation structures. Finally, limitations of site-specific accuracy assessments can be addressed through area-based accuracy measures...|$|E

40|$|The {{count of}} litter {{macrofauna}} {{was carried out}} in 339 natural deciduous forest sites in Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, Nikolaev andDonetskregions ofUkrainein 2001 – 2014. It was shown that <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> density did not significantly influence the abundance of litter macrofauna and the abundance of litter invertebrates. The Shannon and Pielou diversity indexes have a tendency to raise the gradient of <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> density (from 50 % to 90 – 100 %). The relative abundance of saprophages and zoophages reached its minimum (median was 18 % and 3 %, respectively) in forest sites with sparse <b>crown</b> <b>cover,</b> and, at the level of tendency, was higher in dense forests with a closed crown (median was 40 % and 18 %, respectively). The relative abundance of polyphages, on the contrary, was lower in these conditions (82 % in sparse and 27 % in closed <b>crown</b> <b>cover).</b> The number of species in each trophic group did not significantly change in relation to <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> density. At sites with 70 – 79 % <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> density the size structure of the litter macrofauna was close to its optimal condition. The relative abundance of ants reached its maximum (median 73 %) in sparsely timbered sites (up to 50 % <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> density), the relative share of Isopoda reached its maximum (median 40 %) at sites with average crown density (50 – 59 %). At densely wooded sites the taxonomic structure at the level of order and family was more or less level, without clearly dominant groups, each order and family occupying about 15 % {{of the total number of}} macrofauna. The relative abundance of the majority of orders and families did not significantly vary in response to different levels of <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> density. The influence of herbaceous layer cover on macrofauna was in general less than that of <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> density. The abundance of litter macrofauna in deciduous forests reached its maximum at sites with the two extreme variants of herbaceous layer cover: sparse herbaceous cover (up to 15 %) and dense herbaceous cover (over 90 %). The minimal abundance of litter macrofauna was observed at sites with average herbaceous layer density (45 – 59 %). The number of species and the Shannon and Pielou diversity indexes did not vary significantly in relation to changes in herbaceous layer density in deciduous forests of the steppe zone of Ukraine. The number of phtyophage species was higher at sites with average values for herbaceous layer density, while the number of saprophage, zoophage and polyphage species did not significantly change. The dominance structure of litter macrofauna was maximally transformed at sites with the extreme variants of herbaceous layer cover: sparse herbaceous cover (up to 15 %) and dense herbaceous cover (over 90 %). The median number of ground beetle species reached its maximum at sites with 15 – 29 % herbaceous layer cover. The median of the relative abundance of ground beetles did not significantly change relative to the extent of herbaceous layer cover. The median of the relative abundance of Formicidae reached its maximum at sites with 60 – 74 % herbaceous layer cover and for Isopoda this maximum was reached at sites with 15 – 59 % herbaceous layer cover...|$|R
