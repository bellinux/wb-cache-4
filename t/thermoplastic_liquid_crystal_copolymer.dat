40|$|A {{range of}} side chain <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>copolymers</b> have been {{prepared}} using mesogenic and non-mesogenic units. It is found that high levels of the non-mesogenic moieties may be introduced without completely disrupting {{the organization of the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> phase. Incorporation of this comonomer causes a marked reduction in the glass transition temperature (Tg), presumably as a result of enhanced backbone mobility and a corresponding lowering of the nematic transition temperature, thereby restricting the temperature range for stability of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> phase. The effect of the interactions between the various components of these side-chain polymers on their electro-optic responses is described. Infrared (i. r.) dichroism measurements have been made to determine the order parameters of the liquid crystalline side-chain polymers. By identifying a certain band (CN stretching) in the i. r. absorption spectrum, the order parameter of the mesogenic groups can be obtained. The temperature and composition dependence of the observed order parameter are related to the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> phase transitions and to the electro-optic response. It is found that the introduction of the non-mesogenic units into the polymer chain lowers the threshold voltage of the electro-optic response over and above that due to the reduction in the order parameter. The dynamic electro-optic responses are dominated by the temperature-dependent viscosity and evidence is presented for relaxation processes involving the polymer backbone which are on a time scale greater than that for the mesogenic side-chain units...|$|R

Injection molded articles of rigid chain <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>copolymers</b> (LCP's) are gaining increasing commercial importance because their dimensional stability, high stiffness and strength per unit weight, make them highly attractive for aerospace structures and automotive parts, where the anisotropic nature of the materials can be exploited to achieve novel design strategies. Considerable technological importance is given to thermotropic LCP's because of their melt phase behavior and ease of processing. Because of their comparatively low viscosity, they can be injection molded with short cycle times into thin and complex shapes. In the present work, broad range of material properties, including specific heat, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and shear viscosity of a commercial LCP injection molding resin have been determined experimentally. In addition, a detailed experimental study has been made of the crystallization kinetics of this LCP resin. The study showed that the resin undergoes two crystallization mechanisms, a fast and a slow mechanism, depending on the temperature and the cooling rates. Various experimental techniques, to characterize the microstructure of the molded parts, including morphology, orientation, crystallinity and mechanical properties, have been developed and used.

The polymer electrolyte exhibits a phase separated morphology {{consisting of}} a columnar hexagonal <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> phase and PEO-rich regions. The polymer electrolyte forms self-supporting, solid-like films. The ionic conductivity on initial heating of the sample is very low below ca. 60 °C but increases rapidly above this temperature. This is attributed to the melting of crystalline PEO-rich regions. Crystallisation is suppressed on cooling, and subsequent heating cycles exhibit higher conductivities but still less than those measured for the corresponding lithium perchlorate complex in poly(ethylene glycol) (MW= 2000 gmol− 1). Instead the triblock copolymer mimics the behaviour of high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (MW= 300, 000 gmol− 1). This is attributed, in part, to the anchoring of the short PEG chains to the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> block which prevents their diffusion through the sample.

Smectic ordering is observed as well as microphase separation of the block copolymer. Lamellar structures were observed for far larger volume fractions than for coil-coil copolymers (up to a volume fraction of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> block, f(LC) = 0. 8).

40|$|Side chain <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> polyurethanes are <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> {{elastomers}} {{with the}} potential to couple mechanical stress fields with optical changes brought on by <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> alignment. These materials excite interest because they are the first <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> elastomers (LCTPEs) that utilize the physics of microphase segregation rather than chemical crosslinking to achieve elastomeric properties: LCTPEs offer the potential to use traditional plastic processing technologies to effect the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> monodomain ordering required for mechanooptic applications. This thesis describes the design. synthesis and characterization of two series of side chain <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> po I yurethanes. The first series of polyurethanes are made with traditional hard segments and cyano-biphenyl mesogens pendant on the soft segment. The synthesis of the soft segment macrodiol. a carbinol endcapped hydromethylsiloxane oligomer that can be functionalized with mesogen via a hydrosilylation technique, is effected by a polycondensation approach. These side chain liquid crystalline (LC) siloxane macromonomers are then converted to segmented polyurethanes using traditional urethane chemistry. Structural analysis and characterization of the resulting polymers is provided. along with a comparison study of the thermal and optical behavior of these urethanes as the spacer length is increased from 3 to 8 methylene units. Discussions {{of the effects of the}} hard segment mobility on the phase behavior of these LC polyurethanes is offered. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) dichroism experiments performed on the cyano-biphenyl polyurethanes provide an opportunity to study the interplay between polyurethane morphology and <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> ordering as the material is exposed to mechanical deformation. This complex material follows the trend established in the literature for both side chain <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> siloxane homopolymers and segmented polyurethanes. At low strains. the soft segments align with the strain inducing an orientation in the "lone" horn segments. Up to strains of 40 %, the LC mesogens align with the strain field and the hard segments in hydrogen bonded domains align perpendicular to the field. At strains above 40 %, a rearrangement of the ordering that results in symmetric layers and hard segments aligning parallel to the field is found. A model is proposed to represent these findings. and reflections on the cooperative movement of the different macromolecular components of the polyurethane are offered. Phase modulated dynamic Ff-IR experiments are performed to study the response of these materials to sinusoidal mechanical perturbations in an attempt to further understand the response of the polyurethanes to mechanical fields. In dynamic Ff-IR. the viscoelastic reorientation of various segments of the macromolecule can be monitored as a function of applied strain. Evidence is presented for the two types of hard segments: those involved in hydrogen bonding within hard domains, and those found in "lone" hard segments in the soft matrix. Evidence is also presented for two types of mesogens: those found in smectic layers. and those not involved in smectic ordering postulated to be located at the hard domain interface. The hard domains and the smectic layers have strong viscous components to their mechanical response. The "free" mesogens and the "lone" hard segments, on the other hand, exhibit a more elastic response. Once again. evidence for the mechanical coupling of the hard segments and the LC mesogens is of~·ered. In an attempt to improve the mechanical properties of the LC segmented polyurethanes. and to explore piezoelectric and electro-mechanical behaviors. new LC segmented polyurethanes are designed with higher overall molecular weight. longer soft segments. higher degrees of microphase segregation. and smectic C* mesogens. Vinylmethylsiloxane macrodiols are anionically synthesized using a diifunctional intitiator. and then polymerized to form segmented polyurethanes by condensation reactions with diisocyanates and chain extenders. The degree of functionalization of the soft segment. and the length of the hard segment are varied in attempts to decrease the degree of mechanical coupling between the hard segment and the mesogens. It is found that polyurethanes with 50 % functionalized soft segments provide phase segregated morphologies. form cohesive polyurethane films. and show decoupling in the thermal phase behavior of the LC soft segment and the hard segment. The study of side chain <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> polyurethanes described in this thesis provides a fundamental understanding of the properties of this new class of materials. The interdependance of the hard segment and the mesogen on the thermal and mechanical responses of these materials is a key finding. The development of LC polyurethanes in which this cooperative interaction is muted leads to materials with great potential for mechano-optic applications. The findings reported here should be helpful in testing the piezoelectric and mechano-responsive behaviors of these promising materials. by Bindu R. Nair. Thesis (Ph. D.)

We show {{for the first time}} how these materials could potentially be used as a novel kind of surface stabilized <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> display device. Magnetic field induced structures in a thermotropic main chain <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> homopolymer were also examined. Defects in orienting fields are of interest because <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> displays must be defect free over large areas. A study of the interaction of defects in an applied field yields information towards optimally processing these materials in order to minimize or completely eliminate these defects. The basic building block of the systems investigated is a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> mesogen. <b>Liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> mesogens are easily oriented by electric, magnetic, and flow fields and interact with polarized light such that they are desirable materials for display devices. Additionally, these systems are all polymeric, lending the complexity of the molecules' long-chain nature to the material properties, and the resulting processing challenges and mechanical advantages inherent to polymers. Polarized light microscopy (PLM), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) are the tools employed. Two-dimensional Ndel inversion walls formed in a nematic monodomain during magnetic realignment of a highly elastically anisotropic thermotropic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> polyether are examined via PLM and AFM. (cont.) he elastic anisotropy is defined as [epsilon] [approximately equal to] (kll 1 - k 33) /(kll + k 33), where kll is the Frank elastic constant for splay distortions and k 33 is the Frank elastic constant for bend distortions. For this polymer, [epsilon] [approximately equal to] + 0. 5; kll - 3 k 33. Following PLM examination, the detailed director patterns of these walls are imaged at high-resolution by AFM through a lamellar decoration technique, employed after walls have been fixed by quenching while under field. Walls form as closed loops comprised of a continuous inversion wall with antiparallel director alignment of the interior region with respect to that of the exterior. The energy of N 6 el walls is theoretically evaluated as a function of elastic anisotropy. In our experimental system, the energy of a splay wall is 17 % higher than that of a bend wall. The variation of the characteristic width of walls in this polyether as measured by AFM yields an effective elastic constant of 1. 6 x 10 - 6 dynes at 160 â°C. Inversion wall dynamics may be followed through time-under-field experiments. Loops coalesce, shrink, and smooth their curvature, occasionally splitting into a partial loop terminated by two opposite strength 1 / 2 disclinations. The observed more rapid shrinkage of splay distortion-rich wall segments as compared to that of bend-rich wall segments corresponds to the expected wall energetics based on the elastic anisotropy of the polymer.

In this sense, monofunctional POSS are not different from different types of rubbers, <b>thermoplastics,</b> or <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> used to modify polymer networks. Although some authors have noticed the occurrence of PIPS in particular systems, a comparative study of the effect of the chemical structure of POSS and its prereaction with one of the monomers on the morphologies generated has not been previously reported. Glycidyloxypropylheptaisobutyl POSS (iBu-GlyPOSS) and glycidyloxypropyl-heptaphenyl POSS (Ph-GlyPOSS) were used to modify an epoxy network based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and 4, 4 '-methylenebis(2, 6 -diethylaniline) (MDEA). POSS was introduced in the formulation either nonreacted or prereacted with MDEA (molar ratio POSS/MDEA: 1 / 10). While both nonreacted and prereacted iBu-GlyPOSS were soluble in the epoxy-amine precursors at the polymerization temperature (135 °C), only prereacted Ph-GlyPOSS could be dissolved in epoxy-amine precursors. For every case a polymerization-induced phase separation took place. For the nonreacted iBu-GlyPOSS this process led to a dispersion of spherical particles with sizes in the range of the micrometers that crystallized upon cooling. Both prereacted POSS led to different types of amorphous biphasic structures. Therefore, the nature of the organic inert group and the prereaction of a monofunctional POSS can be used to control the morphologies generated in the POSS-modified polymer network...|$|R

This thesis focuses {{on the effects of}} copolymer architecture, concentration fields, and external shear flow fields on the self-assembly of block copolymers. ^ Theories of the morphology transition of diblock copolymers at equilibrium have been studied for more than two decades. However, relatively little work has been done on more complicated architectures. The first part of this thesis uses a combination of the density functional theory (DFT) and the theory of composition fluctuations to examine the morphology transition in block copolymers of topologically distinct architectures. The morphology diagrams and corresponding properties are calculated for A-B-A triblock copolymer with given architectural parameters. ^ The second part of this thesis focuses on the phase behavior of polymer blends consisting of amphiphilic block copolymers and selective homopolymer solvents. Phase diagrams are calculated for binary and ternary systems and the formation of induced morphologies due to the change of concentration fields are studied. The effects of architecture and sizes of constituent blocks of copolymers and the sizes of homopolymers are investigated by comparing various systems. Also, the critical Lifshitz point is examined and discussed. ^ The third part of the thesis focuses on the order-disorder transition (ODT) and order-order transition (OOT) of block copolymers induced by an external shear flow field. The presence of shear alters the microscopic evolution of fluctuations and leads to a suppression of the fluctuation field. Consequently, the effective potential caused by excitations of monomer densities is reduced, resulting in an apparent increase of the ODT temperature. The self-consistent equation of the fluctuation spectrum is solved numerically, and the transition curve with respect to the applied shear rate is computed. This result resolves the recent controversy between experimental data and the previous perturbation analysis and shows good agreement with experimental results. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{new kind}} of {{electrically}} controlled <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> lens, which respond in a relatively fast time, is presented. The multiwalled carbon nanotubes are doped into <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> to fabricate the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> lens. As 0. 02  % concentration of multiwalled carbon nanotubes is uniformly distributed in the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal,</b> the optical features of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> lens are obviously improved. The <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> lens with a diameter of 2. 0  mm was fabricated with about 0. 2  s response time and less than 5  Vrms applied voltage. The focal length can vary from 16 to 510  mm, and the operation voltage changes from 1. 0 to 5. 5  Vrms. This <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> lens has the very attractive feature of submillisecond response time, which is a much faster response time in comparison with conventional <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> lens. Thus, this kind of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> lens has high potential for implementation in many practical imaging applications and imaging commercialisation. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

The <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> bio-transducer is produced by manual scraping of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> onto the petri dish, in which the technique is highly subjective to the skill of the user to produce homogeneously spread <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> substrates. This paper describes {{the development of an}} apparatus used to produce a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> substrate using squeegee coating technique. It consists of a biaxial mechatronic system which is synchronously controlled in vertical and horizontal directions scraping the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> substrates evenly on the surface of a petri dish. The thickness of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> was profiled using laser diffraction technique and the homogeneity of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> films produced was examined in a crossed-polarizing microscope. At an angular speed of 1500 rpm and under a shear stress of 1. 46 ± 0. 72 kPa, the squeegee coating was found producing <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> films at a thickness of 132 ± 23 μm on the surface of petri dishes. With the application of this apparatus, evenly spread <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> coatings with control thickness in petri dishes were consistently produced.
