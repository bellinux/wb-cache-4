5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, <b>they</b> <b>added</b> the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E

It was later {{taken over by the}} Tippecanoe County Historical Association, which now maintains the battleground and the seminary building, housing a museum about the battle. <b>They</b> <b>added</b> an amphitheater to the memorial in 1986. In 1989–90, the amphitheater was used for performances of The Battle of Tippecanoe Outdoor Drama.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got bolder in the sense that <b>they</b> <b>added</b> new scenes not included in the book to round out the source material.|$|E

5|$|After the Revolution {{the senior}} {{branch of the}} Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated {{in the first half}} of the 19th century.

5|$|As is {{the case}} with many fortresses, Golubac's {{structure}} was modified over time. For years, there were only five towers. Later, four more were added. The towers were all built as squares, a sign of the fortress' age, showing that battles were still fought with cold steel. Once firearms came into use, the Turks fortified the western towers with cannon ports and polygonal or cylindrical reinforcements up to two metres thick. After the Hungarian raid in 1481, <b>they</b> <b>added</b> the final tower, complete with cannon embrasures and galleries.|$|E

Founder Yves Potvin stayed on with the company, and has stated that the buy-out assisted Gardein to access more capital and expand manufacturing facilities to Hagerstown. All Gardein products are vegan, and they are certified by Vegan Action. Most of Gardein's products are certified Kosher pareve by Kosher Check (The Orthodox Rabbinical Council of BC).

5|$|Having {{failed to}} make the playoffs the season before, and with their {{division}} rivals (the Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros) expected to be strong, the Cardinals were generally expected to finish 3rd in the National League Central. However, strong offensive seasons from Albert Pujols, Scott Rolen, and Jim Edmonds—during which they each hit more than 30home runs and 100runs batted in (RBI)—helped them to lead the league in runs scored. They also allowed the least runs of any team in the league. Four of their starters recorded at least 15 wins and closer Jason Isringhausen recorded a league-best47 saves. <b>They</b> <b>added</b> outfielder Larry Walker in August and finished the regular season with the best win–loss record in the league.|$|E

5|$|In 1861, Loring joined Fletcher in L. Fletcher & Co., {{a general}} store specializing in {{supplies}} for lumbermen on Nicollet Avenue across from Minneapolis City Hall where they prospered for fifteen years. They joined with W. F. Cahill {{to convert the}} municipal waterworks building into a flour mill run on hydropower, the smallest in the Mississippi west bank milling district. With George Hineline <b>they</b> <b>added</b> three limestone stories and operated it as the W. F. Cahill & Co. Holly mill. During this period, Loring served in the city government, first as road supervisor and in 1872 as a Minneapolis City Council member from the Fifth Ward in the Near North community.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Wise, the {{congregation}} implemented many reforms in its services. In 1861 they adopted Wise's Minhag America prayer book. In that same decade <b>they</b> <b>added</b> an organ, {{did away with}} the prayer shawl, and started a religious school. In the 1870s {{the congregation}} removed yahrzeit candles from the sanctuary, and added family pews and a mixed choir (men and women together). In 1873 B'nai Yeshurun {{was one of the}} first thirteen founding members of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), now Union for Reform Judaism.|$|E
5|$|The house {{expanded}} in several phases. In 1861, before the Del Valle family moved here permanently, <b>they</b> <b>added</b> three additional rooms {{as well as}} a free-standing cocina (kitchen). This was to keep fire away from the main building, as well as to keep it cooler. A basement was dug out as the foundation of the new rooms. In the 1870s, another wing was added perpendicular to the 1861 addition. Finally, some time after 1895, one more room was added to the new wing, {{as well as a}} breezeway to the kitchen, completing the current shape. Remodeling completed after this time was to the interior only.|$|E

Thus, below pH 5.5, phosphates add a single negative charge; near pH 6.5, <b>they</b> <b>add</b> 1.5 negative charges; above pH 7.5, <b>they</b> <b>add</b> 2 negative charges.

5|$|The {{legislature}} heeded some of Clark's message. <b>They</b> <b>added</b> {{a second}} auditor {{in the office}} of the state auditor, and gave greater discretion to the state's sinking fund commission. They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent. They also created county school commissioners in every county. In response to his remarks on slave property, the legislature enacted laws that raised the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for stagecoach owners to allow fugitive slaves to use their coaches to escape.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. <b>They</b> <b>added</b> a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which critics would remark.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, <b>they</b> <b>added</b> the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
