5|$|The second area {{is located}} on the south of the former {{artificial}} lake of Segaran. Even though this area was not the focal point of Taman Sari, it is the best preserved area in the complex and is currently the most popular tourist attraction. The area is accessed via two gates on <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> west side, each of these gates leads {{to the center of the}} complex, first to an inner octagonal-shaped courtyard on <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> west, and then each of these courtyards leads to a central bathing complex in the center.|$|E

5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Massachusetts {{had been}} cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old-growth forest in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts. The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area in <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Springfield metropolitan area in the west, although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently 219 endangered species in Massachusetts.|$|E

As of 2005, about 158,000people, 5percent of Oregon's population, lived in the basin.|$|E
5|$|Further {{extensions}} to both <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> west {{followed in}} later years {{after several years of}} false starts under the administrations of two different governors. Expansion of the highway was finally approved in 1998. The extension to the west, linking the Creek Turnpike to the Turner Turnpike in Sapulpa, opened December 15, 2000. The extension to the east opened in three parts over the course of 2001 and 2002.|$|E
5|$|Growth {{was much}} slower in <b>the</b> <b>east,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> modest {{extensions}} {{on this side}} were separated from the much larger extensions in the west by the marshy open area of Moorfields adjacent to the wall {{on the north side}} which discouraged development in that direction.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests of <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dry {{regions of the}} west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, {{and a lack of}} regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E

The River Tamar forms the county boundary between Devon and Cornwall and its estuary forms the Hamoaze on which is sited Devonport Dockyard.|$|E
