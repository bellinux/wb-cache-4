40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the diffusion of helium {{in the wake of}} a circular cylinder was conducted in the GALCIT hypersonic wind tunnel at a Mach number of 5. 8. The cylinder was constructed of material having random porosity and was mounted with its axis perpendicular to the stream. The light gas was injected in small amounts and the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>method</b> was utilized to detect the concentration of helium in the air at points downstream. Problems in the utilization of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>method</b> for low sample densities were overcome by suitable calibration. Flow in the wake of the cylinder was found to display characteristically similar behavior at a few diameters downstream, with respect to decay and spread of the concentration. Reynolds number similarity was established in the laminar case, but turbulent Reynolds number similarity may require reference to momentum thickness, which was not possible with the present data. Profile data was somewhat marred by a tunnel pressure perturbation, but many of the important conclusions were not affected. The profiles appear to follow the theoretical Gaussian distribution in the similar region. The <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>method</b> is quite promising as a means of tracing the diffusion of one binary gas constituent in another, as applied to hyper sonic wind tunnel experiment. It will also serve in the analysis of transition and turbulence, and of the lateral spreading of the turbulent fluid into the rest of the wake region behind the bow shock...|$|E

By modeling the experimental design with ASTM standards and taking care to reduce heat loss terms, a design was built that was able to accurately measure two reference materials (Pyrex and Stainless) to within 1 % of their reference values. After verifying the experimental design, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of the CNT RET polymer was determined and compared with 3 -[omega] results. Both data sets from different <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>methods</b> yield an increase in <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> {{with an increase in}} volume percent CNT.

Effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>method</b> is commonly used to simplify different thermal conductivity properties of pack bed materials. The effective thermal conductivity is evaluated by considering combination of thermal conductivities for a quiescent bed with the correction of turbulence created due to mixing. This method is used for both homogeneous and heterogeneous bed models (as separate properties for solid and gas phases). In some models, radiation effect is also lumped into the effective thermal conductivity (Jurena 2012; Sirinivasan 2011), while others were used separate radiation models (Yang et al. 2005 a).

40|$|Abstract. Transient <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>methods</b> {{have benefited}} from the rapid nature of the testing, {{but at the same time}} these methods are {{destructive}} because a sample must be prepared. Laser flash diffusivity is an example of a well-established transient <b>method</b> of measuring <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity,</b> which requires samples to be prepared to a diameter of 12. 4 mm. The newly introduced modified hot wire (MHW) and transient plane source (TPS) techniques are transient as well, but are nondestructive in nature. This is possible because both of these new techniques are reflectance methods that operate by applying and measuring heat at the same surface. Essentially any flat surface can be measured, with no maximum size constraints. These transient techniques have been used to evaluate materials of differing size, structure, and homogeneity. While results compare well for homogeneous materials from foams to ceramic, composite materials differ considerably. This is because the two methods penetrate the samples to different degrees, and the results are a reflection of the testing depth. As test times are varied in the reflectance techniques, information was gathered that has been related to the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> as a function of position normal to the sample. Techniques are discussed and results on homogeneous materials from two different transient techniques are compared...|$|R

Two variants of such measurement are considered, the first of which is the measurement of ITR between two bonded layers of different materials which had been studied before by various researchers. The second tested measurement method is targeted at determination of ITR in particulate composites with low and moderate filler content based on their effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity.</b> <b>Method</b> of such measurement is proposed and tested on two cases of particle-filled polymer composites. Positive verification results were obtained for polymer/glass composite in which the difference between thermal conductivities of matrix and filler is low. For a polymer filled with aluminum particles the evaluation of average ITR in the samples was impossible as the effective medium models applied in the method strongly underestimated the thermal conductivity of that material. The investigation confirmed the need for more accurate methods of macroscopic thermal properties prediction for composite media with high contrast of thermal conductivities of the constituents. Extended literature study suggests that the method can be applicable to selected classes of engineering materials. Comment: 28 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables, submitted to Thermochimica act...|$|E

The governing equations are discretised using a control volume approach on a staggered mesh and a pressure correction method is employed for the pressure–velocity coupling. The solid regions are considered as fluid regions with infinite viscosity and the thermal coupling between the solid and fluid regions is taken into account by the harmonic <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>method.</b> Parametric studies are performed by varying the heat generation based Grashof number in the range $ 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 7 $ and the fan velocity based Reynolds number in the range 0 – 1500, with air as the working medium.

40|$|The two-tank {{molten salt}} {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) system in CSP plants is limited by cost, environmental, and {{operational}} issues. The literature on TES systems suggests a few promising alternatives, but several key questions remain unanswered. Thus, the present work aims to investigate what is the ‘best’ way forward for high temperature TES materials and systems? Attempting to answer this, however, opens up several other important questions: How can complicated underlying physical phenomena (phase change and natural convection) {{be incorporated into the}} design process? How do these systems techno-economically compare against each other? Answering these questions requires detailed annual integrated analysis. As a first step, it was found that alternative TES systems require alternative operational modes and control strategies, which motivated the author to develop appropriate off-design models for the receiver and the Rankine cycle. Additionally, it was noticed that full fundamental mathematical models for high temperature shell-and-tube TES systems were not available, so, this work expanded the literature by: (i) Determining the circumstances under which natural convection must be considered through proposing error correlations and (ii) Developing natural convection Nusselt correlations that can be used via the effective <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>method.</b> After developing and validating these mathematical models, along with pulling other salient models from the literature, an integrated system model was developed for comparative analysis amongst all alternatives (including various sensible and phase change systems).

Economically, a maximum reduction of 60 % compared to two-tank systems was obtained with a thermocline system with concrete filler in terms of the total TES specific cost, followed by ~ 50 % reduction with pipeless shell-and-tube systems with concrete. Shifting from solid fillers to compact low cost PCMs can lead to ~ 60 % reduction in shell-and-tube system with embedded pipes, but only a 40 % reduction was achieved for a thermocline system.

The interatomic pair potentials of Cr-Cr, Mn-Mn, Fe-Fe, C-C, Cr-C, Mn-C, Fe-C, Cr-Fe, Cr-N and Mn-N were inverted by the lattice inversion method and ab initio cohesive energies, and then employed to investigate the properties of Cr-, Mn- and Fe-carbides by atomistic simulations in this work. For the binary M 7 C 3 carbide, the structural properties of M 7 C 3 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe) were investigated by atomistic simulations. The {{results show that the}} stable structure for these compounds is hexagonal structure with P 63 mc space group. The cohesive energy of M 7 C 3 calculated in this work indicates that the stability of carbides decreases with the increasing in metal atomic number. Further, the vibrational entropy of Cr 7 C 3 was calculated at different temperatures and compared with the entropy obtained by experimentations. The comparison demonstrates that the main contribution to the entropy is made by the vibrational entropy. For the binary τ-carbides, the structural properties of Cr 23 C 6 and Mn 23 C 6, as well as the vibrational entropy of Cr 23 C 6 were computed. Further, the site preference of ternary element Fe among 4 a, 8 c, 32 f and 48 h symmetry sites in Cr 23 -xFexC 6 was studied. It has been seen that Fe atoms would firstly occupy 4 a sites and then 8 c sites. The lattice constant and stability of Cr 23 -xFexC 6 were also computed with different Fe content. In order to understand the relative stability of the transition metal carbides and nitrides, the standard formation Gibbs energies of carbides and nitrides for Cr, Mn and Fe were compared. The order of carbon and nitrogen affinities for Cr, Mn and Fe was further clarified by the comparison of the interatomic pair potentials among Cr-C, Mn-C, Fe-C, Cr-N and Mn-N. It was found that Cr-N interaction was very strong in comparison with other binary interactions above and consequently, nitrogen addition would lead to a strong decrease in the thermodynamic activity of chromium in Cr-containing alloys. This was confirmed by the investigations of thermodynamic activities of Cr in the Fe-Cr-N and Fe-Cr-C-N alloys. The activities were measured in the temperature range 973 - 1173 K by solid-state galvanic cell method involving CaF 2 solid electrolyte under the purified N 2 gas.

In this paper, we developed an appropriate definition for integrated heat current to calculate <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of solids under periodic conditions. We applied this method to solid argon and silicon based systems; compared and contrasted with the Green-Kubo approach. Comment: We updated this manuscript from second version by changing the title and abstract. This paper is submitted to J. Chem. Phy...|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{nuclear fuel}} <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> in-pile can provide much needed data for {{understanding}} fuel performance during irradiation and yield thermophysical property data needed for simulation codes and fuel databases. The {{objective of this}} research is to develop and compare two in-pile <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>methods</b> in a laboratory setting using surrogate fuel materials. A steady-state radial heat flow method was investigated to understand its viability as an in-pile steady-state <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> technique. By using Joule heating to simulate volumetric heat generation within a surrogate fuel rod, <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> was measured with two thermocouples at different radial positions within the rod. Examinations were completed on two batches of surrogate materials over the temperature range of 500 to 700 °C. The selected surrogate rod was fabricated from the only material identified to possess the required <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> and electrical resistivity required for the selected laboratory approach. Evaluations estimated a measurement uncertainty of 12 % and values were within 33 % of values obtained using laboratory material property measurement systems for this surrogate material. Results indicate that the selected surrogate rod material limited the ability to assess this approach at higher temperatures in a laboratory setting. A transient needle probe method adapted from American Standard Test Method standards was also used to measure temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of surrogate fuel rod materials for temperatures ranging from room temperature to 400 °C. The needle probe has a heating element and a temperature sensor contained in a metal sheath, and it is inserted into the surrogate fuel rod whose <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> is to be measured. The <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> is calculated from the power applied to the heating element, and the temperature rise detected in the sample. Needle probes were designed and fabricated using materials recommended for in-pile application. Scoping room-temperature values obtained using the needle probe method were within acceptable accuracies defined by the ASTM needle probe reference standard. Temperature-dependent values were within 2 % of values for the well-characterized ASTM recommended reference material, fused silica. A measurement uncertainty under 6 % was calculated for the needle probe method. As a result of this study, the needle probe method was selected for additional testing at the Idaho National Laboratory for anticipated testing in Materials Test Reactors. This would result in the first-ever transient in-pile <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> sensor...|$|R
50|$|Time-Domain Thermoreflectance is {{a method}} by which the thermal {{properties}} of a material can be measured, most importantly <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity.</b> This <b>method</b> can be applied most notably to thin film materials (up to hundreds of nanometers thick), which have properties that vary greatly {{when compared to the}} same materials in bulk. The idea behind this technique is that once a material is heated up, the change in the reflectance of the surface can be utilized to derive the thermal properties. The reflectivity is measured with respect to time, and the data received can be matched to a model with coefficients that correspond to thermal properties.|$|R
40|$|A {{stochastic}} temperature {{solution is}} derived for the heat conduction {{problem in a}} nonhomogeneous plate with random <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> by perturbation <b>method</b> and Laplace transform. The nonhomogeneous plate, which has exponential variations in the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> and mechanical properties through the plate thickness, is heated by a prescribed deterministic temperature on the one surface. The stochastic thermal stress problem in the nonhomogeneous plate with the random <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> or random coefficient of linear thermal expansion is analyzed thorough the use of thermal stress expression reported by one of present authors. Numerical results for the standard deviation of thermal stress are presented for {{the case that the}} randomness in the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> and coefficient of linear thermal expansion is assumed to follow a uniform probability distribution...|$|R
