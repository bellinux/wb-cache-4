40|$|BACKGROUND: A lactose-free diet is {{commonly}} prescribed to subjects with hypolactasia. We tested {{the effectiveness of}} a single ingestion of <b>tilactase</b> (a beta-D-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae) in adults with hypolactasia, previously assessed by lactose H(2) -breath test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After measurement of orocecal transit time (OCTT, by lactulose H(2) -breath test) and lactose H(2) -breath testing plus placebo, a total of 134 subjects were positive to hypolactasia and underwent lactose H(2) -breath testing plus either low (6750 U) or standard (11, 250 U) doses of <b>tilactase.</b> The appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms during the tests was monitored. RESULTS: OCTT was longer in malabsorbers (subjects without bloating, abdominal pain and/or diarrhoea, n = 25) than in intolerants (bloating, abdominal pain and/or diarrhoea, n = 109, P < 0. 02). Malabsorbers had longer time to H(2) peak (P < 0. 03), lower H(2) peak levels (P < 0. 002) and smaller integrated H(2) excretion levels (P < 0. 005) than intolerants. After <b>tilactase</b> ingestion, integrated H(2) levels were decreased by 75...|$|E
40|$|Lactase enzyme {{supplements}} and probiotics with high beta-galactosidase activity may be valid treatment {{options for the}} lactose intolerance. Aim {{of this study was}} to assess whether supplementation with <b>tilactase</b> or Lactobacillus reuteri when compared to placebo affects hydrogen breath excretion and gastrointestinal symptoms in lactose intolerant patients during lactose breath test (H,-LBT) ...|$|E
