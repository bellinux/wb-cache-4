50|$|Quia Emptores {{ended the}} ancient {{practice}} of frankalmoign whereby lands could {{be donated to}} a Church organization {{to be held in}} perpetuity. Frankalmoign created a tenure whereby the holder (the Church) was exempt from all services, except trinoda necessitas. Quia Emptores allowed no new <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> <b>frankalmoign,</b> except by the Crown. The issues arising from frankalmoign had been addressed by the Statute of Mortmain. Quia Emptores took mortmain one step further by banning outright the formation of new tenures, except by the Crown.|$|E
25|$|In Bracton's time, the {{question}} frequently arose about land held <b>in</b> <b>frankalmoign</b> (land {{donated to the}} Church). Writs were common prohibiting Church courts from meddling into the title of land, {{even if it were}} to be held <b>in</b> <b>frankalmoign.</b> The question was that of lay fee, which was the equivalent of secular lands, even though it may have been held in free, pure and perpetual alms. Bracton posited that land which is sacred (housing Churches and the like) was within the jurisdiction of the Church. To this could be added lands donated {{in the form of a}} dower. A glance of the plea rolls demonstrates them to be covered with writs of prohibitions directed at ecclesiastical judges in a continuous battle over jurisdiction of Church lands.|$|R
5000|$|Every {{feoffment}} {{made by a}} new tenant {{could not}} be <b>in</b> <b>frankalmoign,</b> since the donee was a layman; it would be reckoned {{by the laws of}} socage. Socage grew at the expense of <b>frankalmoign.</b> The tenant <b>in</b> chief could not alienate without the license of the King. Petty serjeanty came to be treated as [...] "socage in effect".|$|R
50|$|Like its Bridgetown counterpart, Ballybeg, {{in which}} the de Roches also had a part in its {{foundation}} and endowment, was probably held from the de Barrys <b>in</b> <b>frankalmoign</b> and included rights such as gallows and baronial courts for all contentious issues and pleas arising on the abbey's domain among its tenants and bondsmen, excepting those reserved to the crown. Alexander fitz Hugh de la Roche enfeoffed his nephew Maurice le Fleming with {{the western part of}} Fermoy. This Maurice le Fleming gave two carucates of land for the foundation of Bridgetown Abbey, while his grandson William Fitz Richard de Barry, granted the church of Cahirduggan to the Priory of Ballybeg by charter perfected on 28 September 1273.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{mention of}} it under its present name {{occurs in the}} Testa de Nevill {{towards the end of}} the 13th century, when it was held in two moieties, half a fee under John de Lisle of Wootton by Henry de Botebrigge, and a fifth of a fee, {{formerly}} held by Walter Urry under Matilda de Estur of Gatcombe, by the Abbot of Quarr Abbey. In 1328, Henry de Botebrigge, and in 1331 Robert de Botebrigge, confirmed a grant made by their ancestors <b>in</b> <b>frankalmoign</b> to the Abbot and convent of Quarr of part of the meadow called Ryedemede in the east part of the road from Budbridge to 'la Rydeforde.' [...] By the middle of the 14th century, Henry de Botebrigge had been succeeded by Henry Romyn. In 1358, William de Wintershill seems to have been in possession of Budbridge, here called a manor, as in that year he demised it to John de Weggham.|$|R

30|$|To {{summarize}} {{our results}} about the returns to {{different types of}} specific human capital, we find a strong return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the formal sector, but no significant return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the informal sector. Our estimates of 10 -year returns to employer, occupation, industry, and sector tenure indicate that formal sector tenure matters more than other specific human capital, namely employer or occupation <b>tenure.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the strong return to formal sector tenure, we find significant returns to potential experience with and without controlling for sector tenure, {{which is consistent with}} previous findings in the literature.|$|R
