5|$|British and French {{submarine}} {{operations in}} <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara {{were the one}} significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara. During the campaign there was always one British submarine in <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E

5|$|The North Pacific {{right whale}} appears {{to occur in}} two {{population}}s. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals. A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk, but very {{little is known about}} this population. Thus, the two northern right whale species are the most endangered of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk and in the eastern Bering Sea. Although this species is very likely to be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns are not known.|$|E
