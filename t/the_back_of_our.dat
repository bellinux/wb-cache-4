Mike wasn't the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds, that he wasn't where we needed him to be mentally."

[...] Considered a last-ditch effort since it would not provide cooling, such a plan would require massive reinforcement under the floor, as for the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus.|$|E

2500|$|The 2013 Stanley Cup {{run by the}} Bruins was {{one that}} further united the New England region that had been rocked by tragedies, such as the Boston Marathon bombing and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Coach Claude Julien said after the {{deciding}} Game 6, [...] "You know, {{at the end of}} the day, I think that's what hurts the most is in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds, although we needed to focus on our team and doing what was going to be the best thing for our team to win a Stanley Cup, in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds we wanted to do it for those kind of reasons, the City of Boston, what Newtown has been through, that kind of stuff. It hit close to home, and the best way we felt we could try and cheer the area was to win a Stanley Cup. I think that's what's hard right now for the players. We had more reasons than just ourselves to win a Cup." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When I {{think back}} to it, {{it was such a}} crucial point to so many people, we didn't even realise back then but it showed us what we would be doing for the next year of our lives. We were never nervous about Anette, or the album being good, but we just couldn't tell how people would take it. Would they like Anette? Would they like the music? That was in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds all the time. And there was such a huge amount of money involved, over 800.000 euros, that we needed to sell at least a few albums to get going," [...] Tuomas Holopainen was recalling in 2008.|$|E

60|$|Although I was {{standing}} {{well in the}} centre <b>of</b> <b>our</b> force, {{it was possible to}} see the uniforms of that band of renegades which Sir John had armed and equipped that they might kill their neighbors, as the men came up {{to take the place of}} the retreating redskins, and, if anything had been needed to stiffen <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> people, surely they got it when seeing those whom they had once called friends, moving into line to compass their death.|$|R

5000|$|In {{answer to}} the {{question}} of why he writes poetry, Coburn has said [...] "It simply isn’t a conscious decision I make to write poetry, but an impulsion that cannot be ignored. Poetry photographs parts of life and humanity that can’t be captured visually, at least in a literal sense. It dissects the hopelessness of being alive and makes it seem to develop meaning momentarily, even if it never actually does.If our most private and affecting inner thoughts and memories, the ones we keep silently at <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds, were given a voice, it would be poetry. That is what poetry is to me." ...|$|R

500|$|So, {{against the}} dread beast {{of pride and}} against these sevenfold brutes of {{poisonous}} vices, which strive cruelly to tear apart with their rabid teeth and virulent fangs all who are unarmed, despoiled of the cuirass of virginity and stripped of the shield of chastity, the virgins of Christ and the young champions of the church must fight with muscle and strength. Against, as it were, the ferocious legions of the barbarians, which in their troops never cease to batter the tortoise of the soldiers of Christ with the artillery of guileful fraud, the struggle must go on manfully, fought with the darts of spiritual weaponry and the iron-tipped spears of the virtues. Let us not, like timid soldiers who effeminately dread the shock {{of war and the}} call of the trumpeter, inertly offer to the ravening foe <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> shoulders rather than the bosses <b>of</b> <b>our</b> shields! ...|$|R
60|$|We did so; and {{by degrees}} {{the fact that}} his life was {{permanently}} blighted became almost a legend. At <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds we were aware of it, but it did not obtrude itself into the affairs of every day. It was only when someone, forgetting, as Ellerton had done, tried to enlist his sympathy for some misfortune of his own that the look of pain in his eyes and the sudden tightening of his lips reminded us that he still remembered.|$|E
6000|$|His Grace plainly {{had some}} {{business}} with us, and I hoped {{he was coming}} to force the fighting. The pieces had ceased to rattle on the round mahogany table, and every head in the room seemed turned our way, for the Covent Garden story was well known.

60|$|Now Suzanne rose, {{and taking}} the boy by the hand she began to lead him homeward, very slowly, since he was footsore and exhausted, {{and for the last}} half of the way could only walk resting upon her shoulder.

60|$|And {{through the}} years the tale of my madness never ceased from being told over the camp-fire. Yet was the very telling the source of my vengeance; for the dream did not die, and the young ones, {{listening}} to the laugh and the sneer, redreamed it, {{so that in the}} end it was Othar, my eldest-born, himself a sheer stripling, that walked down a wild stallion, leapt on its back, and flew before all of us with the speed of the wind. Thereafter, that they might keep up with him, all men were trapping and breaking wild horses. Many horses were broken, and some men, but I lived at the last to the day when, at the changing of camp-sites in the pursuit of the meat in its seasons, our very babes, in baskets of willow-withes, were slung side and side on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> horses that carried our camp-trappage and dunnage.|$|R
60|$|As {{might be}} expected, having Martina's brains, Heliodore's love, and the Northmen's loyalty at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>our</b> plan went well.

60|$|Betty {{uttered a}} cry. Something {{had told her}} who he was, this Harvard man who had sold himself. That species of sixth sense which lies undeveloped at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds during the {{ordinary}} happenings of life wakes sometimes in moments of keen emotion. At its highest, it is prophecy; at its lowest, a vague presentiment. It woke in Betty now. There was no particular reason why she should have connected her stepfather's words with John. The term he had used was an elastic one. Among the visitors to the island there were probably several Harvard men. But somehow she knew.|$|E
60|$|But an {{occasional}} change of habit does nobody any harm; and besides, as Harris and I agreed, {{it was good}} training for George. In the Black Forest we should be up at five every morning; that we had determined on. Indeed, George himself had suggested half-past four, but Harris and I had argued that five would be early enough as an average; that would enable us to be on our machines by six, and to break <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> journey before {{the heat of the}} day set in. Occasionally we might start a little earlier, but not as a habit.|$|E
6000|$|A road {{has been}} called Adelaide Road; it leads from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> house to the bridge, and thence to the garden, and by a {{bifurcation}} to the pig pen. It is thus much traversed, particularly by Fanny. [...] An oleander, {{the only one of}} your seeds that prospered in this climate, grows there; and the name is now some week or ten days applied and published. ADELAIDE ROAD leads also into the bush, to the banana patch, and by a second bifurcation over the left branch of the stream to the plateau and the right hand of the gorges. In short, it leads to all sorts of good, and is, besides, in itself a pretty winding path, bound downhill among big woods to the margin of the stream.|$|E

2500|$|Snyder {{presented}} his first budget {{to the legislature}} on February 17, 2011, calling it a plan for [...] "Michigan's reinvention," [...] and saying it would end Michigan's deficits. He described the budget as containing [...] "shared sacrifice" [...] but added that his budget plan would create jobs and spur economic growth. The $46 billion budget reduced $1.8 billion in spending, raised taxes by eliminating tax exemptions on pensions, {{while at the same}} time abolished the state's complex business tax, replacing it with a significantly reduced flat tax on the profits of C corporations. This shift in tax burden led State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer to criticize the budget, saying that it did not involve [...] "shared sacrifice," [...] but instead was balanced [...] "on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> kids, working families, and our seniors" [...] and [...] "picks out who he’s willing to leave behind." [...] Snyder supported <b>the</b> government <b>backed</b> rescue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American auto industry. This reflected the view of a 56% of Americans in 2012 who supported the 2009 auto bailout according to a Pew Research Center poll (63% support in Michigan).|$|R
