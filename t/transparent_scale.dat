40|$|The {{wings of}} the swordtail {{butterfly}} Graphium sarpedon nipponum contain the bile pigment sarpedobilin, which causes blue/green colored wing patches. Locally the bile pigment is combined with the strongly blue-absorbing carotenoid lutein, resulting in green wing patches and thus improving camouflage.

30|$|Quartz stone density {{analysis}} {{was done by}} digital analysis of the 1 m 2 images using Adobe Photoshop software. In a first step, all vascular plants with clear bounds (e.g., Agyroderma sp.) were masked and saved as an extra image. The remaining image was displayed with maximum contrast as {{a black and white}} image, the soil being shown in black and the pebbles in white. The coverage of each color was analyzed with ArcView 3.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, WA, USA) software and the Spatial Analyst application. All images were converted into grids, in which black pixels were assigned the value 0 and white ones the value 1. The number of pixels with each value was extracted from the attribute table and converted into percentages. The images with the vascular plants were processed in the same manner and their percentage subtracted from the total pixel number per image, yielding the percentages of quartz pebbles and bare soil. In order to validate this digital method, three 25 × 25 cm areas of one sampling image were printed in color, and on each print, two 5 × 5 cm areas were randomly covered with <b>transparent</b> <b>scale</b> paper. On an illuminated screen, the edges of the quartz pebbles were traced with a pen onto the 5 × 5 cm scale papers, which were then enlarged and the quartz pebble pixels were counted.

Would these eyes result from atrophy or from stagnated development? How would its visual function work? Anatomical investigations of these organs are the fundamental preamble to answer those questions, which are still little explored by the literature. {{in this article we}} have studied anatomical aspects of the eyes of three species of fossorial reptiles, within the suborder Amphisbaena (Amphisbaena alba, Amphisbaena mertensi, Leposternon infraorbitale), as well as a species within the ophidian suborder (Typhlops brongersmianus). the minuscule eyes (1 - 2 mm diameter) were visualized through a scale, a translucent area which corresponds to the spectacle. This spectacle is a thinner and <b>transparent</b> <b>scale,</b> covering a conjunctival sac. the retrobulbar space was filled with the harderian gland. the eyes of Typhlops presented an oval shape, whereas Amphisbaena specimens presented cup-shaped eyes. in Amphisbaenian sclera is comprised of cartilage, while the thin sclera of Typhlops consists of connective tissue and striated muscle fibers. the retina presented all the typical layers found in vertebrates, regardless the species. the characteristics involved in the fossil adaptation of these species include: reduced size of the eyeball, rudimentary cornea, absence of the anterior chamber, presence of a complex iris-ciliary body, and lens with amorphous nucleate cells. the analysis of the eye morphology of these animals suggests {{that there might be a}} specific function concerning light perception.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the EMC algorithm for reconstructing a particle's 3 D diffraction intensity from very many photon shot-noise limited 2 D measurements, when the particle orientation in each measurement is unknown.

After a few iterations of the EMC update rule, the reconstructed intensity {{is given to}} the difference-map algorithm for reconstruction of the particle contrast.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulation {{studies were}} performed on four molten metal tribromides, MBr 3, M = La, Ce, Y, Dy. The many-body (polarizable-ion) simulation potentials were constructed from recent metal trichloride potentials using physically <b>transparent</b> <b>scaling</b> arguments to account to the change in anion size and polarizability. Comparison was made with neutron scattering results by constructing the total structure factors from the simulated partial functions. In addition, difference functions, which exploit the proposed isomorphous nature of the (Dy, Y) and (La, Ce) pairs, are constructed and compared with experiment. The structural comparison between different trihalide materials is further extended by producing model structure factors, obtained by re-weighting and scaling the simulated partial structure factors for the tribromides, which are then compared with experimental structure factors for certain trichlorides and tri-iodides. Strong structural similarities are demonstrated between the different halides with similar cation-anion radius ratios. It is further suggested that the structures exhibited by the trihalides fall into {{a small number of}} characteristic structure classes. The short- and intermediate-range order within the different structure classes is then exemplified by analysis of the local coordination environments and the connectivity of the coordination polyhedra...|$|R
40|$|Brilliant {{iridescent}} colouring in male butterflies enables long-range conspecific {{communication and}} {{it has long been}} accepted that microstructures, rather than pigments, are responsible for this coloration. Few studies, however, explicitly relate the intra-scale microstructures to overall butterfly visibility, both in terms of reflected and transmitted intensities and viewing angles. Using a focused-laser technique, we investigated the absolute reflectivity and transmissivity associated with the single-scale microstructures of two species of Morpho butterfly and the mechanisms behind their remarkable wide-angle visibility. Measurements indicate that certain Morpho microstructures reflect up to 75 % of the incident blue light over an angle range of greater than 100 ° in one plane and 15 ° in the other. We show that incorporation of a second layer of more <b>transparent</b> <b>scales,</b> above a layer of highly iridescent scales, leads to very strong diffraction, and we suggest this effect acts to increase further the angle range over which incident light is reflected. Measurements using index-matching techniques yield the complex refractive index of the cuticle material comprising the single-scale microstructure to be n = (1. 56 ± 0. 01) + (0. 06 ± 0. 01) i.

40|$|Global {{software}} stacks {{on scientific}} cluster computing resources {{are required to}} provide a homogeneous software environment which is typically inflexible. Efforts to integrate Virtual Machines (VMs), in order to abstract the software environment of various scientific applications, suffer from performance limitations and require systems administration expertise to maintain.

In this paper, we introduce the Virtual Container Cluster (VCC) that encapsulates a typical HPC software environment within Docker containers. The novel component cluster–watcher enables context aware discovery and configuration of the virtual cluster. Containers offer a lightweight alternative to VMs that more closely match the native performance, and presents a solution that is more accessible to customization by the average user. Combined with a Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology, the VCC enables dynamic features such as <b>transparent</b> <b>scaling</b> and spanning across multiple physical resources.

Fluid mechanic forces are a key player in the early development and progression of atherosclerosis and a better understanding of the interplay between haemodynamic and vascular diseases is needed. The carotid artery (CA) in one of the predominant sites of atherosclerotic plaque formation. In this work a <b>transparent,</b> <b>scaled</b> model of an average human carotid artery (AHCA) bifurcation was constructed and steady blood flow at Re = 290 and Re = 700 was simulated using an aqueous glycerin solution. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were performed in the plane of bifurcation and three axial planes in the carotid sinus. Flow inside the CA bifurcation was found to be three-dimensional with strong secondary currents due to the curvature of the vessel. An accurate method for wall shear stress (WSS) calculation along the outer internal carotid artery (ICA) wall is introduced. The method was tested against synthetically generated particle images and was found to perform best for an 8 x 8 pix 2 interrogation windows.
