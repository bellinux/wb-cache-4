5|$|There is a race {{prejudice}} {{that exists}} between the white and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers.... Just <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>the</b> announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E

25|$|First-year cadets are {{required}} to arrive one week {{before the start of}} classes for training, also known as New Cadet Week.

The parade is intended to display the change in the new cadets and their acquisition of military knowledge and discipline.

25|$|The city is {{best known}} as the home of the Sanctuary of the Padre Jesús de Petatlán. The image is of Christ during one of the times he fell while {{carrying}} the Cross. The image dates to the 17th century. This image has been accredited with many miracles, with devotees referring to it as “Tata Chuy” or “Papa Chuy.” (Tata means grandfather, and Papa means dad. Chuy is a common diminutive for Jesús.) The image is housed in a large white church with very large wooden doors, whose official name is Santuario Nacional del Santo Señor de Petatlán. Just outside the atrium, vendors selling gold and religious items congregate. It is a regional pilgrimage site, which is particularly visited during Holy Week, when as many as 30,000 people come into the city. During <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>the</b> city holds a fair, called Fexpo, but the highlight of the week is a Passion Play in which 60 area residents are chosen to play Jesus and the other principal characters. The Play begins at the sanctuary, and then proceeds along a five-kilometer path, reenacting the Stations of the Cross, {{on the way to a}} hill in the Colonia Benito Juarez neighborhood, which simulates Calvary. However, in 2006, there was a grenade attack during the Fexpo in which two people were killed and about 50 wounded; since then, the crowds during Holy Week and the rest of the year have been much smaller.|$|E

Emitt praised it for being transgressive, writing that both the song and the video represented [...] "the boldness of the rising generation of queer and trans* artists who eschew comfortably 'safe' representations of sexuality in favor of discomforting the audience they still mean to attract… and arouse." ...|$|E
500|$|The season saw {{drastic changes}} to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, [...] "Herrenvolk", Williams—the actor who played Mulder's {{informant}} X—was written out of the show. He said that, [...] "Carter called me up personally [...] 'Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we're gonna bring you up for another episode <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> <b>The</b> bad news is you're gonna take a bullet." [...] The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be [...] "more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman", noting that he [...] "wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically. [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] also introduced the killer bees, who {{would go on to}} play a larger part in the 1998 film. Carter described the fourth season as [...] "maybe the most intense and difficult season of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|... : As new housemates, Bea, David, Hira, Kenneth and Tom {{could not}} {{nominate}} {{and could not}} be nominated by their fellow housemates. However, they were set a secret mission, in which they had to get Halfwit and Noirin (who were randomly chosen by Hira) nominated for eviction by the other housemates. Failure meant automatically facing the public vote. Charlie and Lisa received the most nominations, therefore the new housemates failed their mission and faced eviction themselves. As punishment for discussing nominations, Charlie, Dogface (who also failed to nominate the required two people for eviction this week), Halfwit, Marcus, Noirin and Siavash also faced the public vote and Big Brother voided all nominations. Therefore, Lisa and Rodrigo were the only two housemates not to face eviction <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> <b>The</b> eviction was later cancelled due to Kenneth walking from the house.
