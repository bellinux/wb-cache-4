They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C.

5|$|In 1894 the {{authorities}} decided {{to abolish the}} position of bailiff and {{it was decided that}} some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs. This resulted in 26 new chief of police positions, largely corresponding to the old bailiwicks. Some received jurisdiction over both cities and rural areas, other just rural areas. At the same time the existing police districts were expanded to include the surrounding rural areas. However, the individual bailiff were not removed from office until their natural retirement, leaving some bailiwick in place until 1919. The reform eliminated the difference between the rural and city police forces; yet the sheriffs were only subordinate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> of police in police matters—in civil matters and administration they remained under the county governors.|$|E
