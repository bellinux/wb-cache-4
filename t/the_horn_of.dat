5|$|Blessed Lightning, a monk at the monastery, has {{a vision}} of Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains {{consciousness}} and, too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to the monastery, loses the message, but is recognised as the dog from Blessed Lightning's vision. Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey regain consciousness in the monastery and are brought before the Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and Haddock travel on to <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> the Yak.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Chinese envoys {{had been}} sailing through the Indian Ocean to India since perhaps the 2nd century BC, {{yet it was}} during the Tang dynasty that a strong Chinese {{maritime}} presence could be found in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, into Persia, Mesopotamia (sailing up the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq), Arabia, Egypt, Aksum (Ethiopia), and Somalia in <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa.|$|E

Aurochs <b>horns</b> were large and thick overall, reaching 80-100 cm {{in length and}} 10 cm or more in diameter. However, <b>the</b> <b>horns</b> <b>of</b> Heck cattle differ in many respects. Usually, they curve too much upwards or outwards compared to the original, or do not reach the length or diameter of the aurochs.

5|$|During the 7th century, Aksumite power {{began to}} fail, and Ethiopian society began to {{withdraw}} {{further into the}} highland hinterlands, with the coastal areas becoming peripheral areas (whereas Adulis on the coast was once the second city of Aksum).

5|$|Subsequently, {{forestry}} authorities intensified their {{pest control}} methods and additionally started education campaigns, such as warning not to transport firewood over large distances or to store it too long. Through wood export, the wasp can spread to East Asia, West Australia {{and parts of}} Africa. Remote locations, such as <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa, may be spared from the Sirex woodwasp, providing the area is controlled. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the IUCN has graded the wasp as heavily invasive.|$|E

5|$|Activated in 1985, the 10th Mountain Division's second brigade's {{elements}} saw numerous deployments to contingencies {{around the}} world in the 1990s. With the Global War on Terrorism the brigade has deployed six times: initially deployed to Uzbekistan, Kuwait and Qatar in 2001, elements of the brigade later deployed from Uzbekistan into Afghanistan; the brigade deployed again in early 2003, split across Iraq, Afghanistan and <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa; the entire brigade returned to Iraq in 2004–2005, 2006–2007 and 2009–2010 before returning to Afghanistan in 2013 for its sixth deployment.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1975, {{smallpox}} persisted only in <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa. Conditions {{were very}} difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, and refugees made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1977, {{under the direction of}} Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner. As the campaign neared its goal, Fenner and his team {{played an important role in}} verifying eradication. The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (Variola minor) was diagnosed in Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Merca, Somalia, on 26 October 1977. The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly Variola major had been detected in October 1975 in a two-year-old Bangladeshi girl, Rahima Banu.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Company C, 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment was {{deployed}} to <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa and stationed at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, after completing a 14-month deployment at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Company C carried the crew-served weapons {{to protect the}} camp. It also operated the entry control checkpoints, protected U.S. and allied ships at the massive Djibouti Port, and guarded the U.S. Embassy there. By mid-2009, {{the rest of the}} battalion deployed there in case a larger combat maneuver element was needed to operate from the base. The area is considered to be the most unstable part of Africa, and the Somali border is less than 10 miles from Camp Lemonnier.|$|E

5|$|Italy {{joined the}} war on Germany's side on 10 June 1940, opening the East African Campaign and the Desert War in North Africa. A Rhodesian-led force of irregulars from the Somaliland Camel Corps—based in British Somaliland, on <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa's north coast—took part {{in one of the}} first clashes between British and Italian forces when it {{exchanged}} fire with an Italian banda (irregular company) around dawn on 11 June. Two days later three Caproni bombers of the Regia Aeronautica attacked Wajir, one of No. 237 Squadron's forward airstrips, damaging two Rhodesian aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for its {{progressive}} political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a large number of European settlers entered the state who had mainly emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany. The state remains today a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa, the Middle East and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is {{among the highest in the}} United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.|$|E
5|$|The M. {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) {{includes four}} other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti. M. africanum is not widespread, {{but it is}} a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa. M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare and seems to be limited to <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E

5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} {{is native to}} Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, but it is extinct in Djibouti. Largely {{confined}} to <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa today, the species historically ranged from Awash (Ethiopia) southward through southern and eastern Ethiopia, and most parts of Somalia (except {{the north and the}} northeast) and Kenya (except the southwest). It also occurred in southeastern Sudan and northeastern and eastern parts of Uganda and Tanzania. The only evidence for its existence in the Arabian peninsula is a single set of horns obtained in 1967 from an individual shot in South Yemen and another in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird has the {{smallest}} {{range of the}} three tropicbird species, yet it still ranges across the neotropics, {{as well as the}} tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian oceans. The nominate subspecies Phaethon aethereus aethereus breeds on islands in the Atlantic south of the equator, including Ascension, and Saint Helena on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and Fernando de Noronha and Abrolhos Archipelago in Brazilian waters. It is a vagrant to the coastline of Namibia and South Africa. The subspecies P. a. mesonauta is found in the east Atlantic, the east Pacific, and in the Caribbean. The Indian Ocean subspecies, P. a. indicus is found in waters off Pakistan, western India, southwestern Sri Lanka, <b>the</b> <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Africa and Arabian Peninsula.
