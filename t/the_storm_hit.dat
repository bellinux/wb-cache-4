A board game, called The Blizzard of '77 Travel Game was created after <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> In it, <b>the</b> players drive around the board, trying to collect goods, such as groceries and gasoline, before <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>hits.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>hits,</b> <b>the</b> board is flipped over to the [...] "Blizzard" [...] side and the players must continue in blizzard conditions. A set of six glasses was sold by the Buffalo Courier-Express newspaper with reproductions of newspaper articles about <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> on them. Two books have been written about it, The Blizzard by Robert Bahr and White Death – The Blizzard of '77, which is a compilation by Erno Rossi of accounts of the blizzard from both southern Ontario and western New York (Rossi 1999; note the original edition of the book was entitled White Death – Blizzard of '77 and published in 1978).

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September28, reports {{indicated}} that Juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal Category1 hurricane.

By 6 p.m. ADT (2100 UTC), additional warnings had been issued since Juan was expected to make landfall as a strong Category1 or weak Category2 hurricane. Most businesses in the areas affected were closed on Sundays, which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute. Although no large-scale evacuations were made, local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of September 28. In all, several hundred people were affected by these evacuations. Utility workers also stood on standby before <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>hit,</b> preparing for large-scale power outages.|$|E
25|$|September 9, 1965, Betsy (Category 3 at landfall) came ashore in Louisiana, causing massive {{destruction}} as {{the first}} hurricane in history to cause one billion dollars in damage (over ten billion in inflation-adjusted USD). <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>hit</b> New Orleans and flooded nearly 35% of the city (including the Lower 9th Ward, Gentilly, and parts of Mid-City).

25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 8 June 2007, Newcastle Port Corporation radioed the 56 moored ships waiting off the coast to load coal to warn them to move out to sea to escape an {{approaching}} storm.

The ship never called for tug assistance, ran aground with a fully operational engine room and still had both anchors stored in the hawsepipes leading some maritime experts to believe that proper precautions were not taken by the ship's captain.|$|E

25|$|In early March 2016, {{a dip in}} the {{jet stream}} and {{collection}} of moisture from the gulf caused a large, slow-moving weather system that produced torrential rains and severe weather as it made its way from Texas into the Mississippi Valley. On March 8, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>hit</b> northwest Louisiana, where it proceeded to create huge flood events in the area near Shreveport. Many neighborhoods around Red Chute Bayou and Flat River in Bossier Parish were quickly inundated and evacuated. In the neighborhood of Golden Meadows in Bossier City, the rapid rainfall overwhelmed storm drains and left people stranded in their homes with up to four feet of water in some areas. As the storm later moved east, the rest of North Louisiana was heavily impacted with up to twenty five inches of rain recorded in some areas such as Monroe. There were also many areas in other states such as Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee severely affected by this storm.
