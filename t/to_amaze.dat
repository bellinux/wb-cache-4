Batmaz praised Portnoy for [...] "displaying admirable restraint": [...] "Free is perhaps his most minimalistic side, because of the thick atmosphere on the album, but at any rate, his performance his spectacular".

Chicago Tribune journalist Rick Kogan describes this as a massive undertaking with the natural foibles of the human element in it selections and accuracy, and by nature of its attempt to serve as a historical compilation an immediately dated product due to the dynamic nature of the city. [...] However, he feels it is sure <b>to</b> <b>amaze</b> its audience. A Chicago Sun-Times reviewer describes it as a scholarly product that is [...] "easily the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published". The State Journal-Register, the Springfield, Illinois newspaper, reviewers complain that downstate cities and regions are neglected in the book. A Daily Herald review describes it as a book accurately [...] "billed as the city's most definitive historical reference book". [...] The Peoria Journal Star notes that although there are complaints about omissions and underserved topics, the online version should quell the demands for further knowledge.|$|E

500|$|John Sinnott of DVD Talk {{said that}} while [...] "the show still {{has a lot of}} charm," [...] he felt it did not live up to the {{standards}} of the first season. Sinnott criticised the season for wrapping up the Cabal story line in the first two episodes, expecting it to continue throughout the season, as well as accusing the writers of throwing out [...] "a lot of aspects that made {{the end of the first}} season so great." [...] However, he felt there were good episodes, naming [...] "Sleepers" [...] as his favourite, and also saying he liked [...] "Hero". He summed up that the season was [...] "still worth watching and enjoyable, just not as gripping as the first season," [...] believing it comes [...] "recommended" [...] to those who wish to purchase the season box set. David Blackwell of Enterline Media stated that the second season [...] "continues <b>to</b> <b>amaze</b> as a show I first wrote off as bad. I'm glad I'm still giving this show a second chance as it continues to deliver great character arcs and stories." [...] Blackwell named [...] "Pavor Nocturnus", [...] "Veritas" [...] and [...] "Haunted" [...] as the standout episodes. CliqueClack TV believed the season was a [...] "mixed bag"; [...] "End of Nights" [...] was considered [...] "the most thrilling hours of television Sanctuary has ever produced," [...] but the season later [...] "suffered mostly from failure to follow through with the Cabal/Ashley story arc." ...|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases <b>to</b> <b>amaze</b> me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
500|$|In Russell's {{penultimate}} season, the 1967–68 season, {{his numbers}} slowly declined, but at age 34, he still tallied 12.5 {{points per game}} and 18.6 rebounds per game (the latter good for the third highest average in the league). In the Eastern Division Finals, the 76ers had the better record than the Celtics and were slightly favored. But then, national tragedy struck as Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. With eight of the ten starting players on Sixers and Celtics being African American, both teams were in deep shock, and there were calls to cancel the series. In a game called as [...] "unreal" [...] and [...] "devoid of emotion", the Sixers lost 127–118 on April 5. In Game 2, Philadelphia evened the series with a 115–106 win, and in Games 3 and 4, the Sixers won, with Chamberlain suspiciously often defended by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry, causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down. Prior to Game 5, the Celtics seemed dead: no NBA team had ever {{come back from a}} 3–1 deficit. However, the Celtics rallied back, winning Game 5 122–104 and Game 6 114–106, powered by a spirited Havlicek and helped by a terrible Sixers shooting slump. In Game 7, 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading 3–1. Russell limited Chamberlain to only two shot attempts in the second half. Despite this, the Celtics were leading only 97–95 with 34 seconds left when Russell closed out the game with several consecutive clutch plays. He made a free throw, blocked a shot by Sixers player Chet Walker, grabbed a rebound off a miss by Sixers player Hal Greer, and finally passed the ball to teammate Sam Jones, who scored to clinch the win. Boston then beat the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 in the NBA Finals, giving Russell his tenth title in 12 years. For his efforts Russell was named Sports Illustrateds Sportsman of the Year. After losing for the fifth straight time against Russell and his Celtics, Hall-of-Fame Lakers guard Jerry West stated, [...] "If I had a choice of any basketball player in the league, my No.1 choice has to be Bill Russell. Bill Russell never ceases <b>to</b> <b>amaze</b> me." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Renaissance, romance {{continued}} to be popular. The trend was to more fantastic fiction. [...] The English Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory (c.1408–1471), was written in prose; this work dominates the Arthurian literature, often being regarded as the canonical form of the legend. [...] Arthurian motifs have appeared steadily in literature from its publication, though the works have been a mix of fantasy and non-fantasy works. [...] At the time, it and the Spanish Amadis de Gaula (1508), (also prose) spawned many imitators, and the genre was popularly well-received, producing such masterpiece of Renaissance poetry as Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando furioso and Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata. [...] Ariosto's tale, with [...] its endlessly wandering characters, many marvels, and adventures, was a source text for many fantasies of adventure. [...] With such works as Amadis of Gaul and Palmerin of England, the genre of fantasy was clearly inaugurated, as the marvels are deployed <b>to</b> <b>amaze</b> and surprise readers.|$|E
2500|$|Sutherland's early {{recordings}} {{show her}} to be possessed of a crystal-clear voice and excellent diction. However, by the early 1970s her voice lost some of this clarity in the middle register, and she often came under fire for having unclear diction. Some have attributed this to sinus surgery; however, her major sinus surgery was done in 1959, immediately after her breakthrough Lucia at Covent Garden. In fact, her first commercial recording {{of the first and}} final scene of Lucia reveals her voice and diction to be just as clear as prior to the sinus procedure. Her husband Richard Bonynge stated in an interview that her [...] "mushy diction" [...] occurred while striving to achieve perfect legato. According to him, it is because she earlier had a very Germanic [...] "un-legato" [...] way of singing. She clearly took the criticism to heart, as, within a few years, her diction improved markedly and she continued <b>to</b> <b>amaze</b> and thrill audiences throughout the world.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1981, {{after months}} of {{intensive}} touring, Split Enz returned to the studio to record what many critics regard as their most personal and creative album, Time and Tide. Much of the material came out of Tim's recent personal turmoil -- in January that year he had married English dancer Liz Malam, but the marriage collapsed in October and he suffered a nervous breakdown, an ordeal he recounted in [...] "Six Months In A Leaky Boat". The album was produced by rising English producer/engineer Hugh Padgham. He was already well-known on the music scene for his engineering work with producer Steve Lilywhite on landmark recordings by artists like Peter Gabriel, XTC and Genesis and he is credited with inventing the [...] "gated reverb" [...] drum sound that became Phil Collins' trademark. Padgham reportedly had a much more relaxed style than Tickle which the Enz found ideally suited them. Released in April 1982, Time and Tide became Split Enz' third successive #1 album in Australia and New Zealand. The advent of MTV in America, and its interest in new wave acts also helped the band's growing cult status in America -- both [...] "Dirty Creature" [...] and [...] "Six Months in a Leaky Boat" [...] (as well as earlier videos) were given wide airplay on the channel. [...] "Dirty Creature" [...] reached #6 in Australia in April and [...] "Six Months In A Leaky Boat" [...] went to #2 in June. [...] "Never Ceases <b>To</b> <b>Amaze</b> Me" [...] (August) was issued as the third single from the LP {{but it did not}} chart.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, Weber was {{a popular}} banquet speaker renowned for his [...] "polysyllabic fluency," [...] "mind--boggling after-dinner speeches," [...] and his often humorous talks {{about the history of}} Michigan football. It was noted that he would [...] "regale with dubious rhetoric" [...] audiences before whom he would thunderously and whimsically [...] "expatiate upon" [...] Michigan's storied history. Another {{described}} Weber's unusual speaking style this way: [...] "He still sounds like an educated foghorn, and still flips that king's English around in a manner <b>to</b> <b>amaze</b> and apall old Noah Webster." [...] Praising a piledriver spotted among a current crop of Wolverines, the coach would exclaim, [...] "When he hits 'em, generations yet unborn feel the shock of the impact!" [...] Jim Brandstatter wrote in his book Tales from Michigan Stadium that Weber was still a regular visitor at the football offices when he enrolled in 1968. He recalled Weber as a master story teller and a favorite among the students at pep rallies: “Who can forget Wally Weber rolling his pant legs up to his knees as the student body roared before he spoke so eloquently about his beloved Michigan?” Weber also held positions in the 1960s and early 1970s in alumni relations and the physical education department. Weber also provided color commentary on WPAG radio's broadcasts of Michigan football games with Bob Ufer for several years. He retired in 1972 {{at the same time as}} Oosterbaan. With the exception of four years at Benton Harbor, Weber had been a student or employee of U-M for 48 years at the time of his retirement.|$|E
