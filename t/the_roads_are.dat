25|$|It is fruitless to do {{detailed}} {{planning for}} things {{not within the}} capabilities of the HN and FID organization. For example, plans that call for the placement of forces not accessible by roads, or where <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> unsafe, will not be practical unless the forces can reach their destinations by air or water.|$|E
5000|$|North-east of <b>the</b> motorway, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{classified}} as a non primary route, while south-west of <b>the</b> motorway, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{classified as}} a primary route.

25|$|Motor traffic, {{particularly}} during working hours, is often congested but driving {{late at night}} and on weekends can be easier. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> not arranged according to midtown's distinctive rectangular grid pattern with staggered lights, but have small often one-lane roads with numerous stoplights and stop signs. The FDR Drive, East River Esplanade, and South Street run along the East River, and the Downtown Manhattan Heliport serves Wall Street.|$|E
25|$|Village Homes in Davis, California is {{designed}} to allow car-free movement with an extensive system of pedestrian/bike paths, running through common areas that exhibit a variety of landscaping, garden areas, play structures, statuary, with most houses facing the common areas rather than the streets. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> all narrow, curving cul-de-sacs without sidewalks which give them the feel of village lanes; the few cars that venture into the cul-de-sacs usually travel slowly.|$|E
25|$|Automobile {{access is}} allowed {{to most of the}} park, {{although}} several roads are closed to vehicular traffic. Parking lots exist at the Bell playground and zoo, at Colborne Lodge, at Grenadier Cafe, High Park pool and the north-western children's playground, as well as along some roads. On Sundays in summer, <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> closed to traffic. Colborne Lodge Road does not allow through traffic from The Queensway beyond the parking lot for the lodge.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> gazetted a State Highway in 1961. In {{the same}} year tar-sealing of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|R
50|$|Lonsdale <b>Road</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} <b>the</b> Earl of Lonsdale. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> named in 1905 {{although}} the first houses in <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>were</b> erected from 1902.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{famous for}} <b>the</b> antique and century old Spanish houses and Balete trees that line <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> also notable for the {{haunting}} legends that it had.|$|R
25|$|On November 2, 2017 the new Line 6 {{was inaugurated}} from Cerrillos to Los Leones adding 10 new {{stations}} now this new line will {{not count on}} Box Office in its place will have machines for sales and loads of cards bip! it will have gates and <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> not electrified since the routes of electification will be aerial and will have new turnstiles of entrance and exit of the station.|$|E
25|$|The roads within Basankusu are non-metalled {{and prone}} to erosion from the frequent, torrential downpours. Roads to other towns and villages are also non-metalled; their {{condition}} has continued to decline since the country's independence from Belgium in 1960. The metal Bailey bridges, which span ravines and streams along <b>the</b> <b>roads,</b> <b>are</b> also in very poor condition and in danger of collapse in some cases. Motor vehicles are rare and are usually only owned by businesses, hospitals, Christian missions, and government organisations.|$|E
25|$|Several small tunnels run under {{roads in}} Boca, but <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> built up several feet at these locations, or are on dunes. Several of these tunnels are under State Road A1A at Spanish River Park, {{from the west}} side of the road where parking is {{available}} to beachgoers, to the east side of the road, which is where the beach is located. A1A is already higher than the surrounding land here due to sand dunes formed by erosion and other natural features.|$|E
50|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> only paved from Muar to Lenga {{and another}} section near Labis; however, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> fully paved in the 1970s {{as a result}} of the opening of many FELDA {{settlements}} along Labis-Lenga stretch. During Malayan Emergency (1948-1960), <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> sabotaged by communist terrorist.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{treated as}} a memorial, as {{the bones of the}} people who died while {{constructing}} it were laid beneath or around <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> built on permafrost, interment into the fabric of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> deemed more practical than digging new holes to bury the bodies of the dead.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} a local field called [...] "Betwixt the Towns", dating from around 1630, {{subsequently}} spelt [...] "Between Roads" [...] in 1853 when <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> created. It was originally called Surman's Lane, then High Street, Cowley. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> named [...] "Between Towns Road" [...] in 1930.|$|R
25|$|Continuing west, {{the route}} would have crossed Penge Road (A213) and the railway line to Norwood Junction. Next, {{it would have}} passed across a {{residential}} section of South Norwood. Here <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> not aligned to afford an easy route for a motorway and demolitions would have been required to provide a passage for it to reach Whitehorse Lane where it would have turned south-west again to follow the road for a short distance before turning west again just north of Selhurst Park stadium.|$|E
25|$|The Schnellweg (en: expressway) system, {{a number}} of Bundesstraße roads, forms a {{structure}} loosely resembling a large ring road together with A2 and A7. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> B 3, B 6 and Bundesstraße 65|B 65, called Westschnellweg (B6 on the northern part, B3 on the southern part), Messeschnellweg (B3, becomes A37 near Burgdorf, crosses A2, becomes B3 again, changes to B6 at Seelhorster Kreuz, then passes the Hanover fairground as B6 and becomes A37 again before merging into A7) and Südschnellweg (starts out as B65, becomes B3/B6/B65 upon crossing Westschnellweg, then becomes B65 again at Seelhorster Kreuz).|$|E
25|$|The Capital Township {{formed from}} Springfield Township on July 1, 1877, and was {{established}} and {{named by the}} Sangamon County Board on March 6, 1878, {{and the limits of}} the township and City of Springfield were made co-extensive on February 17, 1892 to better serve the people. There are three functions of this township: assessing property, collection first property tax payment, and assisting residents that live in the township. One thing that makes the Capital township unique is that the township never has to raise taxes for road work, since <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> maintained by the Springfield Department of Public Works.|$|E
50|$|In peak periods, {{parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>are</b> clogged with traffic, and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> a {{reference}} point on Perth radio traffic reports.|$|R
50|$|A {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> opened to traffic in 1970 and <b>the</b> entire <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> originally built by Japan Highway Public Corporation and management {{was transferred to}} Aichi Prefectural Road Public Corporation in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed limit}} {{for most of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> length <b>is</b> 90 km/h. It's a dual {{carriageway}} south of Šiauliai. The alternative name for <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> Via Hanzeatica as <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> an important transportation corridor between cities of the Hanseatic League.|$|R
25|$|A {{very small}} portion of the roads in Isfana are covered with asphalt. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> not well {{maintained}} and require major rehabilitation. Isfana is connected with other settlements in Kyrgyzstan through highways. The road that connects Isfana with Batken and Osh was not maintained after Kyrgyzstan became independent in the early 1990s. The country has received funding from the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Asian Development Bank to rehabilitate the road that connects Isfana with Batken and Osh. The distance from Isfana to the capital Bishkek is 960km and driving non-stop from Isfana to the capital takes about 20 hours.|$|E
25|$|The general {{military}} {{character of}} the country is that of extreme difficulty. Immediately {{at the front of the}} hills the plain is covered with the Great Saul Forest, for an average width of ten or twelve miles; the masses of the mountains are immense, their sides steep, and covered with impenetrable jungle. The trenches in these ridges are generally water-courses, and rather chasms or gulfs than any thing that deserves the name of a valley. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> very insecure, and invariably pathways over mountains, or the beds of rivers, the usual means of transport throughout the country being by hill porters. Notwithstanding this general description, spaces comparatively open and hollow, and elevated tracts of tolerably level land, are to be met with, but so completely detached as to contribute but little to facilitate intercourse.|$|E
25|$|The race is {{actually}} {{divided into three}} courses of varying difficulty: the Sellaronda course, the Middle course and the Maratona course. All riders start at 6:30am {{in the village of}} La Ila and complete the four pass Sellaronda course first. After completing the Sellaronda course riders can either choose to finish the race or proceed directly onwards with the Middle course. As the Maratona course is an extension of the preceding shorter Middle course, riders wishing to tackle the full Maratona dles Dolomites have to proceed with the Middle course. All three courses lead the riders through the Dolomite mountains around the Sella Group and over roads, where legendary rides by great champions of the Giro d'Italia have taken place. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> lined {{with tens of thousands of}} cheering spectators and the entire event is broadcast live on Italian national broadcaster RAI.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Douglas Arterial <b>Road</b> <b>is</b> a four-lane {{motorway}} {{located in}} Townsville, Queensland. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> commonly known by locals as either <b>the</b> Ring <b>Road</b> (which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> name the project goes under) or the Douglas Motorway. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{first stage of}} <b>the</b> Townsville Ring <b>Road</b> which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> future National Highway route through Townsville.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} Lilian Baylis (1874-1937), a {{theatrical}} producer and manager, who managed the Old Vic Theatre. Previously, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> called Oakley Street, since when {{the route of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> has <b>been</b> moved at its northern end to merge with Lower Marsh.|$|R
50|$|D33 connects Šibenik to Drniš and Knin. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> has {{junctions}} {{to major}} state roads, namely D8 in Šibenik, connecting to Biograd na Moru and Trogir, and D1 state road in Knin, {{which in turn}} connects to Sinj {{to the south and}} to Gračac to the north. The southern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> found in Vidici interchange near Šibenik. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> also connected to A1 motorway in Šibenik interchange. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> 73.3 km long. The northern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> at Strmica border crossing to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> proceeds to Drvar.|$|R
25|$|Sinn {{returned}} to China in 1935 to the Japanese {{occupation of the}} northeastern {{part of the country}} (known then as Manchuria). Using his music as a weapon to protest the occupation, he took part in patriotic activities. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), he wrote vocal works that encouraged the people to fight the Japanese invaders, including Saving the Nation, Non-Resistance the Only Fear, Song of Guerrillas, <b>The</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>Are</b> Opened by Us, The Vast Siberia, Children of the Motherland, Go to the Homefront of the Enemy, and On the Taihang Mountains, among others. He worked for film studios before going to the Communist headquarters in Yan'an, where he became dean of the Music Department at Lu Xun Institute of Arts in 1938. It is at this time that he composed the famous Yellow River Cantata and the Production Cantata.|$|E
25|$|San Diego {{has a major}} {{network of}} roads, {{predominantly}} free Highways with several toll roads, and Interstates. Interstate 5 runs south from the Canadian-border city of Vancouver and terminates at the San Ysidro International border where it becomes Federal Highway 1. Another major freeway is Interstate 8 that runs west from the Arizona Sun Corridor at Casa Grande, Arizona and terminates at Ocean Beach in San Diego. The roadway system in Tijuana is very low end compared {{to the quality of}} streets in the United States. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> in desperate need of repair with many newly constructed off ramps being set up in an impractical method often requiring sharp and hard turns. When it comes to long distance travel through Baja California, many people use the toll roads that are well maintained and are at a standard comparable to that of U.S. roads.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{road network}} is {{generally}} well designed. An efficient system of highways, flyovers, ringroads and underpasses serve the city, {{and allow for}} the transport of goods and vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> not always well-maintained however, and often have incorrect, poorly visible or no road markings, as well as potholes in some roads and inner-city streets. In recent years, a rapid increase in car ownership has meant that traffic jams, lack of parking spaces and overcrowding are also not uncommon, especially on smaller streets. Road accidents {{are also on the}} rise because of the increase in vehicles and the subsequent lax in attention given by authorities to dangerous driving. In a rare RTA conflict health study, road traffic accidents were studied during the period of the 2011 armed conflict, in which Benghazi was a focal point of events. It was found that while the number of road traffic accidents had decreased during the period of the war, the morbidity and mortality of the injured had increased significantly.|$|E
50|$|North of its {{crossing}} point with Highway 7, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> known as Upper Dwyer Hill Road. South of its junction with Kinburn Sideroad, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> numbered as Ottawa Road #3. In total, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> about 70 km long, edging out both the Queensway and Bank Street {{for the title}} of longest <b>road</b> in <b>the</b> city.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first part}} of the E35 where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{concurrent}} with <b>the</b> A10 was opened on December 6th 1989. The {{first part of}} the E35 where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> concurrent with <b>the</b> A2 was opened in May 1938. The {{first part of the}} E35 where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> concurrent with <b>the</b> A12 was opened on November 25th 1939.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{vital for}} {{servicing}} communities on the Dampier Peninsula {{and is also}} a popular tourist attraction. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> maintained by <b>the</b> Shire of Broome.|$|R
