40|$|Abstract　In {{various kinds}} of {{electronic}} circuits, transformers are practically utilized, which have been designed or analysed mainly with lumped constant circuit theory. 　In very high speed pulse circuits, however, travelling time within transformer becomes significant. 　Thus the lumped constant theory is no longer adequate for analysis, and transformers must be considered as distributed constant circuits. In some books, a few descriptions can be found about transmission-line pulse transformers. However, those <b>turn</b> <b>ratio</b> is limited to 1 : 1 and those discussions are rather quantative. 　This paper presents a distributed constant circuit theory for transformer of arbitrary <b>turn</b> <b>ratio</b> n: 1, and evaluates the pulse rise-time responses more accurately and regorously than in a lumped constant circuit theory. 　　変成器は種々の電子回路において実用されているが，その設計および解析は主として集中定数回路理諭によってなされている。しかし，ひじょうに高速のパルス回路においては変成器内部の伝搬時問が重要になり，集中定数論はもはや成立しなくなるので分布定数諭で考えなければならなくなる。伝送線路形パルス変成器に関する文献はわづかであり，しかも巻線１：１の場合に限られており，その説明も定性的である。　　本論文は任意の巻線比ｎ：１の変成器に関する分布定数論を提供するものであって，集中定数論におけるよりもさらに正確で厳密なパルス応答の立上り特性を求めている...|$|E

The zero-voltage and zero-current switches (ZVZCS) for all switches are achieved over wide load range without affecting effective duty cycle. A clamp circuit not only clamps the surge voltage but also reduces the circulation current flowing in the high-current side, resulting in significantly reduced conduction losses. The duty cycle loss can also be compensated by operation of the clamp switch. The detailed design and operating principles are described and simulated using Pspice.
