40|$|When can a {{litigant}} assert someone else’s {{rights in}} federal court? The courts currently purport {{to adhere to}} a “prudential” justiciability rule barring such “thirdparty standing. ” But the Supreme Court has devised exceptions—jus tertii standing and First Amendment overbreadth—under which courts can ignore that rule. The Court has never explained the source of that remarkable judicial power to choose what rights litigants can assert. The doctrine of third-party standing is, in short, an undertheorized muddle. Thankfully, the Court suggested in its 2014 decision in Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., that it might soon try to bring order to its third-party standing jurisprudence. Drawing on Lexmark, this Article offers a fresh and timely account of thirdparty standing doctrine. It argues that the rule barring assertion of third-party rights {{has nothing to do}} with prudence and justiciability. Rather, it is best understood as going to the merits of the parties’ dispute, in that it concerns the substantive issue of whether a litigant can establish the grounds of a claim or defense. As a merits doctrine, the rule barring assertion of third-party rights appropriately requires courts to defer to limits placed on substantive rights by the lawmakers who created them. That conclusion raises serious questions concerning the viability of the jus tertii standing and overbreadth exceptions. This Article argues that jus tertii standing doctrine can survive, but only if cabined to situations in which recognition of an implied right belonging to the litigant is necessary to effectuate the design of the lawmakers who created the asserted <b>third-party</b> <b>right.</b> The overbreadth doctrine, however, has no place in a world in which courts must defer to lawmakers concerning the scope of substantive rights. But the long-dormant doctrine of jus tertii inseverability, which is grounded in lawmakers’ intentions, could fill some of the void left by the overbreadth doctrine’s demise...|$|E

40|$|The privity {{rule has}} {{give rise to}} many criticisms due to its {{injustice}} and inconvenience. In realizing this situation, various means or mechanisms were available to circumvent the privity rule including tort of negligence. Nevertheless, it may have its own weakness that is; {{it is difficult to}} establish a duty of care owed by promisor in recovering of pure economic loss claim. Hence, this dissertation intends to examine the claims by third parties in tort and look into their problems in imposing a duty of care owed by the promisors. By adopting the judicial decision from various cases, the scope of this research is confined with the third parties claim namely contractors or builders, owners or subsequent owners and purchasers or subsequent purchasers. The findings revealed that of 21 cases, only five managed to prove a duty of care owed by professional man, whereas the rest proved otherwise. To recap, the recovery of claims by third parties remains difficult and we might concluded that tort of negligence provides uncertainties in protecting their rights. Indirectly, it was not an effective mechanism to circumvent the privity rule?s problems as yet it was inadequately protecting <b>third-party's</b> <b>rights</b> in certain situations.

40|$|With {{the rise}} of the risk society came the {{regulatory}} state. Increasingly, governments are turning to law for achieving their policy goals, also in the field of urban and environmental planning. Legal rules do not only reduce the risks for society but also for policy makers, since those standardise decision-making, hence reducing discretion and chances of personal failure. The result is an increasingly complex legal system and a juridification of planning in practice. While planning has become more legalistic, in the Netherlands we see {{at the same time that}} the access to the legal system is being reduced. How can this seeming contradiction be explained? In this paper we explore, conceptually, the relationship between the risk society and the regulatory state. Then we turn to the empirical body of the paper, in which we observe that Dutch government is responding to the negative consequences of the regulatory state by taking major decisions with regard to the entrance to the legal system. <b>Third-party</b> <b>rights</b> are under scrutiny. We conclude our paper by arguing that government has chosen the easiest way out of the juridification of planning. Rather than a fundamental contemplation on the relationship between law and society, government pragmatically chooses to limit access to the legal system. This leads to a paradoxical situation where our (environmental) quality requirements for a land-use plan are becoming greater, while the means available to citizens for ensuring that these requirements are met move in the opposite direction...|$|R

APPROACH We conducted a survey on nearly 300 print and electronic dissertations in social sciences and humanities from the University of Lille 3 (France), submitted between 1987 and 2013. FINDINGS After a short overview on open access to electronic dissertations, on small data in dissertations, on data management and curation, and on the challenge for academic libraries, the paper {{presents the results of}} the survey. Special attention is paid {{to the size of the}} research data in appendices, to their presentation and link to the text, to their sources and typology, and to their potential for further research. Methodological shortfalls of the study are discussed, and barriers to open data (metadata, structure, format) and legal questions (privacy, <b>third-party</b> <b>rights)</b> are addressed. The conclusion provides some recommendations for the assistance and advice to PhD students in managing and depositing their research data. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Our survey can be helpful for academic libraries to develop assistance and advice for PhD students in managing their research data in collaboration with the research structures and the graduate schools.

40|$|It {{is likely}} that Grotius was {{influenced}} by knowledge {{of the practice of}} the courts in the Netherlands in his easy recognition of <b>third-party</b> <b>rights.</b> This may perhaps be seen in his Inleidinge tot de Hollandsche Rechts-geleerdheid, where the departure from the firm Roman rules is justified in terms of a preference for billickheid over scherpheid van rechten, reflecting Martinus Gosia’s favouring of aequitas over strictum ius and also the aequitas canonica used to ground a third party’s claim in the Grand Conseil of Malines in the sixteenth century. By contrast, the treatment of the subject in the De Iure Belli ac Pacis was strongly influenced by the analysis of Covarruvias, whose Relectio on the Sext 1. 18. 2 was cited by Grotius in the margin of his text. The normal rule, as for Covarruvias, was that a contract was created by the acceptance of a promise, and it did not matter whether the acceptor was present or absent. Against this background Grotius dealt with three distinct situations raising the controversial issue of <b>third-party</b> <b>rights.</b> First was the simple pactum in favorem tertii, where one person accepted a promise in his own name for the benefit of another. Roman law would have said that the acceptor obtained a right only if he had an interest, but Grotius stated that this was no longer the law. The acceptor therefore received a right which he could transfer to the third-party beneficiary, provided that he also accepted it. In the meantime, the promisor could not unilaterally revoke the promise, though the acceptor (in whom the right was vested) had the power to release it. Second was the case of direct representation, where a person had been mandated to accept a promise in another’s name. Roman law had restricted direct representation to slaves and others in the potestas of the beneficiary, but, said Grotius, this restriction no longer existed and anybody might be authorised by another to accept a promise on their behalf. In such a case the right vested immediately in the person on whose behalf the promise had been accepted. Third was the situation where acceptance was made {{in the name of the}} beneficiary, but by a person acting without authorisation. No right vested in the beneficiary until he had himself accepted the promise, but neither, it seems did any right vest in the acceptor. None the less, until the beneficiary had accepted or rejected the promise the promisor had no power to revoke the promise, nor did the acceptor have any power to release it – he had not received the promise for his own benefit or on his own behalf, and it would be contrary to good faith were it to be released. Alongside this, Grotius dealt with the donatio sub modo, applying the same principle as he had identified as lying behind the pactum in favorem tertii and saying that a burden placed on the donee of a gift in favour of a third party could be revoked so long as it had not been accepted by the third party. status: publishe...|$|R
