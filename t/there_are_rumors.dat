5|$|The {{etymology}} of Buffalo Creek is unknown. No buffalo {{have ever}} been definitely observed on the creek, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> about old buffalo wallows. Buffalo Township, Buffalo Valley, and Buffalo Mountain are all named after the creek. Historical industries in the watershed included mills and timbering, but livestock raising and agriculture are {{more common in the}} 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Narimantas was {{the second}} son of Gediminas. He was baptized as Gleb {{and went on to}} rule Pinsk, Polotsk, and – as his {{patrimony}} by invitation of Novgorod's nobles – Ladoga, Oreshek and Korela. He initiated a tradition of Lithuanian mercenary service north of Novgorod on the Swedish border that lasted until Novgorod's fall to Moscow in 1477 and helped keep Moscow at bay. In 1345 Narimantas became the strongest supporter of his deposed brother Jaunutis and went to Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, to ask for support against Algirdas and Kęstutis. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> that Narimantas married a Tatar princess, but they lack credibility. After a few years the brothers reconciled, and it is believed that Narimantas led the Battle of Strėva in the name of Algirdas and died there. He left behind three to five sons who founded Russian princely families, including Kurakin and Galitzine.|$|E

25|$|Men largely {{avoid the}} demonstrations {{and run away}} from the protests to avoid the women acting in {{offensive}} ways. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> that seeing the women can drain a person’s vital force and this keeps men from intervening in the practice at all.

500|$|Prior to the finals, the Lithuanian {{media outlet}} 15 min {{released}} an undercover video suggesting that representatives from Azerbaijan {{were trying to}} bribe Lithuanians for votes in the tele/smsvoting. The video detailed the plan, which involved recruiting groups of 10 people each, and supplying them with SIM cards so they could vote multiple times during the voting window in the tele/smsvoting. It was also suggested that similar activity was taking place {{in a total of}} 15 countries including Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Croatia and Switzerland. In response to the allegations, Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand reaffirmed the contest's commitment to a [...] "fair and transparent result." [...] He stated that while Eurovision organisers were looking into the case, they [...] " [...] that the intention of these individuals have not yet been clarified, and nor has a link been established between the individuals in the video and the Azeri delegation, the Azeri act or the Azeri EBU member Ictimai TV." [...] He added that, since 1998, when he was first involved with the contest, [...] "every year <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> about irregularities in the voting".|$|E
2500|$|However, some {{symbols and}} {{practices}} {{associated with the}} earlier forms of local action are continued in Takembeng. The women primarily wear old clothes (although some wear deliberately clashing bright colors) and many dress with plants which are believed to provide protective powers, prominently the nkung plant. Men and uninvolved women deliberately avoid the Takembeng women and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> that men become ill or die if they observe the Takembeng women naked. [...] Rumors are widely circulated that soldiers and government forces which do not adhere to these conventions either die or lose their wives. As a result, soldiers and security forces change tactics when engaging with Takembeng women.|$|E

Coincidentally, he won the title from Hideo Otake, who had taken Cho's Gosei the same year. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> that said that Cho vowed that after moving to Japan, he wouldn't return to South Korea until the Meijin title was his. He made his first trip home on the New Year holiday in 1980 {{at the age of}} 24. He was a {{national}} hero in Korea now. He even played two games with Korean champion Cho Hunhyun. One was a quick Go game, while the other spanned an almost 18 hours over two days. Cho Chikun won both games. After losing both games, Cho Hunhyun vowed that he'd never lose to Cho Chikun again.|$|E

2500|$|Rumours {{rising in}} 2012 stating that sambo will be {{included}} as a demonstration sport in the 2016 Olympics are therefore not supported by any facts, and thus sambo {{is still a very}} long way from maturing into an Olympic sport, notwithstanding the effort that is being put into the matter. Indeed, given the intention of the Olympic Committee to remove classic wrestling from the Olympic roster, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> that sambo is highly unlikely to ever make it to the Olympics. However, sambo has been included in the 27th Annual Summer Universiade {{for the first time in}} history. FIAS submitted an application to the International Olympic Committee IOC to consider sambo for the 2020 Games and has devoted 2010-2013 to creating a sambo commission in the International Sports Press Association (AIPS). [...] This close relationship is reestablishing the global popularity and media emphasis on sambo.|$|E
6000|$|Lomaque {{looked toward}} the {{tribunal}} door, and lowered his voice to a fainter whisper before he continued, [...] "In that time Robespierre's own head may fall into the sack! France is beginning to sicken under the Reign of Terror. Frenchmen of the Moderate faction, who have lain hidden for months in cellars and lofts, are beginning to steal out and deliberate by twos and threes together, under cover of the night. Robespierre has not ventured for weeks past to face the Convention Committee. He only speaks among his own friends at the Jacobins. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> of a terrible discovery made by Carnot, of a desperate resolution taken by Tallien. Men watching behind the scenes see that {{the last days of}} the Terror are at hand. If Robespierre is beaten in the approaching struggle, you are saved--for the new reign must be a Reign of Mercy. If he conquers, I have only put off the date of your death and your sister's, and have laid my own neck under the axe. Those are your chances--this is all I can do." ...|$|E
60|$|There are churches on {{each side}} of Fifth Avenue--perhaps five or six within sight at one time--which add much to the beauty of the street. They are well built, and in fairly good taste. These, added to the general {{well-being}} and splendid comfort of the place, give it an effect better than the architecture of the individual houses would seem to warrant. I own that I have enjoyed the vista as I have walked up and down Fifth Avenue, and have felt that the city had a right to be proud of its wealth. But the greatness and beauty and glory of wealth have on such occasions been all in all with me. I know no great man, no celebrated statesman, no philanthropist of peculiar note who has lived in Fifth Avenue. That gentleman on the right made a million of dollars by inventing a shirt collar; this one on the left electrified the world by a lotion; as to the gentleman at the corner there, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> about him and the Cuban slave trade but my informant by no means knows that they are true. Such are the aristocracy of Fifth Avenue, I can only say that, if I could make a million dollars by a lotion, I should certainly be right to live in such a house as one of those.|$|E

6000|$|Schmidt and he, after patient trial, {{were both}} of them {{beheaded}} and quartered,--in pasteboard effigy,--in the Salt Ring (Great Square) of Breslau, May, 1762:--in pasteboard, Friedrich liked it {{better than the other}} way. [...] "MEINETWEGEN," [...] wrote he, sanctioning the execution, [...] "For aught I care; the Portraits will likely be as worthless as the Originals." [...] Rittmeister Rabenau had got off with a few days' arrest, and the remark, [...] "ER IST EIN DUMMER TEUFEL (You are a stupid devil)!" [...] Warkotsch's Estates, all and sundry, deducting the Baroness's jointure, which was punctually paid her, were confiscated to the King,--and by him were made over to the Schools of Breslau and Glogau, which, I doubt not, enjoy them to this day. Reverend Gerlach in Schonbrunn, Kappel and Kappel's Bursch, were all attended to, and properly rewarded, though <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>rumors</b> to the contrary. Hussar-Colonel Wallis got no public promotion, though it is not doubted the Head People had been well cognizant of his ingenious intentions. Official Vienna, like mankind in general, shuddered to own him; the great Counts Wallis at Vienna published in the Newspapers, [...] "Our House has no connection with that gentleman;"--and, in fact, he was of Irish breed, it seems, the name of him WallISCH (or Walsh), if one cared. Warkotsch died at Raab (THIS side the farthest corner of Turkey), in 1769: his poor Baroness had vanished from Silesia five years before, probably to join him. He had some pension or aliment from the Austrian Court; small or not so small is a disputed point.|$|E
