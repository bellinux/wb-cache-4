40|$|Finding the {{solution}} to some crop diseases is like solving a jigsaw puzzle. The solution has many pieces, and fitting them together can be a challenge. Citrus greening, also known as “Huanglongbing” (HLB), is just such a disease. HLB is costing Florida citrus growers millions of dollars each year in lost revenue from unproductive trees. It continues to spread and {{is the most serious}} threat to the U. S. citrus industry in history. The disease was recently confirmed in commercial groves in Texas and in a homeowner’s yard in California. Both states are important citrus producers, and if HLB spreads in these states the way it has throughout Florida, the economic consequences will be devastating. The Agricultural Research Service is working aggressively with university and private-industry partners to help mitigate the threat posed by HLB. The goal is to keep the U. S. citrus industry sustainable and profitable and to preserve the nutritious and delicious array of fruits and juices that people have come to treasure. Solving the HLB puzzle depends on developing a deeper understanding of its complicated nature. HLB is presumed to be caused by nonculturable, Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. So far, the species of bacteria associated with HLB in the United States is Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, which is transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, an insect. The puzzle pieces are questions that constitute gaps in our knowledge: Do some types of citrus have a natural resistance that can be bred into commercial varieties? How can psyllid populations be effectively suppressed? Are there molecular <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>tapping</b> into the genomes of the psyllid or bacterium in ways that would “disarm” them? How do we replant young, healthy trees and keep them free of HLB? Is there a cure for infected trees...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{is one of}} {{the most}} central driving forces in today’s economy. Thus, {{organizations}} need to recognize knowledge as a valuable resource and develop <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>tapping</b> into the collective intelligence and create a greater organizational knowledge base. However, to stay competitive on today’s global marketplace actors must collaborate and share knowledge across organizational boundaries. Companies must therefore consider barriers to knowledge sharing. While the importance of knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries has been highlighted, researchers emphasize that an interesting factor to examine in further research is the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to mitigate barriers for knowledge sharing. The purpose with this study is to explore in what way ICT may be used to mitigate barriers for knowledge sharing between individual forest landowners and forest companies within the Swedish forest industry. The study is divided into two research questions: (1) What critical barriers for knowledge sharing exist between individual forest landowners and forest companies within the Swedish forest industry? and (2) In what way may ICT be used to mitigate barriers for knowledge sharing between individual forest landowners and forest companies. To answer the research questions, a multiple case study consisting of 23 interviews was conducted with forest consultants, forest landowners and forest companies. In addition to prior literature regarding individual, organizational and technology barriers, our study emphasize that firms also must consider inter-organizational barriers to knowledge sharing. By mapping the most critical barriers according to individual forest landowners and forest companies, our study assess in what way ICT may be used to mitigate these barriers. In addition, the study contributes with an emerging framework for managers to visualize and prioritize barriers to mitigate, which is useful when planning and evaluating knowledge management activities...|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the hyacinth macaw diet is nuts, from native palms, such as acuri and bocaiuva palms. They have very strong beaks for eating the kernels of hard nuts and seeds. Their strong beaks are even able to crack coconuts, the large brazil nut pods, and macadamia nuts. The birds also boast dry, smooth tongues with a bone inside them that makes them an effective <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>tapping</b> into fruits. The acuri nut is so hard, the parrots cannot feed on it until it has passed through the digestive system of cattle. In addition, they eat fruits and other vegetable matter. The hyacinth macaw generally eats fruits, nuts, nectar, and various kinds of seeds. Also, they travel for the ripest of foods over a vast area.|$|R
40|$|The CO 2 Performance Ladder is a {{certifiable}} {{scheme for}} energy management and carbon reporting {{that is used}} by several Dutch public authorities as a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> green public procurement. Achieving certification gives companies a competitive advantage in awarding contracts. This paper aims at evaluating the effectiveness of implementing the CO 2 Performance Ladder as a management system for improving energy efficiency and CO 2 emission reduction in the construction industry sector which is the main target group of the scheme. The implementation of the CO 2 Performance ladder will be evaluated by using methods for evaluating policy theory, programme process evaluation and impact assessment. Data were mainly collected through document research (e. g. energy management plans, monitoring reports and CO 2 footprints) and interviews with various representatives of firms and other stakeholders. The research results show that 1) the CO 2 Performance Ladder contributes significantly in improving energy management practices in the involved firms; 2) that additional energy saving measures were taken because of the CO 2 Performance ladder and 3) that the majority firms show sufficient progress towards reaching their CO 2 emission reduction goals. This research concludes that {{at least in the short}} term the CO 2 PL is an effective <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>tapping</b> the energy efficiency potential in firms in the construction industry sector...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} to comprehend rights under mental health legislation is an untapped {{area of research}} that deserves attention. For those committed to hospital under British Columbia 2 ̆ 7 s Mental Health Act, youths under 16 years are provided fewer procedural protections than those over 16 years. However, both are told their rights under that Act. Research relating to adolescents 2 ̆ 7 understanding of rights is presented, primarily from the juvenile justice context. Generally, by middle adolescence, most youths understand their rights to counsel and silence as well as adults. In general, most adolescents do not appreciate the full consequences of waiving their rights, and hence do not perform up to the legal standard under criminal law. The {{development of a new}} research program is suggested by the application of rights comprehension research to the mental health arena. The primary focus of the present project is {{the development of a new}} <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>tapping</b> comprehension of rights under the Mental Health Act: The Mental Health Rights Comprehension Test (MHRCT). The MHRCT was administered to 120 healthy adolescents and its psychometric properties and structure were investigated. While the MHRCT shows modest structural reliability and convergent validity, it demonstrates excellent interrater and test-retest reliability. Evidence for the measure 2 ̆ 7 s construct validity and unidimensionality were examined with factor analysis. Exploratory factor analysis did not result in a rejection of the null hypothesis of unidimensionality. Therefore, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed in an effort to determine what model of unidimensionality best fit the data. A fit assessment determined that the MHRCT fits the parallel model of unidimensionality, indicating it is a homogenous measure of rights comprehension. This project was an important first step in a research program that aims to quantify rights comprehension in a population whose rights have been the focus of debate and shifting policy...|$|R

40|$|Background: Traditionally, impulsivity {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a stable trait. However, a series of longitudinal and behavioural laboratory studies has found that impulsivity can fluctuate within individuals, suggesting {{that it has a}} state as well as a trait manifestation. Whilst existing impulsivity questionnaires tap the former, there is no self-report instrument to assess recent fluctuations in impulsivity. Research aims and design. The present study set out to develop and undertake preliminary validation of a measure of 'recent' impulsivity, focusing in particular on Rash Impulsivity. Part of the construct validation of the resulting Recent Rash Impulsivity Scale (RRIS) entailed examining its association with recent alcohol intake, since there are well-documented reciprocal relationships between alcohol consumption and inhibitory control. In developing the RRIS, items from existing trait impulsivity questionnaires were converted into a 'previous two weeks' format. The pilot RRIS was then administered, along with a parallel trait version (Trait Rash Impulsivity Scale; TRIS) and a well-established trait impulsivity measure (the BIS- 11; Patton, Stanford & Barratt, 1995), to two cohorts of first-year undergraduates aged 17 to 25 (N = 240), on two occasions one month apart. Information about habitual and recent alcohol intake was also gathered. Results: Factor analyses on both the RRIS and TRIS identified two factors: 'Cognitive Impulsivity' (CogImp) and 'Motor Impulsivity' (MotImp). Consistent with the RRIS being sensitive to fluctuations in impulsivity, it was found that, as predicted: i) the RRIS was somewhat less strongly correlated than the TRIS with an established trait measure (the BIS- 11; Patton et al., 1995); ii) the test-retest stability of 'Total' scores (CogImp and MotImp) was weaker for the RRIS than the TRIS; iii) there was evidence that the RRIS MotImp and Total scales were more strongly predicted by recent alcohol intake than were their trait equivalents; and iv) the RRIS CogImp and Total scales correlated more strongly with their trait equivalents in participants whose alcohol consumption had remained stable recently (relative to their habitual intake), compared to those whose consumption had recently changed. Conclusions: These data suggest that transient changes in impulsivity can be assessed via self-report, and that the RRIS is sensitive to recent changes in alcohol intake. Subject to a more intensive and detailed validation, it is thus promising as a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>tapping</b> and characterising fluctuations in behavioural control and for exploring a range of factors to which this might be associated...|$|R
