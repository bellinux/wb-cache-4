2500|$|The {{first group}} of Directives create a range of {{individual}} rights in EU employment relationships. The Employment Information Directive 1991 requires that every employee (however defined by member state law) {{has the right to}} a written statement of their employment contract. While there is no wage regulation, the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003 requires that pension benefits are protected through a national insurance fund, that information is provided to beneficiaries, and minimum standards of governance are observed. Most member states go far beyond these requirements, particularly by requiring a vote for employees in who manages their money. Reflecting basic standards in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ILO Conventions, the Working Time Directive 2003 requires a minimum of 4 weeks (totalling 28 days) paid holidays each year, a minimum of 20-minute paid rest breaks for 6-hour work shifts, limits on night work or time spent on dangerous work, and a maximum 48-hour working week unless a worker individually consents. The Parental Leave Directive 2010 creates a bare minimum of 4 months of unpaid leave for parents (mothers, fathers, or legal guardians) to care for children before they turn 8 years old, and the Pregnant Workers Directive 1992 creates a right for mothers to a minimum of 14 weeks' paid leave to care for children. Finally, the Safety and Health at Work Directive 1989 requires basic requirements to prevent and insure against workplace risks, with employee consultation and participation, and this is complemented by specialised Directives, ranging from work equipment to dangerous industries. In almost all cases, all member states go significantly beyond this minimum. The objective of transnational regulation is therefore to progressively raise the minimum floor in line with economic development. Second, equality was affirmed by the Court of Justice in Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG to be a general principle of EU law. Further to this, the Part-time Work Directive 1997, Fixed-term Work Directive 1999 and <b>Temporary</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>Work</b> Directive 2008 generally require that people who do not have ordinary full-time, permanent contracts are treated no less favourably than their colleagues. However, the scope of the protected worker is left to member state law, and the TAWD 2008 only applies to [...] "basic working conditions" [...] (mostly pay, working hours and participation rights) and enabled member states to have a qualifying period. The Race Equality Directive 2000, Equality Framework Directive 2000 and Equal Treatment Directive 2006 prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief, age, race and gender. As well as [...] "direct discrimination", there is a prohibition on [...] "indirect discrimination" [...] where employers apply a neutral rule to everybody, but this has a disproportionate impact on the protected group. The rules are not consolidated, and on gender pay potentially limited in not enabling a hypothetical comparator, or comparators in outsourced business. Equality rules do not yet apply to child care rights, which only give women substantial time off, and consequently hinder equality in men and women caring for children after birth, and pursuing their careers.|$|E

With dynamic business environment and flexible <b>work</b> arrangements, <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employments are also emerged in Sri Lanka. <b>Temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers are dual committed employees. However, with this dual commitment, organizations face issues in achieving <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers’ commitment due to low attention of <b>agencies</b> to <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers. Even though the Client organization provides due attention to <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers, they fail to receive due commitment {{due to the lack}} of attention from <b>agency</b> to <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers. This study was conducted to identify the agency related factors affecting <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers’ commitment. This was carried out as a cross sectional field study with a sample of 93 workers from <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>works</b> in the ABC (pvt) ltd. 93 <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers were selected as sample. Data were collected via a standard questionnaire that met accepted standards of validity and reliability. Descriptive statistics, Simple ranking, Factor analysis, ANOVA and Independent Sample T-Test technique were performed to analyze data. No of Temporary workers to supervisor (temp to consult ratio) is the most influencing factor of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers’ commitment in agency context. Job satisfaction, agency support, side bets, interactional justice, lack of alternative employments, procedural justice, distributive justice, reciprocity norm acceptance, socialization, breach of psychological contract, lack of skill transferability are the other factors, which are ordered from most influencing factor to less affecting factor to workers’ organizational commitment. Findings revealed that eleven out of thirteen factors are job related factors, other two are organization related and person related factors. Most client companies provide their attention, while agencies fail to provide their due attention. It shows, it is useless to expect <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers’ commitment without providing due attention from agency.

40|$|Objectives The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to explore the motivation and commitment of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employees compared to regularly employed workers. The thesis also examined if and how the national culture of the <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employees influences their motivation and commitment. Summary The primary research in this study was done through semi-structured interviews conducted with <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employees, <b>temporary</b> <b>work</b> <b>agencies</b> and client organizations. The interviews focused on the motivational factors of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employees as well as their work satisfaction and commitment to their place of employment. The agencies and client organizations were also asked about how the national culture of their employees affects their motivation. Conclusions This thesis concludes that overall the <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employees are quite motivated and committed to their job. However, more emphasis should still be put in the human resources management of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employees at the client organizations, to make the employees feel more welcome, appreciated and useful. The amount of support that the employees received from the client organization and the agency clearly correlate with how motivated and committed they are to said companies. According to the respondents, there was very little correlation between the national culture of the <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employees and their motivation and commitment to their place of employment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Temporary</b> <b>work</b> <b>agencies</b> use {{training}} as a recruitment and retention argument when qualified labor is scarce. However, short job assignments present a major obstacle for employers and employees to increase investment in training. As <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers are mainly low-qualified and often previously unemployed, paid work in combination with training should lead to more sustainable employment. Adjustments in labor market institutions could make the provision of training more attractive for both staffing <b>agencies</b> and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers...|$|R

However, recent public exposure of labour abuses has led to political demands to re-regulate employment, which are met by counter-claims that voluntary codes are adequate.

5000|$|... ==Purpose== As {{with several}} other EU {{directives}} {{in the area of}} employment and social policy, the political purpose of this directive is to set common minimum standards for <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>work</b> in the EU. The political goals this serves is to prevent [...] "unfair competition" [...] between different member states. Common minimum standards are preferred by politicians to prevent a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] where every country tries to deregulate to attract business, and, theoretically, all end up [...] "losing" [...] (at least the politicians and union leaders would lose power). The political goals are to ensure a higher standard of living and quality of life, consistent with the aims of the Treaty on European Union. [...] Critics contend that the policies increase labour market inefficiencies and ultimately raise unemployment levels and reduce business output, leading to lowered living standards for those not already securely seated in permanent positions in the labour market.|$|E
