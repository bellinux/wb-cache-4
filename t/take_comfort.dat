25|$|In the election, the Scottish National Party under Alex Salmond won an un-precedented {{majority}} of seats, winning 69 of the 129 seats available. The Conservative result was self-described as 'disappointing', {{as the party}} was reduced from 17 seats to 15. The party lost three of their six notionally held constituency seats, including former party leader David McLetchie in Edinburgh Pentlands and Jackson Carlaw in Eastwood, although both individuals were returned to parliament on the regional list. Whilst the Conservatives could <b>take</b> <b>comfort</b> {{in the knowledge that}} their losses were slight in comparison to those suffered by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, Annabel Goldie announced her resignation as party leader four days after the election.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{airing of}} the De Vries {{programme}} on Dutch television, Beth Twitty {{adhered to the}} position that the tapes represented the way events transpired and told the New York Post that she believed her daughter might still be alive if Van der Sloot had called for help. She contended that Van der Sloot had dumped Holloway's body, possibly alive, into the Caribbean. Twitty also alleged that the person Van der Sloot supposedly called that evening was his father, Paulus, who, according to Holloway, [...] "orchestrated what to do next." [...] She and Dave Holloway alleged that Van der Sloot was receiving [...] "special legal favors." [...] After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, [...] "I think that what I do <b>take</b> <b>comfort</b> in, his life is a living hell," [...] later adding, [...] "I'd be good with a Midnight Express prison anywhere for Joran." ...|$|E
500|$|While McKellen {{had made}} his sexual {{orientation}} known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, {{it was not until}} 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio. The context that prompted McKellen's decision– overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career– was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament. Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality [...] "... as a kind of pretended family relationship". McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay. McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin. In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking. He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [...] <b>take</b> <b>comfort</b> that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps {{it would be all right}} for other people to be as well, gay and straight. Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.|$|E

These SBNRs find their {{constant}} search for novel spiritual practices to be a byproduct of their [...] "unsatisfied curiosity", their desire for journey and change, as well as feelings of disappointment. Explorers are best understood as [...] "spiritual tourists" [...] who <b>take</b> <b>comfort</b> in the destination-less journey of their spirituality and have no intentions of ultimately committing to a spiritual home.|$|E

2500|$|During {{this time}} many Americans found it {{difficult}} to reconcile slavery with their interpretation of Christianity and the lofty sentiments that flowed from the Declaration of Independence. [...] A small antislavery movement, led by the Quakers, had some impact in the 1780's and by the late 1780's all of the states except for Georgia had placed some restrictions on their participation in slave trafficking. [...] Still, no serious national political movement against slavery developed, largely due to the overriding concern over achieving national unity. When the Constitutional Convention met, slavery was the one issue [...] "that left the least possibility of compromise, the one that would most pit morality against pragmatism. In the end, while many would <b>take</b> <b>comfort</b> {{in the fact that the}} word slavery never occurs in the Constitution, critics note that the three-fifths clause provided slaveholders with extra representatives in Congress, the requirement of the federal government to suppress domestic violence would dedicate national resources to defending against slave revolts, a twenty-year delay in banning the import of slaves allowed the South to fortify its labor needs, and the amendment process made the national abolition of slavery very unlikely in the foreseeable future.|$|E
