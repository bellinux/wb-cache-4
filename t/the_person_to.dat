The E license allows <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> own a gun for self-defense purpose and carry the concealed weapon. All guns need to be registered with the police in 10 working days after buying except for the D category.|$|E

5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using {{naltrexone}} or another opioid antagonists to treat alcoholism by having the person take the medication {{about an hour before}} they drink alcohol, and only then. The medication blocks the positive reinforcement effects of ethanol and hopefully allows <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> stop drinking or drink less.|$|E
5|$|Measurement of {{predictive}} visual tracking {{is being}} studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury. A head-mounted display unit with eye-tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern for <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> follow with their eyes. People without brain injury {{will be able}} to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those with mild traumatic brain injury cannot.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} {{imposed on}} {{a speech at}} Speakers' Corner were {{that it had to}} take place only between 7:00a.m. and 7:00p.m. on the date notified by <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> the police, had to be in any of Singapore's four official languages (English, Malay, Mandarin or Tamil) or any related dialects, and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited. The latter restriction was justified {{on the grounds that it}} would reduce noise pollution and prevent one speaker from drowning out another one, and that it also applied to Speakers' Corner in London.|$|E

5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> a higher level of nursing care, such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
5|$|Treating. Treating is {{the act of}} corruptly giving or providing, or paying {{in whole}} or part for, any food, drink, refreshment, cigarette, {{entertainment}} or other thing, or any money or ticket or other means to enable such things to be obtained, in order to corruptly influence a person to vote or refrain from voting, or to induce <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> attend an election meeting, or to reward him for having done so. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both, and the disqualifications referred to above.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E
5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard {{which led to a}} significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A few moments later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, Kippenberger {{was offered}} the {{position}} of Editor-in-Chief of New Zealand's largest-ever publishing project, the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45. The New Zealand government had made initial plans for a published record of New Zealand's involvement in the war as early as 1943. Kippenberger, well respected across all branches of New Zealand's services, was championed by New Zealand's prime minister, Peter Fraser, as <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> coordinate the project. The resulting series of books, covering campaign and unit histories as well as volumes on the New Zealand people at war, was {{to be published by}} the War History Branch at the Department of Internal Affairs. By 1946, his work with the Reception Group was largely complete and he returned to New Zealand to take up his new position. Initially contracted for seven years from 1 July 1946, he would be involved with the project {{for the rest of his}} life. In his capacity as Editor-in-Chief, he guided the planning and production of volumes dedicated to specific campaigns, units and the war effort in general.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960 Heffron {{provided}} his {{old friend}} H. V. Evatt a dignified exit from federal politics by nominating him to succeed Sir Kenneth Street as Chief Justice of New South Wales. His Attorney General Reg Downing, however, was horrified, having favoured the senior puisne justice Sir William Owen as the most suitable candidate while also realising that Evatt's worsening health would render him less than equal {{to the task of}} chief justice. Therefore, while Downing, as attorney general, would normally be <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> move the nomination of chief justice in cabinet, he refused to do so, leaving Heffron to do it himself. Heffron's motion to nominate Evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6. Downing's concerns would come to pass as Evatt indeed proved highly ineffective, often wracked by mental and physical ill-health, was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co-written for him, and resigning in 1962 after only two years as chief justice.|$|E
5|$|The process upon being branded is {{a painful}} {{experience}} for the person as the body would either accept the seal or reject it. Once one's body accepts the seal, they can assume its First Level where the seal spreads from its point of application across the user's body, increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process. When the seal is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the seal to engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness. The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E
