5|$|Berhtwald (died 731) was {{the ninth}} Archbishop of Canterbury in England. Documentary {{evidence}} names Berhtwald as abbot at Reculver before his election as archbishop.

5|$|Roe {{was rated}} as {{being one of}} Somerset better batsmen in their early years of {{first-class}} cricket, but his form in club cricket did not translate into good performances for the county. Between 1881 and 1882, Roe scored thirteen centuries, but none of those came in county cricket. In fact, {{it was not until}} 1884 that he made his first hundred in first-class cricket, scoring 132 against Hampshire. His work as a schoolmaster limited his availability for Somerset, and he only played three first-class matches for them in each of 1884 and 1885. After the 1885 season, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches.|$|E

Its most radical wing would declare itself republican in 1870—an ominous signal to the monarchy.|$|E

This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee.

Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, and that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights.

In January 1994, bin Laden was personally presented with the team's surveillance reports, and he and his senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, al-Qaeda prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, bin Laden continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. authorities had investigated al-Qaeda activities in Nairobi, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> detected any warnings of imminent attacks.|$|E
5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, even though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority {{was thought to be}} the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E

60|$|And it is yet {{far more}} evident; for that those that {{approach}} this throne of grace, {{they must do}} it through believing; for, saith the apostle, 'How shall they call on him in whom <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> believed,' of whom <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> heard, and in whom <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> believed? for to that purpose runs the text (Rom 10:14). 'How then shall they call on him in whom <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> believed,' antecedent to their calling on him, 'and how shall they believe in him of whom <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> heard' first? So then hearing goes before believing, and believing before calling upon God, as {{he sits on the}} throne of grace. Now, believing is to be according {{to the sound of the}} beginning of the gospel, which presenteth us, not first with Christ as ascended, but as Christ dying, buried, and risen.[16] 'For I delivered unto you first of all, that which I also received; how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures' (1 Cor 15:3,4).|$|R
