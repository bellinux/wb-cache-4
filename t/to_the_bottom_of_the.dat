5|$|On 27 August 1928, Kommandøren ran aground at Opdalseldet in Bårdsundet off Tysnesøy Hordaland; she was refloated {{after all}} 350 {{passengers}} {{had been taken}} off. She ran aground yet again in April 1938, when she ran into the island Segløya while en route from Skjerjehamn to Eivindvik.

5|$|A {{new stage}} {{adaptation}} of the show debuted in 2003. Based on Clarke's novel The Moonbather, the play was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 to 11 October 2003. Using new actors to perform the roles of Compo, Clegg, and Foggy, the play featured the trio as they attempted to get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disturbance created by a near-naked man in the town. The play was later performed in Eastbourne by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} thigh injury restricted Whalley's first-team involvement at {{the start}} of the following season, which also coincided with a change in management at the club, after a poor start to the season left Shrewsbury rooted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League One table. Whalley scored his first goal of the season against Oxford United, deep in injury time, to seal a 2–0 victory for new manager Paul Hurst in his first home league match in charge. After becoming a first-team regular under Hurst, and helping Shrewsbury avoid relegation once again in 2016–17, Whalley signed a two-year contract extension in May 2017.|$|E

Morgan is last seen wondering about the significance of the Fountain and whether it really was the Fountain of Youth, and is seen refilling his empty canteen from the water of the lake.|$|E

5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube, where the process repeats.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E

5|$|Iridium is also {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product}} from nickel and copper mining and processing.

To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several separation methods are available depending {{on the nature of the}} mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in the United States by W. & S.B. Ives in Salem, Massachusetts on November 25, 1843. Their game was a folding game board with a cloth and cardboard pocket attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game board along its edge. In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate. This type of teetotum was referred to as a pin and plate teetotum.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E

5|$|Since Warhol gave no {{indication}} of a definitive ordering of the collection, the sequence chosen by MoMA (in the picture at the upper right of this article) in the display from their permanent collection reflects the chronological order in which the varieties were introduced by the Campbell Soup Company, beginning with Tomato in the upper left, which debuted in 1897. By April 2011, the curators at the MoMA had reordered the varieties, moving Clam Chowder to the upper left and tomato <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four rows.|$|E
5|$|Since the RCL {{is still}} covalently {{attached}} to the protease via the ester bond, the S to R transition pulls protease from the top <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serpin and distorts the catalytic triad. The distorted protease can only hydrolyse the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely slowly and so the protease remains covalently attached for days to weeks. Serpins are classed as irreversible inhibitors and as suicide inhibitors since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single protease, and can only function once.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{feeds on}} shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, crabs and other worms.

The bluespotted stingray overpowers its prey by pinning them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seafloor with its fins. The bluespotted stingray has numerous tiny teeth, with the lower jaw being slightly convex. They also, like most stingrays, have plate-like teeth to crush prey.|$|E

5|$|The club's {{first major}} title {{came in the}} 1950–51 season. After {{finishing}} fourth in the Autumn Cup the Panthers won 18 of their 30 league games and clinched the league championship.

The following season Nottingham lost Chick Zamick to injury and fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rankings. Success returned in 1953–54 when, after a last place finish in the Autumn Cup, the Panthers secured their second English League title by one point over Streatham.|$|E
5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out {{the center of the}} log and scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{the route}} chosen {{was a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, {{over the top of}} the ridge for many miles. Due to cost and {{drainage}} concerns, and a desire to reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.|$|E
