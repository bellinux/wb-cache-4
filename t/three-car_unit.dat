50|$|From 1919, {{additional}} capacity {{was created}} by converting further steam stock to two-car trailer units, to operate between two ordinary <b>three-car</b> <b>units,</b> forming an eight-car train.

500|$|MX3000 is an [...] {{electric}} train used on Oslo Metro in Oslo, Norway. The multiple units {{are produced by}} Siemens, who started serial delivery in 2007. Seventy-eight <b>three-car</b> <b>units</b> have been ordered by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, and five by Akershus County Municipality. They replaced the older T1000 and T1300 stock that was used on the Oslo Metro since 1966. By 2010, the last T1000 and T1300 trains have been retired and replaced by 83 <b>three-car</b> <b>units.</b> 32 additional sets were ordered, and the final train set was delivered in 2014, increasing the fleet to 115 units.|$|R
50|$|A {{third rail}} system was used, {{with a line}} voltage of 600 V DC. The rolling stock {{consisted}} of 84 <b>three-car</b> <b>units,</b> all formed from converted steam stock, and the system was an immediate success {{when it opened in}} 1915 - 1916. In fact, overcrowding was experienced in busy periods and trains were augmented by a number of two-car non driving trailer units from 1919, also converted from steam stock, which were formed between two of the <b>three-car</b> <b>units,</b> forming an eight-car train. All the electric trains provided first and third class accommodation only.|$|R
500|$|Each car is {{equipped}} with four three-phase asynchronous [...] motors, giving each <b>three-car</b> <b>unit</b> a power output of [...] In each car, the four motors are fed by the car's own insulated-gate bipolar transistor. They transform the 750volt direct current collected from the third rail shoe to the three-phase alternating current used in the motors. The frequency and amplitude of the current fed to the engines varies depending on the train's speed. The MX3000 introduced regenerative brakes, that allow the electromagnetic brakes to feed power back to the power supply when braking. In addition, there is a back-up disc brake on each axle. Acceleration in the range [...] is limited to 1.3meters per second squared (4.3ft/s2). In this phase, the fully loaded train uses 5.0kiloampere. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This removes the need for shunting at the depots, and makes maintenance more cost efficient. Energy usage is reduced by 30%, estimated to save the operating company NOK13 million per year, compared to using the old stocks.|$|E

5000|$|The Tait trains {{originally}} entered {{service as}} six-car sets, the majority {{made up of}} three [...] "M" [...] cars and three trailers.

These sets were made up of a four-car [...] "block" [...] and a three-car [...] "unit", usually operating as an M-T-T-M+G-T-M set during peak hours. On quieter lines the <b>three-car</b> <b>unit</b> would be uncoupled and stored at Jolimont sidings between peaks.|$|E
50|$|When first introduced, these <b>three-car</b> <b>units</b> {{were all}} based with the similar Class 121 single {{carriage}} (railcar) units on British Railway's Western Region for suburban {{work out of}} London Paddington and Cornwall.
