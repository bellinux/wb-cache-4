5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} contemporaneous American lion revealed that the <b>two</b> <b>cats</b> shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E

According to hunters, though, only one or <b>two</b> <b>cats</b> per year were caught, and the number of remaining cats was probably quite low. Togawa did not expect to catch one alive.|$|E
25|$|Feline {{infectious}} peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, incurable disease {{caused by}} Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), {{which is a}} mutation of Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV/FeCoV). The mutated virus can invade and grow in certain white blood cells, namely macrophages. The immune system's response causes an intense inflammatory reaction in the containing tissues. This disease is generally fatal. However its incidence rate is roughly 1 in 5000 for households with one or <b>two</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Iriomote cat's karyotype, the {{restriction}} fragment {{length of the}} ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and molecular phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and cytochrome b {{have proven to be}} identical, or nearly so, to the leopard cat's. The <b>two</b> <b>cats</b> are assumed to be extremely closely related, their differences being categorized as either intraspecies variations or individual mutations. Also, from the speed of cytochrome b's base-pair substitution and its diversity, it is estimated that the Iriomote cat diverged from the leopard cat around 180,000-200,000 years ago. According to marine geologists, the Ryukyu Islands were connected to mainland Asia via a land bridge from about 20,000 years ago to 240,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the Iriomote cat moved its range to the islands during this period. Because of this, it is assumed that there is little genetic variety within the species.|$|E

500|$|The chase {{scene at}} the end of the game, in which Don pursues Adrienne {{throughout}} the entire mansion, took a full week to film. Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him. Only one prosthesis was available, and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said [...] "we were essentially holding it in place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax". Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals, including a Doberman Pinscher, <b>two</b> <b>cats,</b> a beagle and several rats. Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillian and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals. <b>Two</b> <b>cats</b> were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game. Some were edited for length and pacing, but none were cut altogether.|$|E

Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out.

500|$|An inquest {{into the}} deaths {{took place on}} 29 March 1831. The family's three servants, one of whom {{appeared}} to have been poisoned as well and was ill, were placed in custody separately to stop them communicating with each other while the investigation proceeded. The jury replicated the effects by feeding the fish to (and poisoning) <b>two</b> <b>cats.</b> The jury learnt that the servant, Speed, had caught the 20 or so fish and taken them home to eat. A neighbour called out to him not to eat the fish as they were [...] "no good", but he took it as a joke. The inquest concluded with a finding of accidental death, with some deliberation over whether Speed should have been charged with manslaughter or even murder after hearing the warning. Warnings about toadfish were subsequently issued.|$|E
500|$|In June 1974, Lennon and Pang {{returned}} {{to live in}} New York City. Lennon stopped drinking and concentrated on recording. As Lennon had previously had cats in Liverpool—while living at his aunt Mimi's house—he and Pang adopted <b>two</b> <b>cats</b> which they named Major and Minor. In the early summer, while Lennon was working on his Walls and Bridges album, the couple moved into a penthouse apartment at 434 East 52nd Street, where Lennon and Pang claim to have seen a UFO on August 23, 1974, from their terrace, which had {{a panoramic view of}} east New York. To gain access to the deck Lennon and Pang had to climb out of their kitchen window. On the night in question, a naked Lennon excitedly called Pang to join him on the deck outside and they both watched a circular object silently floating less than 100 feet away. Lennon called Bob Gruen—Lennon's [...] "official" [...] photographer—and told him what had happened. Gruen suggested Lennon should call the police, but Lennon laughed it off, saying, [...] "I’m not going to call up the newspaper and say, 'This is John Lennon and I saw a flying saucer last night'". Gruen called the local police precinct which confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting, and the Daily News said that five people had reported a sighting in the same area of New York where Lennon and Pang lived.|$|E

500|$|Wilt Chamberlain was {{the first}} big earner of basketball: {{immediately}} becoming the highest paid player upon entering the NBA, Chamberlain was basketball's first player to earn at least $100,000 a year, and earned an unprecedented $1.5 million during his Lakers years. As a Philadelphia 76er, he could afford to rent a New York apartment and commute to Philadelphia. In addition, he would often stay out {{late into the night}} and wake up at noon, a point that became notorious in the 1965–66 NBA season. When he became a Laker, Chamberlain built a million-dollar mansion he called the [...] "Ursa Major" [...] in Bel-Air, as a play on his nickname [...] "The Big Dipper". It had a 2,200-pound pivot as a front door and contained great displays of luxury. [...] Robert Allen Cherry, journalist and author of the biography , describes his house as a miniature Playboy Mansion, where he regularly held parties and lived out his later-notorious sex life. This was also helped by the fact that Chamberlain was a near-insomniac who often simply skipped sleeping. Designed according to his preferences, the house was constructed with no right angles, and had an [...] "X-rated" [...] room with mirrored walls and a fur-covered waterbed. Chamberlain lived alone, relying on a great deal of automated gadgets, with <b>two</b> <b>cats</b> named Zip and Zap and several Great Dane dogs as company. In addition, Chamberlain drove a Ferrari, a Bentley, and had a Le Mans-style car called Searcher One designed and built at a cost of $750,000 in 1996. Following his death, in 1999 Chamberlain's estate was valued at $25 million.|$|E
500|$|Johnson was a devout, {{conservative}} Anglican and {{a compassionate}} man who supported {{a number of}} poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself. Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, [...] "no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him". However, Johnson's moral writings do not contain, as Donald Greene points out, [...] "a predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior, even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct. He did not let his own faith prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christ's teachings. Although Johnson respected John Milton's poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity. He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the [...] "next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies". Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats, especially his own <b>two</b> <b>cats,</b> Hodge and Lily. Boswell wrote, [...] "I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself {{used to go out}} and buy oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature." [...] It is a common error to think that these oysters were expensive, since they are so in modern Britain. However, in Johnson's time they were very cheap and eaten by the poor. [...] He thought that his servant, Frank, might resent Hodge if he had to go buy the oysters for him.|$|E

[...] Two explanations have been offered: the cats may {{have entered the}} chimney and been overcome by smoke from the fireplace, which then prevented their remains decomposing; or {{they may have been}} offered as a sacrifice by a witch. [...] Such activities have been reported in other parts of Hastings in the 16th and 17th centuries.
