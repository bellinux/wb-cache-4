25|$|Hachikō {{attracted}} the attention of other commuters. Many of the people who frequented the Shibuya train station had seen Hachikō and Professor Ueno together each day. Initial reactions from the people, especially from those working at the station, were not necessarily friendly.

25|$|Note: There is here a {{possible}} confusion between two {{meanings of the}} word transition. (i) In the context of Markov chains, transition is the general term that refers to the change between two states. (ii) In the context of nucleotide changes in DNA sequences, transition is a specific term that refers to the exchange between either the two purines (A ↔ G) or the two pyrimidines (C ↔ T) (for additional details, see <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>about</b> transitions in genetics). By contrast, an exchange between one purine and one pyrimidine is called a transversion.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{cities that}} have a metro include Moscow, St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan. Entrances to metro {{stations}} are marked using the letter M which looks {{the same in the}} Russian and Roman alphabets. On the Moscow Metro, announcements on trains are made in Russian and English, and direction signs and maps often include English. Apart from buses and trams, trolleybuses are a very common means of overground transport in Russian cities. For more information see the list of trolleybus systems in Russia. Another widely used means of public transport is marshrutkas, or shared taxies. If you are going to visit Moscow and use public transport, see <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>about</b> the Troika card (a similar card known as Podorozhnik is used in St Petersburg). Taxi services available in major Russian cities include Yandex.Taxi, Uber (company), and Gett.|$|E

25|$|John Howe {{probably}} {{began his}} apprenticeship as a printer to Richard Draper in either 1766 or 1767. Richard Draper was the King's printer in Massachusetts and {{the publisher of}} the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, the oldest English newspaper in the Americas. As Richard Draper was known to be a frail and sickly man, and as he was Draper's apprentice, John Howe probably witnessed and wrote <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>about</b> the Boston Tea Party that appeared in the December 23, 1773, issue. Less than six months after the report on the Boston Tea Party, Richard Draper, owner of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, died on June 5 or 6, 1774, leaving the paper in the hands of his widow, Margaret Draper. Richard Draper may have anticipated his demise, as he formed a partnership with John Boyle in May, the month before his death. However, Margaret Draper soon ended this partnership (between August 4 and 11, 1774) as Boyle did not share her loyalist sympathies. Margaret Draper published the paper by herself from August 11, 1774.|$|E
