Most of the underlying matching models neglect the necessity to allow not only mismatches, but also insertions and deletions.

While the most frequent error-type in Illumina reads are mismatches, reads produced by 454 ’s GS FLX predominantly contain insertions and deletions (indels). Even though 454 sequencers are able to produce longer reads, the method is frequently applied to small RNA (miRNA and siRNA) sequencing. Fast and accurate matching in particular of short reads with diverse errors is therefore a pressing practical problem. We introduce a matching model for short reads that can, besides mismatches, also cope with indels. It addresses different error models.

First, 2 D interconnects based on conductive inks have been integrated into thin layers, manufactured using μSLA.

Peptides produced by splicing can be presented on class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex and recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes.

Contrary to the previously described spliced peptides, which are produced by the association of fragments of 3 to 6 amino acids, the peptide described here results from the ultimate association of an 8 -amino acid fragment with a single arginine residue. As described before, peptide splicing {{takes place in the}} proteasome by transpeptidation involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate linking one of the peptide fragment to a catalytic subunit of the proteasome.

The spliced peptide produced from this reaction therefore bears an extended C-terminus that needs to be further trimmed in order to produce the final antigenic peptide.

However, further study has indicated that a 10 -mer peptide, I- 10 (RGPGRAFVTI), within P 18 IIIB is the minimal-sized epitope and the <b>trimming</b> <b>step(s)</b> of two carboxyl terminal amino acids (GK) is essential to produce I- 10 from P 18 IIIB. In the processing, angiotensin- 1 -converting enzyme (ACE), found in sera, plays {{a central role in}} generating I- 10. Target cells could be sensitized with I- 10 under conditions where ACE activity in the sera was abrogated. In contrast, in the case of P 18 IIIB, requiring further processing to delete the C-terminus of two amino acids in order to act, sensitization of target cells was completely abrogated under the conditions. Pretreatment of target cells with brefeldin A (BFA), preventing the presentation of endogenous antigens from the class I MHC molecule pathway, did not inhibit the presentation of P 18 IIIB. Moreover, glutaraldehyde-fixed cells, which can not process native protein, though they could present the exogenously added peptides, were also sensitized by P 18 IIIB. These results clearly demonstrate that the fine processing to produce I- 10 occurred in the extracellular milieu. Furthermore, our result suggests that the longer P 18 IIIB can bind to the class I molecules on the cell surface, and then be trimmed by ACE while it is bound. The mechanisms behind the extracellular processing outlined in this paper will offer important information for designing peptide-based vaccines to elicit MHC molecule-restricted effectors...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master's {{thesis is}} to develop a method that fully automates a <b>trimming</b> <b>step</b> in the {{production}} of a fiber-optical power spectrometer, based on a unique Acusto-Optical Scanning Filter. The filter is created by letting an ultrasonic mechanical pulse pass through a chirped Fiber Bragg Grating. The pulse introduces a disturbance in the grating, creating a thin optical transmission window in the otherwise reflective bandwidth. The high demands on the window requires a precise, unit dependent pulse form with unknown properties. Thus each unit needs to be trimmed to reach required performance. The manual trimming is largely a trial and error process, that contains two performance tests. We redefine one, eliminating the need to reroute the optical path and reducing the number of fiber weldings. The tests are then quantified, allowing a figure of merit to be based on weighted performance values. A brute force method, testing a large set of pulses, is implemented. The set is defined by the parameter space spanned by previously produced units. Due to the large space, the method is too time consuming. Instead it is used to measure the performance spaces of three units. An attempt to largely reduce the parameter space using PCA failed. An alternating variables method that finds local performance optima in the parameter space is developed. By using a set of several starting points, the method tends to find several qualified pulses. The method is implemented and successfully verified by trimming new units. Finally we propose where to focus improvements of the method in a production ramp up...|$|E

It has been shown that removing ambiguously aligned regions, but also other sources of bias such as highly variable (saturated) characters, can improve the overall performance of many phylogenetic reconstruction methods. A current scientific trend is to build phylogenetic trees from a large number of sequence datasets (semi-) automatically extracted from numerous complete genomes. Because these approaches do not allow a precise manual curation of each dataset, there exists a real need for efficient bioinformatic tools dedicated to this alignment character <b>trimming</b> <b>step.</b> Results Here is presented a new software, named BMGE (Block Mapping and Gathering with Entropy), that is designed to select regions in a multiple sequence alignment that are suited for phylogenetic inference. For each character, BMGE computes a score closely related to an entropy value. Calculation of these entropy-like scores is weighted with BLOSUM or PAM similarity matrices in order to distinguish among biologically expected and unexpected variability for each aligned character. Sets of contiguous characters with a score above a given threshold are considered as not suited for phylogenetic inference and then removed. Simulation analyses show that the character trimming performed by BMGE produces datasets leading to accurate trees, especially with alignments including distantly-related sequences. BMGE also implements trimming and recoding methods aimed at minimizing phylogeny reconstruction artefacts due to compositional heterogeneity. Conclusions BMGE is able to perform biologically relevant trimming on a multiple alignment of DNA, codon or amino acid sequences.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} to manufacture special-purpose tiles (i. e. <b>trim</b> pieces, <b>steps,</b> skirting boards, etc.) has been recently developed {{on the basis}} of a pyroplastic shaping of porcelain stoneware tiles. This innovative process involves a second firing, peaking at temperatures close to those of sintering, whose effect was investigated by comparing industrially-manufactured tiles before and after pyroplastic shaping. Characterization by XRF, XRPD, SEM and standard testing (ISO 10545) put in evidence that pyroplastic bending induced little changes in the water absorption and bulk density values, as in phase composition. Limited variations occurring to closed porosity, mechanical strength and microstructure do not significantly affect the overall technological performance of the special-purpose tiles, which is substantially the same of the original porcelain stoneware tiles. A detailed microstructural characterization was performed for the first time on porcelain stoneware tiles: coarse grains (> 10 ?m) represent 10 - 15 % of total volume, while fine-grained crystals, dispersed in the glassy phase, amount from 30 % to 65 % of the viscous matrix. The pyroplastic behaviour was found to depend in a complex way on such microstructural and compositional features, which deeply affect the effective viscosity of the matrix...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop a simple mathematical model able to predict the subcutaneous fat thickness of pig thighs starting from the carcass traits as weight, backfat and l. dorsi thickness, and weight of the <b>trimmed</b> thighs. A <b>stepping</b> model-building technique using the General Regression Model method, involving two steps, was implemented. Firstly, the best fit equation was developed which was able to describe relationships among the investigated variables. Thereafter, a validation step, to evaluate the predictive ability of the model, was performed against a set of independent data from that used in building step. Results proved that both the quadratic and interactive terms of carcass traits could be successfully used to predict the subcutaneous fat thickness of pig thighs. About 82 % of the predicted data were {{in agreement with the}} experimental measurements...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} we present the {{theoretical}} {{development of the}} normalized backpropagation, and we compare it with other algorithms that have been presented in the literature. The algorithm that we propose {{is based on the}} idea of normalizing the adaptation step in the gradient search by the variance of the input. This algorithm is simple and gives good results in comparison with other algorithms that accelerate the learning and has the additional advantage that the parameters are calculated by the algorithm, so the user does not have to make several trials in order to <b>trim</b> the adaptation <b>step</b> and the momentum until the best combination is found. The task which we have designed in order to compare the algorithms is the recognition of digits in the Catalan language, with a data base of 1000 items, spoken by 10 speakers. The algorithms that we have compared with the normalized back propagation are: D. E. Rumelhart and J. L. McCielland, Franzini, Suddhard, Fahlman, Monte.
