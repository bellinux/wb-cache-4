5|$|Other composers {{who have}} used the organ {{prominently}} in orchestral music include Gustav Holst, Richard Strauss, Ottorino Respighi, Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, and Ralph Vaughan Williams.

5|$|Overdifferentiation is when phonemic distinctions from one's primary {{language}} are imposed on <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the second system {{where they are}} not required; underdifferentiation of phonemes occurs when two sounds of the second system are not maintained {{because they are not}} present in the primary system.|$|E

5|$|Dreyer {{shot and}} edited {{the film in}} France and then brought it to Berlin where it was post-synchronized in both German and French. Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound {{equipment}} available {{to him at the}} time. Most of the actors did not dub their own voices. The only voices of the actors that are their own in the film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. <b>The</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were fake and were done by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music.|$|E

60|$|It {{may not be}} {{absolutely}} futile if we bestow a little more attention upon the details of these laxities of rhyme. The repetition of an identical syllable has been cited 6 times. In 4 instances <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> taught is assimilated to that of not (I take here no account of differences of spelling, but only of the sounds); in 4, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> ground and of renown to that of moaned, or of Chatterton; in 2, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> o in road, both, and wove, to that in God, youth, and of; in 3, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> song to that of stung; in 2, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> ee in compeers, steel, cheek, and grief, to that in dares, fell, break and knife; in 2, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> e in wert and earth to that in heart and forth; in 3, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> o in moan and home to that in one, dawn, and tomb; in 2, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> thither to that of together. The other cases which I have cited have only a single instance apiece. It results therefore that the vowel-sound subjected to the most frequent variations is that of o, whether single or in combination.|$|R

5|$|During the night, {{artillery}} strikes continued, eventually {{forcing the}} ICU frontlines to falter. A mutiny within the ICU caused their forces to disintegrate, and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10p.m., <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> battle died down.

5|$|Early American {{alternative}} bands such as Dream Syndicate, R.E.M., The Feelies and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with {{folk music}} and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. {{was the most}} immediately successful; its debut album, Murmur (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers. One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' Paisley Underground revived <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as The Velvet Underground.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
