5|$|Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) built animatronic WALL-E's {{to promote}} the picture, which made {{appearances}} at Disneyland Resort, the Franklin Institute, the Miami Science Museum, the Seattle Center, and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{they were required to}} interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard cutout.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{meanings}} of the terms associated with the separation axioms has varied over time, as explained in History of the separation axioms.

25|$|A {{further and}} most {{important}} appliance is the doctor, a thin sharp blade of steel that rests on the engraved roller and serves to scrape off every vestige of superfluous colour from its surface, leaving only that which rests in the engraving. On the perfect action of this doctor depends the entire success of printing, and as its sharpness and angle of inclination to the copper roller varies with the styles of work in hand it requires an expert to get it up (sharpen it) properly and considerable practical experience <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> qualities it should possess in any given case. In order {{to prevent it from}} wearing irregularly it is given a to-and-fro motion so that it is constantly changing its position and is never in contact with one part of the engraving for more than of brass or a similar alloy is frequently added {{on the opposite side of}} the roller to that occupied by the steel or cleaning doctor; it is known technically as the lint doctor from its purpose of cleaning off loose filaments or lint, which the roller picks off the cloth during the printing operation. The steel or cleaning doctor is pressed against the roller by means of weighted levers, but the lint doctor is usually just allowed to rest upon it by its own weight as its function is merely to intercept the nap which becomes detached from the cloth and would, if not cleaned from the roller, mix with the colour and give rise to defective work.|$|E

2500|$|According to Bart D Ehrman: [...] "Mary (Magdalene) is accorded a {{high status}} among the apostles of Jesus." [...] Levi {{actually}} acknowledges that Jesus loved {{her more than}} he loved {{all of the other}} apostles.

2500|$|Plato ( [...] ; Greek: [...] Plátōn, [...] in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC) was {{a philosopher}} in Classical Greece {{and the founder}} of the Academy in Athens, the first {{institution}} of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. This makes it difficult <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Plato wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Today, many {{products}} are {{an outcome of}} a large number of parts and pieces that come from many different countries, and that may then be assembled together in a third country. In these cases, it's hard <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> is the country of origin, and different rules apply as to how to determine their [...] "correct" [...] country of origin. Generally, articles only change their country of origin if the work or material added to an article in the second country constitutes a substantial transformation, or, the article changes its name, tariff code, character or use (for instance from wheel to car). Value added in the second country may also be an issue.|$|E

40|$|In the lattice Boltzmann equation, {{continuous}} {{particle velocity}} space {{is replaced by}} a finite dimensional discrete set. The number of linearly independent velocity moments in a lattice Boltzmann model cannot exceed the number of discrete velocities. Thus, finite dimensionality introduces linear dependencies among the moments that do not exist in the exact continuous theory. Given a discrete velocity set, it is important <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> order moments are free of these dependencies. Elementary group theory is applied to the solution of this problem. It is found that by decomposing the velocity set into subsets that transform among themselves under an appropriate symmetry group, it becomes relatively straightforward to assess the behavior of moments in the theory. The construction of some standard two- and three-dimensional models is reviewed from this viewpoint, and procedures for constructing some new higher dimensional models are suggested...|$|R
50|$|It is also {{sometimes}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> the Alexandrians meant when they rejected a passage. The scholia on Odyssey 23.296 {{tell us that}} Aristarchus and Aristophanes regarded that line {{as the end of}} the epic (even though that is grammatically impossible); but we are also told that Aristarchus separately rejected several passages after that point.|$|R

He continued, saying that the [...] "device allowed {{producers}} and writers to have fun mocking critical and public perceptions of The OC, its supposed soap-operatic excesses and pop-culture obsessions. In a book written by Alan Sepinwall that examined the series, Sepinwall noted that [...] "Schwartz spends enough of his day trolling message boards <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> fans are complaining about and which references to other shows and movies they've caught, and he incorporates it into his scripts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to Hitler's War {{was mostly}} negative. Various historians such as Gitta Sereny, Martin Broszat, Lucy Dawidowicz, Gerard Fleming, Charles W. Sydnor and Eberhard Jäckel wrote either {{articles}} or books rebutting {{what they considered}} to be erroneous information in Hitler's War. Writing in the Sunday Times, Sereny called Irving's work [...] "closer to theology or mythology" [...] than history, while Broszat labelled Irving a [...] "Hitler partisan wearing blinkers". Lance Morrow wrote in Time that Irving's picture of the [...] "Führer as a somewhat harried business executive too preoccupied <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was happening in his branch offices at Auschwitz and Treblinka" [...] was hard to accept. In {{an article published in}} the Sunday Times under the title [...] "The £1,000 Question" [...] on 10 July 1977, Sereny and the journalist Lewis Chester examined Irving's sources and found significant differences from what Irving published in Hitler's War. In particular, while interviewing one of Irving's primary informants, Otto Günsche, the latter stated that [...] "one must assume that he [...] did know" [...] about the Holocaust.|$|E

5000|$|Pitchfork Media {{selected}} the alternate mix of Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2s opening track, [...] "diskhat ALL prepared1mixed 13", as the week's [...] "Best New Track". Writer Patric Fallon finished his review by stating: [...] "the need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what's</b> going on {{gives way to}} that feeling of awe Twin so regularly produces. It's another reminder that sometimes the best music is the stuff that leaves you asking, 'How?'" [...] In a later review of the entire EP Mark Richardson highly praised Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2 and selected {{it as part of}} the week's [...] "Best New Music". Richardson said that [...] "where James used to offer his electro-acoustic pieces as a showcase for lyrical melodies, about half the music here consists of crisply arranged beats with about half fully fleshed out and the others serving as sketches … Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2 is a release for established fans, people who want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what his pieces would sound like in an altogether different setting … the greatest pleasure comes in knowing where it came from and how it came to be." [...] Resident Advisors Jordan Rothlein's review was also largely positive, describing the EP as [...] "a moody set that sounds a bit like either Tom Waits instrumentals, a gamelan ensemble going pop, or maybe just some bits from Syro played back at a fraction of their original speed." [...] Rothelin was equally critical however, writing that [...] "though there's a certain pleasure in listening to an artist figure things out, a full 28 minutes feels like overkill." ...|$|R
