5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> the sports drink, <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

40|$|Taste aversion {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that rats conditioned to avoid monosodium glutamate (MSG) with amiloride added to reduce the intensity of the sodium component <b>of</b> MSG <b>taste,</b> generalize this aversion to aspartic acid and to L-AP 4, but not to ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists. That is, MSG, L-AP 4 and aspartate have similar tastes to rats. However, conditioned taste aversion methods are unable to show to what extent <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> two substances are different. If two substances activate the same afferent processes (e. g. taste receptors), they are likely to produce <b>the</b> same <b>tastes,</b> but if they activate different afferent processes, the subject may detect differences between <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substances. In this study, rats were tested to determine if they could discriminate between <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> these agonists and MSG. We also established the detection thresh-olds for NMDA, aspartic acid and L-AP 4, with and without amiloride (a sodium channel antagonist). Taste threshold values were 1 – 4 mM for NMDA and aspartic acid and 0. 5 – 2. 5 µM for L-AP 4. None were affected by 30 µM amiloride. Rats could readily distinguish between <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> MSG and NMDA but they had difficulty discriminating between <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> aspartic acid and MSG. Rats could also easily distinguish between 10 – 100 mM MSG and 0. 01 – 5 mM L-AP 4. However, in two separate experiments error rates increased significantly when L-AP 4 concentrations were between 10 – 100 mM, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> L-AP 4 and MSG were similar at these concentrations...|$|R

5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E

5|$|English cookery {{has been}} open to foreign {{ingredients}} and influence from {{as early as}} the thirteenth century, {{and in the case of}} a few foods like sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.|$|E

By 6 September 2010 all 55 locations in the country were closed down and converted to Burgeranches.|$|E
