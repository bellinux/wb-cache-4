5|$|Opened {{as part of}} {{an attempt}} to {{encourage}} holiday traffic on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were very basic, consisting of no more than a single wooden platform, which cost £170 to build, two wooden benches and running in board together with the obligatory oil lamps. No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by wooden <b>trestles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to the bridge's construction, Pleasure Island was {{accessible}} only by ferry. In 1907, the Pleasure Beach Ferry Company was given the rights to build a movable toll bridge. A series of <b>trestles</b> were built across the tidal flats with a swing span across the dredged channel. The swing span was constructed in 1927, but in the Great Depression the Beach Ferry Company transferred control of the bridge {{to the city of}} Bridgeport. The tolls were removed and the bridge continued to be used after Pleasure Beach's closing in 1968, until the 1996 fire. Repairs were made to the bridge in 1988 with money from the state. In 1994, the need to replace the bridge resulted in a state and federal promise of $20 million, but this was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in 1995.|$|E
50|$|A fill <b>trestle</b> or filling <b>trestle</b> is a {{temporary}} construction <b>trestle</b> that is built to provide a scaffolding for the placement of fill or an earthen dam. Typically, the <b>trestle</b> is built across the valley and a railway is laid across the <b>trestle.</b> Specially designed side-dumping railroad cars filled with earth or gravel are pushed onto it and dumped, burying the <b>trestle.</b> Typically, a fill <b>trestle</b> is constructed out of wood which remains buried in the fill and eventually decomposes. Advances in construction technology, particularly {{the development of the}} dump truck, have rendered the fill <b>trestle</b> technique obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|The {{incident}} {{is named for}} the <b>trestle,</b> known as the [...] "Fat Nancy" [...] for the woman {{who served as the}} <b>trestle</b> watcher. The <b>trestle’s</b> official name was Browning <b>Trestle,</b> for the owners of the property on which it sits, or Two-Runs <b>trestle</b> for the creek that ran below. A local African- American woman who waved to train conductors and occasionally received a shovelful of coal inspired locals to rename the <b>trestle</b> as Fat Nancy’s <b>trestle.</b> The Baltimore Sun reported that the woman’s actual name was Emily Jackson and described a woman of “great size and uncouth appearance.” ...|$|R

5|$|The three {{sections}} of decking were assembled {{on the broad}} central reservation of Princess Road, and were craned into position over a weekend when Princess Road was closed. The decking was temporarily supported by <b>trestles</b> until the arch was ready. The six sections of the arch were welded together on site into two halves before being lifted into position during a second weekend. The cables were connected on third weekend. The bridge was formally opened on 10 May 1997 by Alex Ferguson in a ceremony including the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Tony Wilson. The ceremony was concluded by them being driven over the bridge in a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, and {{was followed by a}} street festival.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{the rains}} of Hurricane Floyd caused {{considerable}} {{damage to the}} railroad. Two <b>trestles</b> were entirely destroyed by the flooding of Red Clay Creek, which also caused track washouts and damaged several other <b>trestles.</b> The two destroyed bridges were replaced by steel <b>trestles,</b> but the other timber <b>trestles</b> were simply repaired.|$|E

50|$|Colonel Springs then {{heard of}} a main line <b>trestle</b> {{that was about to}} be {{abandoned}} by the railroad that owned it so they could replace it with a <b>trestle</b> that had double tracks. An added bonus was that the <b>trestle</b> also included a bridge for automobiles. Colonel Springs bought this <b>trestle</b> and then sold it to the county for what he had paid for it. He was left with only the expense of moving the <b>trestle</b> to the Catawba and attaching it to the stone piers of the old <b>trestle</b> that were spared by the flood. That the new <b>trestle</b> fit the piers of the old one was the stroke of luck that the L&C needed.|$|R

25|$|At {{a cost of}} $197 million, new {{parallel}} two-lane <b>trestles</b> {{were built}} both to alleviate traffic and for safety reasons. Immediately after completion of the parallel <b>trestles,</b> traffic was diverted to them and the original <b>trestles</b> and roadway underwent a $20 million retrofit, repairing {{the wear and tear}} of 35 years of service and upgrading certain features, such as repaving the road surface. The older portion of the facility was then reopened on April 19, 1999.|$|E
25|$|Between Stoney Creek Station and Kuranda {{there are}} another two tunnels, and 22 bridges. After leaving Stoney Creek Station {{there is a}} steel lattice girder bridge (Bridge 29) with wrought iron piers on {{concrete}} bases at 22.92km. This is followed by Stoney Creek Bridge (Bridge 30) at 23.15km, with seven spans of steel lattice girders supported by wrought iron <b>trestles</b> on concrete footings. A concrete pier and two timber <b>trestles</b> support the uphill approach spans. This bridge has a total length of 88.4m, with a curved track.|$|E
25|$|The columns {{that support}} the bridge–tunnel's <b>trestles</b> are called piles. If placed end to end, the piles would stretch for about , roughly the {{distance}} from New York City to Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began in late 2006 and {{was carried out in}} stages. Thin soil cover {{prohibited}} the use of bored tunnel and hacked tunnel methods. For each stage the substructure was first constructed within the excavated trenches to the underside of the temporary <b>trestles.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>trestle</b> was {{replaced}} {{in the late}} 1950s with a parallel dirt and rock causeway built under contract by the Morrison Knudsen construction company. The <b>trestle</b> remained in limited use alongside the causeway, until about 1975. The railroad eventually sold salvage rights to the <b>trestle</b> and Cannon Structures, Inc., through its Trestlewood division, began to dismantle it in the early 1990s. Trestlewood continues to market and sell the salvaged <b>trestle</b> wood.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} rails {{were replaced}} in the 1990s, from 60lbs (27.2kg) per yard (0.9m) weight, to 41kg per metre. One in every four sleepers are now steel, with a one in two ratio on curves with a radius under 120m. Some cuttings were also widened in the 1980s and 1990s. Most cuttings are in earth or rock, but some have concrete lining or stone pitching in parts. Some timber bridge components, {{such as the}} piles or headstocks of <b>trestles,</b> {{have been replaced by}} steel, or whole <b>trestles</b> have been replaced by concrete piers. There are a large number of small open concrete drains passing under the line. Early cast concrete pipes and culverts (not reinforced) along the line will be replaced with reinforced concrete pipes if the originals collapse.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{impressive}} {{resistance to}} decay, redwood was extensively used for railroad ties and <b>trestles</b> throughout California. Many {{of the old}} ties have been recycled for use in gardens as borders, steps, house beams, etc. Redwood burls {{are used in the}} production of table tops, veneers, and turned goods.|$|E
