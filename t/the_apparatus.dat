5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering <b>the</b> <b>apparatus.</b> With <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{experiment}} Hendrik Lorentz {{proposed that the}} motion of <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> through the aether may cause <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> to contract along its length {{in the direction of}} motion, and he further assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity.|$|E

50|$|Synaptopodin, {{a protein}} that binds actin and α-actinin-2, is closely {{associated}} with <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus.</b> Although SP-deficient mature mice both lack <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus</b> and display impaired LTP, the relationship between SP, <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus,</b> and plasticity {{is complicated by the}} following three findings: (1) In addition to being associated with <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus,</b> SP is also located in the cisternal organelle, which is structurally similar to <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus.</b> (2) <b>The</b> spine <b>apparatus</b> is generally found in mushroom spines of mature neurons, but ample levels of SP and expression of LTP have been detected in juvenile rats just 15 days old. (3) Unlike SP, <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus</b> has not been found in cultured neurons. These findings have led some to the conclusion that <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus</b> is implicated in plasticity only because this organelle is associated with SP.|$|R

5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel.

50|$|For some time, the {{function}} of <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus</b> has been considered enigmatic.

5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment.

Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over <b>the</b> <b>apparatus,</b> they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers.

5|$|In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor George Bulyea asked Rutherford to {{form the}} new province's first government.

5|$|The {{colonialism}} that Atangana {{had supported}} was ruinous in Cameroon.

Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his tale in oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist scholarship that blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown Yaoundé is named for him.

The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control <b>the</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house.

5000|$|Furthermore, Pierce et al. {{proposed}} that <b>the</b> spine <b>apparatus</b> {{may be involved}} in post-translational protein processing, similar to that observed in <b>the</b> golgi <b>apparatus,</b> and function in the post-translational processing of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits, which are locally translated in dentritic spines, of AMPA receptors.

5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much {{of the weight of}} the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, <b>the</b> <b>apparatus</b> stores and releases energy {{in the manner of a}} spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E
