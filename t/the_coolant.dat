5|$|This {{process can}} cause {{problems}} in lead-bismuth based liquid metal cooled nuclear reactors {{such as those}} used in the Soviet Navy's K-27. Measures must be taken in these reactors {{to deal with the}} unwanted possibility of 210Po being released from <b>the</b> <b>coolant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. <b>The</b> <b>coolant</b> absorbs heat from the mould (which has absorbed heat from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E

5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
25|$|Skimmers {{are used}} to {{separate}} the tramp oil from <b>the</b> <b>coolant.</b> These are typically slowly rotating vertical discs that are partially submerged below <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> level in the main reservoir. As the disc rotates the tramp oil clings to {{each side of the}} disc to be scraped off by two wipers, before the disc passes back through <b>the</b> <b>coolant.</b> The wipers are {{in the form of a}} channel that then redirects the tramp oil to a container where it is collected for disposal. Floating weir skimmers are also used in these situation where temperature or the amount of oil on the water becomes excessive.|$|E
25|$|Cladding is {{the outer}} {{layer of the}} fuel rods, {{standing}} between <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> and the nuclear fuel. It is made of a corrosion-resistant material with low absorption cross section for thermal neutrons, usually Zircaloy or steel in modern constructions, or magnesium with small amount of aluminium and other metals for the now-obsolete Magnox reactors.

Material Specifications The specifications for pressure-retaining ferritic materials, nonferrous met-als and austenitic stainless steels, including weld materials, that are used for each component (e. g., vessels, piping, pumps, and valves) of <b>the</b> reactor <b>coolant</b> pressure boundary, are reviewed by MTEB. The adequacy and suitability of the ferritic materials, stainless steels, and nonferrous metals specified for the above applications are determined. 2. Compatibility of Materials with <b>the</b> Reactor <b>Coolant</b> General corrosion and stress corrosion cracking induced by impurities in <b>the</b> reactor <b>coolant</b> can cause failures of <b>the</b> reactor <b>coolant</b> pressure boundary. <b>The</b> chemistry of <b>the</b> reactor <b>coolant</b> and <b>the</b> additives (such as inhibitors) whose function is to control corrosion are reviewed by CMEB {{as part of its}} primary review responsibility for SRP Sections 5. 4. 8 and 9. 3. 4. CMEB reviews the compatibility of the materials of construction employed in the RCPB with <b>the</b> reactor <b>coolant,</b> contaminants, or radiolytic products to which the system is exposed. The extent of the corrosion of ferritic low alloy steels and carbon steels in contact with <b>the</b> reactor <b>coolant</b> is reviewed...|$|R

25|$|In some reactors, <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> also acts as {{a neutron}} {{moderator}}. A moderator increases {{the power of the}} reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. Thermal neutrons are more likely than fast neutrons to cause fission. If <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.|$|E
25|$|In other {{reactors}} <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> acts as {{a poison}} by absorbing neutrons {{in the same way}} that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating <b>the</b> <b>coolant,</b> which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to scram the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often boron in the form of boric acid) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{a simple}} organic cycle for eight {{subcritical}} coolant fluids {{has been studied}} thermodynamically and economically. For all <b>the</b> <b>coolants,</b> <b>the</b> present cycle was optimized for the best thermal and exergy efficiencies and the best cost of energy production. In a multi-purpose procedure, using the three methods NSGA-II, MOPSO, and MOEA/D, design variables in the optimization are the inlet turbine pressure and temperature, the pinch temperature difference, the proximity temperature difference in regenerator exchanger, and condenser temperature difference. The optimization results show that, in all three methods, {{the impact of the}} parameters’ inlet turbine temperature and pressure on the three objective functions is much more than other design parameters. Coolant with positive temperature gradients shows a better performance but lower produced power. In optimization methods, among all <b>the</b> <b>coolants,</b> <b>the</b> MOPSO method showed higher thermal and energy efficiency, and the MOEA/D showed lower production power costs. In terms of the rate of convergence, also both the MOPSO and NSGA-II methods showed better performance. The fluid R 11 with the 25.7 % thermal efficiency, 57.3 % exergy efficiency, and 0.054 USD cost per kWh showed the best performance among all of <b>the</b> <b>coolants.</b>|$|R
25|$|The main change, and {{the most}} radical among the CANDU generations, {{is the use of}} {{pressurized}} light water as <b>the</b> <b>coolant.</b> This significantly reduces the cost of implementing the primary cooling loop, which no longer has to be filled with expensive heavy water. The ACR-1000 uses about 1/3rd the heavy water needed in earlier generation designs. It also eliminates tritium production in <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> loop, the major source of tritium leaks in operational CANDU designs. The redesign also allows for a slightly negative void reactivity, a major design goal of all Gen III+ machines.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluids degrade {{over time}} due to {{contaminants}} entering the lubrication system. A {{common type of}} degradation is the formation of tramp oil, also known as sump oil, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid. It originates as lubrication oil that seeps out from the slideways and washes into <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats bar stock to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases {{it can be seen}} as a film or skin on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> or as floating drops of oil.|$|E
25|$|Molten salt fuels {{have nuclear}} fuel {{dissolved}} {{directly in the}} molten salt coolant. Molten salt-fueled reactors, such as the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR), are different from molten salt-cooled reactors that do not dissolve nuclear fuel in <b>the</b> <b>coolant.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> reactors' <b>coolant</b> pipes {{have been}} plagued by {{vibrations}} and cracking with substantial cracking in <b>the</b> reactor <b>coolant</b> system.

It was found that mixing in the inlet plenum was slight, and flow from a given loop is corfined mainly to its quadrant of the core.

50|$|A {{new class}} of {{coolants}} are nanofluids which consist of a carrier liquid, such as water, dispersed with tiny nano-scale particles known as nanoparticles. Purpose-designed nanoparticles of e.g. CuO, alumina, titanium dioxide, carbon nanotubes, silica, or metals (e.g. copper, or silver nanorods) dispersed into the carrier liquid enhance the heat transfer capabilities of <b>the</b> resulting <b>coolant</b> compared to <b>the</b> carrier liquid alone. The enhancement can be theoretically as high as 350%. The experiments however did not prove so high thermal conductivity improvements, but found significant increase of the critical heat flux of <b>the</b> <b>coolants.</b>|$|R
25|$|Molten salt {{reactors}} (MSRs) {{are cooled}} by circulating a molten salt, typically a eutectic mixture of fluoride salts, such as FLiBe. In a typical MSR, <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> {{is also used}} as a matrix in which the fissile material is dissolved.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the major}} nuclear {{accidents}} have been directly attributable to operator or human error. This was obviously {{the case in the}} analysis of both the Chernobyl and TMI-2 accidents. At Chernobyl, a test procedure was being conducted prior to the accident. The leaders of the test permitted operators to disable and ignore key protection circuits and warnings that would have normally shut the reactor down. At TMI-2, operators permitted thousands of gallons of water to escape from the reactor plant before observing that <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps were behaving abnormally. <b>The</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps were thus turned off to protect the pumps, which in turn led to the destruction of the reactor itself as cooling was completely lost within the core.|$|E
25|$|Using lead as {{the liquid}} metal {{provides}} excellent radiation shielding, {{and allows for}} operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in <b>the</b> <b>coolant,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a lead-bismuth eutectic mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it {{is not quite as}} transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian Alfa class submarine uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.|$|E
40|$|Power {{transients}} {{were initiated}} in the HIFAR Materials Testing Reactor by altering both {{the temperature of}} <b>the</b> primary <b>coolant</b> circuit and <b>the</b> flow rate of <b>the</b> primary <b>coolant.</b> Analysis of <b>the</b> time variation of the reactor power and the D 2 O temperature provided information about the flow of D 2 O in the reactor aluminium tank and the time response of the negative power coefficient. The experimental power transients were compared with calculations carried out with the HIDYN code, which combines the neutron kinetics with <b>the</b> primary <b>coolant</b> characteristics...|$|R
5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} <b>the</b> {{combustion}} chamber <b>coolant</b> bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass <b>the</b> nozzle <b>coolant</b> loop, thus controlling its temperature. <b>The</b> chamber <b>coolant</b> valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} type is an {{electric}} heating element in the cylinder block, connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in <b>the</b> engine's <b>coolant,</b> which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. Some heaters pump and circulate <b>the</b> engine <b>coolant</b> while heating, others only heat <b>the</b> still <b>coolant</b> in <b>the</b> reservoir.|$|R
25|$|Distributed Vapour/Spiral flow: This {{design is}} that of a condenser, and is usually mounted vertically.

25|$|About 80–85% of {{the core}} thermal power is removed by the fuel rod coolant channels, via the {{graphite}} rings. The rest of the heat is removed by the control rod channel coolant.

25|$|The reactor is {{equipped}} with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS), consisting of dedicated water reserve tank, hydraulic accumulators, and pumps. ECCS piping is integrated with the normal reactor cooling system. In case of total loss of power, the ECCS pumps {{are supposed to be}} powered by the rotational momentum of the turbogenerator rotor for the time before the diesel generators come online. The Chernobyl disaster occurred during a botched test of this system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> system headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.|$|E
