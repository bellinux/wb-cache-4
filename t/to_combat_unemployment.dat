40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of an employment reform from the year 2014. It is a top-down analysis of policy instruments applied by the State to pursue an active employment policy. The analysis operates with Christopher Hood’s four policy instruments: nodality, authority, treasure and organization. It specifically focuses upon {{the parts of the}} reform which are means <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> long-term <b>unemployment.</b> The background for the analysis is the social and political context which the employment policy tradition and the characteristics of the group of long-term unemployed are parts of. The nature, scope and strength of the policy instruments are compared in relation to the three relevant target groups: long-term unemployed, local employment centres and firms. It is concluded that the instruments of the active employment measures in the reform in scope and strength mainly are targeted at the long-term unemployed rather than firms.
