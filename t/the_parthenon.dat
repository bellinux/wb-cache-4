50|$|<b>The</b> Old <b>Parthenon</b> {{was still}} under {{construction}} when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and razed the acropolis. The existence of the proto‐Parthenon and its destruction was known from Herodotus and the drums of its columns were plainly visible built into the curtain wall north of the Erechtheum. Further material evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of Panagiotis Kavvadias of 1885-1890. The findings of this dig allowed Wilhelm Dörpfeld, then director of the German Archaeological Institute, to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to <b>the</b> original <b>Parthenon,</b> called Parthenon I by Dörpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed. Dörpfeld’s observation was that the three steps of <b>the</b> first <b>Parthenon</b> consist of two steps of poros limestone, {{the same as the}} foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of <b>the</b> Periclean <b>Parthenon.</b> This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of <b>the</b> final <b>Parthenon,</b> indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now wholly covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885-90 excavations indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.|$|R

5|$|In Eakins' oeuvre, The Swimming Hole was {{immediately}} {{preceded by a}} number of similar works on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from <b>the</b> <b>Parthenon</b> marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 Arcadia, a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parthenon</b> frieze is the high-relief pentelic marble {{sculpture}} {{created to}} adorn {{the upper part}} of the Parthenon’s naos. It was sculpted between c. 443 and 438 BC, most likely under the direction of Pheidias. Of the 160 meters (524ft) of the original frieze, 128 meters (420ft) survivessome 80 percent. The rest is known only from the drawings attributed to French artist Jacques Carrey in 1674, thirteen years before the Venetian bombardment that ruined the temple.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} temples built on Capitoline hill: {{the temple of}} Juno Moneta, the temple of Virtus, and the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus {{is the most important}} of the temples.

5|$|In 1831, the Indiana General Assembly {{approved}} {{construction of}} a new statehouse. The building was to be funded by the sale of lots of land in Indianapolis. A commission was established and Commissioner James Blake offered a $150 prize to the architect who could design the best statehouse. The firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis created the winning design. Their plans were for a structure that was inspired by the ancient Greek Parthenon. The building looked very much like <b>the</b> <b>Parthenon</b> except for a large central dome. Town and Davis was awarded the contract to construct the building, and completed it ahead of schedule in 1835.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Older <b>Parthenon</b> or Pre‐Parthenon, {{as it is}} {{frequently}} referred to, constitutes the first endeavour to build a sanctuary for Athena Parthenos {{on the site of}} <b>the</b> present <b>Parthenon</b> on <b>the</b> Acropolis of Athens. It was begun shortly after the battle of Marathon (c. 490-88 BC) upon a massive limestone foundation that extended and leveled {{the southern part of the}} Acropolis summit. This building replaced a hekatompedon (meaning [...] "hundred‐footer") and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated to Athena Polias.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parthenon</b> frieze is the {{defining}} monument of the High Classical style of Attic sculpture. It stands between the gradual {{eclipse of the}} Severe style, as witnessed on <b>the</b> <b>Parthenon</b> metopes, {{and the evolution of}} the Late Classical Rich style, exemplified by the Nike balustrade. What sources the designer of the frieze drew upon is difficult to gauge, certainly large scale narrative art was familiar to 5th-century Athenians as in the Stoa poikile painting by Polygnotos of Thasos. While there is an overall coherence to the work there are design differences on opposing sides of the frieze that has suggested to some scholars the possibility of more than one designer and a pattern of influence amongst them. There is greater nudity and frontally on the north than the south, the massing and distribution of figures is greatly different on the east than the more widely spaced west, and the east and north generally exhibit greater innovation. This evidence, along with the frequency with which Greek artists are thought to have collaborated, has led Jenifer Neils to hypothesize the existence of two designers working on the sculpture. This would admit the possibility of a later designer comparing and competing with the earlier, and so, explain the observable changes in composition. Geographical orientations also may have dictated what would be represented on one side versus another, i.e., Amazons to the west, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Shrine {{is based on the}} ancient Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and <b>the</b> <b>Parthenon</b> in Athens. It is a {{structure}} of square plan roofed by a stepped pyramid and entered on the north and south through classical porticos, each of eight fluted Doric columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrine sits. The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford, representing Peace, Justice, Patriotism and Sacrifice. The Art Deco style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is Neo-Classical.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief {{sculpture}} of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes a debt to <b>the</b> <b>Parthenon.</b> There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} <b>the</b> <b>Parthenon</b> frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parthenon</b> Marbles {{acquired}} by Elgin include some 21 {{figures from the}} statuary from {{the east and west}} pediments, 15 of an original 92 metope panels depicting battles between the Lapiths and the Centaurs, as well as 247 feet (or 75m) of <b>the</b> <b>Parthenon</b> Frieze which decorated the horizontal course set above the interior architrave of the temple.
