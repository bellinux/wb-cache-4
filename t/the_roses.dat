5|$|About {{a century}} later, a new mansion was {{constructed}} on land {{that had been}} reclaimed from the Thames, southeast of the first castle. The house was rebuilt after 1428, and became the London headquarters of the House of York during the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses.</b> Both King Edward IV and Queen Mary I of England were crowned at the castle.|$|E
5|$|During the War of <b>the</b> <b>Roses</b> between 1455 and 1485, fought by {{the rival}} factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists, Conwy was reinforced, but played little {{part in the}} fighting. Henry VIII {{conducted}} restoration work in the 1520s and 1530s, during which time the castle was {{being used as a}} prison, a depot and as a potential residence for visitors.|$|E

5|$|John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses.</b> The Clifford family {{was one of}} the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century; and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon. He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses,</b> the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland's {{marriage}} to Eleanor Neville produced {{at least ten}} children. Henry Percy was succeeded by his son Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, who himself died fighting in the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses,</b> at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461.|$|E
5|$|Percy married Eleanor Poynings, who outlived him; {{together}} they had four children. He {{was a leading}} Lancastrian during the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses,</b> from which he managed to personally benefit, although his father died early in the war. He was not, however, to live to enjoy these gains, being killed at the Battle of Towton in 1461 on the defeated Lancastrian side.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the House of Plantagenet's two cadet {{branches}} of York and Lancaster {{brought about the}} Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses,</b> a decades-long fight for the English succession, culminating in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when {{the reign of the}} Plantagenets and the English Middle Ages both met their end with the death of King Richard III. Henry VII, of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; two years later, he married Elizabeth of York, thus ending the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses,</b> and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid {{some of the problems that}} had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers. The resulting stability allowed for the English Renaissance, and the advent of early modern Britain.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power {{at the end of}} the turbulent Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses,</b> followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E

5|$|Edward III {{gave the}} castle {{to his own}} son, Edmund of Langley, the Duke of York, who {{controlled}} it until 1402. Edmund's eldest son, Edward, owned it until 1415, when it passed to Maud Clifford, the widow of Edmund's younger son Richard, who lived there until 1446. Richard of York then inherited the castle, and on his death in 1460 during the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses</b> it passed to his son Edward, who seized the throne in 1461, bringing Conisbrough back into Crown ownership once again.|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} {{stripped}} of his armour and left for dead on the battlefield at Barnet, but he was alive—though gravely injured. His followers found him {{and took him to}} Westminster Abbey. On his recovery, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for four years before submitting to Edward's rule. Exeter did not participate in the later battles of the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses.</b> Edward sent him on a Yorkist expedition to France in 1475, and the duke was reported to have fallen overboard and drowned without any witnesses.|$|E
5|$|For 19 years, {{the castle}} {{served as a}} prison for John I, Duke of Bourbon after he was taken at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. His {{custodian}} was a Nicholas Montgomery the Younger. Nineteenth-century local historian John Joseph Briggs claimed that during the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses,</b> the castle was partially dismantled by the Lancastrian forces of Margaret of Anjou, but since her campaign was {{along the line of}} the Great North Road, it was Melbourn, Cambridgeshire she sacked, not its Derbyshire namesake.|$|E

5|$|Humphrey Stafford, 1st Earl of Devon (ca. 143917 August 1469) was a {{dominant}} magnate in south-western England in the mid-15th century, and {{a participant in}} the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses.</b> A distant relative of the earls of Stafford, Humphrey Stafford became the greatest landowner in the county of Dorset through fortunes of inheritance. Later, Stafford was one of several men promoted rapidly through the nobility by King Edward IV, to fill the power vacuum left by dead or forfeit Lancastrians. In the West Country it was particularly the forfeitures of the Lancastrian Courtenay family that benefited Stafford. In 1469 he received the Courtenay title of earl of Devon.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, Northumberland occasionally {{served with the}} king in France, but his main occupation was {{the protection of the}} border to Scotland. At the same time, a feud with the Neville family was developing, particularly with Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury. This feud became entangled with the conflict between the Duke of York and the Duke of Somerset over control of national government. The conflict culminated in the first battle of the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses,</b> at St Albans, where both Somerset and Northumberland were killed.|$|E

5|$|Later in the century, {{a series}} of civil wars known as the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses</b> broke out between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster and York. After the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Harlech formed a refuge for Queen Margaret of Anjou, and between 1461–68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, {{under the command of}} Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. Thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and {{eventually}} became the last major stronghold still under Lancasterian control. It finally fell after a month's siege, the events credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.|$|E
5|$|Martin's inspirations {{included}} the Wars of <b>the</b> <b>Roses</b> and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon. A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal {{of women and}} religion, {{as well as its}} realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a certain}} red <b>rose.</b> <b>The</b> {{proposition}} that <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> is red is true because <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> is red. One might say {{as well that}} the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> is red is made true by <b>the</b> <b>rose’s</b> being red. This, it has been thought, does not commit one to a truthmaker of the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> is red. For there is no entity that makes the proposition true. What makes it true is how <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> is, and how <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> is is not an entity over and above <b>the</b> <b>rose.</b> It is against this view that I shall argue in this paper. I shall argue that a signiﬁcant class of true propositions, including inessential predications like the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>rose</b> is red, are made true by entities. "No truthmaking without truthmakers" is my slogan. Although I have my view about what kinds of entities are truthmakers, I shall not argue for or presuppose that view here. All I shall argue for here {{is that if a}} proposition is made true by something, it is made true by some thing, but my argument will leave it open what kind of thing that thing is: it could be a fact or state of affairs, a trope, or any other sort of entity...|$|R
