5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E

25|$|The goal {{of local}} helioseismology, a term first used in 1993, is to {{interpret}} the full wave field observed at the surface, not just the mode (more precisely, eigenmode) frequencies. Another way <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> is that global helioseismology studies standing waves of the entire Sun and local helioseismology studies propagating waves {{in parts of the}} Sun. A variety of solar phenomena are being studied, including sunspots, plage, supergranulation, giant cell convection, magnetically active region evolution, meridional circulation, and solar rotation. Local helioseismology provides a three-dimensional view of the solar interior, which is important to understand large-scale flows, magnetic structures, and their interactions in the solar interior.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).|$|E
25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located {{on either side of the}} infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.|$|E

Naughty Dog's Jak & Daxter series and the Ratchet & Clank series are in similar genres; each game in both series' has been released at a similar time and both contain references to each other. Ryan Schneider, an employee of Insomniac, said, [...] "The analogy that I like to use is that at Insomniac we like <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as how Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant act {{when it comes to}} their professions. We don't really look at it as how we compare to other athletes or other games, we just try to do the best that we can and elevate the sport." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> [...] through rose colored glasses, because when you think back on your memories of that time period— no matter what age you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep coming back, and each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast to the reality of life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles asked {{producer}} Martin {{to come to}} the rescue, so {{he borrowed}} two four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a studio with portable equipment. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> but they weren’t interested at all".|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first.

500|$|The main lyricist, Junko Kudo, {{wrote the}} lyrics to {{four of the five}} vocal tracks and had no {{previous}} experience with video game-related projects; she was surprised by the length of the game's script when she asked <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> She had never met Mitsuda before she was asked to write the lyrics. Mitsuda first heard her work in a song by Mimori Yusa on Yusa's 1988 album Hitomi Suishō, and describes himself as being very moved by the lyrics and becaomming a big fan of Kudo's work. Although Mitsuda has said that he is generally not confident in his personal skills at writing lyrics, he wrote those of the title track, which were then translated from Japanese to Gaelic for the recording. Celtic singer Joanne Hogg of the band Iona, who was the singer from the original soundtrack, did not reprise her role in Creid. Instead, Tetsuko Honma sang the four tracks written by Kudo, while Eimear Quinn sang [...] "Creid".|$|E

500|$|Several players thought having over 150 players wearing number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day {{was far too}} many. [...] "This is {{supposed}} to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told USA Today, [...] "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." [...] "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number.

500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{from the point of}} view of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E
