25|$|The {{following}} cladogram {{shows the}} relationship between various subgenera and sections. It summarizes the results of two studies (Jobson et al. 2003; Müller et al. 2004), following Müller et al. 2006. Since the sections Aranella and Vesiculina are polyphyletic, <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> multiple times in the cladogram (*). Some monotypic sections have not {{been included in the}} study, so that their place in this system is unclear. Sections that are not included below are Candollea, Chelidon, Choristothecae, Kamienskia, Martinia, Meionula, Mirabiles, Oliveria, Setiscapella, Sprucea, Steyermarkia, and Stylotheca in subgenus Utricularia; Minutae in subgenus Bivalvaria; and Tridentaria in subgenus Polypompholyx.|$|E
25|$|Besides a lot {{of former}} players who still are fans of the club, there are also many celebrities who openly {{announce}} to be a Feyenoord fan. Singer Lee Towers and actor Gerard Cox are known as the most fanatic Feyenoord fans around, talking about the team wherever <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on TV, radio or magazines. Among other famous Feyenoord fans are politicians Wouter Bos and Jan Marijnissen, baseball manager Robert Eenhoorn, kidnapped Arjan Erkel, judo world champion Dennis van der Geest, DJ Paul Elstak, tennis player Raemon Sluiter and TV star Renate Verbaan. Sluiter, Towers, Van der Geest and Eenhoorn have all officially been Feyenoord ambassadors. Verbaan is the current and first ever female ambassador.|$|E
25|$|Every {{single year}} Feyenoord fans {{look forward to}} the club's first {{training}} of the new season. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> with thousands together and temporary stands are placed around the training pitch. Players signed during the summer will be seen by the fans in public {{for the first time and}} the players take some time to sign autographs after the training. Around the training pitch there are several other activities held before the first and in between the first and second training of the day. No other club in the Netherlands attracts as much supporters towards the first training and the new players are positively surprised every year. Despite finishing 9th in the Eredivisie in the 2006–07 season for instance the first training of the 2007–08 season broke all records when 20,000 fans showed up to support the team and to erase the previous season out of their minds.|$|E

2500|$|A forum, {{sponsored}} by the American Legion, was held between Betty Chu and Christopher Agrella. [...] Judy Chu was originally scheduled to participate but dropped out to do a fundraiser. [...] Judy Chu also did not attend a forum {{sponsored by}} Looking Green, leading to the cancellation of the forum, since the remaining candidates felt it was unnecessary due to their similar positions on the issues. [...] The Judy Chu campaign explained their reason for not attending was to spend {{the last days of}} the campaign contacting voters and making sure <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> for the election, which was expected to have low turnout.|$|E

50|$|Nirvana {{joined up}} with the {{relatively}} unknown Teenage Fanclubto at the festival in 1992. Pearl Jam were going to play in 1992, but had to cancel. <b>They</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> the following year at the festival.|$|R

6000|$|... "You see I've {{only been}} in here a couple of months. It was a pretty tough looking place when I came to it. But I've been getting things fixed. First thing I did I put those two carboys in the window with the lights behind them. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> fine, don't they?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were careful}} not to cross the Colonel's path--he had served his turn, {{and they would not}} out-wear their welcome--nor did <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on the sky-line when they could move in cover. The shelter of the gorze by the cliff-edge was their chosen retreat. Beetle christened it the Pleasant Isle of Aves, for the peace and the shelter of it; and here, the pipes and tobacco once cache'd in a {{convenient}} ledge an arm's length down the cliff, their position was legally unassailable.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is uncertain. For some {{hours in}} a darkened room, the light {{gradually}} growing fainter, but if a bright day follows, the figures stand out on the following night as brightly as before; while if the day is dull <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> but faintly at night. I see not that any use can come of such a thing, for the light is at all times too faint {{to be used for}} reading unless the page is held quite close to it. Come downstairs with me and I will show you the head of one of the old Roman statues that was dug up near Rochester, and which I bought for a few pence last year." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's curious," [...] Mr. Hilbery continued, {{agreeing with}} his daughter, [...] "how {{the sight of}} one's fellow-enthusiasts always chokes one off. <b>They</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> the faults of one's cause so much more plainly than one's antagonists. One can be {{enthusiastic}} in one's study, but directly one comes into touch {{with the people who}} agree with one, all the glamor goes. So I've always found," [...] and he proceeded to tell them, as he peeled his apple, how he committed himself once, in his youthful days, to make a speech at a political meeting, and went there ablaze with enthusiasm for the ideals of his own side; but while his leaders spoke, he became gradually converted to the other way of thinking, if thinking it could be called, and had to feign illness in order to avoid making a fool of himself--an experience which had sickened him of public meetings.|$|E
60|$|We pass {{again through}} the pine woods in the valley, and cross the Arve; then up the {{mountain}} side to where a tiny cascade throws up its feathery spray in a brilliant jet d'eau. Every body knows, even in our sober New England, that mountain brooks are a frisky, indiscreet set, rattling, chattering, and capering in defiance of all law and order, tumbling over precipices, and picking themselves up at the bottom, no whit wiser or more disposed to be tranquil than {{they were at the}} top; in fact, seeming to grow more mad and frolicsome with every leap. Well, that is just the way brooks do here in the Alps, and the people, taking advantage of it, have built a little shanty, where <b>they</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> the capers of this child of the mountain, as if he tumbled for their special profit. Here, of course, in the shanty are the agates, and the carved work, and so forth, and so on, and you must buy something for a souvenir.|$|E

50|$|Despite his {{abilities}} and track record, {{he was never}} presented the opportunity to design a class of entirely-new locomotives that were produced in any numbers. He was continually stymied by railway management and politicians, and often his superbly performing locomotives were treated as embarrassments by his superiors, because <b>they</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> the poor performance of the officially approved locomotives.|$|R

50|$|Although this wine {{region has}} a long history of {{winemaking}} neither the colour nor quality of the earliest wines is now known. In the Kraichgau the high noble Counts of Katzenelnbogen received their title and were famous for supporting viticulture since the 12th. century.
