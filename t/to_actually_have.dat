25|$|The 1953 Chrysler Imperial was {{the first}} {{production}} car in twelve years <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> automotive air conditioning, following tentative experiments by Packard in 1940 and Cadillac in 1941. Walter P.

25|$|This was {{the first}} Super Bowl to be {{televised}} in the United States by ABC, joining the annual broadcasting rotation of the game with CBS and NBC. It {{was also the first}} time that the sitting U.S. president participated in the coin toss ceremony; Ronald Reagan appeared live via satellite from the White House and tossed the coin. This Super Bowl was unique in that it fell on the same day that he was inaugurated for a second term; because Inauguration Day (January 20) fell on a Sunday, Reagan was sworn in privately and the public ceremony took place the following day. It was also only the second Super Bowl in the game's history in which one of the teams could have been considered <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> had home-field advantage, as Stanford Stadium was located in the 49ers' home market -- just 30 miles from San Francisco proper and the 49ers' then-home stadium, Candlestick Park. Super Bowl XVIII, the previous Super Bowl, and Super Bowl XIX became the only time the winning teams have scored the same number of points on consecutive Super Bowls (the Los Angeles Raiders scored 38 points as well in their victory over the Washington Redskins).|$|E

500|$|Shannon's flashbacks in [...] "Abandoned" [...] {{were used}} to allow the {{audience}} {{to get to a}} [...] "really emotional level with the character, [...] finally understand ... why she was the way she was." [...] Her death was planned before the start of season two, as the producers wanted the survivors in the tail section of the plane and the survivors of the fuselage to be forced to come together under difficult circumstances. Her death was also used to [...] "spin Sayid off in another direction." [...] Damon Lindelof commented [...] "It's sort of understood on Lost that that's what you sign up for. There's going to be constant character turnover, because the stakes on the Island are life-or-death." [...] Lindelof felt an [...] "intense, emotional sense of loss" [...] when watching her death.

There wasn't too much time spent {{sitting in a chair}} thinking." [...] Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that, [...] "there was too much to say," [...] following Cobain's death and, [...] "a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album." [...] Grohl still considered that [...] "the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I look at them and some of them seem <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> meaning", and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by [...] "personal experiences of {{the last four or five}} years", with the standout being [...] "Big Me", an [...] "out-and-out love song" [...] to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album.

However, dissenters, supporters of opposition parties and Jews did not share in this growth and found themselves discriminated against, imprisoned or forced to close their businesses and leave town.

During World War II the city was bombed extensively, requiring major reconstructive programmes following the war's end.|$|R
