5|$|The corona, or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup shaped) or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely the corona is a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see <b>Table</b> <b>I)</b> or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, <b>Table</b> <b>I).</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they have a higher incidence of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, <b>Table</b> <b>I).</b>|$|E
5|$|Flower {{orientation}} {{varies from}} pendent or deflexed (hanging down) as in N. triandrus (see illustration, left), through declinate-ascendant as in N. alpestris = N. pseudonarcissus subsp. moschatus, horizontal (patent, spreading) such as N. gaditanus or N. poeticus, erect as in N. cavanillesii, N. serotinus and N. rupicola (<b>Table</b> <b>I),</b> or intermediate between these positions (erecto-patent).|$|E

5|$|While the {{perianth}} may point forwards, in {{some species}} such as N. cyclamineus it is folded back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while in some other {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium (<b>Table</b> <b>I),</b> it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona.|$|E
5|$|The {{inflorescence}} is scapose, {{the single}} stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel {{with up to}} 20 blooms. Species bearing a solitary flower include section Bulbocodium and most of section Pseudonarcissus. Umbellate species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence (unbranched, with short floral stalks) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers, such as N. papyraceus (see illustration, left) and N. tazetta (see <b>Table</b> <b>I).</b> The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be either with (pedicellate) or without (sessile) floral stalks.|$|E
5|$|Child {{marriage}} (including {{union or}} cohabitation) {{is defined as}} marriage {{under the age of}} eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. The practice is commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls married before the age of eighteen is as high as 75% in countries such as Niger (Nour, <b>Table</b> <b>I).</b> Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls to boys is 72:1, while in countries such as the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.|$|E

25|$|Many {{retailers}} in the US {{have created}} corporate policies restricting {{the sale of}} pseudoephedrine-containing products. Their policies restrict sales by limiting purchase quantities and requiring a minimum age with proper identification. These requirements are similar to and sometimes more stringent than existing law. Internationally, pseudoephedrine is listed as a <b>Table</b> <b>I</b> precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.|$|E
25|$|The boron {{framework}} of YAlB14 needs donation of four electrons from metal elements: two electrons for a B12 icosahedron and one electron {{for each of}} the two bridging boron atoms – to support their tetrahedral coordination. The actual chemical composition of YAlB14, determined by the structure analysis, is Y0.62Al0.71B14 as described in <b>table</b> <b>I.</b> If both metal elements are trivalent ions then 3.99 electrons can be transferred to the boron framework, which is very close to the required value of 4. However, because the bonding between the bridging boron atoms is weaker than in a typical B-B covalent bond, less than 2 electrons are donated to this bond, and metal atoms need not be trivalent. On the other hand, the electron transfer from metal atoms to the boron framework implies that not only strong covalent B-B bonding within the framework but also ionic interaction between metal atoms and the framework contribute to the YAlB14 phase stabilization.|$|E

25|$|Legal {{requirements}} for tank size vary greatly {{from country to}} country. In the US, the minimum enclosure size is set by the Code of Federal Regulations, 9 CFR E § 3.104, under the Specifications for the Humane Handling, Care, Treatment, and Transportation of Marine Mammals. In 9 CFR 3.104, Table III classifies killer whales as Group I cetaceans with an average length of 24feet (7.315meters). Based on length, <b>Table</b> <b>I</b> states up to two killer whales may be held in a pool with a minimum horizontal dimension (the diameter of a circular pool of water) of twice that length or 48feet (14.63meters) and a minimum depth of 12feet (3.66m), giving a minimum volume of 615m3 for two killer whales. Each additional killer whale requires a pool with an additional 308m3 of volume. 9 CFR 3.104 also requires a minimum of 63m2 surface area per killer whale in Table IV (the example with a cylindrical tank 7.315m in diameter for two whales provides 84m2 of surface area per killer whale). Swiss regulations require a larger minimum volume: 400 m2 x 4.0m deep for two killer whales, or 1,600m3. The Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA) goes further, and recommends 1,918 m3 for two killer whales. The US exhibitors of captive killer whales belong to the AMMPA, but exhibitors in other countries do not.|$|E
