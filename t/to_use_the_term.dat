5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that {{his use of the}} word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, who was the first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> in a publication.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Danish Bacon and Meat Council {{commissioned}} {{research at}} Leeds University into what features make a perfect bacon butty (the researchers refused <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> sandwich deeming {{this to be}} incorrect terminology). Among the findings were that texture and crispiness of the bacon were {{just as important as}} taste.|$|E
5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of area, it is common <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> surface energy, which is a more general term {{in the sense that}} it applies also to solids.|$|E
50|$|For the E-10 and E-20 digital cameras, {{while some}} journalists {{continued}} to apply <b>the</b> <b>term</b> ZLR, Olympus themselves reverted <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> SLR.|$|R
50|$|FCIR {{reported}} {{that state of}} Florida officials allegedly ordered employees of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> global warming, climate change, and sustainability in their communications.|$|R
2500|$|Official cricket won {{a series}} of minor {{victories}} – Packer was unable <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> [...] "Test match" [...] or call their team of Australians [...] "Australia", or <b>use</b> <b>the</b> official rules of cricket, which are the copyright of the MCC.|$|R
5|$|From 1972 to 2006, {{dramatic}} reductions {{continued in}} the number of feral honey bees in the U.S. and a significant though somewhat gradual decline {{in the number of}} colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Adriaan van Maanen {{discovered}} Van Maanen's Star, {{an isolated}} white dwarf. These three white dwarfs, the first discovered, are the so-called classical white dwarfs., p.2 Eventually, many faint white stars were found which had high proper motion, {{indicating that they}} could be suspected to be low-luminosity stars close to the Earth, and hence white dwarfs. Willem Luyten appears to have been the first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> white dwarf when he examined this class of stars in 1922; the term was later popularized by Arthur Stanley Eddington. Despite these suspicions, the first non-classical white dwarf was not definitely identified until the 1930s. 18 white dwarfs had been discovered by 1939., p.3 Luyten and others continued to search for white dwarfs in the 1940s. By 1950, over a hundred were known, and by 1999, over 2,000 were known. Since then the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has found over 9,000 white dwarfs, mostly new.|$|E
25|$|Martin Ohm (1792–1872) is {{believed}} to be the first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> goldener Schnitt (golden section) to describe this ratio, in 1835.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, newer {{grammatical}} {{descriptions of}} the Germanic languages often avoid <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "weak" [...] except in conjunction with German itself, preferring instead <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> [...] "indefinite" [...] and [...] "definite" [...] for adjectives and to distinguish nouns by their actual stem class.|$|R
2500|$|Some artists, e.g. the Viennese Actionists and neo-Dadaists, prefer <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> [...] "live art", [...] "action art", [...] "actions", [...] "intervention" [...] (see art intervention) or [...] "manoeuvre" [...] to {{describe}} their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear body art, fluxus-performance, happening, action poetry, and intermedia.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> word [...] "tiling" [...] is {{problematic}} as well, despite its straightforward definition. There {{is no single}} Penrose tiling, for example: the Penrose rhombs admit infinitely many tilings (which cannot be distinguished locally). A common solution is <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> carefully in technical writing, but recognize <b>the</b> widespread <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> informal <b>terms.</b>|$|R
25|$|Academic colleges: Any {{educational}} facility {{that had been}} approved to offer at least bachelor's degree is entitled by CHE <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> academic college in its name.|$|E
25|$|Parliament began <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> bumiputra in 1965. Following {{debate of}} the act to create the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA), the {{government}} founded an agency to preserve bumiputra interests.|$|E
25|$|After the Second World War, {{the country}} joined the United Nations as simply ‘New Zealand’. A year later in 1946, Prime Minister Peter Fraser {{instructed}} government departments not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> ‘Dominion’ any longer.|$|E
50|$|HDS moved <b>to</b> {{marketing}} <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> cloud computing, culminating with {{an announcement}} on October 25, 2011.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Athabaskan is {{prevalent}} in linguistics and anthropology, {{there is an}} increasing trend among scholars <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> Dené and Dené languages, which is how their native speakers identify it. They are applying these <b>terms</b> to <b>the</b> entire language family. For example, following a motion by attendees in 2012, the annual Athabaskan Languages Conference {{changed its name to}} the Dené Languages Conference.|$|R
30|$|In the {{managerial}} literature (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Lane and Lubatkin 1998; Todorova and Durisin 2007), absorptive and desorptive capacity are generally <b>used</b> <b>to</b> refer to an organization. That said, {{in accordance with}} Paulsen and Hjertø (2010), {{it would be more}} correct <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>to</b> refer to the sum of individuals/groups/divisions of A/DCAP which is clearly positively related to group/division/individual knowledge transfer.|$|R
25|$|It was at {{this time}} that the term Cantopop was first coined. The Billboard {{correspondent}} Hans Ebert, who had earlier coined the term Cantorock in 1974, noted a change in its style to something similar to British-American soft rock, therefore started <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Cantopop instead in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Later {{during the}} 2000s, the IHSA relinquished its {{ownership}} {{share in the}} trademark, although it retained the right <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> in association with high school championships. During October 2010, the NCAA reached a settlement with Intersport, paying $17.2 million for the latter company's license to use the trademark.|$|E
25|$|Reggae {{had success}} on the radio charts in Australia in the early 1980s when Toots and the Maytals, the first artist <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> “reggae” in song, went to number one with their song “Beautiful Woman”. Early reggae groups from Australia {{included}} JJ Roberts, No Fixed Address, The Igniters, and Untabu featuring Ron Jemmott.|$|E

50|$|For over a year, the WDTA and Saniel & Linda {{engaged in}} {{confidential}} negotiations to craft an agreement designating the WDTA as Saniel & Linda’s sole licensee authorized <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> “Waking Down” and “Waking Down in Mutuality” to brand its teachers’ work and course offerings. On June 6, 2015, Saniel, Linda, and their attorney terminated negotiations {{and indicated that}} the WDTA should rename itself and its work within a reasonable transition period.|$|R
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{a number of}} {{scholars}} adopted the traditional, negative concept of magic. That they chose to do so was not inevitable, for they could have followed the example adopted by prominent esotericists active at the time like Helena Blavatsky who had chosen <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> and concept of magic in a positive sense.|$|E
25|$|The {{only one}} of the late 1st/early 2nd Century Apostolic Fathers <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> is Polycarp (c. 69 – c. 155) who warned the Philippians that {{everyone}} who preached false doctrine was an antichrist. His use of the term Antichrist follows that of the New Testament in not identifying a single personal Antichrist, but a class of people.|$|E
25|$|To {{moderate}} the euphemistic {{aspect of the}} word developing, international organizations have started <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> less economically developed country (LEDCs) for the poorest nations—which can, in no sense, be regarded as developing. That is, LEDCs are the poorest subset of LDCs. This may moderate against {{a belief that the}} standard of living across the entire developing world is the same.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{emphasis}} in this report on adolescent risk behaviors, {{it is important to}} note that many young people do make healthy choices and do not become engaged in behaviors that threaten their health or safety. Social scientists, in an effort to understand why some youth develop a pattern of risky behavior while others do not, have come <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> “protective factors ” or “developmental assets ” to designate thos...|$|R
50|$|Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicle, or GARVEE, {{is a type}} of bond {{or similar}} {{financing}} method issued by a state or state infrastructure bank under the guidelines of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, eventually made permanent in section 122 of Title 23 of the United States Code. States must repay <b>the</b> bonds <b>using</b> federal funds expected to be received in the future. Some financing under this plan is referred <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Grant Anticipation Note (GAN).|$|R
30|$|In the {{literature}} {{as well as}} in practice, <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> compliance programs/training and ethics programs/training are used often interchangeably, we chose <b>to</b> <b>use</b> only <b>the</b> <b>term</b> compliance.|$|R
25|$|Alice Ann Bailey (June 16, 1880– December 15, 1949) was {{a writer}} of more than twenty-four books on theosophical subjects, {{and was one of}} the first writers <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> New Age. Bailey was born as Alice La Trobe-Bateman, in Manchester, England. She moved to the United States in 1907, where she spent most of her life as a writer and teacher.|$|E
25|$|In 1801, he {{published}} Système des animaux sans vertèbres, a major {{work on the}} classification of invertebrates, a term he coined. In an 1802 publication {{he became one of}} the first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> biology in its modern sense. Lamarck continued his work as a premier authority on invertebrate zoology. He is remembered, at least in malacology, as a taxonomist of considerable stature.|$|E
25|$|In 1802 Lamarck {{published}} Hydrogéologie, {{and became}} one of the first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> biology in its modern sense. In Hydrogéologie, Lamarck advocated a steady-state geology based on a strict uniformitarianism. He argued that global currents tended to flow from east to west, and continents eroded on their eastern borders, with the material carried across to be deposited on the western borders. Thus, the Earth's continents marched steadily westward around the globe.|$|E
2500|$|British chemist John Herschel {{made many}} {{contributions}} to the new field. He invented the cyanotype process, later familiar as the [...] "blueprint". He was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> [...] "photography", [...] "negative" [...] and [...] "positive". He had discovered in 1819 that sodium thiosulphate was a solvent of silver halides, and in 1839 he informed Talbot (and, indirectly, Daguerre) {{that it could be}} <b>used</b> <b>to</b> [...] "fix" [...] silver-halide-based photographs and make them completely light-fast. He made the first glass negative in late 1839.|$|R
30|$|It {{has become}} quite {{conventional}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> «method» and «methodology» as synonyms. However, there are convincing philosophical reasons for distinguishing the two. Method connotes a systematic and repeatable {{way of doing}} something - a procedure. Methodology connotes a discourse about methods, i.e., an argumentation about the adequacy and appropriateness of particular combinations of research principles and procedures. As such, a methodology is methods of knowing, it reveals both ontological and epistemological implications, {{and it does not}} come without its own kind of philosophical baggage.|$|R
25|$|Mass {{spectroscopy}} is {{an historical}} term <b>used</b> <b>to</b> refer to mass spectrometry. Current recommendations are <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> latter <b>term.</b> <b>Use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> mass spectroscopy originated in <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of phosphor screens to detect ions.|$|R
