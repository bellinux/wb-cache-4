50|$|The most simple {{mitigation}} {{strategy would}} be for workers to abstain from entering the storage bin, especially within {{three to four weeks}} following the addition of new silage. In the event that a worker is required to enter the silo, the unit should be ventilated (with a silage blower or ventilation fans) for a minimum of 30 minutes prior to entry, with ventilation fans running for the duration that the worker is in the bin. Additional ventilation time is necessary when the silo diameter is greater than 24 feet or if the silage surface is greater than 15 feet from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unloading also poses its {{own special}} hazards, due to the {{requirement}} that the farmer regularly climb the silo to close an upper door and open a lower door, moving the unloader chute from door to door in the process. The fermentation of the silage produces methane gas which over time will outgas and displace the oxygen in the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo.</b> A farmer directly entering a silo without any other precautions can be asphyxiated by the methane, knocked unconscious, and silently suffocate to death before anyone else knows what has happened. It is either necessary to leave the silo blower attached to the silo at all times to use it when necessary to ventilate the silo with fresh air, or to have a dedicated electric fan system to blow fresh air into the silo, before anyone attempts to enter it.|$|E

A small adjustable nozzle at the top, controlled by a handle at the base of the silo directs the silage to fall into the silo on the near, middle, or far side, to facilitate evenly layered loading. Once completely filled, the top of the exposed silage pile is covered with a large heavy sheet of silo plastic which seals out oxygen and permits the entire pile to begin to ferment in the autumn.|$|E

40|$|The final degree {{project for}} a Bachelor of Science in Mining and Mineral Engineering {{has been carried}} out at Boliden Mineral AB between April and June 2013. The report {{describes}} the history and geology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mines <b>of</b> Boliden, origin and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest metal-mining companies in Europe - Boliden Mineral AB. In the Boliden area there are many important ore fields which contain gold, zinc, copper, silver and lead. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this project was to investigate and provide the guidelines for <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regrinding in the ball mill in the Concentrator flotation circuit having influence on metal recovery. The report follows the ore flow from the mine, through the Concentrator and finally to the end product, concentrates. The evaluation leads to conclusions which parameters may affect the concentration process negative. It was discovered that there are problems with the ore stockpiles at the mine and <b>the</b> segregation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fractions in <b>the</b> <b>silos.</b> It is proposed to install a cone on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silos</b> to reduce segregation of ore fractions. To reduce this problem Boliden should install a mobile conveyor on the way to <b>the</b> <b>silos</b> and to <b>the</b> ore stockpiles in the mine. This method has been successfully installed at the Aitik ore stockpiles near the new Concentrator. <b>The</b> main task <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis was to analyze metal distribution in the flotation circuit, especially technical analysis of regrinding effects on <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> flotation. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sampled pulp from the flotation process was done in the Mineral Processing Laboratory and in the Process Laboratory in Boliden. The analytical equipment such as X-rays and ICP were used for metal analysis and QEMSCAN was used for mineralogical determinations analyses. Theoretical calculations and results of conducted laboratory experiments suggests that regrinding in the ball mill has a positive effect on the flotation process, but some improvement is required, especially <b>the</b> regrinding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gangue particles. This process helps to liberate all metal particles and improves results of metal recovery.

40|$|The {{storage silo}} of a sugar {{refinery}} {{was designed by}} its manufacturer for a plug-flow pattern of sugar ingots {{in order to ensure}} effective drying of the sugar introduced at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo.</b> Because of the excessive moisture content of the extracted ingots, the quality of flow within the silo was called into question. The silo flow-pattern was thus studied by introducing sugar lumps as a tracer at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo</b> filled with ingots. The tracer weight percentage was measured at the outlet. Results show that the silo flow-pattern is not of the plug-flow type in its whole volume: after formation of a crater, only the central volume flows, while the outer residual volume remains motionless. The tracer test also enabled the detection of preferential flow patterns. The tracer method was found to be quite useful as a diagnosis method for such a device in normal functioning.

40|$|The {{phosphine}} {{distribution in}} a cylindrical silo containing grain is predicted. A three-dimensional mathematical model, {{which accounts for}} multicomponent gas phase transport and the sorption of phosphine into the grain kernel is developed. In addition, a simple model is presented to describe the death of insects within the grain {{as a function of}} their exposure to phosphine gas. The proposed model is solved using the commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, FLUENT, together with our own C code to customize the solver in order to incorporate the models for sorption and insect extinction. Two types of fumigation delivery are studied, namely, fan- forced {{from the base of the}} silo and tablet from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo.</b> An analysis of the predicted phosphine distribution shows that during fan forced fumigation, the position of the leaky area is very important to the development of the gas flow field and the phosphine distribution in the silo. If the leak is in the lower section of the silo, insects that exist near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo</b> may not be eradicated. However, the position of a leak does not affect phosphine distribution during tablet fumigation. For such fumigation in a typical silo configuration, phosphine concentrations remain low near the base of the silo. Furthermore, we find that half-life pressure test readings are not an indicator of phosphine distribution during tablet fumigation...|$|E

Controlled experiments have been conducted in physical scales from 1 dm 3 to 4 m 3 with wood pellets. Basket tests have been conducted according to the "crossing-point method" to derive kinetic data on the exothermic reactions responsible for self-heating and eventually spontaneous ignition. The kinetic data {{was used in the}} planning of the large-scale experiments for predictions of approximate critical temperatures. The experiments in the 1 m 3 scale were set-up basically as an enlargement of the basket tests to obtain validation experiments with controlled boundary conditions in a reasonable large scale. Several experiments were conducted and spontaneous ignition was seen in the centre of the pellet bulk at an ambient temperature of 115 C. The close to real-scale experiments with 4 m 3 wood pellets filled in a 6 m high silo were not strictly self heating experiments, instead a core shaped heating element was allowed to initiate the pyrolysis in the pellets. Heat and gas production and transportation from the growing pyrolysis zone were mapped with a large number of measurement points in the pellets bulk and in the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo.</b> The experimental work conducted gave kinetic data on the exothermic reactions in wood pellets, insight in self heating processes, a link between different experimental scales and knowledge regarding possibilities for detection of fires in storages of wood pellets...|$|E
40|$|In This Chapter [Measuring the gas {{emission}} from the coal Methane at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo</b> Methane at the load-out area and Actions taken after a silo explosion] Methane accumulations in coal silos {{have resulted in}} the occasional silo explosion. These can be quite violent and dangerous because coal dust adds to the strength of the blast. However, with the appropriate precautionary measures, methane accumulations in silos can be greatly reduced. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations at 30 CFR 2 77. 201 require that the methane content in the air of any coal silo be maintained below 1. 0 vol %. 3 Also, MSHA requires that methane tests be conducted before any electrical equipment is energized, unless a continuous monitor capable of deenergizing the electrical equipment is used. 4 Measuring the {{gas emission}} from the coal. The first necessary step in dealing with silo methane issues is to measure the gas emission from the coal going into the silo. Such measure-ments allow one to estimate the silo ventilation needs and permit a comparison with the methane controls used at other mines that have similar gas levels. The gassiness of the coal can be measured by taking conveyor belt grab samples. 5 Matta et al. [1978] measured the gas emission from conveyor belt grab samples using a simple desorption test. To conduct the test, they collected several grab samples of coal, weighing a few pounds each, from the conveyor belt entering the silo. 6 They then sealed the coal into an airtight sample container that was equipped with a valve and short hose along with a pressure gauge. Every few hours they opened the valve and bled the emitted gas into a water-filled graduated cylinder that had been inverted and placed in a pan of water (Figure 11 - 1).

The COS was applied as a liquid via the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo</b> and released 2 m below the grain surface. The application of 84. 5 kg of COS was completed within 30 min. With 2 h of recirculation using a 0. 4 kW fan, the in-silo concentrations of COS achieved equilibrium with a concentration variation less than 5 % of the mean. After a two-day exposure period, the COS concentration in the silo remained at 29 g m- 3. The concentration×time product (Ct) was then 1900 g h m- 3, and this achieved complete kill of all life stages of mixed-age cultures of Sitophilus oryzae, Rhyzopertha dominica, Tribolium castaneum and Trogoderma variabile. After 2 -days exposure, the silo was aired overnight with an aeration fan (25 kW) resulting in a COS in-silo concentration of below 4 ppm. This is 2. 5 times lower than the Australian Experimental Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 10 ppm. Residues of COS in the wheat declined to below the Australian Experimental Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of 0. 2 mg kg- 1 after overnight aeration. The COS was not detected in any outloading samples at concentrations above the detection limit (0. 05 mg kg- 1). The workspace and environmental levels of COS were monitored during application, fumigation, aeration and outloading. The levels of COS and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) were less than the detection limit of 0. 1 ppm, which was 100 times lower than the TLV of 10 ppm. The treatment with COS had no affect on the wheat germination and seed colour when compared with untreated controls. Oil quality tests showed that COS {{had no effect on}} total lipid (made from treated wheat) content or the lipid colour...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{show that}} silo wall {{pressures}} exhibit large fluctuations {{in time and}} space during discharge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo.</b> This observation is important for <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo</b> wall because spatial pressure variations may impose substantial bending moments that otherwise may be small or vanishing due to <b>the</b> carrying ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane forces in <b>the</b> <b>silo</b> wall. Information about <b>the</b> stochastic properties <b>of</b> this pressure variation cannot be obtained from any existing continuum model for <b>the</b> <b>silo</b> medium flowing within <b>the</b> confinement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo</b> walls.

5000|$|Often, when {{unloading}} grain from {{an auger}} or other opening at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo,</b> another worker will be atop the grain [...] "walking it down", to ensure an even {{flow of grain}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo.</b> Sometimes unstable pockets in the grain will collapse beneath the worker doing the walking; this is called grain entrapment as the worker can be completely sunk into the grain within seconds. Entrapment can also occur in moving grain, or when workers clear large clumps of grain that have become stuck on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silo.</b> This often results in death by suffocation.|$|R
