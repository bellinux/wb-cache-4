5|$|The terrier George {{was played}} by Skippy, known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in The Awful Truth. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both {{played by a}} trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to <b>twirl)</b> Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E
25|$|Once transformed, Tuxedo Mask {{displays}} additional powers. In the anime shows {{these as}} mainly physical, while the manga depicts them as rare and magical. His iconic mainstay in the anime {{involves the use}} of roses, thrown like darts to injure or distract enemies. He can also <b>twirl</b> them or throw a wide array to block attacks, or can throw many at a time to pin an enemy down. He seems to have an unlimited supply of these roses, which are supernaturally strong and embed themselves in most any material, including concrete. In addition, when Mamoru takes on different forms or aspects, his roses change color accordingly. Tuxedo Mask's roses are red, the evil Prince Endymion's are black (and electrified), and the Moonlight Knight's are white.|$|E

50|$|Spinning and <b>twirling</b> are any {{of several}} {{activities}} performing spinning, <b>twirling</b> or rotating the spun object for exercise, play or performance. The object <b>twirled</b> can be done directly by one or two hands, the fingers or by {{other parts of the}} body. It can also be done indirectly, {{as in the case of}} devil or flower sticks, using another object or objects. The origin of <b>twirling</b> can be found in manipulation skills developed for armed combat and in traditional dance. The various <b>twirling</b> skills have become increasingly popular with many associated with circus skills.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twirling</b> {{is a form}} {{of object}} {{manipulation}} where an object is <b>twirled</b> by one or two hands, the fingers or by other parts of the body. <b>Twirling</b> practice manipulates the object in circular or near circular patterns.

25|$|Baphomet {{also serves}} as the main {{antagonist}} in the PC game Tristania 3D, and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courbée Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France {{was the one who}} had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret will remain unearthed. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil <b>Twirl.</b> The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.|$|E
25|$|The McFlurry is a soft-serve {{ice cream}} dessert that has pieces of candy or cookies mixed into it. The McFlurry was first {{integrated}} into the menu at a Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada franchisee in 1995 and in the United States in 1998. The flavors are crushed Oreo, M's Minis, Reese's, or Mars, Incorporated candy bars like Snickers, Twix, Galaxy, etc., Cadbury's candy bars like <b>Twirl,</b> Wispa, Creme Egg, Crunchie etc., Nestlé candy bars like Yorkie, Smarties, Drifter, Rolo, Butterfinger, etc. McDonald's also does limited time only flavors, e.g. for Shrek the Third it released the Ogre-Load flavor. In Australia, they had a special range for their 40 years in Australia celebration. The flavors were double choc fudge, bubblegum squash, strawberry crumble and caramel cookie. Also in Malaysia, a unique flavor called FuseofmyLife is offered to customers. The mixing blade for the dessert is actually a specially designed spoon with a hollow handle that attaches to the mixer spindle (except in Australia and New Zealand where the staff mix it by hand). The blade is used once then given to the customer to use as an eating utensil. Originally test marketed in Hawaii in 1997, it is now available in most of its markets.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of things that you can “twirl”. The most common objects that are <b>twirled</b> among NPHC Greeks are canes and staffs. Although there are other objects that relate back in the history of <b>twirling</b> such as rifles and batons. When <b>twirling</b> a baton there are many competitions. The {{greatest}} is considered to be to Olympics, where medals of gold, silver or bronze can be won every four years by the best baton twirler in the world.

The leaves grow on long leafstalks and are large and palmate, with 5 large radiating lobes. The flowers are greenish-yellow and hang in dangling flowerheads called panicles. They produce copious amounts of pollen and nectar that are attractive to insects. The winged seeds or samaras are borne in pairs and <b>twirl</b> to the ground when ripe. They germinate freely in the following spring.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} characters Formby developed was [...] "John Willie". Baz Kershaw, the professor of theatre, described the character as Formby's [...] "onstage alter ego", while the cultural historian Jeffrey Richards describes Willie as [...] "the archetypal gormless Lancashire lad in baggy trousers, tight jacket, and bowler hat, slow-talking, hen-pecked, accident-prone, but muddling through." [...] His costume included ill-fitting clothes, large boots worn on the wrong feet, {{and a variety of}} hats; he would often carry a cane. In 1908 he lent one of his costumes to a young Charlie Chaplin when the latter was touring with Fred Karno's troupe; Chaplin also incorporated Formby's cane <b>twirl</b> and duck-like walk into his act.|$|E

[...] Lean Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly commented that the album [...] "holds up surprisingly well". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle praised the album saying [...] "every song on Celebration defines a moment in time, a radio sing-along, a <b>twirl</b> under the glitterball. It's a pulsing testament to Madonna's often-overlooked pop prowess, from the scrappy electro beginnings of 'Everybody' and 'Burning Up' to the retro-disco swirl of 'Beautiful Stranger' and 'Hung Up', still a hands-in-the-air highlight." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1950s {{educational}} film {{at the beginning}} of the episode [...] is a reference to old science movies that were often shown in classes when the writers were in school; specifically it was a parody of the 1940s educational short film [...] "A Case of Spring Fever" [...] (later featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000). [...] The <b>Twirl</b> King yo-yo champions are based on groups that companies like Duncan sent to schools to perform tricks. King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew's name appears on a paper Edna Krabappel is grading during detention. [...] Todd Flanders watches a television show that features Gomer Pyle from Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.. Bart sees the fictional movie Ernest Needs A Kidney, based on the character Ernest P. Worrell.

500|$|The {{player is}} {{able to control the}} four main protagonists Mario, Baby Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi either as a quartet or {{alternatively}} in separate pairs. The player can choose to separate the adults from the babies, which is usually required when entrances or holes in the overworld are too small to be accessed by the adult characters. Such instances form multiple puzzles in the game, in which items or switches can be only be accessed by use of the babies' specific qualities. The pairs can also perform special moves while they are separated, which are gained as the player progresses through the game. Each action attained is assigned to a specific button on the DS for a character, which is present on the screen; pressing the corresponding button results in the action. These actions, such as the [...] "Spin Jump" [...] that allows the older brothers to <b>twirl</b> through the air, are required to advance through the game and solve the various puzzles.|$|E
500|$|Two {{new family}} attractions called Pipe Scream and Lake Erie Eagles were added in 2014, {{along with a}} pay-per-ride thrill ride named SlingShot. Camp Snoopy and the Gemini Midway {{underwent}} renovations the same year, and some rides within those areas were relocated and given new themes. In 2015, the stand-up coaster Mantis {{was transformed into a}} floorless roller coaster called Rougarou, receiving new trains and a new green and orange paint scheme in the process. Also in 2015, Hotel Breakers received a $25-million renovation. A new roller coaster called Valravn debuted in 2016 as the tallest, fastest, and longest dive coaster in the world. The [...] ride replaced the 40-year-old Good Time Theater along with an antique car ride known as Turnpike Cars. Calypso was also moved in the process to the beach area near Wicked Twister, where it was renamed Tiki <b>Twirl.</b> Raptor and Top Thrill Dragster were repainted as well.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} algorithm for computing the state obtained from <b>twirling</b> a multi-qudit density matrix. The algorithm {{can be used}} both for approximating the <b>twirling</b> operation in a physical system and for computing the <b>twirled</b> density matrix on a classical computer. The method {{is based on a}} simple non-unitary operation involving a random unitary. When applying this basic building block iteratively, the mean squared error of the approximation decays exponentially. In contrast, when averaging over random unitary matrices the error decreases only algebraically. We present evidence that the unitaries in our algorithm can come from a very imperfect random source or can even be chosen deterministically from a set of cyclically alternating matrices. Based on these ideas we present a quantum circuit realizing <b>twirling</b> efficiently...|$|R
500|$|In the Confessions Tour, {{the song}} was the second {{performance}} of the evening and {{was part of the}} equine segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. She opened her hat from the previous performance of [...] "Future Lovers", as the background changed from the video of the horses to a red, geometric patterned kaleidoscope shot by Steven Klein. Madonna started singing the song. Two male backup dancers appeared behind her wearing horse reins around their heads to convey the feeling of oppression. The song continued in their choreographed performance, with Madonna sometimes pulling the harness around her dancers as if they were horses. During the intermediate musical interlude, Madonna moved {{to the front of the}} stage and lay down on the screen attached to it. As she continued singing the music increased and she started to <b>twirl</b> in the center of the stage. The performance continued with Madonna and her dancers moving to the back of the stage singing the words [...] "get together" [...] repeatedly. It ended with the music of the next song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] starting.|$|E
500|$|The sixth {{season of}} The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{received}} generally favorable reviews from contemporary critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Andrew Asare commented that [...] "we're in {{for quite a}} season [...] divorce, strained relationships, and tested marriages and friendships" [...] after the premiere episode. Danielle Henderson from Vulture stated that [...] "it's the first episode {{of the season and}} I'm already riveted". Lauren Weigle from Heavy stated that [...] "Kenya continues to <b>twirl,</b> Porsha gets wild in the club, Peter's club 'Bar One' goes under, Apollo and Phaedra have marital issues, Kandi and her mother are at odds over Kandi's wedding, and more. Kandi's mother accuses Kandi's fiance of having an affair with Kandi's friend. Nene calls Porsha a bad friend. Somehow Porsha ends up in the hospital. Fist fights ensue," [...] and summarized her review by acknowledging that [...] "this season is going to be crazy." [...] However, Jodi Walker from Entertainment Weekly later criticized the series for insisting its disapproval of violence, despite its widespread promotion of the fight between Williams and Moore and ultimate decision to broadcast the altercation. In April 2014, Bravo renewed The Real Housewives of Atlanta for a seventh season, and additionally announced the spin-off series The Real Housewives of Atlanta: Kandi's Wedding.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} revived {{a decade and}} a half later with the launch of the U2 360° Tour on 30 June 2009 in Barcelona, where it was once again {{performed}} as part of the encore. It was introduced by a robotic voice reading excerpts from the poem [...] "Funeral Blues" [...] by W. H. Auden, followed by Bono's appearance wearing a laser-studded jacket on a darkened stage illuminated only by a glowing steering wheel-shaped microphone that hangs from above. During the performance, Bono would alternatively embrace or hang from the microphone, or <b>twirl</b> around it, or swing it overhead to emphasize the lyrics. The New York Times said its use as [...] "a love song that can double as devotional" [...] helped keep the show's music and messages in balance, while the Chicago Tribune said that Bono sang the song with fervor as part of an encore during which [...] "the show's outsized ambitions produced a neon-lighted moment that nearly justified the costly enterprise." [...] Rolling Stone called the song's performance [...] "one of the show's highpoints." [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] continued to be performed during the encore throughout the first two legs of the tour, with minor changes such as the use of a different introduction.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} <b>twirling</b> semigroups of (super) operators, namely, certain quantum {{dynamical}} semigroups that are associated, {{in a natural}} way, with the pairs formed by a projective representation of a locally compact group and a convolution semigroup of probability measures on this group. The link connecting this class of semigroups of operators with (classical) Brownian motion is clarified. It turns out that every <b>twirling</b> semigroup associated with a finite-dimensional representation is a random unitary semigroup, and, conversely, every random unitary semigroup arises as a <b>twirling</b> semigroup.
