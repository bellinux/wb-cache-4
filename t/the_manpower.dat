5|$|At {{the start}} of the invasion, <b>the</b> <b>manpower</b> of the Soviet {{military}} force that had been mobilized was 5.3–5.5 million, and it was still increasing as the Soviet reserve force of 14 million, with at least basic military training, continued to mobilize.

5|$|In 1984, the {{government}} attempted to solve <b>the</b> <b>manpower</b> shortage problem by instituting obligatory military service. Men of eighteen to {{forty years of}} age were to be conscripted for two years. Opposition to conscription and to the campaigns against guerrilla groups resulted in widespread evasion of military service. As a result, during the late 1980s {{the government}} normally met manpower requirements by impressing men into military service.|$|E
5|$|Most of the population, {{urban and}} rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation's Vietnamese population.

5|$|After their {{defeat the}} Royalists {{effectively}} abandoned Northern England, losing much of <b>the</b> <b>manpower</b> {{from the northern}} counties of England (which were strongly Royalist in sympathy) and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast.

5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified.

Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since <b>the</b> <b>manpower</b> was no longer so available.|$|E

5|$|By January 1916, <b>the</b> <b>manpower</b> of the NZEF had {{expanded}} sufficiently {{that it could}} field a full infantry division on the Western Front. Accordingly, the New Zealand and Australian Division, which had been evacuated to Egypt from Gallipoli, was disbanded and the New Zealand Division created from the original infantry brigade {{as well as two}} new brigades (the 2nd Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Rifle Brigade), which had recently arrived from New Zealand. Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 27 February 1916, Stewart took command of the newly formed 2nd Battalion, Canterbury Infantry Regiment, which was attached to the 2nd Infantry Brigade. He led the battalion for nearly the duration of its service on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men {{had been}} returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. <b>The</b> <b>Manpower</b> Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training. A further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing their course.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} number of troops {{deployed}} by the belligerents vary considerably. Croatian forces have been estimated from under 100,000 to 150,000, but most sources put the figure at about 130,000 troops. ARSK troop strength in the Sectors North and South was estimated by the HV prior to Operation Storm at approximately 43,000. More detailed HV estimates of <b>the</b> <b>manpower</b> by individual ARSK corps indicated 34,000 soldiers, while Serb sources quote 27,000 troops. The discrepancy is usually reflected in literature as an estimate of about 30,000 ARSK troops. The ARBiH deployed approximately 3,000 troops against the ARSK positions near Bihać.

In {{southern}} Quảng Ngãi, the Viet Cong 94th Local Force Regiment attacked Binh Son, cut off a section of National Highway 1 near Chau O, and the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment (2nd Infantry Division) was pinned down trying to deal with Viet Cong attacks. Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province.

5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. Many workers were required to work long hours in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to <b>the</b> <b>manpower</b> laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E
