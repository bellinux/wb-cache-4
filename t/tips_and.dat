5|$|Variations are {{markedly}} different with each subspecies. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, more white along the <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> retraces and obvious wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> less obvious wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|E

5|$|Skuas and jaegers are {{medium to}} large seabirds, {{typically}} with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings.

5|$|The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa is {{distinguished}} from the more common variety by the orange color of the upper branches. Variety compactospora tends to show a more pronounced wine-red, purple, or reddish color in the branch <b>tips,</b> <b>and</b> has smaller spores measuring 9.2–12.8 by 4–5.4µm.|$|E
5|$|Young {{individuals}} have yellowish or greenish tail <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> engage in caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, within striking distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E

5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pterosaur}} skulls had elongated jaws with a {{full complement}} of needle-like teeth. In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small and restricted to the jaw <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|E

40|$|We use {{computer}} modelling {{to investigate the}} mechanism of atomic-scale corrugation in frequency modulation atomic force microscopy imaging of inorganic surfaces in solution. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the forces acting on a model microscope tip result from the direct interaction between a <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> a surface, and forces entirely due to the water structure around both <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> surface. The observed force is a balance between largely repulsive potential energy changes as the <b>tip</b> approaches <b>and</b> the entropic gain when water is sterically prevented from occupying sites near the <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> surface. Only extremely sharp tips are likely to measure direct tip-surface interactions. An investigation into the dynamics of water confined between <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> surface shows that water diffusion can be slowed by at least two orders of magnitude compared to its rate in bulk solution.

30|$|For surface II, the tip takes {{part of the}} 3 rd texture, {{the whole}} 4 th and 5 th textures to slide towards the 6 th texture and {{scratches}} the 6 th texture in the 1 st sliding. Attractive forces between the <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> the textures are so high that most atoms adhere to the <b>tip,</b> <b>and</b> scratches between the <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> the textures occur occasionally. Besides, the textures and cover layer do not form stable structures, so the average friction forces fluctuate all the time.|$|R

5|$|The asci {{are roughly}} {{cylindrical}} {{with a long}} stem-like base; the entire ascus is often as long as 300–325µm and about 15µm in diameter at the thickest point. The spores are round, smooth, translucent (hyaline), and have diameters of about 12–14µm. They are filled with many small oil droplets. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae in the hymenium) are enlarged at their <b>tips</b> <b>and</b> filled with brown colored matter, about 4µm thick.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} soars for hours effortlessly, only {{flapping}} its wings infrequently. While in flight, its wings are held flat with slightly raised <b>tips,</b> <b>and</b> {{from a distance}} the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of courtship behaviour.|$|E

Results of calculations are compared to recent experiments and show good agreement using known bulk {{values for the}} magnetic parameters of <b>tip</b> <b>and</b> sample. We suggest that oscillations of domain wall width result in magnetoelastic emission of phonons. These phonons carry energy from the tip, leading to image contrast at domain walls.
