40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} effects {{associated with}} the growth and collapse of a single cavitation bubble are investigated in the present paper by an experimental approach. The study focuses on the temperature variations in the liquid surrounding the bubble. Experiments are conducted in a cylinder partially filled with water at an ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The bubble growth results from the expansion of an initial air bubble, due to the pressure wave generated by a so-called ‘tubearrest’ method. Several locations of the bubble, at different distances from the bottom wall of the cylinder, are considered. The bottom wall is made of sapphire, which is transparent to both the visible and infrared light spectra which enables temperature measurements by a high-speed <b>thermovision</b> <b>camera</b> at a wavelength of 3 – 5 m. Water is opaque to the infrared light spectrum, hence only temperatures in the boundary layer and on the liquid vapour interface could be determined. A temperature decrease of 3 K was recorded during the bubble growth while an increase up to 4 K was detected during the collapse. Experimental results are compared to the predictions of the ‘thermal delay’ model {{based on the assumption}} that the bubble growth and collapse are due to phase changes only. In this approach, the temperature variations are related to the latent heat exchanges during the vapourization and condensation processes. On the basis of these results, the respective effects of phase change and air dilatation/compression in the bubble dynamics are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Geodynamical {{processes}} often cause degassing at the Earth surface. There the geogas emanates via mineral springs, water mofettes, or dry mofettes. It {{is assumed}} that the emerging gas influences {{the temperature of the}} springs¡¦ or mofettes¡¦ water, respectively the surface temperature of the soil at and around the dry gas vents. This causes a thermal anomaly in comparison to the close vicinity. If the anomaly is sufficiently pronounced with respect to the temperature difference ´T to the vicinity and to the area A influenced by the effect it can be extracted from remotely acquired infrared images. Investigations have commenced to investigate whether the effect can be utilised to detect gas emanations through airborne infrared imaging measurements. In such a way gas vents/springs could be mapped and monitored within large areas and short times. As a first approach compressed air was lead into the ground and released in some depth via a metal lance. The thermal effect at the surface was observed by a <b>thermovision</b> <b>camera</b> over several hours under varying meteorological conditions. Temperature in the depth was measured using contact thermometers for comparison. In addition simulations were performed to determine the temperature difference ´T and the area A of the thermal anomaly required for detection by typical remote sensing instrumentation. Results of measurements and simulations will be presented. The investigations are aiming at studies to be performed in the Western Bohemia (Czech Republic) earthquake swarm region where especially CO 2 of magmatic origin from European Subcontinental Mantle (ESCM) emanates...|$|E
