40|$|Using {{data from}} the U. S. bicycle industry, we examine the {{relation}} among product variety, supply chain structure, and firm performance. <b>Variety</b> imposes two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> costs on a supply chain: production costs and market mediation costs. Production costs include, among other costs, the incremental fixed investments associated with providing additional product variants. Market mediation costs arise because of uncertainty in product demand created by variety. In the presence of demand uncertainty, precisely matching supply with demand is difficult. Market mediation costs include the variety-related inventory holding costs, product mark-down costs occurring when supply exceeds demand, {{and the costs of}} lost sales occurring when demand exceeds supply. We analyze product variety at the product attribute level, noting that the relative impact <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> on production and market mediation costs depends to a large extent on the attribute underlying the variety. That is, some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> incur high production costs and some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> incur high market mediation costs. We characterize supply chain structure by the degree to which production facilities are scale-efficient and by the distance of the production facility from the target market. We hypothesize that firms with scale-efficient production (i. e., high-volume firms) will offer <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> associated with high production costs, and firms with local production will offer <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> associated with high market mediation costs. This hypothesis implies that there is a coherent way to match product variety with supply chain structure. Empirical results suggest that firms which match supply chain structure to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> product <b>variety</b> they offer outperform firms which fail to match such choices.

40|$|Two forms <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> {{have been}} noted in {{organizational}} processes: sequential and configural.

5000|$|In {{the years}} before the American Civil War, {{entertainment}} existed on a different scale. Certainly, variety theatre existed before 1860 in Europe and elsewhere. In the US, {{as early as the}} first decades of the 19th century, theatregoers could enjoy a performance consisting of Shakespeare plays, acrobatics, singing, dancing, and comedy. As the years progressed, people seeking diversified amusement found an increasing number of ways to be entertained. Vaudeville was characterized by traveling companies touring through cities and towns. A handful of circuses regularly toured the country; dime museums appealed to the curious; amusement parks, riverboats, and town halls often featured [...] "cleaner" [...] presentations of variety entertainment; compared to saloons, music halls, and burlesque houses, which catered to those with a taste for the risqué. In the 1840s, the minstrel show, another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> performance, and [...] "the first emanation of a pervasive and purely American mass culture", grew to enormous popularity and formed what Nick Tosches called [...] "the heart of 19th-century show business". A significant influence also came from Dutch minstrels and comedians. Medicine shows traveled the countryside offering programs of comedy, music, jugglers, and other novelties along with displays of tonics, salves, and miracle elixirs, while [...] "Wild West" [...] shows provided romantic vistas of the disappearing frontier, complete with trick riding, music and drama. Vaudeville incorporated these various itinerant amusements into a stable, institutionalized form centered in America's growing urban hubs.|$|E

40|$|The section {{conjecture}} in anabelian geometry, {{announced by}} Grothendieck in 1983, {{is concerned with}} a description of the set of rational points of a hyperbolic algebraic curve over a number field in terms of the arithmetic of its fundamental group. While the conjecture is still open today in 2012, its study has revealed interesting arithmetic for curves and opened connections, for example, to the question whether the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only one against rational points on curves. This monograph begins by laying the foundations for the space of sections of the fundamental group extension of an algebraic variety. Then, arithmetic assumptions on the base field are imposed and the local-to-global approach is studied in detail.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> learned and used by Basque {{language}} learners {{is a key element}} in their self-perception as “true” or authentic speakers of Basque. Drawing on focus groups and individual interviews, we find that new speakers are for the most part strongly oriented towards the value of authenticity epitomized by local varieties. While new speakers report the utility of their mastery over the new standard Basque variety, they are not inclined to view this mastery as granting themselves greater authority or ownership over Basque. Rather they strongly valorize the informal and vernacular speech forms indexing colloquial speech and local dialect most identified with native speakers. The new speaker’s sociolinguistic context and motivations for learning Basque seem to be predictive of the strength of this orientation. The findings of this study point to the necessity of further study and documentation of local vernacular as well the urgency for language educators to find ways of incorporating the acquisition of local and dialectal features into language instruction.

40|$|This {{presentation}} aims {{to explore}} the interface between two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> the English language. The first <b>type</b> includes contact-based <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> English that developed in former British or American colonies (e. g. Singapore, India) and that still have important functions in these countries as an official or semi-official language. These varieties are variously referred to as ‘World Englishes’, ‘New Englishes’, ‘Postcolonial Englishes’ or ‘Indigenized <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> English’ and correspond to the Outer Circle in Kachru’s (1985) well-known model of the three concentric circles. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> that will be investigated covers the foreign learner varieties {{that have been the}} focus of second language acquisition (SLA) research. Called ‘Learner English’ or, more recently, ‘Learner Englishes’ (to emphasize the heterogeneity of learner language; see Gilquin & Granger 2011 : 74), these varieties belong to the Expanding Circle in Kachru’s model. Despite the intuitive similarities between these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> and despite an early call by Sridhar & Sridhar (1986) to bridge the paradigm gap between SLA and the theories of World Englishes, there has been very little communication between the two fields up until recently. Publications like Nesselhauf (2009), Mukherjee & Hundt (2011) and Davydova (2012), however, have demonstrated both the feasibility and desirability of comparisons between the Outer and Expanding Circles, and have thus paved the way for further explorations. Using corpus data from ICE (Greenbaum 1996) for World Englishes and from ICLE (Granger et al. 2009) and LINDSEI (Gilquin et al. 2010) for Learner Englishes, I will follow this path and examine the behaviour of several items, including syntactic, lexical and phraseological phenomena, in World Englishes and Learner Englishes, bringing to light the similarities that emerge from these comparisons and trying to explain them by reference to general cognitive principles of language acquisition (and language change) such as simplification, generalisation, redundancy or analogy (see Schneider 2012). The implications of a rapprochement between the two fields of research, together with a possible symbiosis between their terminological and theoretical apparatus, will also be discussed, as well as the potential links with other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> like dialects, pidgins/creoles or English as a Lingua Franca...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{attempts}} at fixing some guide-posts on {{the relation between}} variety, consumption and growth, while abstracting from the well known effect that variety may exert on productivity, through specialization. A mechanism is first described, through which preference for variety expressed by intertemporally-optimizing consumers perfectly predicting the endogenously growing future consumption opportunities can cause faster steady-state growth. The mechanism amounts to a substitution of future for present consumption causing a higher steady-state savings ratio and is most naturally, but not exclusively, embedded in the intertemporal-equilibrium approach to growth modeling. The paper shows that this growth enhancing effect of preference for variety may not be unambiguous, if {{the creation of new}} goods is endogenous and costly. Some of the results obtained {{in this part of the}} paper hinge upon the assumption that there are constant returns to the endogenous factor, all factors are producible and that each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> can be used both as a consumption good and as a intermediate good in the production of capital by competitive firms. Dissatisfaction with the approach to preference for variety and innovation within the mechanism above is then motivated. The approach is oblivious of endogenous preference formation and the relation between innovation, consumption knowledge and consumption activities. Some research indications concerning long-term growth analysis in a world of endogenous preference formation are then drawn...|$|E

The evaluation was conducted on the experimental plot ŠZP Žabčice. Refraction measurement and level of vitamin C were done in the laboratory of the Institute of Plant Breeding and Propagation. Obtained values were statistically processed and evaluated and were sorted into tables and graphs and subsequently discussed in the text of the thesis. Photographs were taken during observation. These values allow selection of the most suitable <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> for cultivation and subsequent processing. Findings also allow selecting the variety with the largest fruit, variety with highest crop yields, varieties of fruits richest in vitamin C or variety with the largest bush growth. Jolico variety yields the largest single fruit while Vyšegorodský variety offers highest yield of crop. Highest content of vitamin C is found in Fruchtal variety. Vydubecký variety is suitable for a rapid wood growth. Cornelian cherry is a versatile plant that can find its application in landscaping either for its heavy and hard wood or for its fruit which tastes well and is nutritionally interesting.

Solvents can be highly damaging chemicals for two simple reasons: (1) they are used on a large scale, (2) they are often volatile which makes them difficult to contain. For the reason of environmental protection and reduction of damage to human being, clean technologies have become a major concern throughout both industry and academia. Therefore, search for the replacement of the damaging solvents has became a high priority.

The model bases on a Romer¡¯s <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> expansion of intermediate goods. We assume that {{there are two types of}} agents supplying two different types of factors. Workers supply specific skill weighted labor by accumulating their specific skills that depreciate with an introduction of new intermediate goods. The other type of agents, R&D agents, produce and sell new varieties of intermediate goods monopolistically after inventing them. The model yields: Depending on the elasticity of substitution between the two factors and on the value of the factor share, an increase in the efficiency of technology creation (or lowering the barriers on the imports of intermediate goods) affects the growth rates of workers¡¯ and R&D agents¡¯ average income differently. First, if the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, in a certain stage of development, an advance in ITC or ¡®globalization¡¯ increases the growth rate of R&D agents¡¯ average income, while it decreases that of workers¡¯. Thus, the ¡®Digital Divide¡¯ happens. Conversely, if the elasticity of substitution is less than one, the result will be reversed. These results are intuitively obvious.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the varietal type that a farmer will use {{is the result of}} {{considering}} the balance between seed cost and the profit possible from using one type rather than another. This paper uses the criteria of quantitative genetics to predict the relative advantages of a population, lines extracted from this population, hybrids (3 -way-, double-, and single-crosses) between such lines and their F 2 s. Inbreeding depression, rate of multiplication, genetic variability, the ratio of seed price to grain value constitute the main parameters of comparison. There is no single answer to the question and even the situation for one species may evolve over time and accompanying progress in selection. The F 1 hybrids are the best <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> in a large range of situations with high inbreeding depression (> 40 %) and sufficient genotypic variance. In such a situation the expected superiority of single-cross hybrids over population is 20 to 35 %. For cross-fertilized species, populations are to be considered only for low genetic coefficients of variation for hybrids and a relatively high seed cost. F 2 s and lines are obviously justified only with low inbreeding depression (40 %) et une variance génotypique suffisante. Dans une telle situation, la supériorité attendue des hybrides par rapport à la population est de 20 à 35 %. Pour les espèces allogames les populations ne sont jusitifées que si la variation génétique est faible et si le coût des semences hybrides est relativement très élevé. Les F 2 et les lignées ne sont évidemment justifiées que si la dépression est faible (< 20 %) et si la variation entre hybrides est faible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The genetic {{transformation}} efficiency of a rice variety is largely determined by its tissue culturability. Establishment {{of a highly}} efficient tissue-culture system has greatly accelerated the wide spread application of transgenic japonica varieties. However, such process for indica rice was hampered because this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> is recalcitrant to in vitro culture. This study aimed to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for mature seed culturability using a chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSL) population derived from a cross between an indica variety ‘‘Zhenshan 97 B’ ’ and a japonica variety ‘‘Nipponbare’’. The CSSLs consist of 139 lines each containing a single or a few introgression segments, and together covering the whole ‘‘Nipponbare’ ’ genome. Every CSSL was tested by culturing on the two medium systems developed for the respective indica and japonica parental varieties. The performance of culturability was evaluated by four indices: frequency of callus induction (CIF), callus subculture capability (CSC), frequency of plant regeneration (PRF) and the mean plantlet number per regenerated callus (MNR). All four traits displayed continuous variation among the CSSLs. With the culture system for japonica rice, three CIF QTLs, three CSC QTLs, three PRF QTLs and three MNR QTLs were detected. With the culture system for indica variety, six CIF QTLs, two CSC QTLs, three PRF QTLs and six MNR QTLs were identified, and these QTLs distributed on nine rice chromosomes. Two QTLs of CIF and two QTLs of MNR were detected in both the japonica and indica rice culture system. The correla-tion coefficients of all the four traits varied depending on the culture systems. These results provide the possibilities of enhancing the culturability of indica rice by marker-assisted breeding with those desirable alleles from the japonica...|$|E
