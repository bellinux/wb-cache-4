5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. <b>These</b> <b>alternative</b> reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In archaea such as Thermoplasma acidophilum, all the α {{and all the}} β {{subunits}} are identical, whereas eukaryotic proteasomes such {{as those}} in yeast contain seven distinct types of each subunit. In mammals, the β1, β2, and β5 subunits are catalytic; although they share a common mechanism, they have three distinct substrate specificities considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH). Alternative β forms denoted β1i, β2i, and β5i can be expressed in hematopoietic cells in response to exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as cytokines, in particular, interferon gamma. The proteasome assembled with <b>these</b> <b>alternative</b> subunits is known as the immunoproteasome, whose substrate specificity is altered relative to the normal proteasome.|$|E
5|$|Recently an {{alternative}} proteasome was identified in human cells that lack the α3 core subunit. These proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 subunit {{in place of}} the missing α3 subunit. Interestingly, <b>these</b> <b>alternative</b> 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of these proteasome isoforms is still largely unknown, cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} transport pathways {{produced by}} <b>these</b> <b>alternative</b> NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway. The advantages {{produced by a}} shortened pathway are not entirely clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, reactive oxygen species, and infection by pathogens, {{as well as other}} factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} {{to all of}} <b>these</b> <b>alternative</b> scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they {{found to be the}} most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|The main axes of {{the museum}} grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through {{the edge of the}} stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns {{supporting}} the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda, aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden.
