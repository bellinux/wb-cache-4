5|$|Directed by Bo Johan Renck, the {{accompanying}} music video was filmed at Ealing Studios in London on 17 August 2000. Renck had to specially edit the video because All Saints requested that each member shoot their scenes separately {{as they were}} not on speaking terms at the time. According {{to a report by}} the Daily Mirror, the group formed two camps with the Appletons on one side, and Lewis and Blatt on the other. Bullet time effects similar to <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1999 film The Matrix were used, being considered state of the art at the time. The video aired on 4 September 2000 to heavy rotation from MTV Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{respect to}} the Greek {{language}} question, it becomes obvious <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> very beginning Hermes o Logios adhered to Korais’ views. Korais claimed that the appropriate language for the Greek nation should be a vernacular (Demotic) language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative scholars to retain a tincure of archaism. On the other hand, some of Korais' opponents, both conservatives and vernacularists, published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Fortune's time in Wales, in part because {{throughout}} her life she was deliberately elusive when providing biographical details about herself. In later life she reported <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> age of four she had experienced visions of Atlantis, something which she believed were past life memories. The Firths were still in Llandudno in 1900, although by 1904 Fortune was living in Somerset, south-west England. That year, she authored a book of poetry, titled Violets, which was likely published by her family. It was reviewed in the May 1905 volume of The Girls' Room, {{in which it was}} accompanied by the only known photograph of Fortune as a girl. In 1906, her second book of poetry, More Violets, was published.|$|E

Firstly, that almost half the children at Jastrebarsko were older children more able to cope with the harsh conditions. More importantly, <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše guards to improve the health of the children.

5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, {{putting an end to}} hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Russian perspective it was likely that Władysław's abnegation of his claim was more important, in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E

Although it is clear from its size <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outset, the church was planned to be the cathedral of the diocese, the seat of the bishop moved between Wells and the abbeys of Glastonbury and Bath, before settling at Wells. In 1197 Bishop Reginald's successor, Bishop Savaric FitzGeldewin, with the approval of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey. The title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219.|$|E

5|$|Although Allied {{casualties}} {{during the}} battle had been light, {{in the wake of}} the battle, Milne Bay suffered an epidemic of malaria that posed a threat to the base as great as <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Japanese attack. Over one-sixth of Milne Force, including Clowes, came down with the disease. The incidence of malaria soared to 33 per thousand per week in September (equivalent to 1,716 per thousand per annum), and to 82 per thousand per week in December (equivalent to 4,294 per thousand per annum). At this rate, the whole force could have been incapacitated in a matter of months. It placed enormous strain on the medical units and the supplies of anti-malarial drugs. The Chief Pathologist of New Guinea Force, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford went to see Blamey, who was now in personal command of New Guinea Force, and told him that 1,000 men and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies were urgently required at Milne Bay to avert a disaster. Blamey took a personal interest in the matter. He expedited supply shipments, and made the required personnel available. The arrival of quantities of the new drug atabrine allowed this more effective drug to be substituted for quinine. The incidence of malaria dropped dramatically after December, the month in which atabrine became the official Australian prophylactic drug, and by March 1943 the crisis had passed. After this, the incidence of malaria amongst the garrison at Milne Bay was similar to other bases in Papua and New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick's love {{of music}} led him to serve for twenty years as {{chairman}} of the council of Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd. During this time the company expanded its scope. From producing the hymnbooks Hymns Ancient and Modern (A), and The English Hymnal, it also took ownership of Canterbury Press, SCM Press, and the Church Times, leading to jokes that Chadwick was an ecclesiastical Rupert Murdoch. He was heavily involved in the editorial process leading to the supplements to A, 100 Hymns for Today, More Hymns for Today, Worship Songs Ancient and Modern, and Hymns Ancient and Modern New Standard, which combined the best of the original book with <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> supplements into a single volume, and also the most recent revision, Common Praise. He had particularly argued for the inclusion of the Spiritual, Steal Away, and this was amongst the music used at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should have {{produced}} a rapid breakthrough but concedes that the battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops, losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E
5|$|Despite his rapidly failing health, Djajakusuma {{remained}} {{active in}} the arts. In 1980 he made his last film appearance, and his only role on the big screen, acting in Ismail Soebardjo's Perempuan dalam Pasungan (Woman in Stocks). He and Sofia WD portrayed parents who regularly put their daughter in stocks to punish her for being disobedient; {{in an interview with}} Suara Karya, Soebardjo recalled <b>that,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> time he had written it, he had only considered Djajakusuma for the role. Perempuan dalam Pasungan won the Citra Award for Best Film at the 1981 Indonesian Film Festival, and Djajakusuma expressed an interest in making several further films; this was, however, never realised. In 1983 Djajakusuma served as dean of the Faculty of Arts at IKJ, and in 1984 he went to the Three Continents Festival in Nantes, France, where two of his films were shown to critical acclaim.|$|E

5|$|During the hearing, Hurcomb {{pointed out}} a letter {{published}} in The Times in July 1944, in which the Bishop and Dean of Durham, and Warden of the Durham Colleges, had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line, an idea compounded by the publication {{a few days later}} of a photograph taken from the proposed site. He acknowledged that a number of views from parts of the river would be ruined, and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church, Hurcomb emphasised {{that the majority of the}} beautiful views around the city would remain. Pepler also found <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> railway station, the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously.

5|$|Historians believe <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of the bridge's life, it was toll-free for Lumberland residents. Eventually the town leased the bridge out to private individuals, who collected tolls indiscriminately. During times when bridge could not be leased, the town retained control. The tollhouse was later removed and sold. It is now a home. Originally, the settlement of Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side was named Flagstone, but changed to its current name upon construction. Both Pond Eddys expanded rapidly. A new railroad station was created in Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side. The riverfront location on the New York side had two stores, a Methodist church, a telegraph office, eighteen homes and a new hotel with a restaurant. The hotel had new owners {{around the time of}} the bridge and eventually became a large stop for travelers. The Pond Eddy Bridge served the town of Lumberland well in the late 19th century, but the area's prosperity did not last. The canal went out of business in 1898, after years of competition from railroads. The Erie station on the Pennsylvania had no roads to go anywhere, and the community began to decline. Decker died at 77 years old in 1900, having lived long enough to experience the rise and fall of Pond Eddy.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; <b>that</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E
