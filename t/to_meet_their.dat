5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Hawker Hunters deployed to Sweden in 1965 for training in air-to-ground delivery of ordnance, and intermittently thereafter, but annual training abroad for the Swiss Air Force {{did not begin}} until 1985. The use of Swiss air space for combat training became increasingly impractical as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions. The Swiss modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities, particularly among NATO European members, <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> training needs.|$|E

5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E

5|$|Love in Several Masques is a play by Henry Fielding {{that was}} first {{performed}} on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The moderately received play comically depicts three lovers trying {{to pursue their}} individual beloveds. The beloveds require their lovers <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> various demands, {{which serves as a}} means for Fielding to introduce his personal feelings on morality and virtue. In addition, Fielding introduces criticism of women and society in general.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{considered}} the song {{for inclusion in}} their 1967 TV film Magical Mystery Tour. Instead, they selected it later that year for the soundtrack to the Yellow Submarine animated film, <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> contractual obligations to supply United Artists with four new songs for the project. The version used in that 1968 film was a heavily edited version of the track, shortened to 2:22 through the inclusion {{of two of the}} original song's four verses and only the start of the long coda.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Australian and New Zealand Governments, at {{the request}} of Pacific Island nations, sent defence representatives into the South-West Pacific region to assess {{surveillance}} and maritime patrol requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval patrol force <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific Patrol Boat Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Penny {{was named}} {{as one of}} three successors to the {{retiring}} Jay Pritizker besides his son Tom and his cousin Nick. Tom was named the official head of the businesses, Nick and Penny each named vice-chairman. Together, the three were to oversee the Pritzker family assets. Jay intended to keep the family business together, devising a system of trusts that would allow individual family members to receive money from the trusts <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> needs; however, the family's wealth was to be primarily maintained in the trusts to grow the businesses and fund philanthropic endeavors. The Pritzker business empire contained over 200 businesses and was valued at $15billion.|$|E

Since recruitment of blacks had been taking place in the Commonwealth for more than two months already, the concession {{was little more than a}} face-saving gesture by Bramlette. Following the end of the Civil War, Dixon retired from public life. He died in Henderson on April 23, 1876, and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery.|$|E
