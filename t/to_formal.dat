The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-18th century, the {{economic}} and administrative collapse of provinces within the Mughal Empire, from Punjab to Bengal, led to its dissolution.

5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or subtitling. In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a soap opera was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led <b>to</b> <b>formal</b> requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language localisation of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using teletext service normally used for closed captioning.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{classical}} {{problem in}} algebraic deformation theory is whether an infinitesimal deformation {{can be extended}} <b>to</b> a <b>formal</b> deformation. The {{answer to this question}} is usually given in terms of Massey powers. If all Massey powers of the cohomology class determined by the infinitesimal deformation vanish, then the deformation extends <b>to</b> a <b>formal</b> one. We consider another approach to this problem, by constructing a miniversal deformation of the algebra. One advantage of this approach is that it answers not only the question of existence, but gives a construction of an extension as well. In this paper, we study some examples of miniversal deformations of infinity algebras, and use these examples to illustrate how to use a miniversal deformation to determine when an infinitesimal deformation extends <b>to</b> a <b>formal</b> deformation. Actually, using a miniversal deformation, one can construct such an extension explicitly. Also, the obstruction to an extension can be computed by this method. An infinitesimal deformation extends <b>to</b> a <b>formal</b> one precisely when the unique morphism {{from the base of the}} universal infinitesimal deformation to the base of the given deformation inducing the infinitesimal deformation can be lifted to a morphism from the miniversal deformation <b>to</b> the <b>formal</b> power series ring in the parameter of the deformation. A nice property of this algebraic approach is that it answers more than the question of existence; in fact, it gives a construction of an extension of the infinitesimal deformation <b>to</b> a <b>formal</b> deformation. Moreover, since the question is reduced to studying the morphisms of the base of the miniversal deformation <b>to</b> a <b>formal</b> power series ring, th...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return <b>to</b> <b>formal</b> Jewish observance and piety.|$|E
5|$|In vocal music, noisy {{nonsense}} syllables {{were used to}} imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before Clément Janequin made these devices famous in his programmatic chanson La bataille (The Battle) in 1528. Unpitched or semi-pitched performance was introduced <b>to</b> <b>formal</b> composition in 1897 by Engelbert Humperdinck, in {{the first version of}} his melodrama, Königskinder. This style of performance {{is believed to have been}} used previously by singers of lieder and popular songs. The technique is best known, however, from somewhat later compositions by Arnold Schoenberg, who introduced it for solo voices in his Gurrelieder (1900–11), Pierrot Lunaire (1913), and the opera Moses und Aron (1930–32), and for chorus in Die Glückliche Hand (1910–13). Later composers who have made prominent use of the device include Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten (in Death in Venice, 1973), Mauricio Kagel, and Wolfgang Rihm (in his opera Jakob Lenz, 1977–78, amongst other works). A well-known example of this style of performance in popular music was Rex Harrison's portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady. Another form of unpitched vocal music is the speaking chorus, prominently represented by Ernst Toch's 1930 Geographical Fugue, an example of the Gebrauchsmusik fashionable in Germany at that time.|$|E
5|$|Sally Hemings {{remained}} in France for 26 months; slavery was abolished {{in that country}} after the Revolution in 1789. Jefferson paid wages to her and James {{while they were in}} Paris. He paid Sally Hemings the equivalent of $2 a month. In comparison, he paid his Parisian scullion $2.50 a month, and James Hemings $4 a month as chef in training. The French servants earned from $8 to $12 a month. Toward the end of their stay, James used his money to pay for a French tutor and learn the language. Sally Hemings also was learning French. There is no record of where she lived: it may have been with Jefferson and her brother in the Hôtel de Langeac on the Champs-Elysées, or at the convent Abbaye de Panthemont where the girls Maria and Martha were schooled. Whatever the weekday arrangements, Jefferson and his retinue spent weekends together at his villa. Jefferson purchased some fine clothing for Hemings, which suggests that she accompanied Martha as a lady's maid <b>to</b> <b>formal</b> events.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet the}} Dutch threat, Oerip {{intended}} to attack while the former colonists were still consolidating their forces, {{a plan that}} was quashed by the government's attempts at diplomacy. He preferred guerrilla tactics <b>to</b> <b>formal</b> military conflicts, once telling a subordinate that the best attack would be one with a hundred snipers hidden behind enemy lines. Oerip was strongly against the Renville Agreement, an ultimately unsuccessful treaty {{that led to the}} withdrawal of 35,000troops from western Java and the formalisation of the Van Mook Line between Dutch and Indonesian forces. He saw the agreement, ratified on 17January 1948, as a stalling tactic, giving the Dutch the chance to strengthen their forces. Meanwhile, Amir Sjarifuddin– by then also serving as prime minister– began culling the army, predominantly keeping leftist-leaning troops. Disgusted with what he perceived as the government's lack of trust in the military, Oerip tendered his resignation, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Minister of Defence, Vice President Hatta.|$|E
5|$|Women {{had limited}} access <b>to</b> <b>formal</b> {{education}} and girls benefited less than {{boys from the}} expansion of the parish school system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from the seventeenth century. Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from the seventeenth century women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of the established kirk. Women had very little legal status {{at the beginning of the}} period, unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their own actions. From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result, some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control and constrain them.|$|E
