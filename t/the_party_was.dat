5|$|The LPF formed {{part of a}} {{coalition}} government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), but internal conflicts in the LPF led to the coalition's break-up and fresh elections after a few months. Following the 2003 election, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> left in opposition. It became clear that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> not viable without its original leader, and it went into decline until it was finally dissolved in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Although the MDRM {{leadership}} consistently {{maintained its}} innocence, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> dissolved by the French administration on 10 May 1947, {{and all other}} political parties, including PADESM, were temporarily suspended. The banning of MDRM further strengthened PADESM's prominence {{after the end of}} the uprising. Between 1951 and 1956, PADESM candidates won three consecutive legislative elections.|$|E

5|$|Another {{element in}} the {{ideology}} of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> a populist fight against the political establishment, often manifested through political scandals which flourished in 1990s Belgium; including corruption, food and even pedophile scandals. These included the Agusta scandal and the Marc Dutroux affair. The usual suspects were politicians in the three traditional party families; especially the francophone parties.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented {{the evidence against}} the defendants. He later stated {{in an interview that}} he was unsure if the evidence was true, inviting the notion that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E

5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{continued}} to be particularly strong in and around Antwerp, where it received as much as 33% {{of the vote in}} the 2000 local elections. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> forced to alter its political program, as according to the laws for party financing, it was not compatible with the European Treaty on Human Rights. In the 2004 Flemish Parliament election, the party finally became the single largest party group in parliament. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> invited by the formateur for government discussions, only to find that its differences with the other parties was insurmountable, resulting in the three traditional parties forming a majority government, retaining the cordon sanitaire. By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular Flemish party in Belgium, being supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate.|$|E

5|$|Wei Ping Chen was a {{candidate}} in the October 2008 federal election in the Richmond electoral district.

5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and mass unemployment. During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> essentially a rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Oliphant {{returned}} to Australia {{as the first}} Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the new Australian National University, where he initiated the design and construction of the world's largest (500 megajoule) homopolar generator.

5|$|All {{significant}} Flemish {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled {{that some of the}} party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.|$|E

They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>was</b> invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E
