5|$|If the {{governor}} becomes incapacitated, then <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> Governor of Indiana becomes acting-governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become incapacitated during their terms, and current precedent is that {{the governor}}'s office is to notify <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor, who will then {{make the decision to}} become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor becomes governor. If the office of <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of {{governor}} becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor becomes governor {{for the remainder of}} the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor could actually become governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> first <b>lieutenant</b> (1st Lt or 1LT) in the Royal Navy {{and other}} Commonwealth navies, is a post or appointment, {{rather than a}} rank. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenants</b> in a ship were ranked in {{accordance}} with seniority, with the most senior being termed <b>the</b> first <b>lieutenant</b> and acting as <b>the</b> second-in-command.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> Governor of Indiana is a {{constitutional}} {{office in the}} US State of Indiana. Republican Suzanne Crouch, who assumed office 9 January 2017, is the incumbent. The office holder's constitutional roles are to serve as President of the Indiana Senate, become acting governor during the incapacity of the governor, and become governor should the incumbent governor resign, die in office, or be impeached and removed from office. Lieutenant governors have succeeded ten governors following their deaths or resignations. <b>The</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor holds statutory positions, serving {{as the head of}} the state agricultural and rural affairs bureaus, and as the chairman of several state committees. The annual salary of <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor of Indiana is $88,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> Governor of New Jersey is {{an elected}} {{constitutional}} {{officer in the}} executive branch of the state government of New Jersey in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor is the second highest-ranking official in the state government and is elected concurrently on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Because the position itself does not carry any powers or duties other than to be next in the order of succession, the state constitution requires that <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor be appointed to serve as the head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lieutenant</b> {{governor}} has two constitutional functions. The primary {{function is to}} serve as the President of the Indiana Senate. In the Senate <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor is permitted to debate on legislation, introduce legislation, and vote on matters to break ties. As presiding officer in the Senate, lieutenant governors also have partial control over what legislation will be considered, and influence on the legislative calendar. Unless a special session is called by the governor, the Senate meets for no more than 91 days in any two years period, leaving <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor free from his or her senatorial duties in the remainder of the year.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the powers exercised by <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor are statutory and have been assigned by the Indiana General Assembly. The first additional powers granted to <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor were added in 1932 when the office holder was made {{the head of the}} state's agricultural commission. The office's powers have since expanded to include the chairmanship of the Office of Community and Rural Affairs, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, Office of Energy and Defense Development, and the Office of Tourism Development. As head of the various office and committees, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor controls many patronage positions and is permitted to fill them by appointment. Important positions filled by <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor include the members of the Corn Marketing Council, the Main Street Council, Steel Advisory Commission, and the Indiana Film Commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} constitution made {{no provision}} for a vacancy {{in the office of}} <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor; in the event of <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor's death or resignation, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governorship usually remained vacant {{until the end of the}} term. In 1938, following the resignation of lieutenant governor Henry Gunderson, Governor Philip La Follette appointed Herman Ekern lieutenant governor to fill the vacancy. This appointment was challenged in court, and ruled valid in the case State ex rel. Martin v. Ekern. In 1979 the constitution was amended to explicitly allow this: in the event of a vacancy in the office of <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor, the governor nominates a candidate who becomes lieutenant governor for the remainder of the term upon his approval by the Wisconsin Assembly and Wisconsin State Senate.|$|E
5|$|During one leg of {{the return}} trip, the men were stopped by the Hukbalahap, Filipino Communist guerrillas who hated both the Americans and the Japanese. They were also rivals to Pajota's men. One of Pajota's lieutenants conferred with the Hukbalahap and {{returned}} to tell Mucci {{that they were not}} allowed to pass through the village. Angered by the message, Mucci sent <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> back to insist that pursuing Japanese forces would be coming. <b>The</b> <b>lieutenant</b> came back and told Mucci that only Americans could pass, and Pajota's men had to stay. Both the Rangers and guerrillas were finally allowed through after an agitated Mucci told <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> that he would call in an artillery barrage and level the whole village. In fact, Mucci's radio was not working at that point.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lieutenants</b> had {{custody of}} many eminent prisoners of state, {{including}} Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas More, Lady Jane Grey, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I) and Sir Walter Raleigh. At least five of <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenants,</b> Sir Edward Warner, Sir Gervase Helwys, Isaac Penington, Colonel Robert Tichborne, and Sir Edward Hales, themselves later became prisoners in the Tower.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but I {{and one of}} <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenants</b> had a {{narrower}} escape than that. A shot struck {{the side of my}} port-hole, and sent the splinters right and left.

5|$|If the {{governor}} dies in office, becomes permanently incapacitated, resigns, or is impeached, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor becomes governor.

5|$|Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba {{is governed}} by a unicameral {{legislative}} assembly.

The head of state, Queen ElizabethII, is represented by <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> Governor of Manitoba, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although <b>the</b> <b>Lieutenant</b> Governor has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government.|$|E
5|$|Should <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> {{governorship}} become vacant for any reason, including death, resignation, or succession, {{the governor}} may nominate a replacement {{who must be}} approved by both houses of the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon <b>the</b> <b>lieutenant</b> governor, without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E
