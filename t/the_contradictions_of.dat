5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E
25|$|His work often {{contains}} {{political and}} social critique with a leitmotiv of destitute children and poor people {{as one of the}} first photojournalists to explicitly criticize the country’s social elite. Much of his work expresses <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> Mexican life under the one-party rule of the PRI. With Nuestra Señora Sociedad, he pokes fun at the wealthy, as a man in a tuxedo steps on the train of the dress worn by a woman. He also took photographs that showed the sharp class distinctions of Mexico. For example, in “Cada quien si grito” (Each with their own cry), García contrasts a poor rural couple with loads of goods to sell, followed by a couple in elegant evening clothes.|$|E

However, on closer inspection we find that this is a highly contested concept and, moreover, it is associated with new ideologies, of which three are {{discussed in}} the article: postmodernism, neo-liberalism and third wayism. It is argued that these new ideologies are impacting on higher education, which is consequently experiencing far-reaching cultural <b>contradictions.</b> <b>The</b> article examines six <b>of</b> these: <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> teaching and research, <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> efficiency and scholarship, <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> massification and democratisation, <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> management and leadership, <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> opinion and knowledge, and <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> science and technology...|$|R

500|$|Marion Cotillard plays [...] "Mal" [...] Cobb, Dom Cobb's {{projection}} of his guilt over his deceased wife's suicide. As the film's main antagonist, {{she is a}} frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor. Nolan described Mal as [...] "the essence of the femme fatale", the key noir reference in the film. As a [...] "classic femme fatale" [...] her relationship with Cobb is in his mind, a manifestation of Cobb's own neurosis and fear of how little he knows about the woman he loves.

500|$|Commentators {{connected}} the film's {{story to the}} endangerment of biodiversity in the Amazon rainforests of Brazil by dam construction, logging, mining, and clearing for agriculture. [...] A Newsweek piece commented on the destruction of Home Tree as resembling the rampant tree-felling in Tibet, while another article compared the film's depiction of destructive corporate mining for unobtanium in the Na'vi lands with the mining and milling of uranium near the Navajo reservation in New Mexico. [...] Other critics, however, dismissed Avatars pro-environmental stance as inconsistent. Armond White remarked that, [...] "Cameron’s really into the powie-zowie factor: destructive combat and the deployment of technological force.... Cameron fashionably denounces the same economic and military system that make his technological extravaganza possible. It’s like condemning NASA—yet joyriding on the Mars Exploration Rover." [...] Another author called the film [...] "socialism-disguised-as-nonsense enviro stuff" [...] and argued that the very process of creation and promotion of Avatar emitted enough carbon to undermine the film's ecological message. Similarly, an article in National Review concluded that by resorting to technology for educating viewers of the technology endangered world of Pandora, the film [...] "showcases <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> organic liberalism." ...|$|E
500|$|Conflict, or Angelou's {{presentation}} of opposites, is another theme in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. As Lupton states, Angelou constructs a plot by mixing opposing incidences and attitudes - Angelou's [...] "dialectical method". The book {{is full of}} conflicts: in Angelou's marriage, her feelings between being a good mother and a successful performer, the stereotypes about other races, and her new experiences with whites. Lupton believes this {{presentation of}} conflict is what makes Angelou's writing [...] "brilliant"; she finds that the strength of Singin' and Swingin' [...] comes, in part, from Angelou's duplication of conflicts underlying the plot, characters, and thought patterns in the book. Lupton adds, [...] "Not many other contemporary autobiographers {{have been able to}} capture, either in a single volume or in a series, the opposition of desires that is found in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas and, to a lesser extent, in Angelou's other volumes". Even the closing sentence of the book ("Although I was not a great singer I was his mother, and he was my wonderful, dependently independent son") demonstrates Angelou's dialectical construction, sums up <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> Angelou's character, and alludes to mother/son patterns in her later books.|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} [...] "I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise", a 1991 essay {{deconstructing}} the Batman mythos, refer to Anarky {{as a challenge}} to Batman's social and political world view, and to the political position indirectly endorsed by the themes of a Batman adventure. As the Batman mythos is centered on themes of retribution and the protection of property rights, the invitation to readers to identify with Batman's vigilantism is an invitation to adopt political authoritarianism. The authors summarize that position as [...] "the inviolability of property relations and the justification of their defense by any means necessary (short of death)." [...] However, the authors contend that Anarky [...] "potentially redefines crime" [...] and invites the reader to identify with a new political position in favor of the disenfranchised, which Batman [...] "can not utterly condemn". The authors contend that the creation of Anarky and dialogue by other characters represented a shift towards [...] "self-conscious awareness of the Batman's hegemonic function, questioning the most central component of the Batman's identity—the nature of crime and his relation to it." [...] However, the authors remain skeptical of Anarky's commercial nature, pointing out Anarky could be [...] "incorporated as another marketing technique [...] <b>The</b> <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> capitalism would thus permit the commodification of criticisms as long as they resulted in profits." ...|$|E
