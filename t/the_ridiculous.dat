Loran's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on <b>the</b> <b>ridiculous</b> attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E

But, unfortunately, there were many things both in the teaching {{and the practice of}} the ecclesiastics of that day, which were calculated to repel men of sober judgment and high principle. These evil tendencies in the popular presentation of Christianity undoubtedly begot in Shaftesbury's mind a certain amount of repugnance and contempt to some of the doctrines of Christianity itself; and, cultivating, almost of set purpose, his sense of <b>the</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> he was too apt to assume towards such doctrines and their teachers a tone of raillery.|$|E

25|$|A brief {{notice on}} Boudet's book, written by French prehistorian {{specialist}} Émile Cartailhac, {{a member of}} the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude and of the Société archéologique du Midi de la France was published in 1892 in the Revue des Pyrenées. Unsympathetic to Boudet's works, Cartailhac asked the local archeologists to be cautious about the claims of a gullible priest, author he said of <b>the</b> <b>ridiculous</b> book La Vrai langue celtique. In 1893, Cartailhac's notice was used by Gaston Jourdanne for his introduction of Boudet's book to the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude. Citing various renowned authorities, including a work by his friend, a well known Celtic expert, Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Jourdanne demonstrated the errors of Boudet's researches and conclusions. Jourdanne's harsh criticism {{went so far as to}} say that Boudet's study was worthy at most of publication in the British satirical magazine Punch.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Falsk and Mathisen {{wrote and}} created the film Showbiz, where Falsk played the movie's protagonist, a loser obsessed with {{becoming}} a pop star, while Mathisen played six different supporting roles. According to Falsk, he and Mathisen were determined to break every screenwriting rule and ignore every film cliché when writing the script. Falsk also directed the film, which was slaughtered by the critics after its premiere in September 1989, and bombed at the box office. Nonetheless, Showbiz {{has become something of}} a cult film in Norway. The duo's next project, the television show Tom Mathisen og Herodes Falsks latterlige verden (<b>The</b> <b>ridiculous</b> world of Tom Mathisen and Herodes Falsk), which aired on the cable channel TVNorge, was more successful. The TV show was basically an extension of Falsk/Mathisen's live act and featured sketches, songs, television parodies and bits of Falsk's stand-up material.|$|E
25|$|Lawson was as {{known for}} her off stage romances as she was for her onstage performances. In 1933 her {{engagement}} to Maurice Henry van Raalte, heir to a cigar importing fortune, ended tragically with her fiancé's sudden death. In May 1934 Lawson announced she was to marry a Mr H Glendenning, a cameraman {{on the set of}} Money in the Air, a film that Lawson had a part in and that was eventually distributed as Radio Pirates. But only a few months later in August 1934 Lawson caused a national sensation when it was announced that she was engaged to Fred Perry, the world's premier tennis player and winner of multiple Grand Slam tournaments. The couple first met when Perry visited the London studies of the film Falling in Love, in which Lawson played the role of Ann Brent. Perry later escorted Lawson to an exhibition match at Highbury Fields and proposed marriage before he departed to New York City to defend his US Open title. The couple's engagement became a news sensation, which took a toll on their relationship. When Perry turned down on offer of $50,000 to turn pro, he reportedly said it was because he would face tax issues and jeopardise his relationship with Lawson. In April 1935, while Perry was in the United States, the engagement was called off. Lawson reportedly stated that she broke off the engagement because publicity killed their romance, she had tired of <b>the</b> <b>ridiculous</b> rumours that had circulated in the media and she was opposed to Perry's plans to live permanently in America.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Schwimmer played Captain Herbert M. Sobel in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks' HBO World War II miniseries Band of Brothers. The {{television}} miniseries {{is based}} on the book of the same title written by historian and biographer Stephen Ambrose. Although Band of Brothers was met with largely positive reception, Schwimmer's performance was criticized; the BBC News concluded, [...] "Part of the problem... may have been <b>the</b> <b>ridiculous</b> fact that Friends favourite David Schwimmer plays the hard and cruel Captain Herbert Sobel. The only thing believable about Schwimmer's acting is when he cowers in the face of true battle. His puppy dog eyes make him appear even more pitiful". Later that year he portrayed Yitzhak Zuckerman in the war drama Uprising, based on the true events of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.|$|E

Murray mainly found positive aspects with the episode, explaining, [...] "For a show that started out being a fairly dour procedural with wacky mad-scientist elements, Fringe has really worked its way into that fantasy/sci-fi sweet-spot, where its own forward momentum makes <b>the</b> <b>ridiculous</b> look likely and arcane mythology seem well-worth the time to sort through and analyze."
