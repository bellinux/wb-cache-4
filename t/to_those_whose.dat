25|$|Cognitive load {{also plays}} a role in ironic control theory. Studies have shown that a greater {{cognitive}} load results in an increased possibility of dream rebound occurring.

There is a greater degree of dream rebound in those with a higher cognitive load opposed <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>whose</b> load was absent. With the enhancement of a high cognitive load, ironic control theory states thought suppression is more likely to occur and lead to dream rebound.|$|E
