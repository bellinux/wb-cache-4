Judge Steele, a newcomer from Connecticut, was Cooley's ally in this fight.|$|E
5|$|His {{thinking}} threw {{light in}} a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function.

5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution.

Hyder, after initially trying to ally with the British against the Marathas, had later become their firm enemy, as <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> the most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom, and Tipu grew up with violently anti-British feelings.|$|E
5|$|Arctic Monkeys are a British indie {{rock band}} from Sheffield, England. Formed in 2002, Arctic Monkeys {{currently}} consists of Alex Turner on lead vocals and guitar, Jamie Cook on guitar, Matt Helders on drums and backing vocals, and Nick O'Malley on bass guitar and backing vocals, a position formerly held by Andy Nicholson. The band's initial popularity came from fan-made demo tapes and online file sharing, and were heralded {{as one of}} the first acts to come to the public attention via the Internet. Commentators suggested at the time that <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band eventually signed to the independent record label Domino Records.|$|E
5|$|In early 1975 Merlyn Rees set up {{elections}} for the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention at which all of Northern Ireland's politicians would plan their way forward. These were held on 1 May 1975 and the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC), which had won 11 out of 12 Northern Irish seats in the February 1974 general election, won a majority again. As the UUUC would not abide any form of power-sharing with the Dublin government, no agreement could be reached and the convention failed, again marginalising Northern Ireland's politicians and the communities <b>they</b> <b>represented.</b>|$|E

5|$|Marcelo Weksler {{and colleagues}} removed {{most of the}} species then placed in Oryzomys from the genus in 2006, {{retaining}} only the marsh rice rat and related species, including O.gorgasi. They also kept O.curasoae in the genus and suggested {{that it may not}} be distinct from O.gorgasi. In a 2009 paper, R.S. Voss and Weksler examined the two and concluded that <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> the same species on the basis of direct comparisons and a phylogenetic analysis. The resultant tree placed O.curasoae and O.gorgasi sister to each other and closer to O.couesi than to the marsh rice rat. Accordingly, they placed O.curasoae as a junior synonym of the earlier described O.gorgasi.|$|E
5|$|On {{the supply}} side, since 2005 the {{gasoline}} fuelling stations selling more than 3 million liters of fuel {{a year are}} required to sell at least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008. Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> just {{two percent of the}} four million Swedish vehicles. In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's rule {{consolidated}} {{the usage}} of the coat of arms of Moldavia, featuring the aurochs head (first attested in 1387), sometimes as a helmet atop his personal arms. He revived the elaborate design introduced under Alexander the Good, which also featured a rose, crescent, sun and star (often, but not always, five-pointed); its tinctures remain unknown. This arrangement was not familiar to heraldists in Western Europe. By the 1530s, <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> Moldavia with attributed arms featuring Maures; these arms, though originally used for Wallachia, possibly echoed Stephen's victories over the Ottomans.|$|E

It also includes some {{players who have}} played fewer than 100 matches, if <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> their country whilst playing for the club, and players who have set a club playing record, such as goalscoring or transfer fee records. Finally, all players inducted into the Ipswich Town Hall of Fame, whose inaugural members were selected in 2007 by a ballot of former Ipswich players, are included.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to be just, the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community <b>they</b> <b>represented,</b> became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the social}} status of nobles, officials, farmers, and artisan-craftsmen were {{considered}} above the station of the lowly registered merchant, wealthy and successful businessmen acquired huge fortunes which {{allowed them to}} rival the social prestige {{of even the most}} powerful nobles and highest officials. Slaves were {{at the bottom of the}} social order, yet <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> only a tiny portion of the overall population. Retainers attached themselves to the estates of wealthy landowners, while medical physicians and state-employed religious occultists could make a decent living. People of all social classes believed in various deities, spirits, immortals, and demons. While Han Daoists were organized into small groups chiefly concerned with achieving immortality through various means, by the mid 2nd century CE they formed large hierarchical religious societies that challenged imperial authority and viewed Laozi (fl. 6th century BCE) as a holy prophet.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that <b>they</b> <b>represented.</b> In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
5|$|Since Oklahoma won the Big12 Championship game, <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> the Big12 Conference in the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. Contractually, the Fiesta Bowl {{hosts the}} Big12 Champion and then picks, {{from among the}} BCS {{eligible}} teams, the opponent. For 2007, the Fiesta Bowl picked Boise State as Oklahoma's opponent. The game took place on New Year's Day in the then-new University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals. The Broncos led the Sooners {{the majority of the}} game, but the Sooners made up an 18point deficit late in the game and led by a touchdown with a minute left in regulation. With 18seconds left, the Sooners had the Broncos in a fourth-and-18 situation from midfield, but were stunned when the Broncos executed a hook and lateral for the tying score. This would be only the first of three Boise State trick plays that helped elevate this game to epic status.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the {{foundation}} of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet. As <b>they</b> <b>represented</b> {{a shift in the}} strategic outlook of the German navy, the traditional method of ship construction, which relied heavily on foreign models, was abandoned. Some experimentation was implemented in the design process, particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships. Brandenburg and Wörth were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials, while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel-steel alloy armor plating. The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation. While a novel concept, the midships turret caused prohibitive blast damage to the surrounding superstructure when fired, which led to the idea being abandoned. This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto-dreadnoughts. This is incorrect, as the guns were not of the same length, and the ships were designed to fight at close range, unlike the later dreadnought battleships.|$|E
