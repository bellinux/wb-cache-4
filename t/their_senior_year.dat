5|$|Each {{class is}} managed {{by one of}} eleven {{academic}} departments. Nine departments will be experienced by students {{before the end of}} <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year,</b> as one or more of their classes are mandatory for graduation. The other two departments are specialized courses; one involves the Culinary Arts, while the other involves a precollegiate form of ROTC. This system of Professional Learning Communities was designed by Illinois's former Adlai E. Stevenson High School principal, Richard Du Four.|$|E
5|$|SICSIC is an {{official}} spirit organization at BGSU {{that began in}} 1946 by President Frank J. Prout. SICSIC routinely attends major BGSU sporting events and other campus activities promoting school spirit. The organization is secret and contains six members, two each for sophomore, junior and senior classes. Two new members are chosen {{at the end of}} their class's freshman year to replace that year's two graduating seniors. The group is characterized by their use of gray jumpsuits and masks of famous pop culture and political figures to hide their identities, which are not revealed until the last home basketball game of <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the Simpsons' {{television}} breaks down, Marge {{tells her}} children {{how she and}} Homer first met. The year is 1974 and Homer and Marge are both in <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year</b> of high school. Unlike Homer, Marge is a responsible student, but after she burns a bra at a feminist rally, she is sent to detention. Homer is also sent to detention along with his close friend Barney for smoking in the restroom. When Homer sees Marge {{for the first time}} as she enters the detention room, he instantly falls in love. Despite his father Abe's warning that he is wasting his time, Homer is determined to win Marge's heart.|$|E

5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year.</b> Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year. Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E
5|$|West Point {{began the}} collegiate {{tradition}} of the class ring, beginning with the class of 1835. The class of 1836 chose no rings, and the class of 1879 had cuff links {{in lieu of a}} class ring. Before 1917, cadets could design much of the ring individually, but now only the center stone can be individualized. One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest and the center stone ring bears the words West Point and the class year. The academy library has a large collection of cadet rings on display. Senior cadets receive their rings during Ring Weekend in the early fall of <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year.</b> Immediately after senior cadets return to the barracks after receiving their rings, fourth class cadets take the opportunity to surround senior cadets from their company and ask to touch their rings. After reciting a poem known to cadets as the Ring Poop, the senior usually grants the freshmen permission to touch the ring. In 2002, the Memorial Class ring donor program began. Donations of class rings are melted and merged. A portion of the original gold is infused with gold from preceding melts {{to become part of the}} rings for each 'Firstie' class.|$|E
25|$|Prospective Wharton {{candidates}} {{apply in}} <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year</b> {{of high school}} either through the early decision (ED) process or regular decision (RD) process. Unlike many other undergraduate business programs where students transfer in after their freshman or sophomore year (University of Virginia's McIntire, Emory's Goizueta, UC Berkeley's Haas), Wharton applicants apply specifically for Wharton during <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year</b> of high school. These candidates are then grouped with a pool of applicants separate from those applying to University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), or School of Nursing. Each {{of the other three}} schools forms its own separate pools of applicants too.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} attitudes and {{perceptions}} of secondary school students to ICT. During the last decade there have been decreasing numbers of students completing ICT subjects at secondary school in <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>years.</b> The data was collected from university students enrolled {{in a range of}} first year units. Although the survey was undertaken by university students, the data collected related to their opinions whilst still at secondary school. This study explored two areas: firstly, the reasons why students had elected not to study ICT in <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>years</b> at secondary school; and secondly, it describes a gender analysis of {{the attitudes and}} perceptions of students who had elected to study ICT. The analysis found that many students were not interested in studying senior ICT subjects, and for those that were, {{there were only a few}} differences between the gendered opinions to ICT...|$|R
25|$|During <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year,</b> {{while still}} {{completing}} upper-division Cluster Courses, students are also {{required to complete}} a six-credit senior capstone project in order to graduate. The capstone integrates class work with community-based work. These projects are integrated with local community organizations, and cover {{a wide range of}} issues, from social justice to grantwriting, environmental conservation, youth education, and more. Capstone courses often conclude with a public presentation from the students on their experiences with the community organization or cause which they explored.|$|E
25|$|Typically, the {{majority}} of the class takes Geometry their freshman year. As an effect, students take Algebra 2 Pre-AP as sophomores, Pre-Calculus and AP Statistics as juniors, and AP Calculus AB as seniors. Students who enter the school without Algebra I credits will take both Algebra I and Geometry Pre-AP as freshman and then follow the aforementioned track until <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year.</b> If a student who has had both Algebra I and Geometry in their 7th and 8th grade years begins their math curriculum at TAG with Algebra II, they continue on to take Pre-Calculus as a sophomore, AP Calculus AB and AP Statistics as a junior, and AP Calculus BC as a senior.|$|E
25|$|The Honors Program {{offers an}} enriched {{curriculum}} that broadens cultural interests, integrates knowledge, sharpens writing skills, and encourages more active student {{involvement in the}} learning process. Students may enroll in General Honors, which is awarded upon successful completion of eight Honors courses {{or a combination of}} six Honors courses and Departmental Honors (involving a two-semester research project). Students of an exceptional caliber may apply for the University Scholar designation. Those who qualify are freed from four to ten of <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year</b> course requirements in order to complete an independent project of unusual breadth, depth, and originality. Claver House serves as home to the Honors Program and provides honor students 24-hour access to the building's study spaces and computer labs.|$|E

25|$|The first {{incarnation}} of what evolved into OneRepublic formed in 1996 after Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins befriended {{each other during}} <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year</b> at Colorado Springs Christian High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. During a drive home, as Filkins and Tedder discussed favorite musicians including Fiona Apple, Peter Gabriel and U2, they decided {{to put together a}} band. They enlisted a few musical friends and named their rock act This Beautiful Mess—a phrase which first attained cult prominence a year earlier when Sixpence None the Richer released its award-winning second album, This Beautiful Mess. Tedder, Filkins & Co. had a few small gigs at Pikes Perk Coffee & Tea House, attended by friends and family. Senior year ended, and Tedder and Filkins parted ways, each attending different colleges.|$|E

25|$|IA was {{recognized}} by Newsweek magazine as the top public school {{in the nation in}} 2003, second in 2004, second in 2005, ninth in 2006, seventh in 2007, twelfth in 2008, second in 2009, 25th in 2010, 20th in 2011, 5th in 2012, 18th in 2013, 9th in 2014, and 8th in 2015. Newsweeks standings were {{based on the number of}} IB (International Baccalaureate) or AP (Advanced Placement) tests that the school averaged per graduating senior. The IA's high rankings are due to the full diploma program being required of all students, meaning they each sit for at least 6 IB exams in May of <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year.</b> Each senior therefore takes at least six IB tests (in addition to the Theory of Knowledge course; Creativity, Action, & Service hours; and Extended Essay requirements), giving the school a high average number of IB tests.|$|E

25|$|A typical TAG student takes English 1 Pre-AP as a freshman, English 2 Pre-AP as a sophomore, AP English Language and Composition as a junior, and AP English Literature and Composition as a senior. In addition, {{students}} are required to take a semester of Communication Applications (Speech) as a freshman and Independent Study English as a senior. The Texas Education Agency mandated that all TAG students in Texas must submit an “Exit-Level Project” during <b>their</b> <b>senior</b> <b>year.</b> This project requires finding a mentor in the community, researching and developing the project, and submitting the finished project to a set of judges at the state level. The projects are graded on a “1” to “5” scale, with “5” being the highest. The student must score a “3” or higher to graduate with a “TAG” endorsement on their diploma. TAG's Independent Study English course is this exit-level project. In addition to the required courses, students have choices of the following electives: Debate and Humanities (World Studies/Philosophy).|$|E
