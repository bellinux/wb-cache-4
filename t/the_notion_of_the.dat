5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he came up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{challenge}} to <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universality of attachment theory came from {{studies conducted in}} Japan where the concept of amae plays {{a prominent role in}} describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where amae is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory. Most recently a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.|$|E

Brandeis and Holmes emphasized the value of liberty, and identified the most dangerous factor to freedom as an apathetic society averse to voicing their opinions in public.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. <b>The</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> derivative {{of such a}} function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the reign}} of Edward IV (r. 1461–1470, 1471–1483), monarchs {{presented}} the diseased with a gold medal known as touch piece and hung it around the subject's neck. The reverse of the medal depicted a ship, while the obverse showed the archangel Michael slaying a dragon, {{which led to the}} medal being popularly referred to as an Angel. The diseased were instructed to wear the medal constantly to ensure the success of the treatment. Not all people embraced <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal touch and miraculous medals; many were simply eager to obtain the medal, which was then sold on the market.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} two new generalized inverses <b>of</b> matrices, namely, <b>the</b> 〈i|m-core inverse and the jm-core inverse. <b>The</b> 〈i|m-core inverse <b>of</b> {{a complex}} matrix extends <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core inverse defined by Baksalary and Trenkler BT and the core-EP inverse defined by Manjunatha Prasad and Mohana MM. <b>The</b> jm-core inverse <b>of</b> a complex matrix extends <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core inverse and the DMP-inverse defined by Malik and Thome MT.

5|$|The postwar {{drive-in}} theater boom {{was vital}} to the expanding independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, {{there were more than}} 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> midnight movie.|$|E
