5|$|The {{flags of}} Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, can all trace their roots to <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> {{the nation of}} Gran Colombia (1819–1830), the {{short-lived}} republic that encompassed the territories of all three. The Gran Colombian flag in turn was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> the First Republic of Venezuela, the first independent government of that nation. <b>The</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> the Venezuelan Republic was modeled on the one created earlier by General Francisco de Miranda during his attempts to gain Venezuelan independence and which first flew over the port of La Vela in Santa Ana de Coro, Venezuela, in 1806.|$|E

5|$|According to polls {{conducted}} by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> Japan {{as the national}} flag even before {{the passage of the}} Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school events or media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical of <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E

The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square Bhutanese flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on the visit of an Indian official to the country. The standard measurements of <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> India, which was 9 feet by 6 feet.|$|E

In Moscow during the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of the City of Los Angeles instead of <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> the boycotting-United States. In Sydney and Athens, two Greek flags were raised because Greece was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games.
