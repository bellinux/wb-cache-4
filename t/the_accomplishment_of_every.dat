5000|$|In December 1867 church {{president}} Brigham Young publicly {{called for}} the reorganization of Relief Society in every ward. Eliza R. Snow provided a historical account of the society and described its purpose to seek [...] "not only for the relief of the poor, but <b>the</b> <b>accomplishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> good and noble work." [...] Young again addressed the need to establish local Relief Society units at the church's 1868 April general conference, stating: Now, Bishops, you have smart women for wives, many of you. Let them organize Female Relief Societies in the various wards. We have many talented women among us .... You will find that the sisters will be the mainspring of the movement. Snow was assigned to assist local bishops in organizing permanent branches of the Relief Society. Using the minutes recorded in the early Nauvoo meetings as a Constitution, Snow created a standard model for all local wards that united women in purpose and provided a permanent name and structure to their organization. She and nine other sisters began visiting wards and settlements in 1868, {{and at the end}} of the year, organizations existed in all twenty Salt Lake City congregations and in congregations in nearly every county in Utah.|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the recognition of}} human activity based on the interaction between people and objects in domestic settings, specifically in a kitchen. In order to achieve the aim of recognizing activity {{it is necessary to}} establish a procedure and essential equipment. Regarding the procedure, in a simplified manner, it is based on capturing local images where the activity takes place using a colour camera (RGB), and processing the above mentioned images to recognize the present objects and its location. The interaction with the objects is classified as five types of possible actions (unchanged, add, remove, move and Indeterminate), which are used to analyze the probability of the human activity that is being performed at the moment. As for the technological tools employed, the system works with Ubuntu as general Operating System, ROS (Robot Operating System) as framework, OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) for the vision algorithms used, and Python programming language. The development starts with the segmentation using the "difference image" method that obtains the area that the objects take up in the image the recognition of objects is carried out by distinguishing them according to its colour histogram. the positioning is obtained through its centroid, applying the corresponding homography to go from the coordinate system of the image to the coordinates of the real world using comparisons of the historical and the new information of the objects we determine the actions that have been fulfilled as final stage, we filter the relevant objects {{on the basis of the}} actions carried out and compare with the objects defined for <b>the</b> <b>accomplishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> activity the result is the probability of executing each activity...|$|E

50|$|On May 17, 2006, Colbert {{introduced}} Better Know a President, a 43-part {{series that}} would refresh the viewer's memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accomplishments</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> President in United States history. The first president covered was Theodore Roosevelt, played by Roosevelt impersonator Jim Foote. In {{keeping with the}} running gags of the segment, he asked Roosevelt if the Spanish-American War was merely a great war of American imperialism, or the greatest war of American imperialism. The second covered was Thomas Jefferson. Colbert talked to three different Jefferson impersonators, and judged which was the best.|$|R

Ann Veronica could {{at the same time}} ask herself what this queer old gentleman could have meant by speaking to her, and know--know in general terms, at least--what that accosting signified. About her, as she had gone day by day to and from the Tredgold College, she had seen and not seen many an incidental aspect of those sides of life about which girls are expected to know nothing, aspects that were extraordinarily relevant to her own position and outlook on the world, and yet by convention ineffably remote. For all that she was of exceptional intellectual enterprise, she had never yet considered these things with unaverted eyes. She had viewed them askance, and without exchanging ideas with any one else in the world about them.|$|R
