It {{requires a lot of}} sensitivity to just talk about the issue... a lot of sensitivity." ...|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} a hostile reception in some quarters, with critics charging {{that it was}} poorly researched and/or allowed others to exploit it for antisemitic purposes. The German historian Hans Mommsen disparaged the first edition as [...] "a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti-Semitic prejudices". Israeli Holocaust historian Israel Gutman called the book [...] "a lampoon", stating [...] "this is not research; it isn't even political literature... I don't even <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> reviewed or critiqued as a legitimate book." [...] The book was also harshly criticized by Brown University Professor Omer Bartov and University of Chicago Professor Peter Novick.|$|E
500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

[...] Sprague suggested it be called [...] "Lake Majestic." [...] Today, it is known as Crater Lake.

2500|$|Although {{initially}} {{a supporter}} of Thatcherism, Hitchens has criticised the Conservative Party for its free-market economic policies, calling it a [...] "wild form of liberalism", rather than conservatism. He once clashed with Iain Duncan Smith on Question Time over the privatisation of railways. On this issue, Hitchens has written [...] "I have always believed that the electric power grid should be nationalised. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> renationalised {{as a prelude to}} an enormous programme of nuclear power station building, without which we face an appalling energy crisis within 20 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 December 2008, Angel Villar restated [...] "We need {{to present}} a strong, {{consistent}} and winning bid for the 2018 World Cup." [...] He further confessed [...] "Personally, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> with Portugal." [...] Subsequently, {{in the aftermath of}} a RFEF meeting board, Spain and Portugal announced their intention to bid together. Spanish sports newspaper Marca advanced some details about the potential bid: Spain would lead a twelve-stadium project with eight of the venues, and the opening and final games would be held in Lisbon and Madrid, respectively. Spain has previously hosted the 1982 World Cup, while Portugal organised the Euro 2004.|$|E
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of a GPWS alert typically happens {{at a time}} of high workload and nearly always surprises the flight crew. Almost certainly, the aircraft is not where the pilot <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> and the response to a GPWS warning can be late in these circumstances. Warning time can also be short if the aircraft is flying into steep terrain since the downward looking radio altimeter is the primary sensor used for the warning calculation. The EGPWS improves terrain awareness and warning times by introducing the Terrain Display and the Terrain Data Base Look Ahead protection.|$|R
6000|$|Attwater {{stood with}} his hands upon his hips, and his head bent forward. [...] "I am a fatalist," [...] he replied, [...] "and just now (if you insist on it) an experimentalist. Talking of which, by the by, who painted out the schooner's name?" [...] he said, with mocking softness, [...] "because, do you know? one <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> done again. <b>It</b> can still be partly read; and {{whatever}} is worth doing is surely worth doing well.

2500|$|The {{music on}} the album has often been {{described}} as a revival of classic rock 'n' roll with its use of things such as guitar solos. The band have denied that they set out to be any kind of revivalist act, with Heppner noting, [...] "I know what they're intending to say. We remind people of some of the classic bands they love and they compare us to them. It's well intentioned. But we didn't start out to be a seventies rock band. We play rock music the way we <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> played. And that includes guitar solos." [...] The songs follow typical verse-chorus-verse structures, which Watchorn noted the band felt the need to transcend to some extent with their songwriting for Prior to the Fire.|$|E
2500|$|Although her novels {{typically}} {{concentrate on}} black women, Morrison does not identify her works as feminist. When {{asked in a}} 1998 interview [...] "Why distance oneself from feminism?" [...] she replied: [...] "In order to be as free as I possibly can, in my own imagination, I can't take positions that are closed. Everything I've ever done, in the writing world, has been to expand articulation, rather than to close it, to open doors, sometimes, not even closing the book – leaving the endings open for reinterpretation, revisitation, a little ambiguity." [...] She went on to state that she thought it [...] "off-putting to some readers, who may feel that I'm involved in writing some kind of feminist tract. I don't subscribe to patriarchy, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> substituted with matriarchy. I think it's a question of equitable access, and opening doors {{to all sorts of}} things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crucially, {{intensive}} TV broadcasting {{from the}} Glastonbury Festival in 1994 meant that Orbital's set reached a huge audience. Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the gig, Paul Hartnoll commented: [...] "I didn't {{know how much}} of an impact it would have. Being young myself, I just thought, 'It's about time – of course we should have acid house at Glastonbury'. It used to annoy me. I just used to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> happening." [...] In the same article Michael Eavis noted that the Orbital gig marked dance music's appearance on the mainstream agenda. [...] "What was previously underground made it on to one of the big stages, and there was no going back from there. As the police and the council made me very well aware, the buzz had been around the raves and the market sound systems and in the travellers' fields for years. But it needed a showcase to make it legal." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is to examine the}} level of interest, understanding and implantation of sustainable tourism and practices at destination level. It’s a qualitative study exploring how sustainable tourism is perceived among destination managers and their attitudes regarding sustainable tourism. The main stakeholders in tourism planning and development are the destination managers as they often set the good examples and they are the promoters of what kind of tourism development one wishes for. It was conducted nine in depth interviews with destination mangers from the region of Fjord Norway. To sum up one concludes that the destination mangers all agree on a basic definition of sustainable tourism which included environmental, socio-cultural and economical sustainability. The main benefits are also the barriers including the long term perspective is good for the resources but difficult from a business perspective when it’s a struggle to survive from day to day. Some benefits are cost savings, better image, consciousness, destination development and quality and the involvement, pride and economical gains to the local community. On the other side it seems like a pervasive issue the difficulties in defining and decide what’s included in sustainable tourism.

50|$|Their plan backfires, and {{the city}} {{completely}} absorbs the fifty-kiloton explosion. The following H-Day is exceptionally bad. After a recovery period lasting a few months, {{the people in the}} nearby villages are angry at the Third Army. They believe that the alien city <b>should</b> <b>be</b> left alone, and then the aliens might leave the villagers alone. They start launching small scale attacks against the base and sniping at the soldiers. At about the same time, a stranger shows up at the military base. He has stolen something from a distant City of Force. There are many such Cities of Force scattered around the world, and together they create and support the grid that causes Horror Day. The stranger presents two glowing rings, one green and one yellow. They seem weightless and can be stretched to any size and broken to form more rings just like the original. When they are held with the green ring within the yellow one, they spew forth glowing plasma which is the basis of the alien cities. When the positions are reversed and the yellow is put inside the green, the rings re-absorb the plasma. The plasma can take any shape or color, can be accommodating or hostile, and is very hard for the soldiers to figure out. One old soldier, who used to be a scientist and is now the base's doctor, spends weeks trying to understand the rings. He makes some progress, but the scientific method can't shed to much light on how the plasma works because it takes on whatever properties the doctor wants. If he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> hard, <b>it</b> becomes hard. If he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a liquid, <b>it</b> becomes a liquid.|$|R
