5|$|Duncan and Fogarty (1984) {{argued that}} the key {{difference}} lies in <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Terran {{relationship}} to the planet and the Athshean one is the major example of a larger dialectical structure within the novel, a comparison of opposites. Throughout, the Athsheans are shown as living in balance with their world, while the Terrans despoil it. The Athsheans are shown as a gentle people, in contrast the violence and aggression of the Terrans.|$|E
5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, may {{represent}} the Moon, {{which would be the}} earliest depiction discovered. <b>The</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell {{and colleagues}} in their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and monotremes, but argued that Ambondro was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E

50|$|The film portrays Shanghai, China in {{the early}} 1920s.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the {{emergency}} medicine systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some practitioners {{to focus on}} developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international emergency medicine as a subspecialty began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals {{had taken place in}} the late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad. One was <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is {{the first}} such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia {{ratified}} the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics, while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics. This led the media to highlight <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes. The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.|$|E

40|$|Abraham Lincoln was {{the great}} centralizer. His War of 1861 was {{only the tip of}} the iceberg in this regard. This core of his {{philosophy}} can also be seen in his “contributions ” to class warfare, the American “system ” of public works, strong tariff protection, public lands policy, welfare payments to large corporate interests, and in <b>the</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Confederate and the U.

5|$|William Monahan's screenplay, {{based on}} the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, {{examines}} contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> gold and dust of the desert and Arab cities, and the blue and gray of bureaucracy and Washington. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 David {{returned}} to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. Dismayed by <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food {{to which she}} had become used in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, {{at the age of}} 36, she published A Book of Mediterranean Food. Her recipes called for ingredients such as aubergines, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973. Her reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{the best}} ecologically studied {{seamount}} {{in the world}} is Davidson Seamount, with six major expeditions recording over 60,000 species observations. <b>The</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> seamount and the surrounding area was well-marked. One of the primary ecological havens on the seamount is its deep sea coral garden, and many of the specimens noted were over a century old. Following the expansion of knowledge on the seamount there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Much of what is known about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson. Another such seamount is Bowie Seamount, which has also been declared a marine protected area by Canada for its ecological richness.|$|E
5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for the love and affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E

25|$|Although burlesque on the surface, the novel, {{especially}} {{in its second}} half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by Pablo Picasso and Richard Strauss. <b>The</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat, squat, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.|$|R
