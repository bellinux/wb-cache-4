5|$|The {{provision}} of {{and access to}} the routes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> used by the Wicklow Way is dependent on agreement with local authorities and landowners. Accordingly the route has been criticised for excessive use of routes through forestry plantations and roads. Proposals to address these issues were put forward in a review of the National Waymarked Trails published in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and Captain Haddock {{are walking}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> {{of the fictional}} Marlinshire when they come across a Romani {{community}} camped in a garbage dump, and reunite a lost little girl named Miarka with her family there. The Romani explain {{that they are not}} allowed to camp anywhere else so Haddock invites them to the grounds of his estate, Marlinspike Hall.|$|E
5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said to behave {{in a way that}} caused popular resentment, taking provisions as they passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E

5|$|In February 1970, {{the album}} was {{released}} by RCA Records. The cover art was completed by Dean Torrence, known for his teaming with Jan Berry to create {{the rock and roll}} duo Jan and Dean. Since Berry's near-fatal auto accident in 1966, Torrence had become a graphic artist; his sepia tone scene depicted Nilsson driving an old American car <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> with Newman in the back seat. The car is a 1938 Graham-Paige four-door sedan, rusty but working.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} from that expedition eight days later, Brigadier General Richard Montgomery had assumed command of the invasion due to Schuyler's illness. Montgomery, likely not wanting the troublemaker in his camp, again sent him out, this time to raise a regiment of French-speaking Canadiens. Accompanied by {{a small number of}} Americans, he again set out, traveling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> to Sorel, before turning to follow the Saint Lawrence River up toward Montreal, recruiting upwards of 200 men.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} four years all three of the regiment's {{operational}} squadrons eventually served in Vietnam, providing invaluable close support to the infantry, particularly during the clearance of Viet Cong bunker systems. Although their value in Vietnam was originally questioned by some, they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence, and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties. The Centurions were able to move <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield. The tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968.|$|E

5|$|North Korean {{machine guns}} {{continued}} to assault the American lines, and Americans who had expended their ammunition {{were forced to}} use their weapons as clubs. Of 667 men in 3rd Battalion, over 60 percent became casualties, including the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carl Jensen, {{and much of the}} battalion staff. Shattered, 3rd Battalion was forced to withdraw in small groups, many of its soldiers already captured or forced to escape on foot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> back to American lines. Most of the retreating men were also captured. Remaining soldiers formed a provisional company of 150 for the retreat. In total 90 percent of the battalion's equipment, including weapons and helmets, was lost. Another four of the M24 tanks were also destroyed without disabling any of the North Korean T34s.|$|E

In late-May 1968 the tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral. Occupying blocking positions in an attempt to thwart an impending communist offensive aimed at influencing the peace-talks, 1ATF deployed two battalions away from its base in Phuoc Tuy, subsequently developing Fire Support Base Coral north-east of Saigon, just east of Lai Khe on 12 May.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{gathered}} an inexperienced crew, {{although both}} his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta {{went on to}} achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, but did not succeed on his terms. As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali over three years, an unusually long period, based on when he or his production manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds. He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding {{that allowed him to}} complete the film. Ray showed an early film passage to the American director John Huston, who was in India scouting locations for The Man Who Would Be King. The passage was of the vision which Apu and his sister have of the train running <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) that a major talent was on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|With {{the support}} of Adolf von Neuenahr and the Count Solms, Gebhard secured some of the {{northern}} and eastern portions of the Electorate, where he held a geographical advantage in his proximity to the rebellious Dutch provinces. In the south, however, Ferdinand's troops hunted the soldiers Gebhard had left in possession of such Oberstift villages as Ahrweiler and Linz; Gebhard's troops were forced out of their strongholds, hunted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> and eventually captured. By the fall of 1583, most of the Oberstift had fallen to Ferdinand's army and many of Gebhard's erstwhile supporters—including his own brother—had returned home. In some cases, they honored parole agreements made after their capture. A strong supporter, Johann Casimir of Simmern, brother of the powerful Louis VI, Elector Palatine, returned to the Palatine when his brother died. Other supporters were frustrated by Gebhard's chronic inability to pay his troops, or intimidated by threats of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. By late October 1583, most of the Oberstift had fallen, although he still held the Godesburg, located near the villages of Godesberg and Friesdorf, the formidable fortress at Bonn, and the fortified village of Poppelsdorf.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} weeks, pro-government forces, {{led by the}} Siliwangi Division, march on Madiun where there was an estimated 5,000-10,000 pro-PKI soldiers. As the rebels retreated they killed Masyumi and PNI leaders and officials, and in the villages killings took place along santri-abangan lines. On 30 September, the rebels abandoned Madiun town, and were pursued by pro-government troops <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside.</b> Musso is killed on 31 October trying to escape custody.|$|E

25|$|Father Ignatius' health {{had always}} been {{precarious}} at best and worn out with continual work, preaching and begging he {{suffered a heart attack}} and died alone in a ditch (the death he had often described as ideal for himself) on 1 October 1864. Fr. Ignatius was returning from giving a mission in Scotland at the end of September 1864. He stopped at Carstairs to visit an old friend. Leaving his luggage at the station, he walked down the road <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> towards the house, and collapsed and died.|$|E
25|$|The St. Joseph River, which {{flows from}} Michigan, across the Michigan border north of Bristol, {{is the main}} {{waterway}} in Elkhart County. The Elkhart River enters the county east of Millersburg and winds its way through Goshen and Dunlap to Island Park in Elkhart where it meets the St. Joseph. The Little Elkhart River flows into the county southeast of Middlebury and creates some scenic views in Bonneyville Mills County Park before emptying into the St. Joseph near Bristol. Numerous creeks wind their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> and several lakes, including Simonton Lake, dot the landscape.|$|E

25|$|Frances {{experienced}} other sorrows {{during her}} marriage to Lorenzo. They lost two children to the plague. Chaos ruled the city in that period of neglect by the pope and the ongoing warfare {{between him and the}} various forces competing for power on the Italian peninsula devastated the city. The city of Rome was largely in ruins, and wolves were known to enter the streets. Frances again opened her home as a hospital and drove her wagon <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> to collect wood for fire and herbs for medicine. It is said she had the gift of healing, and over 60 cases were attested to during the canonization proceedings.|$|E
25|$|During the Mamluk era, the Al Fadl's {{territory}} {{spanned the}} area between Homs {{in the west to}} Qal'at Ja'bar in the northeast and all along the Euphrates valley <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> of Basra southward to the Washm region in central Najd. Mamluk patronage of the Al Fadl enabled them to dominate the other Bedouin tribes of the Syrian Desert. A rival sub-branch of Al Fadl, the Al ʿAli, controlled the Ghouta region of Damascus and the northern Arabian regions of Tayma and al-Jawf, while Al Mira controlled the area of Jawlan southward to the al-Harrah hot springs in Hejaz. Other branches of the Banu Tayy controlled regions within the Banu Rabi'ah's territory. Among them were the Shammar and Banu Lam in the north Arabian mountains of Jabal Ajaʾ and Jabal Salma.|$|E
25|$|Nerthus is {{revered by}} Reudignians, Aviones, Angles, Varinians, Eudoses, Suardones and Nuithones. Nerthus is {{believed}} to directly interpose in human affairs. Her sanctuary is on an island, specifically in a wood called Castum. A chariot covered with a curtain {{is dedicated to the}} goddess, and only the high priest may touch it. The priest is capable of seeing the goddess enter the chariot. Drawn by cows, the chariot travels <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> and wherever the goddess visits, a great feast is held. During the travel of the goddess, the Germanic tribes cease all hostilities, and do not lay their hands upon arms. When the priest declares that the goddess is tired of conversation with mortals, the chariot returns and is washed, together with the curtains, in a secret lake. The goddess is also washed. The slaves who administer this purification are afterwards thrown into the lake.|$|E
