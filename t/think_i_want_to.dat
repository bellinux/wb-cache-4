500|$|Evancho {{appeared}} in the feature film The Company You Keep, a 2013 political thriller. She played Isabel, the eleven-year-old daughter of a widowed attorney turned fugitive, played by Robert Redford, who also directed the film. Jon Weisman wrote that Evancho [...] "showed she's more than a singing prodigy with her earnest sweetness". Redford cast Evancho only days before filming began. Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> act full-time. I think I might like {{to do something with}} a Disney special or make a movie once in a while that would give me enough time to sing and record, but that's about it." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{put it on the}} album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|On March 4, 2008, Favre {{formally}} {{announced his}} retirement. Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, {{had nothing to do with}} what the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he did not want to play anymore. He said during the conference, [...] "I know I can play, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> And that's really what it comes down to." ...|$|E

500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E

The same day, Governor Rick Perry of Texas, formerly {{a supporter of}} Giuliani, threw his support behind McCain as well. Meanwhile, Romney, still burning about McCain's misleading Iraq withdrawal timetable charge, compared McCain to disgraced former President Richard Nixon, saying that McCain's claim was [...] "reminiscent of the Nixon era" [...] and that [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see our party {{go back to that}} kind of campaigning." ...|$|E

When we look at each other, it's like our eyes have fingers and they grab ahold.... I think I ended up being the scarlet woman because of my rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs.

2500|$|The Order of the Stick {{received}} two nominations for Britain's 2008 Eagle Awards, for Favourite Web-Based Comic and Favourite Original Graphic Novel (for Start of Darkness).

[...] No Cure for the Paladin Blues, the comic's second print compilation, won a 2007 Gold ENnie award. OOTS has been nominated for ten Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards, of which it has won five.

We wanna do a couple more, and we definitely want to get something out soon. Our fans have waited long enough, I think, so we wanna get something in their hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do like an EP. It's kind of what people are doing these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us {{so we have a}} few songs together and I'm hoping to get something out by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there. He also stated that the band is no hurry to finish the album.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006 Everett {{published}} a memoir, Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins, {{in which he}} reveals his six-year affair with British television presenter Paula Yates.

2500|$|Monáe's {{signature}} {{style is}} her tuxedo wardrobe. [...] She said [...] "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could {{be buried in}} it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be in the Guinness Book of World Records." [...] Monáe's signature look harkens back to dandyism. Citing Grace Jones and Josephine Baker as role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th century look in the classical white and black pattern. Monáe's signature look can also {{be attributed to the}} early days in her career when she was employed as a maid as she revealed in her 2012 Black Girls Rock! Young, Gifted, and Black award acceptance speech. Monáe has been known to distribute her Ten Droid Commandments which encourages her fans to be individuals. The Telegraph also commented on her image as an artist saying [...] "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes." [...] She has described her tuxedos as being a uniform for her career. She also featured in the [...] "Style 100" [...] of InStyle magazine.|$|E
