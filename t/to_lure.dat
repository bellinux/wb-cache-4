5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} one report of a margay using mimicry of the cry of an infant pied tamarin to try <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> an adult tamarin within {{striking}} distance.|$|E
50|$|Majority of {{the women}} in such {{factories}} are young unmarried women from lower income households who are scared of social stigmatization {{as a result of an}} unwanted teenage pregnancy. Some of the young girls are <b>lured</b> <b>to</b> the baby factory after searching for abortion clinics. In addition, <b>to</b> <b>luring</b> young pregnant women, operators of such factories also kidnap their young victims for procreation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an episode}} of Lost Girl, the main villain of the episode reveals that some people call him Slender Man but most know him as the [...] "Pied Piper" [...] and makes a {{reference}} <b>to</b> <b>luring</b> away human children.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a segment}} of Akira Kurosawa's 1990 film Dreams, a team of {{mountain}} climbers gets caught in a blizzard. After the other men lose consciousness, the last conscious man encounters a beautiful woman, possibly Yuki Onna but never directly referenced as such, who attempts <b>to</b> <b>lured</b> him <b>to</b> sleep and death.|$|R
5|$|After Groenlo was secured, Mondragón marched {{south to}} Rheinberg {{to cover the}} town from a Dutch attack. He encamped his army near Wesel, at Dinslaken, while Maurice {{followed}} him and took up positions at Bislich, both armies being separated by the Lippe river. The Spanish position was strong; the rearguard and the left flank covered by the Rhine and the right flank by the Lippe {{and a range of}} moorland hills called Testerburg. For several weeks both armies looked at each other, often skirmishing when both cavalries sallied to forage. As time passed, the Spanish foragers were forced to look for victuals two or three leagues far away from their camp. Maurice took the opportunity to plan a mock ambush on Mondragón's foraging convoy aiming <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> him into a general action in which he could destroy the Spanish army. Mondragón also hoped <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> his enemy into a trap.|$|E
5|$|Another pursuit-deterrent {{signal is}} {{thanatosis}} or playing dead. Thanatosis {{is a form}} of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, feigning death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> prey into approaching.|$|E
5|$|Mardonius also {{initiated}} hit-and-run cavalry {{attacks against}} the Greek lines, possibly trying <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> the Greeks down to the plain in pursuit. Although having some initial success, this strategy backfired when the Persian cavalry commander Masistius was killed; with his death, the cavalry retreated.|$|E

5|$|Mimesis is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> their prey. For example, a flower mantis mimics {{a particular kind}} of flower, such as an orchid. This tactic has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October, French troops {{backed by}} tanks, {{artillery}} and aerial support launched an operation to surround and eliminate al-Kharrat's rebels in the al-Zur forest. Al-Kharrat's men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al-Malihah. Positioned among the trees, the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops. The latter were unable <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> the rebels out and retreated.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been likened to both Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid {{due to the}} 3D {{platforming}} and stealth gameplay respectively. Players guide the forest inhabitants through 20 levels, during which they must infiltrate a series of suburban homes in order to steal a variety of items and destroy construction materials. The items needed <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> endangered animals to the forest must be collected from houses and carried back to the forest one at a time. Each level requires several trips to be completed. Security systems must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Household members and their pets must also be avoided, distracted or stunned by a thrown object. For example, a phone card {{can be used to}} make a prank call <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> a householder away, catnip can be used to distract cats.|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{condition of}} Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Loew), affected their attraction to 2 similar but qualitatively different synthetic lures in wind-tunnel bioassays. The 2 lures were BioLure (ammonium acetate and putrescine) and AMPu (ammonium carbonate, methylamine HCI, and putrescine). Effects of food deprivation on attraction <b>to</b> the <b>lures</b> were {{smaller than the}} effects of sex, time of day, and irradiation. Sugar-fed, protein-starved flies were attracted more strongly than other hunger-status groups <b>to</b> the <b>lures.</b> Sugar-starved, protein-starved females were less responsive than other groups of females to AMPu. Protein-starved males were more responsive than protein-fed males to BioLure. Females were nearly twice as responsive as males <b>to</b> the <b>lures.</b> Both lures were more attractive to females early and late in the photophase and more attractive to males during midphotophase. Gamma irradiation of flies greatly reduced their attraction <b>to</b> both <b>lures.</b> Fly age from 6 to 17 dafter eclosion {{had little effect on}} attraction <b>to</b> the <b>lures.</b> AMPu was more than twice as attractive as BioLure summed over all wind-tunnel experiments. A field test using BioLure and AMPu on sticky traps confirmed the greater attractiveness of AMPu to laboratory-colony flies...|$|R
50|$|Marroquin confessed <b>to</b> <b>luring</b> gay {{men from}} bars {{in order to}} kill them. He {{tortured}} his four victims by hanging or choking them, but in two cases {{it is said that}} he released men he had kidnapped once he had received a ransom. He added that he would continue doing so if he could, claiming that homosexuality harmed society.|$|R
5000|$|Club funds - the {{successful}} Leagues Club generated revenue from poker machines and liquor sales and enabled funds {{to be poured}} into local talent development but also enabled star local and overseas players <b>to</b> be <b>lured</b> <b>to</b> the club to share in its success.|$|R
5|$|Young {{individuals}} have yellowish or greenish tail tips {{and engage in}} caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> prey, such as frogs and lizards, within striking distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{second meeting}} {{occurred}} on 8 May, when Virginia came out while Monitor {{and four other}} Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> Virginia into the Roads. She did not follow, however, and after firing a gun to windward {{as a sign of}} contempt, anchored off Sewell's Point. Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy Virginia.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2014 Mercer Quality of Living Survey, Birmingham {{was placed}} 51st {{in the world}} in, which was the second highest rating in the UK. This is an {{improvement}} on the city's 56th place in 2008. The Big City Plan aims to move the city into the index's top 20 by 2026. An area of {{the city has been}} designated an enterprise zone, with tax relief and simplified planning <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> investment.|$|E
40|$|In {{continuing}} {{investigations of}} brown tree snake, Boiga irregularis, attraction to carrion odor, {{we hypothesized that}} the attractiveness of live or dead and visually apparent or concealed lures varies seasonally. We determined that lure condition (live or dead mouse lures) and sensory cues (visually apparent or concealed lure) interact among wet and dry seasons. Concealed carrion lures were more effective {{during the dry season}} than the wet season, but the effectiveness of live mouse lures showed less seasonal variability. We identified weather variables that covary with observed seasonal trends in capture rates and investigated the influence of recent feeding on snake response <b>to</b> <b>lures.</b> Data suggest that live mouse lure capture rates correlate with wind and dead mouse capture rates correlate with rainfall. Recently fed and satiated snakes were not less responsive <b>to</b> <b>lures</b> but were less active than unfed snakes. Snakes held for over 2 years were less responsive than recently captured snakes. More intensive studies will be required to determine cause-and-effect relationships between lure type, seasonality, and snake behavior...|$|R

5|$|After their failed courting of the Timberwolves, New Orleans made {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> the Vancouver Grizzlies and Charlotte Hornets to {{the city}} in the 2000s and found success when the Hornets, who had considered both New Orleans and Memphis (where the Grizzlies eventually moved), elected to move to Louisiana in 2002. The Hornets would since then revive their franchise name back in Charlotte in 2014, while the original Charlotte Hornets would be renamed the New Orleans Pelicans in 2013.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Koblenz Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is {{the captain}} of the Nostromo and the only human crew member with access to Mother, the onboard computer. When he {{receives}} a distress signal from the Derelict, an Engineer ship, Dallas steers the Nostromo off course to investigate the beacon. After the Alien hatches from Gilbert Kane's chest and murders Samuel Brett, Dallas enters the ship's air ducts <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> it to the airlock and eject it into space. He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his flamethrower.|$|E
40|$|Brief {{exposures}} of male Choristoneura rosaceana and Argyrotaenia veluti-nana to the plumes {{generated by}} lures releasing 3 -component pheromone blends specifically tuned for each species or by commercially distributed Iso-mate OBLR/PLR Plus pheromone “rope ” dispensers induced markedly dif-ferent subsequent behavioral responses to pheromone. A {{greater proportion of}} C. rosaceana males took flight and successfully oriented toward lures 24 h after preexposure <b>to</b> a <b>lure,</b> a rope, or the lure–rope combination in a sustained-flight wind tunnel compared to naı̈ve moths. Flights were also longer for preex-posed than naı̈ve moths. Preexposed male C. rosaceana were not more likely to fly toward ropes 24 h after preexposure. By contrast, fewer male A. veluti-nana oriented <b>to</b> <b>lures</b> 24 h after preexposure than did naı̈ve moths. Those preexposed A. velutinana successfully locking onto plumes from lures flew for significantly shorter intervals than did unexposed moths. Electroantenno-grams revealed no changes at the periphery 15 min and 24 h after preexposure. For A. velutinana, the long-lasting effect was decreased attraction <b>to</b> a <b>lure</b> and increased attraction to a rope. For C. rosaceana, pheromone preexpo-sure increased responsiveness to its authentic blend. This behavioral evidenc...|$|R

Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> Sharp to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to Sharp under various pseudonyms, each asking for his help in some sort of legal matter, and each sent from a different post office. When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of Veils, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the doorway to gain entrance.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about <b>to</b> <b>lure</b> small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E

Russell previously served as quarterbacks and running backs coach from 1945 to 1949, and is attributed <b>to</b> <b>luring</b> Doak Walker away from the University of Texas. In three seasons as head coach, Russell would compile a 13-15-2 record. After a strong first season, in which the Mustangs were ranked {{number one in the}} nation, the team would suffer two losing seasons. Becoming increasingly under fire, Russell resigned as head coach after the 1952 season.|$|R
