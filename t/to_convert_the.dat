5|$|Before his death, Augustine consecrated Laurence of Canterbury as his {{successor}} to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office. Although {{at the time of}} Augustine's death, 26 May 604, the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>the</b> descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles. Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself. Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.|$|E
