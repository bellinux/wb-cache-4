5|$|In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, {{children}} are shown cards {{and asked to}} sort them based on two different dimensions (e.g. by color, such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) simultaneously into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow foods, blue animals and blue foods). This task {{appears to be more}} difficult as research has shown that seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> simultaneously. These children focused on the <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> simultaneously. This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven.|$|E

5|$|In the game, Mario explores Princess Peach's {{castle and}} must rescue her from Bowser. As {{one of the}} earlier 3D {{platform}} games, Super Mario 64 is based on open world playability, degrees of freedom through all three axes in space, and relatively large areas which are composed primarily of true 3D polygons as opposed to only two-dimensional (2D) sprites. The game established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for 2D sidescrolling platformers. In the evolution from <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> to three, Super Mario 64 places an emphasis on exploration within vast worlds that require the player to complete multiple diverse missions, {{in addition to the}} occasional linear obstacle courses as in traditional platform games. While doing so, it still preserves many gameplay elements and characters of earlier Mario games, and the same visual style.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation or tiling in <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> is a {{topic in}} {{geometry}} that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
