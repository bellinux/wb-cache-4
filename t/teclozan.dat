Após um controle de cura realizado no 4 º, 8 º, 12 º e 20 º dias após o tratamento, obteve eficácia em 75 % dos enfermos (30 casos) e {{excelente}} tolerância. The author report {{his experience}} with Teclozine in the treatment on 40 patients suffering chronic intestinal amebiasis, employing a new therapeutical schedule - 1, 500 mg as the total dose, within the period of 24 hours. After a follow-up on the 4 th, 8 th, 12 th, and 20 th days of treatment, the parasitological cure rate obtained was 75 % (30 cases), and the drug was very well tolerated by all the patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction of amoebicide <b>Teclozan</b> (TEC) was studied on a glassy carbon electrode in acetonitrile. Controlled-potential electrolyses were performed for coulometric and preparative purposes. The electrogenerated products were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction and characterized by (1) H NMR. It was observed that TEC presents two voltammetric peaks, each one {{associated with the}} cleavage of two C-Cl bonds. In presence of a proton donor {{it was observed that}} the first peak at - 1. 8 V promotes mainly the reduction of the groups CHCl(2) to CH(2) Cl and the second one at - 2. 2 V promotes the reduction of the groups CH(2) Cl to CH(3) giving as the sole product the completely dechlorinated TEC derivative with yields between 82 and 97 %. In addition, a comparative study between the analytical performance of voltammetric techniques and amperometric detection of TEC in hydrodynamic conditions was performed. The amperometric detection was more sensitive than all evaluated voltammetric techniques, providing a detection limit of 8. 9 x 10 (- 6) mol L(- 1) ...|$|E
