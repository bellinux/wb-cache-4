But we do prove it a posteriori, i.e., from <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from {{the production of the}} things in this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.|$|E

An anonymous spokesman told News.com.au that Scientology should lose its tax-exempt status. About 150 protesters {{came to the}} Yonge Street headquarters of Scientology in Toronto, Canada; sang [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] and chanted [...] "we want cake". During the Los Angeles protests, a plane flew overhead trailing a large sign that read [...] "Honk if you think Scientology is a cult."

500|$|Dylan was {{rethinking}} {{the direction of}} his life while recovering from a sense of having been exploited. Nine months after the crash, he told New York Daily News reporter Michael Iachetta, [...] "Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened." [...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had {{to come to terms with}} his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh's {{dissipated}} lifestyle {{continued into}} his final Oxford year, 1924. A letter written that {{year to a}} Lancing friend, Dudley Carew, hints at severe emotional pressures: [...] "I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane.... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened". He did just enough work to pass his final examinations {{in the summer of}} 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921–22 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio was {{the first}} actor to be cast in the film. Nolan {{had been trying to}} work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to {{convince}} him to appear in any of his films until Inception. DiCaprio finally agreed because he was [...] "intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life." [...] He read the script and found it to be [...] "very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been swirling around his head for the last eight years." [...] DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order [...] "to make sure that the emotional journey of his character was the driving force of the movie." [...] On February 11, 2009, it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased Inception, a spec script written by Nolan.|$|E

500|$|As the 1950 Detroit Tigers season started, Houtteman {{was on a}} high note, {{pitching}} all {{of spring}} training without allowing a walk. He won his tenth {{game of the season}} on June 28, 1950, and became the first pitcher to hit the 10-win mark alongside Bob Lemon. After the game, he told an Associated Press reporter that he was just about convinced that Lady Luck had decided to give him a break after kicking him around for the past two or three years. Houtteman said, [...] "I've been having a pretty good year and it sure feels good after some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened to me". A week into July, Houtteman notched his eleventh victory, and only lost five games, in a 6–1 win against the St. Louis Browns. Just a few days later, Houtteman was named to the All-Star roster alongside fellow Tigers including Ted Gray, George Kell and Hoot Evers. In the 1950 All-Star game, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He allowed one earned run, three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning on a Ralph Kiner home run that made the game go to extra innings.|$|E
500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{marked the}} modern NFL as {{different}} from other major professional sports leagues is the apparent parity between its 32 teams. While from time to time, dominant teams have arisen, the league has been cited {{as one of the}} few where every team has a realistic chance of winning the championship from year to year. [...] The league's complex labor agreement with its players' union, which mandates a hard salary cap and revenue sharing between its clubs, prevents the richest teams from stockpiling the best players and gives even teams in smaller cities such as Green Bay and New Orleans the opportunity to compete for the Super Bowl. [...] One of the chief architects of this labor agreement was former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who presided over the league from 1989 to 2006. [...] In addition to providing parity between the clubs, the current labor contract, established in 1993 and renewed in 1998 and 2006, has kept player salaries low—the lowest among the four major league sports in the United States— and has helped make the NFL the only major American professional sports league since 1993 not to suffer any player strike or work stoppage.|$|E
500|$|... "Lacrymosa" [...] {{incorporates}} the Lacrimosa sequence from Mozart's Requiem (1791). It additionally includes a 22-piece orchestra led by Dave Campbell and background vocals by The Millennium Choir. Inspired {{by the film}} Amadeus, the song contains electronic backing beats, symphonic string section, heavy guitar and a haunting choir. Its vocals make a contrasting representation of light and dark. Jim Farber of Daily News compared the song with the works of English progressive rock band Renaissance. [...] "Like You" [...] is written in memory of Lee's deceased sister, as was [...] "Hello" [...] on Fallen. Concerning this, the singer said, [...] "I can't help but be affected by that, and if it's my place to express myself and all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been most deep and the most painful and have just touched me, I feel like it does honor her". One of the most personal songs on the album, [...] "Like You", contains lyrics which yearn for death so Lee can be with her sister. which are accompanied by heavy riffing guitars. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield found similarities between the track and American rock band My Chemical Romance's song [...] "Helena" [...] (2005); other critics compared the song with Evanescence's earlier material on Fallen. [...] "Lose Control" [...] was inspired by Balsamo's loud guitar and contains influences from Portishead. The protagonist shows her anger through the lines, [...] "You don't remember my name, I don't really care". According to Lee, the song is about wanting to be less apprehensive and looser.|$|E

500|$|The season {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of Smart House, however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize {{when it comes to this}} set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do it for you, that doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Shafi'i scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d 852 A.H.) too {{approved}} of the Mawlid and states that:As for what is performed {{on the day of}} the Mawlid, one should limit oneself to what expresses thanks to God, such as <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> already been mentioned: [...] recitation, serving food, alms-giving, and recitation of praise [...] about the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – and asceticism which motivate people to perform good deeds and act in view of the next world.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} {{that the existence of}} God can be known to all, even prior to exposure to any divine revelation, predates Christianity.

In this Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by St. Thomas and others, but that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1970, {{according}} to Barry, [...] "Robin rang me in Spain where I was on holiday [...] 'let's do it again'".

We want to apologise publicly to Robin for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been said." [...] Earlier in June 1970, Robin and Maurice recorded a dozen songs before Barry joined and included two songs that were on their reunion album. Around the same time, Barry and Robin were about to publish the book, On the Other Hand. They also recruited Geoff Bridgford as the group's official drummer; Bridgford had previously worked with the Groove and Tin Tin, and played drums on Maurice's unreleased first solo album.|$|E

2500|$|Moore-Bick {{is seen as}} aloof {{and lacking}} empathy; he {{concerned}} residents by suggesting only the technical causes of the fire would be investigated. Dent Coad said she still had less than “total confidence” in Moore-Bick, but “we {{have to work with}} the system we have, unfortunately.” Sources close to the inquiry suggest Moore-Bick is thinking of proposing an advisory panel. He is also inclined to recommend a two-stage inquiry: the first stage investigating the immediate causes of the fire, the second investigating broader issues over a longer period. Dent Coad said there must be a legal commitment to a second stage. [...] "We need to look at all the broader issues. One of the concerns about a two part inquiry – like with Hillsborough – is if it’s held off for too long and then it doesn’t happen at all, so that's a concern."
