5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a <b>turbulator.</b> The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E

50|$|These bubbles can {{be reduced}} or even {{eliminated}} by shaping the airfoil to move the separation point downstream or by adding a device, a <b>turbulator</b> that trips the boundary layer into turbulence. The turbulent boundary layer contains more energy, so will delay separation until a greater magnitude of negative pressure gradient is reached, effectively moving the separation point further aft on the airfoil and possibly eliminating separation completely. A consequence of the turbulent boundary layer is increased skin friction relative to a laminar boundary layer, but this is very small compared {{to the increase in}} drag associated with separation.|$|E

40|$|To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of {{the current state of the}} art of heat transfer augmentation schemes employed for internal cooling of turbine blades and components, results from an extensive literature review are presented with data from internal cooling channels, both with and without rotation. According to this survey, a very small number of existing investigations consider the use of combination devices for internal passage heat transfer augmentation. Examples are rib <b>turbulators,</b> pin fins, and dimples together, a combination of pin fins and dimples, and rib <b>turbulators</b> and pin fins in combination. The results of such studies are compared with data obtained prior to 2003 without rotation influences. Those data are comprised of heat transfer augmentation results for internal cooling channels, with rib <b>turbulators,</b> pin fins, dimpled surfaces, surfaces with protrusions, swirl chambers, or surface roughness. This comparison reveals that all of the new data, obtained since 2003, collect within the distribution of globally averaged data obtained from investigations conducted prior to 2003 (without rotation influences). The same conclusion in regard to data distributions is also reached in regard to globally averaged thermal performance parameters as they vary with friction factor ratio. These comparisons, made on the basis of such judgment criteria, lead to the conclusion that improvements in our ability to provide better spatially-averaged thermal protection have been minimal since 2003. When rotation is present, existing investigations provide little evidence of overall increases or decreases in overall thermal performance characteristics with rotation, at any value of rotation number, buoyancy parameter, density ratio, or Reynolds number. Comparisons between existing rotating channel experimental data and the results obtained prior to 2003, without rotation influences, also show that rotation has little effect on overall spatially-averaged thermal performance as a function of friction factor...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{critical}} role that aerodynamic efficiency plays {{in the performance of}} a glider, gliders often have aerodynamic features seldom found in other aircraft. The wings of a modern racing glider have a specially designed low-drag laminar flow airfoil. After the wings' surfaces have been shaped by a mold to great accuracy, they are then highly polished. Vertical winglets at the ends of the wings are computer-designed to decrease drag and improve handling performance. Special aerodynamic seals are used at the ailerons, rudder and elevator to prevent the flow of air through control surface gaps. <b>Turbulator</b> devices {{in the form of a}} zig-zag tape or multiple blow holes positioned in a span-wise line along the wing are used to trip laminar flow air into turbulent flow at a desired location on the wing.
