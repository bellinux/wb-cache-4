S. adolescents, a <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> troublesome {{from a public}} health perspective {{because they have been}} linked to conventional tobacco smoking. In Vermont, recent data from 2015 reports that 30 % of high school students ever used electronic vapor products. At present the scientific, regulatory, and lay communities all have a dearth of quality information regarding e-cigarettes and their potential adverse health effects. This school-based intervention aims to promote awareness and educate at-risk youth in the Milton School District about e-cigarettes through an educational fact sheet and health blog post.

The detections of the information relating to the left road today are conducted with standardized mode between those of local police; regarding the real relief it is realized with triangulation techniques, with the aid of manual instrumentation consists casters metrics in plastic or steel wires. The GNSS techniques in NRTK lend themselves well to this type of survey, the high information content and to manage different metadata (maps, coordinates, photographs, details of the accident) that are useful for the detection of claims. This paper reports the experience that has been conducted in teams to aid detection of road accidents {{in the body of the}} Municipal Police of Palermo using the Topcon GNSS instrumentation, and in particular a GNSS receiver GRS 1 equipped with software TopCRASH. The first results are very encouraging and lead to the conclusion that the GNSS in NRTK is ripe for interdisciplinary applications such as those related to road acciden...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} provides thirteen economic {{facts on}} the growth of income inequality {{and its relationship to}} social mobility in America; on the growing divide in educational opportunities and outcomes for high- and low-income students; and on the pivotal role education can play in increasing the ability of low-income Americans to move up the income ladder. It is well known that the income divide in the United States has increased substantially over the last few decades, a <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> true for families with children. In fact, according to Census Bureau data, more than one-third of children today are raised in families with lower incomes than comparable children thirty-five years ago. This sustained erosion of income among such a broad group of children is without precedent in recent American history. Over the same period, children living in the highest 5 percent of the family-income distribution have seen their families' incomes double. What is less well known, however, is that mounting evidence hints that the forces behind these divergent experiences are threatening the upward mobility of the youngest Americans, and that inequality of income for one generation may mean inequality of opportunity for the next. It is too early to say for certain whether the rise in income inequality {{over the past few decades}} has caused a fall in social mobility of the poor and those in the middle class [...] the first generation of Americans to grow up under this inequality is, on average, in high school [...] but the early signs are troubling...|$|E

As librarians and publishers, we must evolve as well. I strongly believe that in doing so we will be able to create unique and powerful new ways to help researchers become more productive and more effective. There <b>are</b> two <b>trends</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> challenging for researchers and the global research community. First is the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of research. The once rigid lines that divided traditional research disciplines have grown indistinct. Researchers are venturing into new realms of scientific exploration that actively force the intersection of traditional disciplines.

40|$|In {{terrestrial}} ecosystems, fungi are {{the major}} agents of decomposition processes and nutrient cycling and of plant nutrient uptake. Hence, they have a vital impact on ecosystem processes and the terrestrial carbon cycle. Changes in productivity and phenology of fungal fruit bodies can give clues to changes in fungal activity, but understanding these changes {{in relation to a}} changing climate is a pending challenge among ecologists. Here we report on phenological changes in fungal fruiting in Europe over the past four decades. Analyses of 746, 297 dated and geo-referenced mushroom records of 486 autumnal fruiting species from Austria, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom revealed a widening of the annual fruiting season in all countries during the period 1970 – 2007. The mean annual day of fruiting has become later in all countries. However, the interspecific variation in phenological responses was high. Most species moved toward a later ending of their annual fruiting period, a <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> strong in the United Kingdom, which may reflect regional variation in climate change and its effects. Fruiting of both saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi now continues later in the year, but mycorrhizal fungi generally have a more compressed season than saprotrophs. This difference is probably due to the fruiting of mycorrhizal fungi partly depending on cues from the host plant. Extension of the European fungal fruiting season parallels an extended vegetation season in Europe. Changes in fruiting phenology imply changes in mycelia activity, with implications for ecosystem function...|$|R
40|$|What {{implication}} does {{membership of}} the European Union (EU) have for the national diplomatic systems of its member states? How valid {{is the notion of}} a collective EU diplomacy? These two linked but distinct questions form the focus of this chapter. In examining the impact that the EU has had on its member states, a common approach has been to use the concept of Europeanization as a means of denoting the way in which national policy-making has adapted to the European context (Blair, 2002). A central feature of this viewpoint is the growth in the number and range of areas of government <b>that</b> <b>are</b> affected by and are involved in European policy. This <b>is</b> a <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> has <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> apparent in recent years, with the introduction of the Single European Market (SEM) acting not just as a catalyst for closer economic and trading links, but also as the driving force behind further integration in such areas as social policy. Thus, whereas {{the early years of the}} Community saw a great deal of activity centred on a relatively narrow group of policy areas, such as agriculture, this has now expanded to cover all aspects of government, including developments at the local, regional and national level...|$|R
40|$|The god Janus in Greek mythology was a two-faced god; each {{face had}} its own view of the world. Our idea behind the Janus Head article is to give you two {{different}} and maybe even contradicting views on a certain topic. This issue's Janus Head Article, however, features not two but three different views on terminology work, as researchers, professionals and students (the professionals of tomorrow) discuss "How Much Terminology Theory Can Practical Terminology Management Use? " at DaimlerChrysler AG. Overview Recent years have seen the rising importance of terminology work[1] within business enterprises, a <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> has <b>been</b> <b>particularly</b> fuelled by increasing globalization. A few decades ago, only trained terminologists and translators concerned themselves with the problems involved in developing unambiguous terminology. Today, however, many companies have realized that professional terminology management can decisively boost their competitiveness. This <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> important in the public image areas of Customer Communication and Corporate Language. The result of these developments can be seen through the gradual implementation of what has already been learned from terminology theory and research, and the increasing relevance of terminology studies at colleges and universities. In a cooperative project between DaimlerChrysler AG (DC) and the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, we allowed theory and practice to clash and examined the particular day-to-day terminological challenges faced by the "Language Technology Processes and Methods " team at DaimlerChrysler. Does everything taught by terminology theory prove true in the real terminology-management world? Of course not. But precisely where do theory and practice contradict one another? And what are the reasons for such deviation...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{influence}} {{of economic and}} organizational theories on modern <b>trends</b> in education, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> evident {{in the last few}} decades, has also affected the implementation of marketing orientation in this area. The dilemmas and misunderstandings concerning the application of marketing concepts in education as a specific sphere of social activity where the use of market mechanisms wasn't optimal, were not explained. Nonetheless, such a development can not completely be ruled out, noting that the application of this concept in education has a much broader meaning and significance. To put it another way, it means that the concept of marketing in education is not exclusively oriented towards profit making, but it is primarily focused on motivation and the development of valuable personality traits, and the formation of diverse interests and a wide range of educational needs of potential users. In such developing higher education sector, and institutions for adult's education, one can apply the 'marketing principles and strategies', {{in the interests of the}}se institutions, but also in the interests of the users of educational services and the society in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{fifteenth century}} saw a {{striking}} upturn {{in the number}} of texts from foreign vernaculars <b>that</b> <b>were</b> translated into Irish. Indeed, one might {{go so far as to}} speak in terms of a ‘translation trend’ in Ireland during the mid to late fifteenth century. A notable feature of this <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a <b>particularly</b> high number of these Irish translations are of romances; contextual and textual evidence suggests that the original exemplars for many of these translated texts appear to have come from England, though not all of them were necessarily in English. Irish translations of eight romances have survived to the present day: Guy of Warwick; Bevis of Hampton; La Queste de Saint Graal; Fierabras; Caxton’s Recuyell of the Histories of Troie; William of Palerne; the Seven Sages of Rome; and Octavian. This paper addresses two aspects of these texts of particular relevance to romance scholars who do not work within the sphere of Celtic studies. Firstly, it argues that certain aspects of the dissemination and reception of romance in Ireland are quite distinctive. Manuscript and textual evidence suggests that the religious orders, particularly the Franciscans, seem to have played a role in the importation and translation of these narratives. Secondly, examination of the Irish versions of romance tends to bear out an observation made by Flower many years ago, but not pursued by subsequent scholars: ‘texts of an unusual kind were current in Ireland, and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> interesting discoveries <b>are</b> to be made here’. Certain narrative features of several of these Irish translations diverge from all the surviving versions of the relevant romance in other languages and may witness to a variant exemplar <b>that</b> has since <b>been</b> lost from its own linguistic corpus...|$|R
