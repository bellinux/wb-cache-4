40|$|I {{would like}} to thank my advisor Prof. Ahmed El. Amawy for making this work possible. No words of thanks are enough for his mentorship, guidance, support and patience. I must {{acknowledge}} the freedom he gave me in pursuing research topics that I found interesting. His keen observations and tremendous experience helped me a great deal in defining path for my research. I have learned <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> from him {{in the last couple of}} years both as a researcher and as a person. I {{would like to}} thank Prof. J. Ramanujam and Prof. Hsiao-Chun Wu, for taking their valuable time out and agreeing to be on my thesis committee. I {{would like to thank}} my entire family for their support and love throughout. Rana <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> all the help. No acknowledgement is complete without mentioning the friends I made at LSU. I will always remember them for making my stay away from home a most memorable one. Thank you one and all for always being there. Finally, I would like to thank my best friend and husband Lalit, without whose love and support none of this would have been possible. i...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] Tues., June 15, 1943 Dear Miss Blaney, I {{finally got}} around to answer your letter. At the present time, I am a very busy man in our Uncle’s Army. During the day I am working at Battalion Headquarters office and at night, I’m {{teaching}} a group of illiterates. So you see, I have very little time to myself. It is really a site [sic], Miss Blaney, {{to see so many}} soldiers who can’t either read or write. You would never think that such a condition existed in this land of ours which has equal opportunities for all. Before I go any further, I want to thank you personally for that nice box of “goodies. ” That was really nice of you. I was awfully glad to hear from you that Ben Scuda has been found. I bet that brought much happiness to his family. He must have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of interesting stories to tell. I really haven’t much to say as to my activities as a soldier. All I do is clerical work and teach illiterates. As far as being a soldier, I’m one just in uniform. How is the Bryant Ledger working out? I bet those girls are doing just as well a job as the fellows have in the post or even better. Is Mr. Mercier still free from Uncle Sam? How are all the other teachers, Miss Hines, Miss Collins, etc. ? I should like to write to them individually, but time doesn’t permit. Someday I shall surprise them with a letter. I’m sorry I have to write such a short letter, but I must get back to work. Give everyone at school my regards and in closing, <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> that package. Sincerely, 								John 								[Transcription ends...|$|R
40|$|Finally it is a fact. We have {{recently}} closed issue 27 / 2 and hereby start issue 27 / 3 – {{the first time}} ever that we have 3 issues within one year. Issue 27 / 3 is already completely filled with manuscripts that are either finished, are under revision or are under review. Our current planning is to get all remaining manuscripts online sometime in January, after which we will start immediately issue 28 / 1. Over the last 12 months, the usage statistics for the OSG website have been very healthy! For the Bulletin, we have averaged about 5. 000 visitors and 18. 000 pages per month. For the e-Library (which is only for members), we average 225 visitors and 600 page loads per month. Not bad, since we have only 224 members (but of course, several people visit more than once in a month). It is YOUR website, and it is your contributions that have made it a great success and resource for otter workers. We have passed another historical landmark, as the last report in the last issue was article 300 that is currently online available. Please also keep in mind that all articles are also available via the Directory of Open Access Journals. Thanks to Lesley we have a steady progress with the work to digitalize the remaining six issues that are not available via the website yet. Lesley, <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> all efforts to cope with this increasing flow of manuscripts and your work behind the scenes. We have not received any information regarding the pending decision by Thompson ISI on whether an Impact Factor will be assigned to the IUCN OSG Bull. We are under evaluation and I will inform all readers as soon as a decision will be made public. On behalf of Jim, Lesley and I would like {{to thank all of you}} that have sent greetings to him. I’m sure you all join us in wishing him a full and speedy recovery...|$|R
40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to warmly thank Sébastien Ourselin. Back in 2007, he {{accepted}} me for doing a PhD in his lab (e-Health Research Centre, Brisbane, Australia) and {{gave me the opportunity}} to work on state-of-the-art topics like GPGPU programming for instance. He also thought that developing a fast shell-based finite element model for soft tissues would make a great PhD topic. And after the completion of my PhD, I must say that he was right. So <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> Seb <b>for</b> all your help and support during the 9 months we worked together and even beyond. Thank you as well for all the good wines you brought at each BBQ we did in Brisbane. And yes, Australians can be proud of their wine. Last but not least, thanks for not doing anything to compromise the success of my PhD once you were at UCL. I very much appreciated this and I will not forget it. Merci pour tout Seb. I would now like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Stéphane Cotin. I greatly appreciated to work with you during these three years. Your great understanding of the field and your logical way of thinking have bee...|$|R

5000|$|He said <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{and he sat}} {{right down}} and I gave him {{a piece of the}} sheep. This is the finest piece of moose I knows I ever eat.

40|$|The {{document}} you {{are reading}} now, is a formal ending {{of a very}} small stage of a never ending process of my learning from the pool of information and knowledge, which supports our civilization and helps in its advancement. For initiating me into this field and for guiding me patiently during all this time, I express my gratitude to my research supervisor Prof. H. S. Jamadagni. Just having {{the feeling that he}} is around to help me out whenever I will run into any problem, was assuring enough to make me take a number of initiatives in numerous unknown and uncertain territories. This is one formal opportunity to mention Samar, Satyajeet and T. V. Prabhakar <b>for</b> providing me <b>lots</b> of clarifications and enlightening discussions. Things must have been really tough without you- <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to you. My lab mates Ramakrishna and Dinesh have always given me good company in my lab, many many thanks to them. Abid, Haresh, Dr. Joy Kuri and Venkatesh Prasad have also helped me whenever I needed, <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to them...|$|R

We also want to <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to Annette Christensen and Rita Buch, who gave us great help in our lab work. We hope you will enjoy reading our project report...|$|R
