5|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} Singapore administrative law are the prerogative orders – the mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) – and the declaration, {{a form of}} equitable remedy. In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E
5|$|During a {{night out}} in {{the one of the}} Zones – the cordoned off zone of {{decaying}} ghettos surrounding the City of London – Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike's former mistress. Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader might be a better option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to shop for arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Columbia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son.|$|E
25|$|Instant replay is {{now officially}} sanctioned and standardized. All plays are {{reviewed}} by the replay officials as the play occurs. They may call down to the on-field officials to stop play if they need extra {{time to make a}} review. Each coach may also make one challenge per game. In the case of a coach's challenge, the coach must have at least one time-out remaining. If <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> upheld the coach gets the time-out back but <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> spent.

40|$|Introduction <b>The</b> AAAI Robot <b>Challenge</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} {{four years}} ago as a "grand challenge" for mobile robots. The main objectives of <b>the</b> <b>Challenge</b> <b>are</b> to (a) provide a task that will demonstrate a high level of intelligence and autonomy for robots acting in a natural, peopled, dynamic environment, (b) stimulate state-of-the-art robotics research to address this task, and (c) use robot demonstrations to educate the public about the exciting and difficult challenges of robotics research. <b>The</b> <b>Challenge</b> <b>was</b> designed as a problem that would probably need a decade to achieve adequately. When <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> designed, it was anticipated that no single research institution would have adequate resources to meet <b>the</b> <b>Challenge</b> on its own. <b>The</b> <b>Challenge</b> task <b>is</b> to find the registration booth and register at the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, interact with other attendees, and give a technical talk on itself in an assigned room, and at an assigned time.

The on-field umpire then makes the final decision: either re-signalling a call that is standing or revoking a call that is being reversed and then making the corrected signal. Only clearly incorrect decisions are reversed; if the Third Umpire's analysis is within established margins of error or is otherwise inconclusive, the on-field umpire's original call stands.|$|E

25|$|The {{strategic}} problem {{therefore is}} how {{to ensure that the}} appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived {{in various parts of the}} social system.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{investigation}} of eastern women’s lives, {{they found that}} though the GDR’s socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, {{there had been no}} women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler’s, has allowed women’s historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn’t too difficult, but <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works.|$|E
25|$|Each {{category}} is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common, {{such as the}} empty set or the product of two topologies, yet {{in the definition of}} a category, objects are considered atomic, i.e., we do not know whether an object A is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. To define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets, one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find universal properties that uniquely determine the objects of interest.|$|E
