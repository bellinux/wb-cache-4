I dont {{understand}} what Robert Plant is saying, though I suppose thats a good thing. I dont know the lyrics. I <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> about hobbits or something." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{describing}} this album, Reeves Gabrels said [...] "this {{album is}} as aggressive {{as the first}} one, but the songs are more melodic. Last time, we were screaming at the world. This time, I <b>think,</b> <b>theyre</b> all love songs in a strange kind of way." [...] Reeves joked that his playing style was something his friends called [...] "modal chromaticism, which is any note you want {{as long as you}} end on a right note." ...|$|E
5000|$|Meme is the {{youngest}} child of Osamu and Venus, younger sister to Misa and Samatarou. Meme {{is a candidate for}} goddess status and controls some of her powers, despite her young age; like her sister Misa, she is quite skilled at controlling peoples emotions. Meme usually appears emotionless and acts quite mature for her age, but she is a child. Her lack of experience can cause her to join in with the mad antics of her older relatives, possibly because she has no reason to <b>think</b> what <b>theyre</b> doing is in any way unreasonable.|$|R
5000|$|The poor {{critical}} {{reception of}} the film prompted Lean {{to meet with the}} National Society of Film Critics, gathered at the Algonquin Hotel in New York, including The New Yorkers Pauline Kael, and ask them why they objected to the movie. [...] "I sensed trouble from the moment I sat down," [...] Lean says of the now famous luncheon. TIME critic Richard Shickel asked Lean pointblank how he, the director of Brief Encounter, could have made [...] "a piece of bullshit" [...] like Ryans Daughter. These critics so lacerated the film for two hours to David Leans face that the devastated Lean did not make another film for fourteen years. [...] "They just took the film to bits," [...] said Lean in a later television interview. [...] "It really had such an awful effect on me for several years... you begin to <b>think</b> that maybe <b>theyre</b> right. Why on earth am I making films if I dont have to? It shakes ones confidence terribly."" ...|$|R
5000|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parents realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If Im just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say theyre going to be back at midnight and they dont come back, you immediately <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> dead and you start to worry. If theyd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just dont think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{final four}} girls {{learn how to}} {{correctly}} represent themselves, and use a pie chart that represents what means the most to them, and what means the least to them (Health, Family, Sex, Career, and Fun). When Destiney and Brandi M. make sex the least important, Heather calls them out for saying she doesnt <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> being honest, especially when Destiney picked up on guys on I Love Money, and that Brandi M. made a PSA of being slutty. Later on, Destiney and Heather argue and Destiney cries because she doesnt like Heather, who she thought was her friend, accusing her of being a liar. Heather now doesnt trust {{any of the other}} girls. The girls learn their next challenge is to brand themselves by creating an original T-shirt for designer Christian Audigier. Destiney feels this challenge is right up her alley and makes her shirt with a flying guitar on it, Brandi M. makes her shirt with an octopus on it to show how much shes grown as a person, Lacey makes her shirt about the environment, and Heather puts her face on her shirt to show how much shes changed since then. Heathers assistants computer crashes and barely had enough time to finish the design.|$|E
5000|$|The parodies {{frequently}} make comedic use of {{the fourth}} wall, breaking character, and meta-references. Within an ostensibly self-contained storyline, the characters may refer to {{the technical aspects of}} filmmaking, the publicity, hype or box office surrounding their project, their own past roles or real-life circumstances, and critical analysis of clichés. In the final panel of [...] "The $ound of Money", the magazines 1966 parody of The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews sings a parody of the song [...] "Climb Evry Mountain". The rewritten lyrics reference both the producers decision to create scarcity and maximize box office profits by running the film in just one theater per city at inflated ticket prices ("Charge high admissions; / Let people wait; / That will make them <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> / Seeing something great!"), as well as Warner Brothers decision to replace Andrews with Audrey Hepburn in its movie adaptation of My Fair Lady. Andrews had been a great success as Eliza Doolittle in the original Broadway production, but she was passed over for the film role. Despite the high-profile snub, Andrews made an Oscar-winning debut in Mary Poppins - released four months before My Fair Lady - and solidifying her big screen success with The Sound of Music. Concluding the Mad parody, Andrews gleefully sings: ...|$|E
5000|$|These {{students}} then join {{the other girls}} in Lecture Hall and Ricki calls for Ashley, Marcia and Ki Ki {{to come to the}} carpet. As theyre asked why they <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> up for elimination, an argument breaks out between Ki Ki and Marcia. Meanwhile, Farrah mumbles that she doesnt {{want to be a part}} of [...] "this" [...] anymore. So Hood comments that the Rock of Love girls drink too much, which prompts Farrah to leave the area. Ashley, with Marcia right behind her, follows, shouting that Charm School has become the Real Chance of Love show. Stryker takes the remaining girls to detention hall to cool off. Rikki, in an attempt to get them to stay, heads up to see Ashley, Farrah and Marcia who have already packed their suitcases and are dressed in their casual clothes. In the detention hall, La La states that what shes observing between the girls is a potential black versus white issue, but they say that isnt the case. As things seem to be more calm, all the girls return to the elimination ceremony. Ricki explains to Ashley, Marcia and Ki Ki that they should all be sent home this evening for their behavior, but ultimately asks Ki Ki for her Charm School pin. Rikkis decision was mostly influenced by the fact that many of Ki Kis schoolmates fear her. The Real Chance of Love girls become upset and most walk off, shouting the decision was [...] "fixed". As the episode comes to a close, the audience sees So Hood changing her clothes and packing her things. She says shed rather leave then be on the carpet next to Farrah or Marcia; girls she feels deserve to be sent home before she does.|$|E
5000|$|Ian Freer, {{writing for}} Empire, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars with the verdict, [...] "A kind of Goonies for the Noughties, Monster House is a {{visually}} dazzling thrill ride that scales greater heights through its winning characters and poignantly etched emotions. A scary, sharp, funny movie, {{this is the}} best kids’ flick of the year so far." [...] Jane Boursaw of Common Sense Media also gave it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "This is one of those movies where all the planets align: a top-notch crew (director Gil Kenan; executive producers Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis), memorable voices that fit the characters perfectly; and a great story, ingenious backstory, and twisty-turny ending." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel wrote, [...] "This Monster House is a real fun house. Its a 3-D animated kids film built on classic gothic horror lines, a jokey, spooky Goonies for the new millennium." [...] He also gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Scott Bowles of USA Today observed, [...] "The movie treats children with respect. Monsters pre-teens are sarcastic, <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> smarter than their parents and are going crazy over the opposite sex. Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote, [...] "Its engineered to scare your pants off, split your sides and squeeze your tear ducts into submission." [...] Michael Medved called it [...] "ingenious" [...] and [...] "slick, clever and funny" [...] while also cautioning parents about letting small children see it due to its scary and intense nature, adding that a [...] "PG-13 rating" [...] would have been more appropriate than its [...] "PG rating." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times commented, [...] "One of the spooky archetypes of childhood imagination — the dark, mysterious house across the street — is literally brought to life in “Monster House,” a marvelously creepy animated feature directed by Gil Kenan." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} a critical and commercial disappointment, but has since received much stronger modern reviews. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a positive score of 75% {{based on a}} sample of 20 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10. Siskel & Ebert were split, Siskel giving the film a [...] "thumbs up" [...] and Ebert giving it a [...] "thumbs down," [...] criticizing Allie Fox for being [...] "boring." [...] However, he did compliment Fords performance. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it [...] "utterly flat." [...] In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote, [...] "Sooner or later a man of invention will pollute paradise, a grand contradiction that gives Mosquito its bite and Ford inspiration for his most complex portrayal to date. As a persona of epic polarities, he animates this muddled, metaphysical journey into the jungle." [...] In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Sheila Benson wrote, [...] "Hes orchestrated The Mosquito Coasts action to match Foxs progressive mental state, from rage to explosion to squalls and finally to hurricane velocity; however, the film leaves us not with an apotheosis, but exhaustion." [...] In his review for The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote, [...] "The Mosquito Coast {{is a work of}} consummate craftsmanship and its spectacularly acted, down to the smallest roles ... but its field of vision is as narrow and eventually as claustrophobic as Allies." [...] The negative reviews the film received prompted Harrison Ford to defend the film in the media: [...] "there have been mixed reviews and I think the film has been very unfairly treated in some quarters. I have never seen a serious film treated so badly by the critics. And I <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> wrong. I dont mind saying Im here trying to counter those negative reviews ... Im not defensive about the picture, but I want the public to hear another point of view. Critics see a film and then rush to review it. This is the sort of movie that really doesnt sink home for about three days. It is disturbing and makes you think. It stays with you." ...|$|E
