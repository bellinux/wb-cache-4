5|$|Of {{the actors}} {{cast in the}} four leading roles, only Gina McKee {{was a native of}} North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related {{strongly}} to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether {{it would be possible to}} age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> 50s resulted in her resembling a drag queen.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, {{she did not think}} that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes.

25|$|Then, {{there is}} the {{question}} of the last three poems that were found among her papers. They seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> handwriting, which is why Killigrew’s father added them to her book. The poems are about the despair the author has for another woman, and could possibly be autobiographical if they are in fact by Killigrew. Some of her other poems are about failed friendships, possibly with Anne Finch, so this assumption may have some validity.|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{cultural}} taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant, {{that may have}} reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge {{that she could not}} survive the delivery. [...] Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false. [...] Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery. As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant. The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb , [...] "to cut", with children delivered this way referred to as caesones. [...] Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ab utero caeso, [...] "cut from the womb" [...] giving this as an explanation for the cognomen [...] "Caesar" [...] which was then carried by his descendants. [...] Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as [...] "the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar". Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, [...] "from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen Caesar" ...|$|E
