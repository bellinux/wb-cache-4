2500|$|In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> {{profession}} {{began with}} the vocational guidance movement {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century now known as career development. Jesse B. Davis was the first to provide a systematic school guidance program. In 1907, he became the principal of a high school and encouraged the school English teachers to use compositions and lessons to relate career interests, develop character, and avoid behavioral problems. Many others during this time also focused on what is now called career development. For example, in 1908, Frank Parsons, [...] "Father of Vocational Guidance" [...] established the Bureau of Vocational Guidance to assist young people in making the transition from school to work.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1920s to the 1930s, school {{counseling}} [...] grew {{because of the}} rise of progressive education in schools. This movement emphasized personal, social, moral development. Many schools reacted to this movement as anti-educational, saying that schools should teach only the fundamentals of education. This, combined with the economic hardship of the Great Depression, led to a decline in {{school counseling}}. In the 1940s, psychologists and counselors selected, recruited, and trained military personnel. This propelled <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> movement in schools by providing ways to test students and meet their needs. Schools accepted these military tests openly. Also, Carl Rogers' emphasis on helping relationships and a move away from directive [...] "guidance" [...] to nondirective or person-centered [...] "counseling" [...] influenced the profession of school counseling.|$|E
