The school's finances were in a state of chaos, and it would take effort and time to dig out of the mess. The dean of the Law School, Paul M. Hebert, became the acting president, and Middleton became acting vice president and comptroller. Middleton chose two accounting professors, Dr. Daniel Borth and Dr. Mack Hornbeak, to work with him, and a New York firm was hired <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> establish sound business procedures.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 43 in {{the first}} innings, the second Test in Lahore came down to a run-chase for Australia, with Harvey and Norm O'Neill {{seemingly}} on schedule to win before time ran out. However, the Pakistani fielders began to waste time {{in an attempt to}} foil an Australian victory. They swapped the cover and midwicket fielders very slowly whenever the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single and changed the batsman on strike. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away from a straight ball and let himself be bowled, throwing his wicket away for 37. This allowed Benaud <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give the Pakistanis no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Australia won the match with minutes to spare. Harvey scored 54 and 13 not out in the drawn third Test at Karachi. Australia took the series 2–0, but would not win another Test in Pakistan until 1998. Harvey ended the series with 273 runs at 54.60.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season O'Neill was Australia's leading batsman {{during the}} 1959–60 tour to Pakistan and India, {{where he was}} a part of the last Australian team to win a Test on Pakistani soil for 39 years. After a quiet match in the First Test eight-wicket win in Dacca in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), in which he scored two and 26 not out, O'Neill played a key role in the victory in the Second Test in Lahore that was to Australia's last in Pakistan until 1998. O'Neill made his maiden Test century of 134 in the first innings to give Australia a 245-run lead. He then took his maiden Test wicket in Pakistan's second innings, that of Shujauddin. This left Australia chasing a target of 122 in the last two hours on the final day. The chase was on schedule with O'Neill partnering Neil Harvey when the Pakistanis began wasting time to prevent an Australian victory. This was implemented by swapping fielders very slowly when the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single, and overs began taking seven minutes instead of three. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away when a ball was aimed at the stumps and threw away his wicket by letting himself be bowled for 37. This allowed Benaud <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Benaud then threatened Pakistani captain Imtiaz Ahmed with a formal complaint over the time-wasting, and proceesings returned to their normal pace. Australia made the target with a few minutes to spare, with O'Neill on 43. O'Neill failed to make double figures in the final Test, which was drawn, but ended the series with 218 runs at 72.66. In another tour match, against the President's XI, O'Neill scored an unbeaten 52 in a low-scoring match as Australia stumbled to their target of 116 with only three wickets in hand.|$|E

25|$|By Biblical law, Jews who {{own land}} are {{required}} to make their land available during the Shmita to anyone who wishes <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> harvest. If the land is fenced etc., gates must be left open to enable entrance. These rules apply to all outdoor agriculture, including private gardens and even outdoor potted plants. Plants inside a building are exempt. However, the Rabbis of the Mishna and Jerusalem Talmud imposed rabbinic ordinances on harvesters to ensure an orderly and equitable process and to prevent a few individuals from taking everything. Harvesters on others' land are permitted to take only enough to feed themselves and their families.|$|E
25|$|Taylor and Marsh {{went on the}} attack, {{sensing the}} {{possibility}} of a humiliating 10 wicket victory. However it was not to be. They made a solid opening stand of 62, but Marsh mistimed Emburey to be caught by Robinson for 31. That left Boon <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> he and Taylor mopped up the last few runs. Boon swept Nick Cook to the square leg boundary for four to bring up the winning runs, and Australia had regained the Ashes by taking an unassailable 3-0 lead with only two tests remaining to be played. Geoff Lawson's match figures of 9 for 153 earned him the man-of-the-match award.|$|E

25|$|The {{other type}} of {{exchange}} {{is known as a}} bike-to-bike exchange. The only reason that a team would use this type of exchange is if the team members are not all approximately the same height. More often than not, it is because one member of the team is shorter than the rest because most cyclists in the race are fairly tall. This exchange is far simpler than the other. The first rider only has <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> tap the next rider's shoulder or arm and then the other racer can begin. While this is much easier than the other exchange, it is significantly slower because the second racer is starting from a dead stop, while riders performing the man-to-man exchange have some forward momentum.|$|E
25|$|In early 2016, it was {{announced}} that British boxer Amir Khan was moving up two weight divisions to middleweight, to fight Álvarez for his lineal, Ring and WBC world middleweight championship titles. The fight took place on 7 May 2016, at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bout was on HBO PPV. Khan kept his distance in the first 5 rounds, using his speed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> step out which initially caused trouble for Canelo. In round 6, Canelo landed a devastating right hand that knocked out Khan. The fight generated a live gate of $7,417,350, according to figures released by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. That total came from 13,072 tickets sold, far short of a sellout. The Álvarez-Khan gross places it 34th-best in Nevada history.|$|E

25|$|With {{funding from}} Edward Butler, Addams opened an art {{exhibition}} and studio space {{as one of}} the first additions to Hull House. On the first floor of the new addition there was a branch of the Chicago Public Library, and the second was the Butler Art Gallery, which featured recreations of famous artwork as well as the work of local artists. Studio space within the art gallery provided both Hull House residents and the entire community with the opportunity to take art classes or <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> hone their craft whenever they liked. As Hull House grew, and the relationship with the neighborhood deepened, that opportunity became less of a comfort to the poor and more of an outlet of expression and exchange of different cultures and diverse communities. Art and culture was becoming a bigger and more important part of the lives of immigrants within the 19th ward, and soon children caught on to the trend. These working-class children were offered instruction in all forms and levels of art. Places such as the Butler Art Gallery or the Bowen Country Club often hosted these classes, but more informal lessons would often be taught outdoors. Addams, with the help of Ellen Gates Starr, founded the Chicago Public School Art Society (CPSAS) in response to the positive reaction the art classes for children caused. The CPSAS provided public schools with reproductions of world-renowned pieces of art, hired artists to teach children how to create art, and also took the students on field trips to Chicago's many art museums.|$|E
