5|$|The video {{begins with}} shaky footage showing a figure mostly {{concealed}} {{in the shadow}} between two window-sized openings in a brick wall, through which leaves in trees can be seen blowing in the wind. These images are accompanied by indistinct electronic buzzing and hissing sounds.

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

25|$|Bell {{believed}} the photophone was {{his most important}} invention. The device allowed for the transmission of sound on a beam of light. On April 1, 1880, and also described by plaque as occurring on June 3, Bell's assistant transmitted the world's first wireless telephone message to him on their newly invented form of telecommunication, the far advanced precursor to fiber-optic communications. The wireless call was sent from the Franklin School <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of Bell's laboratory, some 213 meters away.|$|E
25|$|The {{cover of}} the album {{was created by the}} Zurich artist Ernst Gamper, with whom Yello had been working since 1982. Gamper painted the picture of a face on a sheet of celluloid, which he then taped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his studio {{overlooking}} Lake Zurich and photographed at sunset, with the setting sun shining through the unpainted eye to create a 'glowing eye' effect. The CD inlay booklet featured a photograph of Blank and Meier standing by the same window, with the painting visible on the window between them.|$|E
25|$|Ireland, angered {{that he had}} {{received}} no publicity even after three murders, killed again within three days.

25|$|The east window {{has been}} {{restored}} with glass from 1887.

The south wall has two windows, the eastern corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in the north wall. The other is a low side window of the late 13th century or early 14th century with one pointed light, set in a wide 14th-century recess. This window was probably unglazed with a wooden shutter {{and may have been}} used as a sanctus window through which the sanctus bell was rung at the Elevation of the host.|$|E

25|$|On 28 February 1998, Reddy {{raped and}} murdered 37-year-old widow Jayashree Maradi Subbaiah in Peenya. The police believe that he {{repeatedly}} raped the dead body. When her 8-year-old son Suresh returned from school, he saw Reddy in his house. Reddy told the boy that an evil spirit had entered his mother's body, so he had tied her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> grill. He then fled {{saying that he was}} going to get a doctor. Reddy then attempted to rape another woman in Peenya. When the woman raised the alarm, he tried to escape by jumping from the first floor of the house.

25|$|The video {{begins with}} Amy Lee {{dressed in a}} nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper.

During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.|$|E
25|$|Gillani escaped an {{assassination}} attempt on 3 September 2008, when unidentified gunmen fired shots at his motorcade near the garrison city of Rawalpindi, officials said. The shooting occurred shortly after Gillani was returning from an official visit to the eastern city of Lahore. His motorcade was going to Islamabad from the high-security Chaklala military airbase in Rawalpindi. A spokesman for the Prime Minister's House said Gillani and members of his staff had escaped unhurt and were safe. He said police had been put on high alert and an investigation launched into the incident. The unidentified assailants fired at Gillani's motorcade on a highway. At least two shots hit the Prime Minister's bulletproof vehicle, TV channels quoted officials as saying. State-run PTV beamed footage of {{the damage caused by}} the bullets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the driver's door of the vehicle. Reports said the incident occurred at a spot where former premier and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif's motorcade was fired at on 27 December last year, shortly before Pakistan People's Party (PPP) chairperson Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in a suicide bombing in Rawalpindi.|$|E
