40|$|Based on {{comprehensive}} {{survey of}} 6 transects on Luhuitou fringing reef in Sanya City of Hainan Island, China, some features of its biogeomorphologic processes were found, including (i) three basic biogeomorphologic units: inner reef flat, outer reef flat and reef slope; (ii) two important biogeomorphologic boundary lines: up limit for live flat coral growing between {{inner and outer}} reef flats is Mean Lower Low Water of <b>tropic</b> <b>tide</b> 15 cm; the break in slope between reef flat and reef slope is Theoretical Lowest Tide 15 cm; (iii) three types of reef flat profiles in response to distinctive Holocene sea level changes and dynamic condition: Luhuitou type responds to falling sea level and low wave energy; Xiaodonghai type to falling sea sevel and high wave energy; type for atolls of Nansha Islands to stable sea level and low wave energy; (iv) hermatypic coral community is the most essential member in coral reef ecosystem and plays the most important role in biogeomorphologic process. Over the past 30 years Luhuitou fringing reef was severely destroyed by human activities, its biogeomorphologic function severely weakened, and it needs urgent management and protection...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} coastal bio-geomorphologic units and zonation {{patterns}} of coral reefs and mangroves and their bio-geomorphologic boundaries {{as determined by}} tidal levels was undertaken. 20 transects were surveyed at 6 different coral reef and mangrove study sites on the tropical coast of southern China. 14 transects were undertaken at 4 mangrove stands, and 6 transects were carried out at 2 fringing coral reef sites. Bio-geomorphologic units and zonation patterns of coral reefs and mangroves were established based on a comprehensive biophysical survey, including biological, geomorphologic, sedimentary, and hydrodynamic surveys, and a diving survey on the reef slope along coral reef transects. Typical bio-geomorphologic units include inner reef flat, outer reef flat and reef slope on fringing reefs, and mangrove flat on mangrove coast. Each is distinguished by biological community distributions, landforms, sediments and hydrodynamic conditions. The bio-geomorphologic boundaries of fringing reefs and mangroves were determined by leveling surveys along each transect and local tidal observation. The upper limit for the flat coral growth between inner and outer reef flats is Mean Lower Low Water of <b>tropic</b> <b>tide.</b> The limit for hard coral growth from scattered to luxuriant, {{as well as the}} break of slope from reef flat to reef slope, is the Theoretical Lowest Tide. The lower and upper limit of mangrove flats were the Mean Sea Level (or slightly above) and the Mean Higher High Water Level respectively. It seems that tidal level is a control factor for bio-geomorphologic zonation of fringing reefs and mangroves. The study results assist understanding of the structure, function and management of tropical biological coasts...|$|E
40|$|The recent global mean {{sea level}} rise is {{dominated}} by the addition of water to the oceans, accounting for around two thirds of the increase. In contrast, altimetry trends from 1993 to 2010 reveal that the local trends are dominated by the steric contribution, involving density expansion from warming and freshening. We explore an intermediate view between the global and local reconstructions based upon zonal averaging. By combining altimetry or tide gauges along with steric reconstructions, we provide two independent estimates of the zonal average of the mass component of sea level trends. We find that the trend in the increase of mass is spatially dependent and can be partly explained using mass redistribution predictions from gravitational fingerprints. Our two estimates, though, have different zonally averaged patterns. We find that the mass contribution implied by altimetry results in a higher rate of sea level rise in the southern hemisphere and the <b>tropics,</b> while the <b>tide</b> gauges imply a higher rate of rise within the tropics. These different views can be reconciled by the sparse tide gauge data in the southern hemisphere and the tropics. We show that while various land movement corrections at each gauge can alter the magnitude of the trend, this does not impact on the general shape of their latitudinal distributions...|$|R
