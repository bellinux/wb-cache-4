5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> square guard) {{instead of the}} usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E
5|$|Hibiki is a {{young girl}} with little {{confidence}} in her abilities, except in tea making. When she met Shirotsuki, Hibiki was a shy girl who would hide in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> room in his house speechlessly. Eventually, Hibiki warmed up to Shirotsuki's affectionate personality and came to consider him a very important person. Hibiki can be very lighthearted, and always helps people who need it. She has no talent for magic, and relies on her master to help her in this regard. She is a crybaby and somewhat clumsy, but does her best and wins people over with her abundant kindness and warm heart.|$|E

As they walk out of the house, Michael turns around and looks at the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as we hear Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|E
50|$|For {{chemical}} compounds with regular lattices such as sodium chloride and caesium chloride, <b>a</b> count <b>of</b> the nearest neighbors gives <b>a</b> good picture <b>of</b> {{the environment of}} the ions. In sodium chloride each sodium ion has 6 chloride ions as nearest neighbours (at 276 pm) at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> octahedron and each chloride ion has 6 sodium atoms (also at 276 pm) at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> octahedron. In caesium chloride each caesium has 8 chloride ions (at 356 pm) situated at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cube and each chloride has eight caesium ions (also at 356 pm) at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cube.|$|R

5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. <b>The</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E

25|$|The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts has {{its origins}} in a 1919 {{donation}} of 50 paintings to the Commonwealth of Virginia by Judge and prominent Virginian John Barton Payne. Payne, in collaboration with Virginia Governor John Garland Pollard and the Federal Works Projects Administration, secured federal funding to augment state funding for the museum in 1932. Eventually, a site was chosen on Richmond's Boulevard. The site was toward <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contiguous six-block tract of land which was then being used as an American Civil War veterans' home, with additional services for their wives and daughters (the state having earlier acquired title in exchange for helping to subsidize the operations).|$|E
25|$|Jeulmun pottery sherds {{are found}} in light numbers {{throughout}} the area, indicating that occupation began {{at least from the}} Middle Jeulmun Pottery Period. A settlement with a number of pit-houses dating to {{the latter part of the}} Middle Jeulmun was excavated at Sangchon-ni (DAUM 2001b). At the same site charred human skeletal remains were discovered in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pit-house inside a large vessel apparently used as a burial urn. Additionally, there is evidence of a shallow ditch feature that may represent one of the first ditch-enclosed features in East Asian prehistory. Some carbonized seeds found in association with the pit-houses appear to show that Jeulmun people were engaged in small-scale cultivation (Bale 2001; Crawford and Lee 2003).|$|E
25|$|Persian {{architecture}} likely inherited {{an architectural}} tradition of dome-building {{dating back to}} the earliest Mesopotamian domes. Due to the scarcity of wood {{in many areas of the}} Iranian plateau, domes were an important part of vernacular architecture throughout Persian history. The Persian invention of the squinch, a series of concentric arches forming a half-cone over <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> room, enabled the transition from the walls of a square chamber to an octagonal base for a dome in a way reliable enough for large constructions and domes moved to the forefront of Persian architecture as a result. Pre-Islamic domes in Persia are commonly semi-elliptical, with pointed domes and those with conical outer shells being the majority of the domes in the Islamic periods.|$|E
