5|$|Other {{attempts}} to modify general relativity {{have been made}} in the context of cosmology. In the modern cosmological models, most energy in the universe is in forms <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been detected directly, namely dark energy and dark matter. There have been several controversial proposals to remove the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy, by modifying the laws governing gravity and the dynamics of cosmic expansion, for example modified Newtonian dynamics.|$|E

5|$|The solar heavy-element abundances {{described}} above are typically measured both using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been heated to melting temperatures.

5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E

5|$|Olympic {{sports are}} governed by {{international}} sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC. There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program.

During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme {{on the basis of a}} two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC. There are recognised sports <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been on an Olympic programme in any capacity, including chess and surfing.|$|E

Harvard was the first Ivy League team ranked in the Coaches' Poll since the 2009–10 Cornell Big Red and the first Ivy League team ranked in the AP Poll since the 1997–98 Princeton Tigers.

5|$|Barcelona is one {{of three}} {{founding}} members of the Primera División <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won 14 trophies in just 4 years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.
