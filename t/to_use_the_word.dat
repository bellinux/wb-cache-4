25|$|Since {{dead bodies}} are {{deposited}} in the grave, tradition and other sources have tended <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'grave' {{to refer to the}} life of Barzakh. Thus, grave is used synonymously for Barzakh. Muslims believe that each person is interrogated in the grave by two terrifying angels appointed by God. After the burial, the two angels, called Munkar and Nakir, come to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue.|$|E

By August 1906, The board reported that over 5,000 individuals had pledged <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> on <b>the</b> initial list, with another 500 to 600 agreeing <b>to</b> <b>use</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> but objecting to others.|$|R
25|$|In 1910, {{the school}} started <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Lise (Lyceum), a {{first in a}} Turkish school. İstanbul Lisesi was a 5-year {{boarding}} school charging tuition, and was admitting students following an examination. The physical education teacher of the school, Abdurrahman Roberson, established İstanbulspor and a boy scout group in 1912. The scout group, later named Sakarya {{in honor of the}} Turkish victory in Battle of Sakarya, is still active to this day. Also in 1912, during the First Balkan War, about 30 students volunteered for the defense of the capital against the advancing Bulgarian army.|$|E
25|$|While many mathematicians before Galois gave {{consideration}} to what are {{now known as}} groups, it was Galois {{who was the first}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> group (in French groupe) in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as group theory. He developed the concept that is today known as a normal subgroup. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a proper decomposition if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup. He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.|$|E
25|$|Many {{dictionaries}} {{suggest that}} the word chocolate comes from the Nahuatl chocolatl, based on an evolution from -tl to -te, however, {{there are problems with}} this hypothesis. Firstly Coe argued that the word chocolatl does not appear in the Aztec cultural writings of the time. Similarly the word is not found in the work of Alonso de Molina, a lexicographer of the time, who wrote a book about the grammar of the Aztec language in 1555. It is also absent from Bernardino de Sahagún's encyclopedia and from the Huehuetlatolli ("The words of the ancients") a guide to moral conduct. In all these works the word cacahuatl (cocoa water) is used. In his periodic letters, Hernán Cortés refers to 'cocoa.' At an indeterminate time in the 16th century, the Spanish of New Spain began <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> chocolatl.|$|E
50|$|Dr Benjamin Moore, a Liverpool physician, in 1910 in The Dawn of the Health Age was {{probably}} <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> 'National Health Service'.

25|$|Polyploidy was induced in fish by Har Swarup (1956) using a cold-shock {{treatment}} of the eggs close {{to the time of}} fertilization, which produced triploid embryos that successfully matured. Cold or heat shock has also been shown to result in unreduced amphibian gametes, though this occurs more commonly in eggs than in sperm. John Gurdon (1958) transplanted intact nuclei from somatic cells to produce diploid eggs in the frog, Xenopus (an extension of the work of Briggs and King in 1952) that were able to develop to the tadpole stage. The British Scientist, J. B. S. Haldane hailed the work for its potential medical applications and, in describing the results, {{became one of the first}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> “clone” in reference to animals. Later work by Shinya Yamanaka showed how mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent, extending the possibilities to non-stem cells. Gurdon and Yamanaka were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012 for this work.|$|E
25|$|Calvinists {{broke from}} the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. Calvinism differs from Lutherans {{on the real}} {{presence}} of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, {{and the use of}} God's law for believers, among other things. As declared in the Westminster and Second Helvetic confessions, the core doctrines are predestination and election. A basic principle is that they deny the Catholic teaching that humans can achieve salvation through their actions. The protestant part of this reformation was considering that the Bible be interpreted by itself, meaning the parts that are harder to understand are examined in the light of other passages where the Bible is more explicit on the matter. The term Calvinism can be misleading, because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse, {{with a wide range of}} influences rather than a single founder. The movement was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it referring to French reformer John Calvin, and many within the tradition would prefer <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Reformed.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the stories}} in dime novels stood alone, but in the late 1880s series {{characters}} began to appear and quickly grew in popularity. The original Frank Reade stories first appeared in Boys of New York. The Old Sleuth, appearing in The Fireside Companion story paper beginning in 1872, was the first dime-novel detective and began the trend away from the western and frontier stories that dominated the story papers and dime novels up to that time. He was the first character <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> sleuth to denote a detective, the word's original definition being that of a bloodhound trained to track. He is also responsible for {{the popularity of the}} use of the word old in the names of competing dime novel detectives, such as Old Cap Collier, Old Broadbrim, Old King Brady, Old Lightning, and Old Ferret, among many others. Nick Carter first appeared in 1886 in the New York Weekly. Frank Reade, the Old Sleuth and Nick Carter had their own ten-cent weekly titles within a few years.|$|E

25|$|With {{the close}} of Aurangzeb's (1707) reign began a period of disorder. The Marathas, who had incursions in south Gujarat for about half a century sent an {{expedition}} against Ahmedabad upon hearing death of Mughal emperor. Under the command of Balaji Vishwanath, the Marathas won over Mughal army in the Panch Mahals, plundered as far as Vatva within five miles of the city, and were only bought off by the payment of £21,000 (Rs. 2,10,000). In the city the next years were marked by riots and disturbance. In 1709 an order came from the new Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah I (1707-1712), that in the public prayers, among the attributes of the Khalif Ali, the Shia epithet wasi or heir should be introduced. This order caused great discontent among the Ahmedabad Sunnis. They warned the reader not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> wasi again, and, as he persisted in obeying orders, on the next occasion they dragged him from the pulpit and stabbed him to death. Three or four years later (1713-1714) another disturbance broke out, this time between the Hindus and Muslims. A Hindu insisting on burning the Holi near some Muslim houses, the Muslims retaliated by killing a cow. On this the Hindus seized a lad {{the son of a}} butcher and killed him. Then the Muslims especially the Afghans rose, sacked, and burned shops. They attacked a rich jeweller, Kapurchand, who defended his ward, pol, with matchlock men and killed several of the rioters. For three or four days work was at a standstill. Next year (1715) in the city the riots were renewed, shops were plundered and much mischief done, and outside (1716), the Kolis and Kathis grew so bold and presumptuous as {{to put a stop to}} trade.|$|E

500|$|Grapico is a caffeine-free, artificially flavored carbonated {{soft drink}} with a purple color and a grape taste that is sold in the Southeastern United States. When {{introduced}} in 1916, the product quickly became a success, which in part was due to implying that Grapico contained real grape juice even though it contained fake juice. In the spring of 1926, J. Grossman's Sons sold the Grapico business to New Orleans business Pan American Manufacturing Co. Pan American continued J.
