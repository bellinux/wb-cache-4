5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the teams is deeply {{embedded}} in British football hooliganism lore and culture, and has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs' two hooligan firms, the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers. Violence has occurred sporadically between the fans, once resulting {{in the death of}} a Millwall supporter in 1976. Most recently in the 2009 Upton Park riot, widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began. In the last two games between the sides in the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure the games were <b>trouble-free.</b>|$|E
5|$|The weather {{conditions}} became more breezy but remained {{hot in the}} Saturday morning practice sessions. Häkkinen was fastest in the third practice session {{with a time of}} 1:19.115. Barrichello was second quickest, recording a lap time 0.089 seconds slower than Häkkinen. Michael Schumacher was third fastest, two-tenths of a second in front of Trulli, Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve. Frentzen, Fisichella, Verstappen and Herbert completed the top ten. Coulthard did not set a lap during the third session as his team changed his engine as it developed an electrical problem. In the final practice session, Coulthard had a <b>trouble-free</b> session and was fastest with a time of 1:18.654. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello maintained their pace from Friday and were second and third fastest. Häkkinen was fourth quickest and was unable to improve his time as he passed an area with waved yellow flags. Trulli was fifth fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher who was running quicker after set-up changes. Villeneuve, Frentzen, Salo and Fisichella completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday morning and afternoon practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time in the first practice session, at 1 minute and 16.474 seconds, two-tenths of a second quicker than Häkkinen. Prost driver Nick Heidfeld was third fastest, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. The two Jaguar drivers were fifth and seventh, Eddie Irvine ahead of Johnny Herbert. The pair were separated by Fisichella in sixth. Jean Alesi, Pedro de la Rosa and Jenson Button completed the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Four drivers did not set lap times: Coulthard's car developed a mechanical fuel pump problem, Barrichello drove one installation lap to conserve tyres and both Jordan drivers decided to sit out the session. In the second practice session, Coulthard had a <b>trouble-free</b> session and was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:16.253; Häkkinen finished with the second fastest time. The Ferraris were second and fourth, Michael Schumacher was faster than Barrichello. Sauber's Mika Salo was fifth quickest, ahead of Fisichella. Trulli, Heidfeld, Ralf Schumacher and Frentzen followed in the top ten.|$|E
25|$|Some Yugo {{owners have}} {{reported}} that regular oil changes and appropriate maintenance allow the cars to remain dependable and <b>trouble-free.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scale {{refers to}} the size of the model {{relative}} to the actual full-sized object being represented, while gauge is the width of the model track. Most commercially produced model track is a compromise between appearance and a <b>trouble-free</b> running surface.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Pruitt–Igoe housed {{only six}} hundred people in {{seventeen}} buildings; the other sixteen buildings were boarded up. Meanwhile, adjacent Carr Village, a low-rise {{area with a}} similar demographic makeup, remained fully occupied and largely <b>trouble-free</b> throughout the construction, occupancy and decline of Pruitt–Igoe.|$|E
25|$|Dahlgren's former babysitter, Shauna Seymour, {{described}} him as a <b>trouble-free</b> person. According to Garry O'Dell, Dahlgrens' family friend, Kevin denied responsibility for the murders. Dahlgren claims that he went jogging and found the bodies after returning to the house. Scared for his own life, {{he wanted to get}} away as fast as possible.|$|E
25|$|Six YQ-1Bs {{were built}} for evaluation; they proved <b>trouble-free,</b> no {{production}} {{order for the}} type was undertaken, the competing Ryan Q-2 drone having been selected for operational service instead; as a result, the Q-1 program was terminated. However, the YQ-1B airframe was used by Radioplane as the start of {{development of a new}} anti-radar missile, which would be tested by the U.S. Air Force as the GAM-67 Crossbow.|$|E
25|$|Production {{numbers are}} not certain, but 74 {{appear on the}} reconstructed German civil {{aircraft}} register; 53 of these are M.23bs and 11 M.23cs. Many were bought by flying clubs for basic and acrobatic training. Other went to individual owners, with some familiar names amongst them like Ernst Udet (who made well publicised flights to Africa and to Greenland, the latter with Leni Riefenstahl as a passenger) and Rudolph Hess. In 1933, Erwin Aichele and his wife flew <b>trouble-free</b> for 13,000km (8,000mi) around the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|In 1842, Carson guided Frémont {{across the}} Oregon Trail to South Pass, Wyoming. This {{was their first}} {{expedition}} into the West together. The purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail as far as South Pass. A guidebook, maps, and other paraphernalia would be printed for westward-bound migrants and settlers. After the five-month, <b>trouble-free</b> mission was accomplished, Frémont wrote his government reports. These reports made Carson's name known across the United States, and spurred a migration of settlers westward to Oregon via the Oregon Trail.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} of a flush-toilet may be rated by a Maximum Performance (MaP) score. The low end of MaP scores is 250 (250grams of simulated fecal matter). The high end of MaP scores is 1000. A toilet with a MaP score of 1000 should provide <b>trouble-free</b> service. It should remove all waste with a single flush; it should not plug; it should not harbor any odor; it should be easy to keep clean. The United States Environmental Protection Agency uses a MaP score of 350 as the minimum performance threshold for HETs. 1.6 gpf toilets are also sometimes referred as ULF (Ultra Low Flow) toilets.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B1 or {{thiamine}} {{is present}} at a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 milligrams per litre. This vitamin {{is necessary for}} the proper growth of yeasts that ensure alcoholic fermentation. In the must of healthy grapes the natural quantity is sufficient for the yeast. On the other hand, for a degraded harvest (by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to add it to the must to ensure a <b>trouble-free</b> fermentation. In the case of a harvest with a very clear wort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine can help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30 milligrams per hectolitre.|$|E
25|$|Larbre Compétition earned Saleen {{their first}} LMGT1 {{category}} victory at Le Mans since the car {{first appeared in}} , finishing five laps ahead of the Alphand Corvette after having a <b>trouble-free</b> run, and {{was in fact the}} only car in the class to come from an endurance-based series. Aston Martin was leading the class but 2 gearbox replacements put them out of contention for the win, came in third in class and the last GT1 to finish. All three Ford GT1s dropped out in the night after mechanical problems. This is the second time that a GT1 winner stayed behind the GT2 field– this also occurred in 2001 under the GTS/GT classes, respectively– while the Saleen completing at a comparatively low 331 laps for this decade.|$|E
25|$|By 1981, the B31 {{was being}} used less and less. Gellini partnered Ridolfi in a 1.6-litre Cosworth BDG-engined car at the 1000km of Monza, but they lasted just nine laps before retiring. Jones and Barrie Williams then ran a 2-litre BDG-powered B31 at the 6 Hours of Silverstone, but the race was far from <b>trouble-free,</b> and the 141 laps that they {{completed}} were not enough to be classified. Götz, Binder and Blanckley initially entered a DFV-powered B31 in the 1000km of Nürburgring, but instead Götz and Binder drove a Lola T296, whilst Blanckley drove a McLaren M8 Special. The B31's best finish of 1981 came at the sixth round of the Interserie championship, held at Nürburgring; Götz brought his DFV-engined car home in seventh overall, and fourth in the Sports 2000+ class.|$|E
25|$|Byrd's {{first known}} {{professional}} employment was his appointment in 1563 as organist and {{master of the}} choristers at Lincoln Cathedral. Residing at what is now 6 Minster Yard Lincoln, he remained in post until 1572. His period at Lincoln was not entirely <b>trouble-free,</b> for on 19 November 1569 the Dean and Chapter cited him for 'certain matters alleged against him' {{as the result of}} which his salary was suspended. Since Puritanism was influential at Lincoln, {{it is possible that the}} allegations were connected with over-elaborate choral polyphony or organ playing. A second directive, dated 29 November, issued detailed instructions regarding Byrd's use of the organ in the liturgy. On 14 September 1568, Byrd married Julian Birley; it was a long-lasting and fruitful union which produced at least seven children.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly <b>trouble-free.</b> They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E
500|$|Amundsen {{made his}} Antarctic base, which he named [...] "Framheim", in the Bay of Whales on the Great Ice Barrier. After months of preparation, depot-laying and a false start {{that ended in}} near-disaster, he and his party {{set out for the}} pole in October 1911. In the course of their journey they {{discovered}} the Axel Heiberg Glacier, which provided their route to the polar plateau and ultimately to the South Pole. The party's mastery of the use of skis and their expertise with sledge dogs ensured rapid and relatively <b>trouble-free</b> travel. Other achievements of the expedition included the first exploration of King Edward VII Land and an extensive oceanographic cruise.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} made up of two {{different}} classes of songs: lengthy improvisations from the band's live performances and shorter songs that Barrett had written. Barrett's LSD intake escalated part-way through the album's recording sessions. Although in his 2005 autobiography Mason recalled the sessions as relatively <b>trouble-free,</b> Smith disagreed and claimed that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. In an attempt to build a relationship with the band, Smith played jazz on the piano while the band joined in. These jam sessions worked well with Waters, who was apparently helpful, and Wright, who was [...] "laid-back". Smith's attempts to connect with Barrett were less productive: [...] "With Syd, I eventually realised I was wasting my time." [...] Smith later admitted that his traditional ideas of music were somewhat at odds with the psychedelic background from which Pink Floyd had come. Nevertheless, he managed to [...] "discourage the live ramble", as band manager Peter Jenner called it, guiding the band toward producing songs with a more manageable length.|$|E
500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were <b>trouble-free.</b> Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing room and he was so... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [...] we got him out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".|$|E
2500|$|St-Laurent's {{government}} was modestly progressive, fiscally conservative {{and run with}} business-like efficiency. Robertson says, [...] "St Laurent's administrations from 1949 to 1956 probably gave Canada the most consistently good, financially responsible, <b>trouble-free</b> government the country has had in its entire history." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the final, she {{performed}} the song [...] "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" [...] from Phantom of the Opera. [...] Her performance was <b>trouble-free</b> and well-received, and the viewer voting resulted in her finishing in sixth place, receiving 3.9% {{of the reported}} 4 million votes, calculating to 156,000 votes.|$|E
2500|$|The honorary title [...] "Honoured Navigator of the USSR" [...] {{was awarded}} to {{qualified}} civilian navigators 1st class for special merit {{in the development of}} modern aircraft, {{in the use of the}} most advanced navigating techniques, for the highest standards in education and training of flight personnel, for long-term <b>trouble-free</b> flying and for outstanding achievements in the use of aviation in the national economy.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to their}} speed (14.8 {{characters}} per second), immunity to clashing typebars, <b>trouble-free</b> paper path, high quality printed output, and reliability, Selectric-based mechanisms were also widely used as terminals for computers, replacing both Teletypes and older typebar-based output devices. [...] One popular example was the IBM 2741 terminal. Among other applications, the 2741 (with a special typing element) figured {{prominently in the}} early years of the APL programming language.|$|E
2500|$|The honorary title [...] "Honoured Military Navigator of the USSR" [...] {{was awarded}} to members of {{military}} flying units, military agencies, military schools, military organizations and other military or federal authorities, having qualified military navigators 1st class or military navigator-instructors 1st class, for outstanding achievements {{in the development of}} aviation technology, high performance in education and training of flight personnel and long-term <b>trouble-free</b> flight operations in military aviation.|$|E
2500|$|IBM {{has been}} a leading proponent of the Open Source Initiative, and began {{supporting}} Linux in 1998. The company invests {{billions of dollars in}} services and software based on Linux through the IBM Linux Technology Center, which includes over 300 Linux kernel developers. IBM has also released code under different open source licenses, such as the platform-independent software framework Eclipse (worth approximately US$40 million {{at the time of the}} donation), the three-sentence [...] (ICU) license, and the Java-based relational database management system (RDBMS) Apache Derby. IBM's open source involvement has not been <b>trouble-free,</b> however (see SCO v. IBM).|$|E
2500|$|In May 1953, the Vought {{design was}} {{declared}} a winner and in June, Vought received {{an order for}} three XF8U-1 prototypes (after adoption of the unified designation system in September 1962, the F8U became the F-8). The first prototype flew on 25 March 1955 with John Konrad at the controls. The aircraft exceeded {{the speed of sound}} during its maiden flight. The development was so <b>trouble-free</b> that the second prototype, along with the first production F8U-1, flew on the same day, 30 September 1955. On 4 April 1956, the F8U-1 performed its first catapult launch from [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} (NX18100, s/n 1601) first flew, without incident, on June 7, 1938 from Clover Field in Santa Monica, California, piloted by Carl Cover. Testing issues, however, {{delayed the}} Approved Type Certificate until May 5, 1939. It {{was used by}} United Air Lines for in-service evaluation during 1939. On June 9, 1939, when the DC-4 was in Dayton, Ohio, along with Carl Cover, Orville Wright was a passenger on a flight over the city. [...] Although the aircraft was relatively <b>trouble-free,</b> the complex systems proved to be expensive to maintain and performance was below expectations, especially {{with an increase in}} seating to 52 and gross weight to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The day {{was marked}} by several pro-Tibet protests, which {{included}} a giant banner reading [...] "Free Tibet", and an alternative [...] "human rights torch" [...] that was lit by protesters and paraded along the route the flame was to take. Most of these protests were peaceful in nature, and the torch was not impeded. Chinese immigrants also turned out {{in support of the}} Games, but only minor scuffles were reported between both groups. Runners surrounded by rows of security carried the Olympic flame past thousands of jubilant Argentines in the most <b>trouble-free</b> torch relay in nearly a week. People showered the parade route with confetti as banks, government offices and businesses took an impromptu half-day holiday for the only Latin American stop on the flame's five-continent journey.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{preassembled}} track sections made by Märklin using their three-rail system. This trackwork is a little bulkier looking than true to scale, but it is considered quite <b>trouble-free,</b> and is preferred by many that are interested in reducing much of the operational problems that come with HO scale railroading. As with other preformed track, it is also available in several radius configurations. Generally speaking very sharp radius curves are only suitable for single unit operation, such as trolley cars, or for short-coupled cars and locos such as found around industrial works. [...] Longer wheelbase trucks (bogies) and longer car and loco overhangs require the use of broader radius curves. Today many six-axle diesels and full-length passenger cars will not run on curves less than [...] in radius.|$|E
2500|$|The Allison V-1710-41 engines, though {{relatively}} <b>trouble-free</b> {{in other}} types, had no additional cooling systems. Like many pusher designs, they were prone to overheating. On the ground, the aircraft {{had to be}} towed {{to and from the}} runway and could only be started when the Airacuda was able to take off immediately. Even in the air it was not uncommon to experience overheating problems. Although designed for turbo-supercharging, the first flights were made with V-1710-9 carbureted engines that only delivered [...] each. Despite the -long shaft extensions, there were no problems with this feature. When the turbos were fitted to the later YFM-1, they were plagued by cranky turbo regulators that backfired continuously. An explosion during a September 1939 test flight made it apparent that the teething engine troubles would not be solved easily.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{indication}} of its sound design, many SD60s are now being re-manufactured by their owners or by subcontractors for another 30 years of <b>trouble-free</b> service, 240 such units by Norfolk Southern alone, some {{of which will be}} acquired on the secondary market from locomotive lessors. These NS conversions are reported to be upgraded to include electronic fuel injection, intercooling, [...] "crash-worthy" [...] fuel tanks and other components and features found in late SD70s. The traditional [...] "spartan" [...] cab will also be replaced with a new [...] "crash-worthy" [...] cab built to NS specifications ("Crescent cab"). Early units were completed at the original SD60's 3,800 HP rating, but all were later uprated to the SD70's 4,000 HP rating, thereby becoming {{for all intents and purposes}} the equivalent of a late SD70M, but at a fraction of an SD70M's cost.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 November 1941, a {{contract}} was {{issued by the}} Air Ministry {{for a pair of}} prototypes of the [...] "Typhoon Mark II"; the new fighter was renamed [...] "Tempest" [...] on 28 February 1942. Complications were added to the Tempest program by external factors in the form of engine issues; both the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine and corresponding Hawker Tornado aircraft which was being developed in parallel were both terminated; due to this previous experience on other programs, the Air Ministry was sufficiently motivated to request that a total of six Tempest prototypes were to be built using different engines so that if a delay hit one engine, an alternative powerplant would already be available. This measure turned out to be fortuitous, as engine development was not <b>trouble-free</b> on some of the variants of the Tempest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{run up to}} the {{three-way}} {{meeting was}} not <b>trouble-free.</b> C's repeatedly threatened PSOE with ending their alliance if they tried to negotiate with Podemos on their own. C's further distanced itself from PSOE after abstaining during a vote in Congress held on 5 April, involving the paralization of the LOMCE, a point which was included within the PSOE–C's pact. Both PSOE and Podemos, among others, had voted favourably to the law's paralization, leading Pablo Iglesias to highlight the similarities between his party and PSOE and comment on the latter's differences with C's. On the day {{leading up to the}} meeting, a tough confrontation between Iglesias and Rivera during a Congress plenary showed evidence of tense relations between the two parties. Subsequently, C's also demanded entry into a PSOE-led government—after having repeatedly denied this possibility in the past—and demanded that Podemos support them in return for nothing. Iglesias noted, in reference to C's reaction, that [...] "it is difficult to agree with intolerant people".|$|E
2500|$|Development of space-suits in the 1960s {{led to the}} pressure-tight zipper, first {{manufactured}} by B.F. Goodrich, and first used on a dry suit by Bev Morgan in 1956. The suit was in expanded neoprene and had an oral inflator and latex seals. This {{was followed by the}} Unisuit, by Poseidon Industri AB of Sweden, also in neoprene, and which included a low pressure inflator valve and exhaust valves. The zipper ran from mid-back to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread. Overpressure valves were installed in the ankles, wrists and neck of dry suits to remove excessive air introduced [...] through the face mask to prevent discomfort created by squeeze, which also increased the insulation capacity of the undergarments. These were called constant volume dry suits. Also in Sweden, Stig Insulán and Jorn Stubdal developed a vulcanised rubber drysuit, and Insulán patented the semi-automatic variable volume drysuit exhaust valve in 1971 which combined with the low pressure inflator valve gave the diver precise and <b>trouble-free</b> buoyancy control, in the variable volume dry suit.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 2014 {{interview}} Greenwald said {{he believed}} he risked detention if he reentered the U.S., but insisted that he would [...] "force the issue" [...] on principle, and return for the [...] "many reasons" [...] he had to visit, including if he won a prestigious award {{of which he was}} rumoured to be the winner. Later that month, it was announced that he was, in fact, among the recipients of the 2013 Polk Awards, to be conferred April 11, 2014 in Manhattan. In a subsequent interview, Greenwald stated he would attend the ceremony, and added: [...] "I absolutely refuse to be exiled from my own country for the crime of doing journalism and I'm going to force the issue just on principle. And I think going back for a ceremony like the Polk Awards or other forms of journalistic awards would be a really good symbolic test of having to put the government in the position of having to arrest journalists who are coming back to the US to receive awards for the journalism they have done." [...] On April 11, Greenwald and Laura Poitras accepted the Polk Award in Manhattan. Although their entry into the United States was <b>trouble-free,</b> they traveled with an ACLU lawyer and a German journalist [...] "to document any unpleasant surprises". Accepting the award, Greenwald said he was [...] "happy to see a table full of Guardian editors and journalists, whose role in this story is much more integral than the publicity generally recognizes". On April 14, the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service was awarded jointly to The Guardian and The Washington Post for revelation of widespread secret surveillance by the NSA. Greenwald, along with Laura Poitras and Ewen MacAskill, had contributed to The Guardian′s reporting.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, it was {{announced}} that the Gathering would be moving from its home at Cave-in-Rock to a family Campground in Kaiser, Missouri. However, several local citizens vigorously protested the Gathering being held in this location and the event had to be moved once more. It was reported by Insane Clown Posse themselves that locals had started a petition to keep the Gathering out of their area and flooded the owners of the campground with angry phone calls. Finally, a self-professed Juggalo referred to as Steve (who had previously been to the Gathering himself) contacted Psychopathic Records and offered the 120-acre Legend Valley as a place to host the event. Legend Valley (located in Thornville, Ohio) was officially chosen as the Gathering's venue for 2014. In a statement by Psychopathic Records in the February 28, 2014 edition of the Hatchet Herald, it was said that [...] "Mere hours after the news begin spreading that Kaiser, Missouri would not welcome the Juggalo Family, we began receiving phone calls and emails from interested land owners and promoters who wanted to help ensure that the Gathering of the Juggalos found a home. One of the calls we got was from a down ass ninja named Steve who owns the Legend Valley. [...] Steve has actually been to the Gathering of the Juggalos before and is not buying into the media's portrayal of what the Gathering is because he has been there. He has expressed to us that he is super down to host the Gathering this year and has always found Juggalos to be cool ass people. He also believes in our fight alongside the ACLU to have Juggalos removed from the FBI gang list, which is still on the list as a [...] "loosely organized hybrid gang" [...] because their sorry ass case was thrown out of court in 2014. In other words, he has our backs and is the perfect ninja we needed to ensure an awesome, <b>trouble-free</b> Gathering this year." ...|$|E
