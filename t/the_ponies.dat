5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most {{did not return to}} Ireland. The famine of 1845â€“1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who {{previously}} utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace <b>the</b> <b>ponies,</b> and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals.|$|E
5|$|However, Rainbow Dash {{is still}} {{apart from the}} group and without her, the Elements will not activate. They find Rainbow Dash {{protecting}} a cloud, believing it to be her home of Cloudsdale. They start to give chase, but Rainbow flies away. They quickly use a hot-air balloon, pulled along by Fluttershy, {{to catch up to}} Rainbow. At first, it seems that Rainbow has the upper hand, but as soon as Twilight reminds Fluttershy that if she gets away Discord will win, Fluttershy puts on an enormous burst of speed and <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to cast her memory spell. <b>The</b> <b>ponies</b> share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E
5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. <b>The</b> <b>ponies</b> were known for hardiness and an ability to survive in harsh conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> Express {{route that}} the riders used {{went through the}} Territories of Utah, Nebraska and Kansas sharing relay {{stations}} with the Butterfield Overland Mail Company stagecoach line. The Overland Mail Company eventually did take over the western portion of <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express route that went to Sacramento, California, when <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express firm was dissolved in 1861. <b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> Express route went through what are now the states of Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California.|$|R

5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. <b>The</b> <b>ponies</b> {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E
5|$|Dog expert Cecil Meares {{was going}} to Siberia to select the dogs, and Scott ordered that, while he was there, he should deal with the {{purchase}} of Manchurian ponies. Meares was not an experienced horse-dealer, and <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> he chose proved mostly of poor quality, and ill-suited to prolonged Antarctic work. Meanwhile, Scott also recruited Bernard Day, from Shackleton's expedition, as his motor expert.|$|E

5|$|Suddenly, {{an image}} of Discord on the stained-glass windows comes to life, teasing <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> and Celestia. Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to {{where they can be}} located. Twilight {{believes}} Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there. Discord appears in his true form and challenges <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> to a game, telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic (enforcing this rule by making the unicorns' horns and Pegasi's wings vanish), and that if any of them leave the game, he automatically wins. Despite their handicap, <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> enter the maze, but they are soon separated by Discord's magic. He is able to individually test Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy against their respected Elements, making them be momentarily hypnotized, lose some of their color, and become a polar opposite of their Element. Twilight encounters each of them after this point, aware of their personality shift, but oblivious to their encounter with Discord. Soon, they find Rainbow Dash, having regained her wings, flying away from the maze and betraying not only her Element of Loyalty, but also forfeiting the game by leaving; the maze falls around them and Discord boasts his victory, warning of an incoming storm of chaos.|$|E
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they {{could get to the}} end of the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the domesticated ponies {{there is a small}} herd of Eriskay ponies living in a feral state on the Holy Isle. These ponies are descended from a group of five ponies brought to the Holy Isle to when it was owned by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare in the 1970s to form a nature reserve. Today the island is owned by the Samye Buddhist Centre for World Peace and Health. They operate a policy of non-intervention, allowing <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> to live without human interference.|$|E
5000|$|The safest {{method for}} in-hand pony rides {{is to have}} two people with each child, one {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>pony,</b> similar to <b>the</b> methods used for {{therapeutic}} horseback riding. [...] Trained staff should handle <b>the</b> <b>pony,</b> help <b>the</b> child get on and off <b>the</b> <b>pony,</b> and be sure equipment is properly adjusted. Most parents should not be asked to handle <b>the</b> <b>pony,</b> [...] because parents usually lack horse experience and knowledge. That said, where a second person is used as a [...] "spotter" [...] to help balance the child, a parent can fill that role, so long as they are healthy enough to keep up with <b>the</b> <b>pony</b> and able to remain calm around the animal.|$|R
50|$|The {{section of}} US-36 from Washington, Kansas to St. Joseph, Missouri is officially called <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express Highway because it marks the {{starting}} section of <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express.

50|$|The Canadian {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> {{had to be}} changed {{slightly}} to meet standards of that country. <b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> was released for sale in Canada for the 1984 model year and ended in 1987. Differences between <b>the</b> Canadian <b>Pony</b> versus its European counterparts were 8 km/h bumpers, sealed-beam headlights, side marker lamps instead of indicator repeaters (also in a lower position), and slight alterations in interior instrumentation and trim application. Initial projections for 1984 called for 5000 sales, but the final total was an astounding 25,123, making <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> one of Canada's best selling cars that year. <b>The</b> <b>Pony</b> was sold until 1987, even while Excels were for sale alongside.|$|R
5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge of}} the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would be in charge of <b>the</b> <b>ponies,</b> but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy themâ€”with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ponies</b> {{can carry}} adults {{and in many}} cases compete on equal terms with larger equines while doing so. For example, in 2010, the New Forest Pony Enthusiasts Club (NFPEC), a {{registered}} riding club whose members compete only on purebred registered New Forest ponies, won the Quadrille competition at the London International Horse Show at Olympia. This was a significant win, as the British Riding Clubs Quadrille is a national competition, with only four teams from the whole of Britain selected to compete at the National Final.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ponies</b> {{collect the}} Elements and re-approach Discord, who casually passes off their threat. However, with all six ponies restored, the Elements activate, firing a rainbow-beam {{of light that}} engulfs Discord and Ponyville. In moments, Ponyville has been {{returned}} to normal and Discord is once again turned to stone. The ponies' victory is celebrated by a large ceremony at Canterlot, led by Celestia, who praises their heroism {{and the power of}} their friendship and reveals a new stained-glass window of the six ponies defeating Discord.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Galloway <b>pony</b> heavily {{influenced}} <b>the</b> Newfoundland <b>pony,</b> <b>the</b> Highland <b>Pony,</b> and <b>the</b> Fell <b>pony</b> of England.

5|$|April 3, 2010 was <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express' 150th anniversary. Located in St. Joseph, Missouri, the Patee House Museum, {{which was}} <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express' headquarters, hosted events celebrating the anniversary.|$|R
50|$|Between April 3, 1860, {{and late}} October 1861, St. Joseph {{was one of}} the two {{endpoints}} of <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express, which operated for a short period over the land then inaccessible by rail, to provide fast mail service. <b>The</b> <b>pony</b> riders carried additionally, along with the mail, a small personal bible. Today <b>the</b> <b>Pony</b> Express Museum hosts visitors in the old stables.|$|R
5|$|To assist his endeavour, Shackleton {{adopted a}} mixed {{transport}} strategy, involving {{the use of}} Manchurian ponies as pack animals, {{as well as the}} more traditional dog-sledges. A specially adapted motor car was also taken. Although the dogs and the car were used during the expedition for a number of purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to <b>the</b> <b>ponies.</b> The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was dictated by the number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.|$|E
5|$|Colts are {{assessed}} in their two-year-old {{year by the}} New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for suitability to be kept as stallions; any animal failing the assessment must be gelded. Once approved, every spring (usually in March), the stallions must pass the Verderers' assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed. The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> running out on the New Forest, and to counteract this and preserve the hardiness of Forest-run ponies, the Verderers introduced the Bloodline Diversity Project, which will use hardy Forest-run mares, mostly over eleven years old, bred to stallions {{that have not been}} run out on the Forest, or closely related to those that have.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, John Mulvihill, who {{operated}} the Red Fox Inn at the Kerry Bog Village in Glenbeigh, County Kerry, began {{a search for}} remnants of the Kerry Bog Pony population, despite reports that the breed was extinct. He eventually found 20 ponies that resembled those he remembered from his childhood, and removed them from the bog to his stables. In 1995, he had blood typing performed on <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> by Weatherby's Ireland, which identified their DNA markers. Subsequent DNA testing showed them to be a unique breed that formed a separate population from other local ponies and from other breeds in Ireland and Great Britain. Of these 20 ponies, only one was a stallion, named Flashy Fox. Between 1995 and 2012, he sired more than 140 foals, and {{played a significant role}} in repopulating the breed.|$|E

5|$|The Marwari is {{descended from}} native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses. <b>The</b> <b>ponies</b> {{were small and}} hardy, but with poor conformation; the {{influence}} of the Arabian blood improved the appearance without compromising the hardiness. The Arabians possibly came ashore from a cargo ship wrecked off India's west coast. Legend in India states that the Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the Kachchh District. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as foundation bloodstock for the Marwari. There is also the possibility of some Mongolian influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ponies</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, {{the quality}} of <b>the</b> <b>ponies</b> was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of {{breeding}} stallions, {{and the introduction of}} Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War drove up the demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.|$|E
