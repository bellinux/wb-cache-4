50|$|In 1956, Noble {{was hired}} by Metropolitan Museum of Art Director James Rorimer to join his {{administrative}} team as Operating Administrator, a position he held until 1967. He subsequently served as Chairman of the Administrative Committee (1966-1967) and Vice-Director of Administration (1967-1970) at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. In his position as Operating Administrator, Noble oversaw curatorial and administrative functions including human resources, construction, acquisitions, and visitor services. With his 1967 promotion to Vice-Director of Administration Noble’s role changed slightly. According to a New York Times article on Thomas Hoving’s appointment as Director of the Metropolitan, Noble’s new position was “designed <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of the museum and to lessen {{the burden of the}} director.” Noble, however, in a 1994 oral history interview described his change in title as “technical” and noted that his “duties were virtually the same.” He further stated that “Director Tom Hoving’s job is to pull the Museum up to the sky; it is my job to hold its feet on the ground. Between the two, we will stretch the Metropolitan Museum of Art.”.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to understand, from an owners’ perspective, the {{limiting}} factors regarding growth in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Theoretically we discuss attitudes towards growth, the value of available resources, {{understanding the importance of}} business timescales, the motivations of the owner, ambitions for the business and reactions to uncertainty. The major findings are summarized: • The SMEs owner is a limiting factor • SMEs owners have difficulty engaging with their employees • SMEs have difficulty growing in niche markets • Unfavorable economic outlook changes a SMEs owner’s mindset towards business survival The report recommends a decoupling of the owner from the business. Once personal ambition is sated, the owner’s motivation can diminish, which could be of detriment to the business. The owner should separate from operational activities in order <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>the</b> <b>business.</b> To achieve this, owners should improve knowledge management within their business and encourage employee responsibility and ownership. SMEs need to expand into new markets using existing core business operations and through associated products/services via strategic alliances and partnerships. SMEs should implement strategic planning through times of economic uncertainty to ensure they are laying the foundations for future growth...|$|E

Business managers often {{speculate on the}} business needs innovative form of operation under intensive change of environment. The alignment and transformation of the organizational structure should be actively reflected while a business has been confronting competition for survival. The life cycle of a business verifies {{the theory of evolution}} Darwinism. The system and rule of the market sometimes change least but sometimes most. The competitive analysis of value chain and system that the business usually employs is examined continuously in the new era. Based on the literature review, this research took network organization, virtual product and service, objective integration, resource deployment and Information Technology as the dimensions <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> virtualization. The virtual business operates their virtual value chain by means of gathering, organizing, selecting, synthesizing and distributing of information. The discussion of this research is that the different dimension and mix of business virtualization will influence that of the patterns of marketing innovation, such as product, notion, service, pricing, distribution channel and advertising. This research would build the business model that a business can operate appropriately in the marketplace and the marketspace after business virtualization. In conclusion, business virtualization is the focus of the strategic choice when an organization faces environmental changes and challenges, and marketing innovation presents the ability to catch the market opportunity and share and strengthen the position established...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 34 - 36). Economists have long studied innovation and its effects on business cycles. Economist Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883 - 1950) was the first economist to thoroughly discuss these ideas in his Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung, published in 1911 (English translation: The Theory of Economic Development, 1934). This paper focuses on three issues: defining innovation, defining and identifying business cycles, and determining which innovations caused which business cycles. The first section introduces the concepts of innovation and invention. The second section discusses the business cycles and highlights general causes of business cycles. The final section details the history of the iron, steel, aluminum, and pharmaceutical industries and incorporates the available business and economic data (output, productivity, inventories, and capital investment) required to answer the central question: which innovations caused which business cycles? The iron industry, examined over the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, reveals that its relationship to the business cycle is likely significant but was difficult to quantify because of limited data. An examination of the steel industry from the post-Civil War period to the early twentieth century follows. The steel industry had a significant effect on the business cycle and seemed <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> cycle during the growth in railroad mileage. Steel was a huge and indispensable industry for most of the 20 [th] century so it makes a very important case to study. The aluminum industry is relevant to examine because the process for making aluminum has remained the same since the American inventor, Charles Hall, patented his method in 1889. The contribution of aluminum was significant because of the introduction of the large-scale electrical generators needed to produce aluminum. Finally, the paper focuses on the contribution of the pharmaceutical industry to the business cycle. The pharmaceutical industry is important to this study because it has already proved to be a major source of innovation and is an industry that will continue to {{play a significant role in}} the American economy. The findings reveal the contribution from this industry was most significant in the post-World War II era of research and development. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving and expanding this innovation and business cycle study...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this short essay is to make some {{introductory}} remarks to frame {{the debate about the}} historical evolution and economic structure of the Law Merchant. For these purposes the capitalization of the phrase should not mislead, for by the Law Merchant I mean nothing more pretentious than the commercial law rules-contractual, customary, and statutory-that govern transactions among merchants. It includes the rules governing sale, credit, insurance, transportation, and, probably, partnership. In approaching so salient a topic, it comes as something of a shock to realize that {{the first order of business}} in this venerable area is the extensive debate over whether there really is a Law Merchant at all. The positions on this matter are many and subtle, and it is worthwhile to give a capsule account of the overall situation. One point of broad agreement is that a body of law largely <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> transactions between merchants arose sometime during the Middle Ages. Much of this law derived from the Roman law of sale, but much of it, such as the creation of bills of exchange and similar credit instruments, was created by merchants in response to the difficulties of trading at a distance. There is further agreement that this law prized freedom of choice and speed of enforcement. There is yet further agreement that it had a distinct international cast in that a large number of transactions that fell within the scope of the Law Merchant involved trade between merchants from two or more nations. Thus, one party often had to sue in a court in which he faced the risk of discrimination as a foreigner. And last, there is some agreement that the principles that were embodied in the Law Merchant had some relationship to the ius gentium, or the law of nations as it has come down to us from Roman times.

40|$|Excerpt] According to <b>the</b> <b>Business</b> Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the U. S. {{economy has}} been in {{recession}} since December 2007. Congress passed and the President signed an economic stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P. L. 111 - 5), in February 2009. The $ 787 billion package included $ 286 billion in tax cuts to help stimulate the economy. Among the tax reductions, many were tax incentives <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> <b>business.</b> <b>The</b> preliminary estimate of third quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is 2. 8 %; the unemployment rate, a lagging indicator, averaged 9. 6 % {{in the third quarter}} and 10. 0 % {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2009. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke expects the economy to continue growing at a modest pace, but predicts that bank lending will remain constrained and the job market will remain weak into at least 2010. To further assist unemployed workers, help business, and stimulate housing markets, Congress passed the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (P. L. 111 - 92). The Obama Administration has advocated further business tax incentives to spur investment and employment, especially for small <b>business.</b> <b>The</b> two most common measures to provide business tax incentives for new investment are investment tax credits and accelerated deductions for depreciation. The evidence, however, suggests that a business tax subsidy may not necessarily be the best choice for fiscal stimulus, largely because of the uncertainty of its success in stimulating aggregate demand. If such subsidies are used, however, the most effective short-run policy is probably a temporary investment subsidy. Permanent investment subsidies may distort the allocation of investment in the long run. Employment and wage subsidies are designed to increase employment directly by reducing a firm’s wage bill. The tax system is a frequently used means for providing employment subsidies. Most of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> tax incentives for hiring currently under discussion are modeled partially on the New Jobs Tax Credit (NJTC) from 1977 and 1978. Evidence provided in various studies suggests that incremental tax credits have the potential of increasing employment, but in practice may not be as effective in increasing employment as desired. There are several reasons why this may be the case. First, jobs tax credits are often complex and many employers, especially small businesses, may not want to incur the necessary record-keeping costs. Second, since eligibility for the tax credit is determined when the firm files the annual tax return, firms do not know if they are eligible for the credit at the time hiring decisions are made. Third, many firms may not even be aware of the availability of the tax credit until it is time to file a tax return. Lastly, product demand appears to be the primary determinant of hiring...|$|R
