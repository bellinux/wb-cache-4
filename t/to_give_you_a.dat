The bottom line is we're just trying <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sense {{of what it was like}} to hang out around this person. That's really it.

I was getting hurt. I didn't understand my role. I bounced around and I just didn't enjoy the game." [...] At the trade deadline on July 31, Affeldt was traded along with Denny Bautista to the Colorado Rockies for Ryan Shealy and Scott Dohmann. [...] Affeldt recalled, [...] "When [...] traded me, he said, 'I feel like I need <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> fresh start. You can learn to enjoy the game again.'

500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set." [...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of {{what it feels like}} to be on a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She wanted to make a video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E

[...] Blessy Chettiar of DNA India, noted the music of the film and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film: [...] "For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep-sea diving at Costa Brava, sky-diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, not to forget the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls", he wrote, giving it 3 stars. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, [...] "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts." [...] He also praised the performance of the cast, highlighting it as one of the main positives of the film, but points out that the film's length [...] "sucks some fun of out of the ride" [...] and gave a rating of 3.5 stars. On the contrary, Raja Sen of Rediff held that the film [...] "tried too hard to be cool" [...] and gave it 1.5/5 stars.|$|E
500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted {{that he would like to}} take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
500|$|Initial work on Grand Theft Auto V {{constituted}} the open world creation, where preliminary models were constructed in-engine during pre-production. The game's setting is the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas and city of Los Santos, based on Southern California and Los Angeles respectively. San Andreas {{was first used}} as [...] setting, which featured three cities separated by open countryside. The team thought that the ambition of including three cities in San Andreas was too great, as it did not emulate the cities {{as well as they}} had hoped. Houser felt that [...] "to do a proper version of L.A....the game has <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sense of that sprawlif not completely replicate it", and that dividing the budget and manpower between multiple cities would have detracted from capturing [...] "what L.A. is". Garbut said that PlayStation 2 era technology lacked the technical capabilities to capture Los Angeles properly, such that San Andreas rendition of Los Santos looked like a [...] "backdrop or a game level with pedestrians randomly milling about". The team disregarded San Andreas as a departure point for Grand Theft Auto V because they had moved on to a new generation of consoles and wanted to build the city from scratch. According to Garbut, with the move to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware, [...] "our processes and the fidelity of the world [...] evolved so much from San Andreas" [...] that using it as a model would have been redundant. The team's focus on one city instead of three meant that they could produce Los Santos in higher quality and at greater scale than in the previous game.|$|E

[...] He further called the song [...] "one of 21s angrier tracks" [...] and concluded: [...] "The chorus' hooks are crazy catchy, and by the final one Adele {{releases}} and her hurt slips through the anger <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> damn real and forward show of emotion. I’d imagine seeing this song live or in a stripped down setting would make one bawl like a child. You’ll want to pump your fist and pound your chest. That’s a guarantee." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy praised the song saying, [...] "'It was dark and I was over/ Until you kissed my lips and saved me,' she admits over a gloomy piano riff, before launching into a ballsy, hands-in-the-air chorus. 'I {{set fire to the}} rain/ and I threw us into the flames,' she belts with growly vocals against cinematic strings. Rounding out with a suitably breathtaking blast from her impressive pipes and the result sounds like classic, though it's anything but camp." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Steve Lillywhite {{was hired}} by U2 in December 1986 to help mix some songs for The Joshua Tree; [...] "With or Without You" [...] was one of them. While Lillywhite and {{engineer}} Mark Wallis were mixing it, Eno entered the room {{and told them that}} he wanted to change the introduction. Wallis said: [...] "And it was kind of awe-inspiring because he said, 'Right, send this guitar through those ten effects over there and send that guitar through those ten effects over there and then feed them back to each other.' So what started as a traditional bit of rhythm guitar, bass, and drums suddenly became something quite otherworldly and spiritual, {{and the sound of the}} music you were hearing started <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> feeling of where the song was going to go prior to the lyric. I thought that was really visionary." [...] Ultimately, [...] "With or Without You" [...] was the most debated song of those on which Lillywhite worked, as Eno and Lanois each had ideas different from his. Lillywhite, who wanted a more mainstream approach to his mix, favoured [...] "a little more crash, bang" [...] sound to Mullen's drums that enter later in the song, while Eno preferred that the drums remain [...] "more mysterious and more supportive".|$|E

Speaking to MTV Garred said, [...] "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so we bought some clothes and these hats, it was fun." [...] Sharing a love of The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Police, and David Bowie, Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved {{under the guise of}} a school music project. Pritchard himself said [...] "We got together just on a whim, really." [...] With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. [...] "So we went in to get a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, and this guy told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but I like your hats, so I'm going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> gig'", said Garred.
