5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope was used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope in order <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres.
