500|$|In {{his opening}} speech on 26 September 2001, Garnham said that race {{may have played}} a part in the case, {{due to the fact that}} a black child was murdered by her black carers, and the social worker and police officer most closely {{involved}} in the case were black. He said that the fear of being accused of racism may have led to the inaction. In the hearings, Arthurworrey, who is African-Caribbean, admitted that her assumptions about African–Caribbean families influenced her judgement, and that she had assumed Climbié's timidness in the presence of Kouao and Manning stemmed not from fear, but from the African–Caribbean culture of respect towards one's parents. Ratna Dutt, director of the Race Equality Unit (now the Race Equality Foundation), a charity that provides race-awareness training to social workers, later said, [...] "the implicit message is that it's acceptable for ethnic minorities to receive poor services under the guise of superficial cultural sensitivity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> shameful, as it allows people to argue that good practice is compromised by anti-racism"; and, contrasting the outcomes of the white and black staff members involved, [...] "for a large number of black frontline staff if the finger of blame is pointed at them they don't end up in jobs in other local authorities. That's how institutional racism operates". Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary from 2007, said: [...] "I have not seen widespread evidence that social workers are not taking action", and, [...] "there are no cultures that condone child abuse.

Polly appeared at least outwardly to tolerate Harry's dallying unconventional behavior, and she soon had her own courtiers. In her journals, she privately worried about Harry's continued loyalty to her.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Marburg Colloquy, Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army. Luther had argued against {{resisting}} the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses, provoking accusations of defeatism. He saw the Turks as a scourge sent by God to punish Christians, as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist, whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church. He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War, [...] "as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> contrary to Christ's doctrine and name". On the other hand, in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms, Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks. In 1526, he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war. By 1529, in On War against the Turk, he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks.|$|E

2500|$|Also in April, Michael Keaton entered {{talks to}} play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly {{thereafter}} due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast {{as a friend of}} Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as [...] "one of [...] most diverse places in the world", with Feige adding that [...] "we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [...] especially, it really feels like <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> what has to happen and continue." [...] This is also different from the previous films, which Feige described as being [...] "set in a lily-white Queens". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included The Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, [...] "We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn’t want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want {{to do it in a}} way that feels contemporary." [...] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials [...] "MJ" [...] as a nod to that character.
