40|$|THIS PH. D. DISSERTATION CONCERNS THE QUASI-RESONANT CONVERTERS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AT INCREASED SWITCHING FREQUENCIES: HIGH SWITCHING STRESSES AND LOSSES AND PRODUCTION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE. A NOVEL DC-DC FIXED SWITCHING FREQUENCY BUCK-BOOST ZERO-VOLTAGE-SWITCHED QUASI-RESONANT CONVERTER IS PROPOSED. USING AN ADDITIONAL POWER SEMICONDUCTOR SWITCH, CONSTANT SWITCHING FREQUENCY OPERATION IS ACHIEVED. THIS WAY, THE CONVERTER'S OUTPUT VOLTAGE IS REGULATED USING THE WELL-KNOWN PWM TECHNIQUE INSTEAD OF FREQUENCY MODULATION. THE PROPOSED CONVERTER IS THEORETICALLY ANALYZED AND SIMULATED USING SOFTWARE PACKAGES. A 5 W PROTOTYPE IS BUILT AND THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS CONFIRM BOTH THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND COMPUTER SIMULATION. A NOVEL AC-DCFLYBACK ZERO- CURRENT-SWITCHED QUASI-RESONANT CONVERTER IS ALSO PROPOSED. USING A SINGLE STAGE, A SINGLE POWER SEMICONDUCTOR AND A HIGH-FREQUENCY POWER <b>TRANFORMER,</b> BOTH STEP-UP/ DOWN OPERATION AND ELECTRICAL ISOLATION ARE ACHIEVED. THE CONVERTER DRAWS SINUSOIDAL CURRENT FROM THE MAINS, THUS PROVIDING ACTIVE POWER FACTOR CORRECTION. THE PROPOSED CONVERTER IS THEORETICALLY ANALYZED AND SIMULATED USING SOFTWARE PACKAGES. A 120 W PROTOTYPE IS BUILT AND THE EXPERIMENTALRESULTS CONFIRM BOTH THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND COMPUTER SIMULATION. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE PRODUCED BY RESONANT CONVERTERS IS ALSO EXAMINED.

40|$|We report initial {{results of}} the Plasma Wakefield Acceleration (PWFA) Experiments {{performed}} at FACET - Facility for Advanced aCcelertor Experimental Tests at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. At FACET a 23 GeV electron beam with 1. 8 x 10 {sup 10 } electrons is compressed to 20 {mu}m longitudinally and focused down to 10 {mu}m x 10 {mu}m transverse spot size for user driven experiments. Construction of the FACET facility completed in May 2011 with a first run of user assisted commissioning throughout the summer. The first PWFA experiments will use single electron bunches combined with a high density lithium plasma to produce accelerating gradients > 10 GeV/m benchmarking the FACET beam and the newly installed experimental hardware. Future plans for further study of plasma wakefield acceleration will be reviewed. The experimental hardware and operation of the plasma heat-pipe oven have been successfully commissioned. Plasma wakefield acceleration was not observed because the electron bunch density was insufficient to ionize the lithium vapor. The remaining commissioning time in summer 2011 will be dedicated to delivering the FACET design parameters for the experimental programs which will begin in early 2012. PWFA experiments require the shorter bunches and smaller transverse sizes to create the plasma and drive large amplitude wakefields. Low emittance and high energy will minimize head erosion which {{was found to be}} a limiting factor in acceleration distance and energy gain. We will run the PWFA experiments with the design single bunch conditions in early 2012. Future PWFA experiments at FACET are discussed in [5][6] and include drive and witness bunch production for high energy beam manipulation, ramped bunch to optimize <b>tranformer</b> ratio, field-ionized cesium plasma, preionized plasmas, positron acceleration, etc [...] We will install a notch collimator for two-bunch operation as well as new beam diagnostics such as the X-band TCAV [7] to resolve the two bunches. With these new instruments and desired beam parameters in place next year, {{we will be able to}} complete the studies of plasma wakefield acceleration in the next few years...|$|E
40|$|Piezoelectric {{transformers}} have {{a number}} of favorable characteristics over traditional electromagnetic <b>tranformers.</b> However, the construction of piezoelectric transformers tends to be complicated, which may result in increasing manufacturing cost. Furthermore, such complex constructions may raise difficulties in the miniaturization of such devices. A ring-shaped piezoelectric transformer is developed in this invention for low voltage applications. One surface of the transformer is covered by two disc or ring-shaped electrodes separated by a ring-shaped separating segment, and the regions covered by the disc or ring-shaped electrodes served as the input and output parts of the transformer. This transformer may be fabricated relatively easily due to its simple structure. Furthermore, its size and thickness may be reduced relatively easily without increasing the difficulty of the fabricating process. The transformer may be used separately or in parallel.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a market based coordination mechanism for charging electric vehicles. In market based coordination, a virtual market {{is used to}} match supply and demand of a commodity. The goal is to limit {{the impact of the}} electric vehicles on the low voltage distribution grid. First it is shown how, in general, the trading volume on a commodity market with a single supplier can be controlled by the shape of the bid function of the supplier. This approach is then translated to an electricity market where the transformer is the single supplier and the households and electric vehicles are the buyers of electricity. A number of test-scenarios are created with a reference distribution grid in which several vehicles are plug-in hybrid electric or fully electric. Load flow analysis shows that if no coordination takes place, the peak load exceeds the <b>tranformer's</b> rating and the voltage drops below the norm. Simulations show that the market-based coordination mechanism is indeed capable of reducing the peak load to an acceptable level and keeps the under-voltage within an acceptable range...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} for completing this specific project was because Ausgrid is currently conducting a small tiral of four Amorphous Steel Core (ASC) 200 kVA pole top transformers. this trail {{is part of}} a strategy to reduce operating costs of the distribution network, which would be specifically achieved by larger scale roll out of ASC transformers. With this in mind two apsects of this trial deserved further investigation: - A more meaningful economic comparison with specific attention to the performance of these transformers in comparison with existing cold rolled gain oriented (CRGO) legacy transformers across a range of load profiles. - an investigation into the possible increased levels of inrush current in these 'new' <b>tranformers</b> and what implications this increase level of inrush current might have on existing protection schemes used on Ausgrid's 11 kV distribution system. Both these investigations were carried out using Matlab applications and the results were as follows: - The ASC transformers out performed economically the legacy CRGO transformers across all load profiles. This performance was {{due to the fact that}} these transformers exhibited reduced no load and load losses characteristics. What further influenced these results in the ASC favour was that the purchase price of these ACS transformers is only 10 % higher than existing transformers. - The ASC transformers developed inrush current levels well below those designed for in existing protection schemes ad as such there is no implications if large scale roll out of these transformers was implemented. With these results in mind there was 3 significant recommendation made before larger scale roll out of these transformers: - Re-assess the manufactured quality of the transformers after a two year period. - Assess the performance characteristics of other capacity transformers. - Rectify an error within the inrush current simulator to ensure the validity of results presented in this report. ...|$|R
