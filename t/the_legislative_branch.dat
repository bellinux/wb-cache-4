5|$|Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>branch</b> officially {{holds the}} Union's {{budgetary}} authority.

If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively. In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.|$|E
5|$|Rowan {{identified}} with the Democratic-Republican Party and espoused the Jeffersonian principles of limited government and individual liberty. He was chosen to represent Nelson County at the constitutional convention held at Frankfort, Kentucky in 1799 to draft the second Kentucky Constitution. As a delegate, he advocated the supremacy of <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>branch</b> over the executive and judicial branches, which he believed provided ordinary citizens {{a greater role in}} state government. The constitution adopted by the convention abolished the use of electors to choose the governor and state senators, providing for the direct election of these officers instead.|$|E

40|$|The most {{conspicuous}} {{feature of the}} new government under the Federal Constitution was its division into three parts <b>the</b> <b>legislative,</b> <b>the</b> executive and the judicial. Experience has vindicated that division, except, it may be, that some lack of efficiency has shown itself in the absence of more useful cooperation between the executive and <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>branches.</b> <b>The</b> wisdom of keeping the executive and <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>branches</b> apart from <b>the</b> judiciary has, however, been confirmed by the event, not only under the American Constitution, but in England and in all the states under her flag. In the United States, where judicial systems have different degrees of this quality, permitting comparison, the greater the independence of the courts the stronger their influence, and the more satisfactory their jurisdiction and administration of justice...|$|R

Because of San Francisco's status as a consolidated city-county, the mayor also serves as the head of government of the county; both entities have been governed together by a combined set of governing bodies since 1856.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>branch</b> {{consists}} of a unicameral National Assembly of 193members who are elected every five years, and although the Malawian constitution provides for a Senate of 80seats, one {{does not exist in}} practice. If created, the Senate would provide representation for traditional leaders and a variety of geographic districts, as well as special interest groups including the disabled, youth and women. There are currently nine political parties, with the Democratic Progressive Party acting as the ruling party and the Malawi Congress Party and the United Democratic Front acting as the main opposition parties in the National Assembly.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>branch</b> {{consists}} of the Gyeongju City Council, with 21 members as of 2009.

Most subdivisions of Gyeongju elect a single member to represent them in the Council, but Angang-eup is represented by two members because of its large population, {{and two of the}} representatives serve combined districts composed of two dong.

5|$|Many of {{the legislators}} would become {{prominent}} figures during the territorial years of Oregon. At first {{the body was}} a small committee of nine people, but the group was altered when the Organic Laws of Oregon were revised in 1845 with <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>branch</b> of the Provisional Government becoming the Oregon House of Representatives {{with a minimum of}} 13 members. Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that law, because it was in conflict with Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the sole right to coin money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins.|$|E
5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>branch</b> being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E
5|$|The city clerk is Buster Brown. The City of Omaha administers twelve departments, {{including}} finance, police, human rights, {{libraries and}} planning.

The council enacts local ordinances and approves the city budget. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance approved annually.
