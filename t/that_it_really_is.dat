5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
500|$|Litigation, {{ultimate}} {{roll call}} of damage, and {{the scope of}} final insurance recovery were all unknown , with analysts reporting that the aftermath was of unprecedented scale and complexity compared to previous disasters which themselves took many years to unfold and resolve. A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that [...] "at some point {{the scale of the}} litigation becomes so large <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> novel", that [...] "the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means {{it will be hard to}} aggregate them into so-called class actions" [...] and that there was [...] "no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before". As with the Exxon Valdez disaster, litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20-year timescale.|$|E
500|$|Zhou Lian, an {{associate}} professor of philosophy at Renmin University of China, and Ai Weiwei, an artist in Beijing, have publicly criticized Bo and his Chongqing Model for being wrong and lowering trust. Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody knew about this stuff, but now they know <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> true and it’s as bad as it can possibly be.” ...|$|E

500|$|Philip Stead, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement {{considered}} the novel to be [...] "a morbid {{version of that}} of Beauty and the Beast". The review noted that once Bond arrives on the scene to find Michel threatened by the two thugs, he [...] "solves [...] in his usual way. A great quantity of ammunition is expended, the zip-fastener is kept busy and the customary sexual consummation {{is associated with the}} kill." [...] Stead also considered that with the words of the police captain [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to have summarized in this character's remarks some of the recent strictures on James Bond's activities." [...] Vernon Scannell, as critic for The Listener, considered The Spy Who Loved Me to be [...] "as silly as it is unpleasant". What aggrieved him most, however, was that [...] "the worst thing about it is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> so unremittingly, so grindingly boring." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{child must}} have been born shortly before 4 February 1902, when Einstein wrote: [...] "... now you see <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a Lieserl, just as you'd wished.

2500|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{this is a}} much-disputed area. Much {{has been}} made—particularly by Calvin Hoffman—of so-called [...] "parallelisms" [...] between the two authors. For example, when Marlowe's [...] "Jew of Malta", Barabas, sees Abigail on a balcony above him, he says But stay! What star shines yonder in the east? The lodestar of my life, if Abigail! Most people would immediately recognize how similar this is to Romeo's famous But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! when she appears on the balcony above. There are many such examples, {{but the problem with}} using them as an argument is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> not possible to be sure whether they happened because they were by the same author, or because they were—whether consciously or unconsciously—simply copied by Shakespeare from Marlowe. It is worth noting, however, that Marlowe is the only contemporary dramatist from whom Shakespeare appears to 'copy' so much, and that the influence Marlowe had on Shakespeare is universally acknowledged.|$|E

2500|$|The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Become Real was Margery Williams Bianco's first American work, and {{it remains}} her most famous. It has {{remained}} a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children's theatre {{as well as on}} radio, television and in the movies. The author's trademark undercurrents of sentimentality and sadness persist in the tale of a small boy who finds a velveteen rabbit in his Christmas stocking. The boy quickly discards the toy after playing with it for a few hours in the bustle of Christmas and relatives. [...] In the nursery the rabbit is looked down on by the fancier wind up toys. He asks the skin horse, [...] "What is Real?" [...] The skin horse tells him, [...] "When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real." [...] The boy comes to adore the rabbit, and they are constant companions. This happy existence continues until the boy contracts scarlet fever. [...] The rabbit stays with him, whispering to him of the games they will play again when he is better. [...] As the boy gets better his family prepares {{to take him to the}} seaside. Although the rabbit looks forward to the seaside very much, the doctor insists he be thrown out and burned along with the other toys that may be infected. While the rabbit is waiting to be burned, he cries a real tear, from which a fairy emerges. The fairy tells the rabbit that he was real to the boy, because the boy loved him, but now she will make him truly real. [...] Later, the boy sees a real rabbit in the garden. [...] He thinks it looks like his old rabbit, but he does not know <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the velveteen rabbit he once loved.|$|E

6000|$|The first church rate book only {{begins in}} 1776, {{but it is}} curious as showing to whom the land then belonged.

[...] Walter Smythe, Esquire, of Brambridge, appears, also John Colson John Comley, and Charles Vine. Lincolns belonged to Mr. Kentish and Gun Plot to Thilman.|$|E

30|$|Today the CIRSE Annual Congress welcomes over 6500 {{delegates and}} Interventional Radiology {{has become an}} {{important}} discipline which cannot be ignored in any modern hospital.

I can say <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> {{a pleasure to have}} been actively involved in all these great developments.|$|R
5000|$|Lasker himself wrote {{two days}} before the tenth game, [...] "The match with Schlechter is nearing its end and <b>it</b> appears {{probable}} <b>that</b> {{for the first time in}} my life I shall be the loser.

60|$|Having been {{in great}} {{trepidation}} about the play, I am correspondingly elated by the belief <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a success. No doubt the unnecessary explanations {{will have been}} taken out, and the flatness of the last act fetched up. At some points I could have done wonders to it, {{in the way of}} screwing it up sharply and picturesquely, if I could have rehearsed it. Your account of the first night interested me immensely, but I was afraid to open the letter until Dolby rushed in with the opened Times.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will admit}} {{this is an}} odd bandage," [...] he said. [...] "And that's just the odd thing about it, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a bandage. This white stuff {{is the sort of}} lint they use in hospitals, cut into strips like this. But most doctors keep some; and I have the {{evidence}} of Jake the fisherman, with whom Doctor Brown lived for some time, that the doctor had this useful habit. And, last," [...] he added, flattening out a corner of the rag on the table, [...] "isn't it odd that it should be marked T.B.B.?" ...|$|E
60|$|The formal couple {{are always}} sticklers {{for what is}} rigidly proper, {{and have a great}} {{readiness}} in detecting hidden impropriety of speech or thought, which by less scrupulous people would be wholly unsuspected. Thus, if they pay a visit to the theatre, they sit all night in a perfect agony lest anything improper or immoral should proceed from the stage; and if anything should happen to be said which admits of a double construction, they never fail to take it up directly, and to express by their looks the great outrage which their feelings have sustained. Perhaps this is their chief reason for absenting themselves almost entirely from places of public amusement. They go sometimes to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy;--but that is often more shocking than the stage itself, and the formal lady thinks <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> high time Mr. Etty was prosecuted and made a public example of.|$|E
5000|$|Dillinger drew Dunn for {{his first}} ride. Out of the chute, Dillinger took two long jumps and, {{according}} to Herrington, [...] "it looked like he went halfway across the Thomas & Mack Center before he turned back, but it just happened so quick and so strong you're like, I don't know. It was like seeing something you had never seen before. Of course, it proved out over time <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> something we hadn't seen before." ...|$|R
6000|$|To Una and to Mr. Fein <b>it</b> seemed obvious <b>that,</b> since {{women have}} {{at least half of}} the family {{decision}} regarding the purchase of suburban homes, women salesmen of suburban property should be at least as successful as men. But Mr. Truax had a number of [...] "good, sound, conservative" [...] reasons why this should not be so, and therefore declined to credit the evidence of Una, Beatrice Joline, and saleswomen of other firms <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> so.|$|R
60|$|That last {{question}} {{was the most}} unkindest cut of all. Felicity could have forgiven Uncle Roger anything but <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> unpardonable. She confided to me as we climbed the stairs that she hated Uncle Roger. Her red lips quivered and the tears of wounded pride brimmed over in her beautiful blue eyes. In the dim candle-light she looked unbelievably pretty and appealing. I put my arm about her {{and gave her a}} cousinly salute.|$|R
6000|$|The speech ends, {{and there}} rises a grey Englishman {{in a black}} frock-coat. He looks a strong man, and a worldly. Surely he will say, [...] "Yes, Lala Sahib, all this may be true talk, but there's a vile smell in this place, and {{everything}} must be cleaned in a week, or the Deputy Commissioner will not take any notice of you in durbar." [...] He says nothing of the kind. This is a Legislative Council, where they call each other [...] "Honourable So-and-So's." [...] The Englishman in the frock-coat begs all to remember that [...] "we are discussing principles, and no consideration of the details ought to influence the verdict on the principles." [...] Is he then like the rest? How does this strange thing come about? Perhaps these so English office fittings {{are responsible for the}} warp. The Council Chamber might be a London Board-room. Perhaps after long years among the pens and papers its occupants grew to think <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> and in this belief give résumés of the history of Local Self-Government in England.|$|E
60|$|Southport is {{as stupid}} {{a place as}} I ever lived in; and I cannot but bewail our ill fortune to have been {{compelled}} to spend so many months on these barren sands, when almost every other square yard of England contains something {{that would have been}} historically or poetically interesting. Our life here has been a blank. There was, indeed, a shipwreck, a month or two ago, when a large ship came ashore within a mile from our windows; the larger portion of the crew landing safely on the hither sands, while six or seven betook themselves to the boat, and were lost in attempting to gain the shore, {{on the other side of}} the Ribble. After a lapse of several weeks, two or three of their drowned bodies were found floating in this vicinity, and brought to Southport for burial; so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> not at all improbable that Milton's Lycidas floated hereabouts, in the rise and lapse of the tides, and that his bones may still be whitening among the sands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{never seem}} to me to be talking about {{anything}} else, Kate, and upon my word I am quite surprised at your being so very thoughtless. You can find subjects enough to talk about sometimes, and when you know {{how important it is to}} keep up Miss Bray's spirits, and interest her, and all <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> quite extraordinary to me what can induce you to keep on prose, prose, prose, din, din, din, everlastingly, upon the same theme. You are a very kind nurse, Kate, and a very good one, and I know you mean very well; but I will say this--that if it wasn't for me, I really don't know what would become of Miss Bray's spirits, and so I tell the doctor every day. He says he wonders how I sustain my own, and I am sure I very often wonder myself how I can contrive to keep up as I do. Of course it's an exertion, but still, when I know how much depends upon me in this house, I am obliged to make it. There's nothing praiseworthy in that, but it's necessary, and I do it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pickwick {{might very}} {{probably}} have reasoned {{himself into the}} belief <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>was,</b> had he not, just then happening to look out of the coach window, observed that the looks of the passengers betokened anything but respectful astonishment, and that various telegraphic communications appeared to be passing between them and some persons outside the vehicle, whereupon {{it occurred to him}} that these demonstrations might be, in some remote degree, referable to the humorous deportment of Mr. Robert Sawyer.|$|R
