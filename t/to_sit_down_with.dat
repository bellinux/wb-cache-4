5|$|I {{really wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's {{one of those}} songs, one of those tracks {{and one of those}} videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
25|$|The day after, Nerman got <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Bukharin {{for a long}} interview, {{in which}} Bukharin {{expressed}} his optimism in the world revolution and socialist future. The same day he met with Alexandra Kollontay, the female Bolshevik leader, who later would be the Soviet ambassador to Sweden.|$|E
500|$|Rahm Emanuel {{worked for}} the Daley {{campaign}} as a fundraiser, David Axelrod as campaign strategist, William Daley as chief strategist, and Forrest Claypool as a campaign aide. Among four Daley campaign appearances on a Sunday shortly before the primary was a rally of Polish Highlanders at 4808 S. Archer Ave. In a videotaped television newscast, it appeared that Daley said, [...] "You want a white mayor <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> everybody." [...] Sawyer said he was [...] "shocked." [...] Daley explained, [...] "It was my standard stump speech. I'm not maybe the best speaker in town, but I have never used the word [...]" [...] That Friday, the campaign watchdog group CONDUCT censured Daley and commended Sawyer for his [...] "rejection of racially inflammatory comments." ...|$|E

500|$|Simkins, {{a son of}} Edgefield, while {{recognizing}} faults in Tillman's racial policies, stated that [...] "no South Carolinian, with the single exception of Calhoun, has ever made a profounder impression on his generation than Tillman." [...] The late senator's supporters and protégés remained long in South Carolina, encouraging a view of Tillman as a great man in state and national history. James F. Byrnes, for example, repeated Tillman's themes of race war {{on the floor of}} the House of Representatives in 1919. In 1940, Byrnes, by then a senator and soon to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, dedicated a statue of Tillman outside the South Carolina State House and called him the state's [...] "first New Dealer". Others who knew and at one time admired Tillman included Strom Thurmond, son of Tillman's Edgefield attorney, who saw and was inspired by Tillman's campaigning style as a boy. Other southerners were highly negative: Lyndon B. Johnson said of Tillman, [...] "He might have been president. I'd like <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> him and ask how it was to throw it away for the sake of hating." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 28, 1976, the Golden Gaters {{claimed the}} {{negotiating}} rights to ten reigning French Open champion Adriano Panatta {{after he had}} been left unprotected by the New York Sets. Golden Gaters did not contact Panatta about a contract but did inform him that they had obtained his rights. [...] "Should the time arise in the near future when the Gaters need some strength in the men's category," [...] said Golden Gaters owner Dave Peterson, [...] "I will not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Adriano and discuss financial terms. But, until that time comes, I am totally pleased with our present lineup and look at the Panatta acquisition as a strengthening to the Gater franchise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Left-wing {{politicians}} {{from the}} Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, including Satur Ocampo, Liza Maza, Teddy Casiño, Rafael V. Mariano, and Luzviminda Ilagan, has stated in 2010 {{that the government}} of Benigno Aquino III should [...] "acknowledge the existence of extrajudicial executions of activists and scrap the operation plan behind these murders" [...] and that [...] "they are willing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Aquino to present their concerns and offer solutions if the President wants to". They further said that “Aquino’s vow to uphold human rights should be measured by concrete political and military reforms he is ready to initiate in his government, starting with the scrapping of Oplan Bantay Laya and its criminal component of targeting activists and civilians".|$|E

60|$|The old man, never bidden <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> stood <b>with</b> {{an earnest}} hand {{laid on the}} back of the young man's easy chair. The young man sat looking at the fire with a face of {{listening}} curiosity, ready to check him off and catch him tripping.|$|R

2500|$|I {{honestly}} thought after Ligonier that we {{were beginning}} {{a new era of}} cooperation and Orthodox unity on this continent. For {{the first time since the}} early years of our presence in the Americas, it seemed there was a common vision, or at least a common goal of working together, not just for the sake of working together, but toward a canonically proper end of a unified Church. For me, the chance <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> brother bishops, many of whom I had never met, was a great and awesome experience. What made this experience great and awesome, besides just getting [...] together, was that [...] there was a purpose. Often we had gotten together in the past, but just for social purposes or anniversaries, celebrations, etc. This time it was for the good of the Church. Unfortunately, [...] what happened in the aftermath of Ligonier left us further apart and more disunited than we were in the years that led up to that historic gathering.|$|E
2500|$|On January 24, 2007, in {{reference}} to his stated plan to take public financing should he procure the nomination, he said, [...] "I think that for a time, the presidential public financing system works." [...] On November 27, he said, [...] "I will aggressively pursue {{an agreement with the}} Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election," [...] and on February 28, 2008, he wrote that he planned to [...] "aggressively pursue" [...] a publicly financed campaign, later promising <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> John McCain to ensure [...] "a public system" [...] of campaign financing is preserved. On June 19, 2008, he opted out of public campaign financing and declared, [...] "I support a robust system of public financing of elections (...) but the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken." [...] Furthermore, he maintained that he would not take contributions from federal lobbyists and special interests during his 2008 presidential campaign.|$|E
2500|$|By August 2009, Rosenberg {{said that}} the scripts for Part 1 and 2 were 75 to 85 percent completed. She found the {{greatest}} challenge in writing the scripts {{to be the final}} sequence of Part 2: [...] "The final battle sequence is a big challenge because it lasts 25 pages", she said. [...] "It's almost an entire three-act story in and of itself. You have to track [...] hundreds of characters. It's an enormous challenge to choreograph on the page and for Bill [...] to choreograph on the stage." [...] She had written various drafts of the scene but, at that, hadn't revised or discussed them with Condon yet. She said, [...] "That's the next big hurdle <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the stunt coordinator and create the ballet. It's a lot of work. I'm exhausted, but we're intent on making them the best scripts yet." [...] Godfrey called Part 2 [...] "an action film in terms of life-and-death stakes" [...] and said that in Part 1 [...] "there are the pangs of newlywed tension that occur that are relatable even in a fantasy film. Marriage is not quite the experience that they thought it was." [...] Condon thought of Part 1 [...] "as a real companion piece to Catherine Hardwicke's movie". Condon explains, [...] "Like, everything that got set up there gets resolved here. I think you'll find that there are stylistic and other nods to that film." ...|$|E

5000|$|Believing {{that the}} Labour Party had moved {{further to the}} {{political}} centre, Furre commented that the Socialist Left Party could only support a left-oriented minority government. Labour Party Secretary Ivar Leveraas responded negatively to Furre's comment, saying [...] "It isn't appropriate for the Labour Party <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> together <b>with</b> the Socialist Left to discuss our political program and conditions for support, as Berge Furre requires." ...|$|R

60|$|I have {{a desire}} to write some verses for your album; so, if you will give me the entry among your gods, goddesses, and godlets, there will be nothing wanting but the Muse.

6000|$|... 'We {{are your}} {{grateful}} servants, mistress,' said he, when the smoking joint and the batter pudding {{had been placed}} upon the table. 'We have robbed you of your room. Will you not honour us so far as <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> us and share our repast?' ...|$|E

60|$|The Emperor {{expected}} {{to keep all}} he already possessed in Italy; that Port Longue,[32] on the Tuscan coast, should be delivered to him by France; and, lastly, {{that he should not}} be obliged to renounce Spain. But the Queen, as well as France, thought that his Imperial Majesty ought <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> contented <b>with</b> his partage of Naples and Milan; and to restore those territories in Italy, which he had taken from the rightful proprietors, and by the possession of which he was grown dangerous to the Italian princes, by reviving antiquated claims upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, I {{always have}} my meals by myself. I like these antique customs. I don't {{think that women}} ought <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> at table <b>with</b> men.

60|$|But Master Frank excused himself. He did {{not choose}} to pledge himself <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> dinner <b>with</b> Mary.
