25|$|After the dreadfully {{desultory}} affair at the Sydney Football Stadium {{a fortnight}} before, the ten-try bonanza <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> {{the two sides}} at Ballymore was a timely reminder that running rugby, {{with the emphasis on}} the players and not the whistle, was what the public wanted. Welsh referee Clive Norling had given only thirteen penalties, ensuring the continuity needed by sides with the attacking flair of France and Australia. A close study of the video replay shows that Norling made at least six major mistakes, five of which led to points being scored. Nevertheless he was hailed as a hero for his willingness to let the players be the stars.|$|E
25|$|In early 2012, Nicho started {{carrying}} his old Psicosis mask {{to the ring}} with him. On April 6, Nicho and Joe Líder interfered in each other's matches, with Líder burning Nicho's face with a fireball during a main event run-in. On May 6, Nicho returned to working under his old mask and the ring name Psicosis, continuing his rivalry with Líder. In storyline, Líder's fireball had not only severely burned Nicho's face, but the incident had also driven him insane, causing him to once again don a mask and refer to himself as Psicosis. On August 5 at Triplemanía XX, Psicosis reunited with Líder for one night {{to take part in}} a Parejas Suicidas steel cage match, featuring three other former tag teams. Líder lost the match, after being <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> Psicosis, forcing the two to face other in a Hair vs. Hair match later in the event. In the end, Psicosis won the match, forcing his rival to have his head shaved bald.|$|E
25|$|REM Stage (REM Sleep – 20–25% {{of total}} sleep in adults): REM sleep is where most muscles are paralyzed, and heart rate, {{breathing}} and body temperature become unregulated. REM sleep is <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> acetylcholine secretion and is inhibited by neurons that secrete monoamines including serotonin. REM is {{also referred to}} as paradoxical sleep because the sleeper, although exhibiting high-frequency EEG waves similar to a waking state, is harder to arouse than at any other sleep stage. Vital signs indicate arousal and oxygen consumption by the brain is higher than when the sleeper is awake. REM sleep is characterized by high global cerebral blood flow, comparable to wakefulness. In fact, many areas in the cortex have been recorded to have more blood flow during REM sleep than even wakefulness- this includes the hippocampus, temporal-occipital areas, some parts of the cortex, and basal forebrain. The limbic and paralimbic system including the amygdala are other active regions during REM sleep. Though the brain activity during REM sleep appears very similar to wakefulness, the main difference between REM and wakefulness is that, arousal in REM is more effectively inhibited. This, along with the virtual silence of monoaminergic neurons in the brain, may be said to characterize REM.|$|E

500|$|In July 2005, Chris Wilson, the Internet Explorer Platform Architect, {{stated that}} passing Acid2 {{was not a}} {{priority}} for Internet Explorer 7, describing the test as a [...] "wish list" [...] of features rather than a true test of standards compliance. In December 2007, Microsoft announced that all the changes required to pass Acid2 would be made available in Internet Explorer 8, but that the changes would not be <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> default, meaning that IE8 would not actually pass the test.

500|$|This {{episode was}} the third episode of the series {{directed}} by Greg Daniels. Daniels had previously directed the episodes [...] "Basketball" [...] and [...] "The Dundies". [...] "The Client" [...] was written by Paul Lieberstein, who acts on the show as human resources director Toby Flenderson. The idea for Jan and Michael to have a romantic relationship was conceived by Steve Carell {{as far back as}} the filming of the pilot episode. According to writer and producer Greg Daniels [...] "it was like he (Michael) was <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> his teacher." [...] Writer and actor Paul Lieberstein said that the first idea that anybody came up for the episode was the final shot, where Jim and Michael look at each other and shake their heads, suggesting that they had been through similar experiences. The rest of the episode was written to lead to that scene. The scene where Oscar tells a story about a date getting a background check on him was based on an actual date that Paul Lieberstein went on.|$|E

500|$|Suzuki {{did not use}} storyboards and disliked pre-planning. He {{preferred}} {{to come up with}} ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who should know {{what is going to happen}} is the director. He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture. An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer's rice-sniffing habit. Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially [...] "Japanese" [...] killer, [...] "If he were Italian, he'd get <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> macaroni, right?" [...] Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible. In directing his actors, Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went [...] "off track". For nude scenes the actors wore maebari, or adhesive strips, over their genitals in accordance with censorship practices. The film was edited in one day, a task made easy by Suzuki's method of shooting only the necessary footage. He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for Shochiku when film stock remained sparse after the war. Post-production was completed on June 14, 1967, the day before the film was released.|$|E
500|$|Underwood's {{sexuality}} is ambiguous {{throughout much of}} the first two seasons; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated about his homosexuality. It is revealed in [...] "Chapter 8" [...] he had an experience with homosexuality in college. Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1. Slate journalist Hanna Rosin noted: if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real-life Washington couple and they were found each to be having an affair, he would be accused of being [...] "secretly gay, <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> women only when he can use them for a pure power play". Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood's sexuality, but hypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire. In season 2, Underwood is involved in a threesome with Claire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), while in season 3, there is a moment of sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer, Tom Yates (Paul Sparks). The same season, however, also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings (Malcolm Madera), his male personal trainer.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the Final Destination films is the {{threshold}} or tipping-point logic of characters' deaths. Conrich frames the complex death sequences in Final Destination films as [...] "death games, contraptions or puzzles {{in which there are}} only losers", which he compares to Rube Goldberg machines, the Grand Guignol, and Mouse Trap. Brinkema picks out the deaths of Ashley and Ashlyn from Final Destination 3 as epitomizing the death sequences in the Final Destination series. The characters' deaths are brought about by [...] "a series of neutral gestures, a set of constraints that will ultimately lead to their conflagratory ends"; these include the placing of a drink, a rifling-through of CDs, and an ill-chosen doorstop. The scene utilizes logics of temperature, color, and light to realize the deaths of the characters, as well as to allow Wendy to recognize the threat that they face. The [...] "literal tipping point", at which the characters can no longer escape, occurs when a coat rack is knocked onto the sunbeds; it is blown by an air-conditioning unit, which was <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the rising heat. Conrich identifies the roller-coaster derailment as paradigmatic of the franchise's focus on mobility in death sequences. He argues that theme-park rides and horror cinema are mutually influential; the former draw from the frightening aspects of the latter, while the latter draw from the [...] "theatrics and kinetics" [...] of the former.|$|E
