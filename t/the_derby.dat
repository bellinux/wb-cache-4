5|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the race, Secretariat was seen as the {{favorite}} to win by many; however there were doubts about him following a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to <b>the</b> <b>Derby.</b> In the wake of Secretariat's loss, Angle Light and, in particular, Sham were the horses that were seen as the most likely to win <b>the</b> <b>Derby,</b> aside from Secretariat. Many sportswriters believed that the horses in the field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken.|$|E

It was to eliminate the opposition of the Grand Junction company to the other NSR proposals that the NSR agreed to absorb <b>the</b> <b>Derby</b> and Crewe. However {{part of the deal}} was that the proposed line from Harecastle to Liverpool was abandoned. Despite having arranged to purchase the T canal for a considerable sum, to obtain support for the Liverpool extension the NSR agreed to the GJR demand. All that survived of the NSR Liverpool plan was the short branch to Sandbach from Harecastle.|$|E

5|$|Boulding {{returned}} {{on trial}} to former clubs Mansfield Town, {{with his brother}} Rory, and Barnsley. Boulding offered to play for free on a short-term deal at the latter club and started the season with the Championship side, being named on the bench for the club's opening match away to Queens Park Rangers. He was an unused substitute as his new side lost 4–0. Boulding was limited to reserve team football, which included a goal against Nottingham Forest. He failed to appear for the first-team and in February 2011, {{he was given a}} trial with another Championship club Derby County scoring in a reserve game against Walsall. After his trial, Boulding joined Derby on a non-contract deal {{until the end of the}} 2010–11 season. He played for the reserves before he earned his first call-up to <b>the</b> <b>Derby</b> team for a game against Crystal Palace. He was an unused substitute in a 2–2 draw. Boulding did not feature in <b>the</b> <b>Derby</b> first-team and they did not retain him at the end of the season.

5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make <b>the</b> <b>Derby</b> and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. <b>The</b> <b>Derby</b> was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E

5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for <b>the</b> <b>Derby,</b> and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still be able to make <b>the</b> <b>Derby.</b> The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|Juventus have {{significant}} rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino and matches {{between the two}} side are known as <b>the</b> <b>Derby</b> della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, {{the capital of the}} neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Derby</b> d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other {{at the top of the}} league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A. They also have rivalries with Milan, Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.|$|E
