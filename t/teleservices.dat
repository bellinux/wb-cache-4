Document components completed in preceding authoring activities can be specified as activity input. The document data are fully incorporated within the workflow artifacts. The central component is a multimedia archive that provides integrated workflow- and document management functionality.

40|$|The German {{machine and}} plant {{construction}} industry, with its mainly small and {{medium sized enterprises}} ('Mittelstand'), is particularly strongly affected by globalisation and is exposed to high competitive pressure. The stagnation of markets in Europe makes it essential for firms to open up new markets in distant regions, particularly in Asia, and to concentrate on keeping their regular customers. Appropriate use of the newest {{information and communication technologies}} can help to attain these goals. At the same time, the increasing complexity of machines and plants, as well as the growing proportion of software for machine control, require new and specialised knowledge, so that the customers of mechanical engineering have to rely more on support from the manufacturer's experts. The aim is to bridge distances between customer and manufacturer effectively and at reasonable cost. <b>Teleservice</b> (TS) is one answer to this problem. The findings are that <b>Teleservice</b> offers innovative potentials - which have been insufficiently exploited so far - for bringing machines into service, remote diagnosis and fault elimination, and for extended use in process support and customer advisory services. All enterprises that are already using <b>Teleservice</b> today are gaining economic and strategic advantages from this and are planning a further expansion of its use. At present <b>Teleservice</b> is particularly worthwhile for complex new machines whose modern controls are already planned to accommodate <b>Teleservice.</b> Theleservice is internationally considered as a strategically important technology application whose potential usefulness can only be realised in the relatively long term. Germany has a clear lead with regard to the range of services and technical level of existing solutions. The telecommunication infrastructure is no longer regarded as a problem. The survey comes to the conclusion that <b>Teleservice</b> should be used as an important component of business strategy in the area of service and customer relations. (orig.)

Most companies were formed by a recent revolution and restructuring launched within a decade, directed by Ministry of Communications and IT, Department of Telecommunications and Minister of Finance. Since then, most companies gained 2G, 3G and 4G licences and engaged fixed-line, mobile and internet business in India.
