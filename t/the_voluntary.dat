30|$|The {{extent of}} {{increase}} in <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> concentric torque induced by the conditioning contraction {{is influenced by the}} joint angular velocity. <b>The</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> concentric torque can be potentiated by the conditioning contraction when the joint angular velocity during <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> concentric contraction is sufficiently high, and not when the velocity is critically slow.|$|R

5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} conscription after the failure of <b>the</b> <b>voluntary</b> recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed.

After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all <b>the</b> <b>voluntary</b> muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|The Pagan Empire {{disintegrated}} and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, {{who probably}} preferred the situation, {{did nothing to}} restore order in the next ten years.

30|$|Not only twitch torque {{but also}} <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> {{concentric}} torque increases after a high-intensity contraction (conditioning contraction). The {{purpose of this}} study was to test the hypothesis that the increase in <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> concentric torque induced by a conditioning contraction is prominent when tested at fast angular velocities conditions. Twelve healthy male participants performed <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> isometric plantar flexion for six seconds as a conditioning contraction. Before and after the conditioning contraction, peak torques during <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> concentric plantar flexions were measured at 30 °/s (slow) and 180 °/s (fast), each of which was carried out in a separate condition. Isometric twitch torque was also recorded before and after the conditioning contraction in each of the two velocity conditions to confirm the extent of the positive effect of the conditioning contraction. The extent of increase in isometric twitch torque was similar between the two velocity conditions, whereas <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> concentric torque increased significantly only in the fast velocity condition (p[*]=[*] 0.003). These results support the hypothesis and indicate that <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> concentric torque can be potentiated by the conditioning contraction if the joint angular velocity during <b>the</b> maximal <b>voluntary</b> concentric contraction is sufficiently high.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voluntary</b> Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voluntary</b> Human Extinction Movement {{was founded}} by Les U. Knight, a high school {{substitute}} teacher who lives in Portland, Oregon. After becoming involved in the environmental movement {{as a college student}} in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation. He joined the Zero Population Growth organization, and chose to be vasectomised at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.|$|E

5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} opt for <b>the</b> <b>voluntary</b> repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia {{to reduce the size of}} its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in <b>the</b> <b>voluntary</b> repatriation programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Isobel (known as Iso) Rae (18 August 1860– 16 March 1940) was an Australian impressionist painter. After {{training}} at Melbourne's National Gallery of Victoria Art School, where she studied alongside Frederick McCubbin and Jane Sutherland, Rae travelled to France in 1887 with her family, and {{spent most of}} the rest of her life there. A longstanding member of the Étaples art colony, Rae lived in or near the village of Étaples from the 1890s until the 1930s. During that period, Rae exhibited her paintings at the Royal Society of British Artists, the Society of Oil Painters, and the Paris Salon. During World War I, she was a member of <b>the</b> <b>Voluntary</b> Aid Detachment and worked throughout the war in Étaples Army Base Camp. She and Jessie Traill were the only Australian women to live and paint in France during the war, however they were not included in their country's first group of official war artists. Following Hitler's rise to power, Rae moved to south-eastern England, where she died in 1940.|$|E
