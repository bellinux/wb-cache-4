5|$|Besides his {{governmental}} career, Gale was {{a member}} of the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society, where he served as treasurer. Gale was known as a collector of manuscripts and other antiquarian items, writing a few published works on <b>those</b> <b>subjects.</b> He donated his manuscript collection to his alma mater in 1738, and died in 1744. Although contemporaries felt he was one of the foremost scholars of his age, later historians have been less convinced, contrasting his learning unfavourably with his father's.|$|E
5|$|In September 2004, {{the school}} was {{designated}} a music and mathematics specialist school, which means it receives additional funding for <b>those</b> <b>subjects.</b> In 2007, {{the school was}} invited to become a High Performing Specialist School, and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As mathematics is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to be included under the first specialism. The Judd School is now a music with English and science with mathematics specialist school.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in <b>those</b> <b>subjects</b> into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E

5|$|John Peckham (c. 1230– 8 December 1292) was Archbishop of Canterbury in {{the years}} 1279–1292. He {{was a native of}} Sussex who was educated at Lewes Priory and became a Friar Minor about 1250. He studied at the University of Paris under Bonaventure, where he would later teach theology. From his teaching, he came into {{conflict}} with Thomas Aquinas, whom he debated on two occasions. Known as a conservative theologian, he opposed Aquinas' views {{on the nature of the}} soul. Peckham also studied optics and astronomy, and his studies in <b>those</b> <b>subjects</b> were influenced by Roger Bacon.|$|E
5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought. Multiple {{studies have shown that}} thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in <b>those</b> <b>subjects</b> asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of {{an automatic}} process.|$|E
5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able to take <b>those</b> <b>subjects</b> beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E

5|$|Manasollasa or Abhilashitartha Chintamani by king Someshvara III (1129) was a Sanskrit work {{intended}} for all sections of society. This {{is an example}} of an early encyclopedia in Sanskrit covering many subjects including medicine, magic, veterinary science, valuing of precious stones and pearls, fortifications, painting, music, games, amusements etc. While the book does not give any of dealt topics particular hierarchy of importance, it serves as a landmark in understanding the state of knowledge in <b>those</b> <b>subjects</b> at that time. Someshwara III also authored a biography of his famous father Vikramaditya VI called Vikraman-Kabhyudaya. The text is a historical prose narrative which also includes a graphic description of the geography and people of Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{found it}} {{difficult}} to evaluate Mesoamerican scientific and mathematical achievements, because of his relative ignorance of <b>those</b> <b>subjects.</b> While working in Boston in 1841, he met George Howard, who was to stay a close friend for the remainder of his life. Prescott worked industriously throughout 1840–1842, and as a result, the work was finished by August 1843. It was published by Harper & Brothers, New York in December, Bentley issuing the British edition. His elderly father had suffered a stroke in October, which resulted in temporary paralysis, so Prescott spent most of the winter attending him in Pepperell. The History of the Conquest of Mexico was received extremely well, both critically and by the general public, despite Prescott's fears to the contrary. Those praising the work included George Hillard in the North American Review, George Ticknor Curtis in the Christian Examiner, Joseph Cogswell in the Methodist Quarterly, as well as the Dean of St. Paul's, Henry Hart Milman in the Quarterly Review.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{explained}} {{in his memoirs}} that Mikhaíl Azanchevsky had taken over that year {{as director of the}} Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in <b>those</b> <b>subjects,</b> had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{investigation}} into human CD36 as well. A study examined oral detection of fat in obese subjects with genetic bases for high, medium, and low expression of the CD36 receptor. <b>Those</b> <b>subjects</b> with high CD36 expression were eight times more sensitive to certain fats (oleic acid and triolein) than the subjects with low CD36 expression. <b>Those</b> <b>subjects</b> with an intermediate amount of CD36 expression were sensitive to fat at a level between {{the high and low}} groups. This study demonstrates that there is a significant relationship between oral fat sensitivity and the amount of CD36 receptor expression, but further investigation into CD36 could be useful for learning more about lipid tasting in the context of obesity, as CD36 may be a target for therapies in the future.|$|E

50|$|The {{legal system}} needs to permit <b>those</b> <b>subject</b> {{to the law}} to {{regulate}} their conduct with certainty and to protect <b>those</b> <b>subject</b> to the law from arbitrary use of state power. Legal certainty represents a requirement that decisions be made according to legal rules, i.e. be lawful. The concept of legal certainty may be strongly linked to that of individual autonomy in national jurisprudence. The {{degree to which the}} concept of legal certainty is incorporated into law varies depending on national jurisprudence. However, legal certainty frequently serves as the central principle for the development of legal methods by which law is made, interpreted and applied.|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{knowledge}} about factors affecting {{the willingness of}} societies to conserve biodiversity is still scarce. This study investigates the role of body size in national decisions on wild animal species by analysing the average body sizes of the animal species subject to species-specific legislation in the Netherlands over the period 1857 – 1995. Three legal objectives were distinguished, namely ‘control’, ‘use’ and ‘protection’. For most taxa, average body sizes of species were found to differ significantly between legal objectives within {{a substantial number of}} subperiods analysed. Throughout the entire period examined, protected bird, mammal, fish and mollusc species were of smaller average body size than <b>those</b> <b>subject</b> to use legislation and protected bird, mammal and mollusc species were also smaller than <b>those</b> <b>subject</b> to control legislation most of the time. Protected insects were generally larger than <b>those</b> <b>subject</b> to control or use. For vertebrate taxa, average sizes of protected species increased over the time period selected for examination, suggesting that legislation initially excluded larger vertebrates from protection, possibly partly owing to demands to maintain use of these species. The results emphasize that conservation context is important, as other studies suggest that conservation policy generally favours larger species. ...|$|R
