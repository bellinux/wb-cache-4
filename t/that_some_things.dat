The same warrant states, however, <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> stayed constant: He always had a lot of money on him, he carried two loaded pistols in his trousers, and a huge two-handed sword.|$|E

In 1997 the children visit an art gallery, and see a painting by Lewis Bast, the same Lewis from 1867. The painting is of an unknown girl, but the children notice that the girl is Constance.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have seen}} that a Proposition of Relation, {{beginning}} with [...] "Some," [...] asserts <b>that</b> <b>some</b> existing <b>Things,</b> being Members of its Subject, are also Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts <b>that</b> <b>some</b> existing <b>Things</b> are Members of both; i.e. it asserts <b>that</b> <b>some</b> existing <b>Things</b> are Members of the Class of Things which have all the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate.|$|R

25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title.

500|$|Sarah Hughes of The Guardian {{was very}} {{complimentary}} towards the episode as a season premiere, remarking that [...] "The season opener deftly covers {{a huge amount}} of scene-setting while introducing a host of new characters." [...] In addition, she praised the episode's adaptation of the source novels for including a large number of important scenes and storylines with minimal filler. [...] " [...] this was a leanly written episode, which tackled {{a huge amount of}} exposition and scene-setting but never wasted a word." [...] Nina Shen Rastogi, writing for Vulture, thought that the episode served as both a redefinition of the plot and an reintroduction of the first seasons's themes of violence and succession. She wrote, [...] "from the very first scene of last night's season premiere, GoT strove to reassure us <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> would never change." [...] Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine lauded [...] "The North Remembers" [...] as a [...] "thematically focused" [...] episode on the subject of good leadership. He enjoyed how each of the rulers were developed in the premiere and hoped {{that the rest of the}} season [...] "can keep up with its premiere's big ideas." ...|$|E

When Will keeps {{ignoring}} her advances and is continuously hostile, he reveals that she was horrible to him in high school. Will also eventually reveals that during high school, he and Ross initiated the episode's titular rumor: that Rachel is a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school, and {{even went so far as}} to reach Chandler's high school. Rachel reacts tearfully, claiming she never hurt Ross in high school, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though Ross shockingly reveals that this is in fact true, much to everyone's amusement and disgust. Monica comforts Rachel, saying that despite the rumor, she was still the most popular girl in their high school and reminds Ross that due to his rumor, he was 'put on the map' in the school. She then reminds Ross and Rachel that they are having a baby together and <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> are more important than high school. Will feels betrayed that Ross had a relationship with Rachel but then that turns to a high five when he discovers that Ross [...] "knocked her up but did not marry her." [...] Ultimately the characters settle their differences. The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey wearing Phoebe's-turned-Rachel's maternity pants and getting the meat sweats. After being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.|$|E

2500|$|We {{have the}} intuition that Mary has been {{deprived}} of some vital data {{to do with the}} experience of redness. It is also uncontroversial <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> cannot be learned inside the room; for example, we do not expect Mary to learn how to ski within the room. Lewis has articulated that information and ability are potentially different things. In this way, physicalism is still compatible with the conclusion that Mary gains new knowledge.

2500|$|According to the {{regression}} hypothesis, two similar approaches developed. Cohen started to conduct several studies {{on his own}} to determine [...] "whether the last things learned are, in fact, the first things to be forgotten, and whether forgetting entails unlearning in reverse order from the original learning process" [...] (Cohen 1975: 128). He observed the attrition of Spanish, as the second language, among school children during the summer vacation. Cohen's results supported {{the regression}} hypothesis and his last-learned-first-forgotten thesis.

2500|$|The {{music of}} ancient Greece was almost universally present in ancient Greek society, from marriages, funerals, and {{religious}} ceremonies to theatre, folk music, and the ballad-like reciting of epic poetry.

Before playing the track, Swift explained its meaning: [...] "I wrote this song about the fact <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> are just hard to forget," [...] she said, [...] "because the emotions involved with them were so intense and, to me, intense emotion is red." [...] Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project. [...] "Thinking about what that means to me and all the different emotions that are written about on this album – they're all pretty much about the sexy, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years," [...] I noted. [...] "All those emotions – spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion – in my mind, all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between; there is nothing beige about any of those feelings." ...|$|E

You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
