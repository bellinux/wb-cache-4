5|$|In the 1920s, a non-electrified branch {{along the}} West Shore of Staten Island {{was built to}} haul {{materials}} to construct the Outerbridge Crossing, branching off of the main line south of Richmond Valley. The branch was cut back to a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built. Afterwards, the branch served a scrapyard owned by the Roselli brothers. The branch still exists <b>to</b> <b>Page</b> Avenue, and the switch is kept working.|$|E
5|$|The Z80 {{processor}} {{used in the}} Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, {{which means}} only 64KB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80KB of RAM the designers used bank switching so the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16KB {{at the top of}} the address space. The same technique was used <b>to</b> <b>page</b> between the new 16KB editor ROM and the original 16KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the address space.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Poland, Hergé was conscripted into the Belgian Army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Discharged within the month, {{he returned to}} Brussels and began Land of Black Gold. The story subsequently began serialisation in Le Vingtième Siècle on 25 September 1939. He was re-mobilised in December and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium, and Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold, on 8 May. The {{point at which the}} story was ended corresponds <b>to</b> <b>page</b> 30 of the current book edition, when Tintin is about to be caught in a sandstorm following his first confrontation with Muller.|$|E
5|$|The {{clothing}} worn by characters {{was brought}} up-to-date, while the old steam railways {{were replaced by}} electrified alternatives. Adverts for the genuine Johnnie Walker whisky were replaced by adverts for a fictional alternative, Loch Lomond whisky, while a Sussex County Council signpost was added <b>to</b> <b>page</b> 11. Various English towns and villages were renamed, with Puddlecombe becoming Littlegate, and Eastbury becoming Eastdown, while Scottish pub Ye Dolphin was renamed The Kiltoch Arms. The police were no longer depicted as carrying guns, as was accurate, while the journalists Christopher Willoughby-Drupe and Marco Rizotto, who had first appeared in The Castafiore Emerald (1963), were retroactively added into the background of one scene.|$|E
5|$|When Tintin in the Congo {{was first}} {{released}} by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected <b>to</b> <b>page</b> 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.|$|E
