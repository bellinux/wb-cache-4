40|$|OBJECTIVES. Hair {{coloring}} {{products are}} widely used and contain components that are mutagenic and carcinogenic. An association between occupational exposure to hair coloring products and hematopoietic cancers has been reported, but the risk for these cancers among users has not been carefully evaluated. METHODS. We conducted a population-based, case-control study with <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>from</b> 385 with <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>from</b> 385 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases, 70 Hodgkin's disease cases, 72 multiple myeloma cases, 56 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases, and 1432 controls. RESULTS. Among women, use was associated with odds ratios of 1. 5 for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1. 7 for Hodgkin's disease, 1. 8 for multiple myeloma, and 1. 0 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Risk was higher for permanent hair coloring products than for semi- or nonpermanent products, particularly for dark colors. Long duration and early age of first use tended to increase risk, but the patterns were inconsistent. Use was much less common in men and did not significantly increase risk. CONCLUSIONS. The use of hair coloring products appears to {{increase the risk of}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's disease were also associated, although based on far fewer subjects. If these results represent a causal association, use of hair coloring products would account for 35 % of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases in exposed women and 20 % in all women...|$|R

The data was gathered by <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>from</b> a sample population of 2, 500 company managers questioned over a five-year period between 2001 and 2005.

Objective: To examine the relation between patterns of dietary intake at baseline and new onset of persistent cough with phlegm in a population-based cohort of Singapore Chinese. Methods: A 165 -item validated food frequency questionnaire was administered in-person at baseline in 1993. We identified 623 cases of incident cough with phlegm among 52, 325 subjects by <b>telephone</b> <b>interview</b> <b>from</b> 1999 through 2004. We identified two distinct food patterns: a “meat-dim sum” pattern characterized by pork and chicken dim sum foods and noodle dishes, and a “vegetable-fruit-soy” pattern characterized by vegetables, fruit, and soyfood items. Main Results: The meat-dim sum pattern was positively associated with new-onset cough with phlegm (odds ratio, 1. 43; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 08, 1. 89; comparing fourth to first quartile, p for trend = 0. 02), after adjustment for age, sex, total energy intake, smoking, education, and nonstarch polysaccharide intake, a protective factor for cough with phlegm in this cohort. Weaker associations were seen for more chronic symptoms and for incident asthma. A weak inverse association for the vegetable-fruit-soy pattern disappeared after adjustment for nonstarch polysaccharide intake.

40|$|In survey {{research}} {{it is important}} to have a good representation of the population. However, it appears that young adults, full-time workers, inhabitants of large cities and ethnic minorities are difficult to survey. This research has studied how these groups can be reached better. In an experiment, potential survey participants (respondents) could choose how they wanted to participate: by a web survey, a personal <b>interview</b> or a <b>telephone</b> <b>interview.</b> Respondents who chose the web viewed pre-recorded clips of an interviewer reading the questions to them for half of the survey (video-web survey). The experiment showed that young adults and full-time workers have a preference for web surveys. So offering these groups this method in future surveys could improve their representation. However, survey methods such as web or telephone can also affect the way respondents answer questions. Respondents can invest minimal effort when participating or can adapt their answers to social norms (socially desirable responding). The experiment showed that the degree of socially desirable responding and investing effort in video-web was equivalent to the web survey without video. The answers of both web surveys differed from the answers given in the personal and <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews.</b> <b>From</b> this it can be concluded that adding videos in a web survey does not improve data quality for web surveys, but does also not deteriorate data quality. Socially desirable responding is further investigated conducting three experiments. These experiments provided more insights about how the sensitivity of questions for socially desirable responding can be established...|$|R
40|$|Background This paper {{provides}} important contextual {{and service}} implementation data by exploring participant experiences of a pilot case management intervention for long-term incapacity benefit (IB) recipients. Methods Service experiences were assessed via a postal questionnaire and semi-structured qualitative <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews.</b> Data <b>from</b> 77 service user questionnaires and 20 semi-structured qualitative interviews were obtained. Questionnaire data were analysed using SPSS and <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> were transcribed, thematically coded and analysed using NVivo. Results Respondents were generally positive about {{their experience of}} the intervention and particularly the benefit gained from the personal support that case managers provided. However, they also made suggestions about how the service could be delivered more effectively particularly {{in terms of the}} duration of the treatments and increasing the level of face-to-face support. Conclusions Case management approaches may offer a supportive environment in which the health needs of those in the long-term receipt of IB can be addressed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} evidence of genetic influence on alcohol use in samples selected to be informative for alcoholism research. However, {{there are a}} growing number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using samples unselected for alcohol consumption (i. e., selected on other traits and forms of psychopathology), which nevertheless assess consump-tion as a risk factor. Is it reasonable to expect that genes contributing to variation in alcohol con-sumption can be identified in such samples? Methods: An exploratory approach was taken to determine whether linkage analyses for heavi-ness of alcohol consumption, using a sample collected for heterogeneous purposes, could replicate previous findings. Quantity and frequency measures of consumption were collected in <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>from</b> community samples. These measures, and genotyping, were available for 5, 441 individuals (5, 067 quasi-independent sibling pairs). For 1, 533 of these individuals, data were col-lected on 2 occasions, about 8. 2 years apart, providing 2 datasets that maximize data collected at either a younger or an older age. Analyses were conducted to address the question of whether age and heavier levels of alcohol consumption effects outcome. Linkage results were compared in the younger and older full samples, and with samples in which approximately 10, 20, and 40 of drink...|$|R
