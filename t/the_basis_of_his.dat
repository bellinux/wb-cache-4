5|$|George Went Hensley (May 2, 1881 – July 25, 1955) was an American Pentecostal {{minister}} {{best known}} for popularizing the practice of snake handling. A native of rural Appalachia, Hensley experienced a religious conversion around 1910: on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> interpretation of scripture, he {{came to believe that}} the New Testament commanded all Christians to handle venomous snakes.|$|E
5|$|Yeats's mystical inclinations, {{informed}} by Hindu Theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided much of <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> late poetry, which {{some critics have}} judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision (1925).|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
5|$|Born in London {{and raised}} largely in Brighton, Grinsell {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology through visits to Brighton Museum. Later {{working as a}} bank clerk in London, he embarked on archaeological research in an amateur capacity, visiting prehistoric barrows during his weekends and holidays in order to record their shape, dimensions, and location. On <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> research, he published a range of academic articles and {{books on the subject}} of barrows during the 1930s, gaining recognition as Britain's foremost expert on the subject. In 1933, he carried out his only archaeological excavation, at the Devil's Humps in Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Druitt rented legal {{chambers}} at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple. In {{the late}} Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, {{and only one}} in eight qualified barristers {{was able to make}} a living from the law. While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the community at Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{running back}} Chris Johnson {{finished}} {{the game with}} 223rushing yards, 32receiving yards, and 153return yards {{for a total of}} 408all-purpose yards. That mark broke the NCAA bowl record for all-purpose yards previously set by Alabama's Sherman Williams against Ohio State in the 1995 Citrus Bowl. On <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> record-setting performance, Johnson was named the game's Most Valuable Player. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Boise State tailback Jeremy Avery had a solid, if unspectacular, outing. He produced 69rushing yards, 43receiving yards, 41kick–return yards, and caught a 25–yard touchdown pass. Both Johnson and Avery received the Most Valuable Player award for their respective teams.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lack of residency in Chicago {{for one year}} prior to the election.

5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This {{laid the groundwork for}} Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all.

For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August Thorpe, {{along with}} Holmes {{and two of}} Holmes's associates, were charged with {{conspiracy}} to murder Scott.

5|$|Percy George Herbert Fender (22 August 1892– 15 June 1985) was an English cricketer {{who played}} 13 Tests and was captain of Surrey between 1921 and 1931.

On <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Surrey captaincy, contemporaries judged him the best captain in England.|$|E
5|$|William and {{his brother}} Roger de Chesney were leading {{supporters}} of King Stephen in 1141, and were both leaders in Stephen's army that gathered at Winchester. In 1143, William de Chesney was given control {{of the town and}} royal castle at Oxford. He also held the town and castle of Deddington, which he had acquired at least by 1157, and possibly earlier. Although he did not begin the fortifications at Deddington Castle, it is likely that he began the first stone defences at the site. Deddington was Chesney's most important holding in Oxfordshire, and <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power in the county.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E

Responding to widespread interest, Dr. Tripp gave a talk in 1963 at the Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on Development of Leadership in Boy Leaders of Boys. In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at Camp Pico Blanco. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher).

5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> epic, Omeros.|$|E
5|$|Ernst {{had been}} a canon at Cologne since 1570. He {{had the support of}} the {{neighboring}} Duke of Jülich and several allies within the Cathedral Chapter. Although supported by both the papacy and his influential father, a 1571 effort to secure for him the office of coadjutor of the electorate of Cologne had failed once Salentin had agreed to abide by the Trentine proceedings; as the coadjutor bishop, Ernst would have been well-positioned to present himself as Salentin's logical successor. Since then, however, he had advanced in other sees, becoming bishop of Liège, Freising and Hildesheim, important strongholds of Counter-Reformation Catholicism. He was a career cleric, not necessarily qualified to be an archbishop on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> theological erudition, but by his family connections. His membership in several chapters extended the family influence, and his status as a prebendary gave him a portion of revenues from several cathedrals. He had been educated by Jesuits and the papacy considered collaboration with his family as a means to limit the spread of Lutheranism and Calvinism in the northern provinces.|$|E
50|$|In the meantime, Park grew anxious of {{the shift}} in US policy towards {{communism}} under Richard Nixon's Guam Doctrine.
