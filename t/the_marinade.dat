500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in <b>the</b> <b>marinade</b> for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E

50|$|Kalmi kabab, {{a popular}} snack in South Asian cuisine, {{is made by}} marinating chicken {{drumsticks}} and placing them in a tandoor.

The acidic marinade helps tenderize the meat (which is typically a tougher cut) before it cooks. Buttermilk is also used as a marinade in certain regional varieties.|$|E

5000|$|Raw pork, seafood, {{beef and}} poultry may contain harmful {{bacteria}} which may contaminate <b>the</b> <b>marinade.</b> Marinating {{should be done}} in the refrigerator to inhibit bacterial growth.

40|$|The mass {{transfers}} of water, acid and NaCl in turkey meat cubes (initial volume 1 cm 3 during marination were evaluated at various molalities of acetic acid (0. 0 - 1. 0) and NaCl (0. 0 - 1. 5). An experimental design was drawn up, {{associated with an}} estimate of the velocities of each component by means of kinetic monitoring. High mass yields (mass gain > 0. 3 kg kg_ 1), obtained for <b>the</b> <b>marinades</b> most dilute in acid, were found only in the absence of NaCl. The presence of NaCl had a negative effect on mass yield, counterbalanced by the positive effect of acetic acid. In the case of acidic marinades with low salt concentration, high solute flux densities were observed upon the start of immersion, as well as solute transfer velocities greater than those in water. This phenomenon may be explained by the superimposition of material diffusion and transport phenomena caused by a fall in internal filtration pressure due to expansion of the protein matrix. The fall in the buffering capacity of the meat in the course of soaking, related to the leakage of proteins, dipeptides and lactates, may explain the low pH values obtained during immersion in comparison with theoretical data.
