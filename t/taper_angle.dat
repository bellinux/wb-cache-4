50|$|Mechanical {{models that}} treat accretionary {{complexes}} as critically tapered wedges of sediment demonstrate that pore pressure controls their <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> by modifying basal and internal shear strength. Results from some {{studies show that}} pore pressure in accretionary wedges {{can be viewed as}} a dynamically maintained response to factors which drive pore pressure (source terms) and those that limit flow (permeability and drainage path length). Sediment permeability and incoming sediment thickness are the most important factors, whereas fault permeability and the partitioning of sediment have a small effect. In one such study, it was found that as sediment permeability is increased, pore pressure decreases from near-lithostatic to hydrostatic values and allows stable taper angles to increase from ∼2.5° to 8°-12.5°. With increased sediment thickness (from 100 - 8000 m), increased pore pressure drives a decrease in stable <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> from 8.4°-12.5° to <2.5-5°. In general, low-permeability and thick incoming sediment sustain high pore pressures consistent with shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high-permeability and thin incoming sediment should result in steep geometry. Active margins characterized by a significant proportion of fine-grained sediment within the incoming section, such as northern Antilles and eastern Nankai, exhibit thin taper angles, whereas those characterized by a higher proportion of sandy turbidites, such as Cascadia, Chile, and Mexico, have steep taper angles. Observations from active margins also indicate a strong trend of decreasing <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> (from >15° to <4°) with increased sediment thickness (from <1 to 7 km).|$|E

50|$|Working area: Working {{area is the}} plastically {{deforming}} {{area for}} drawing materials. Length and cone angle are the two factors for the working performance of this area. If the working area is too short, excessive pressure to the working area will be generated by the metal stretched. For the above reason, the tensile stress increased significantly, resulting in the accelerated wear of the mold. The principles for {{the selection of the}} length of the working area are as follows: a. The working area used for stretching soft metal wire is shorter than the working area used for stretching hard metal wire; b. The working area used for stretching metal wire with small diameter is shorter than the working area used for stretching metal wire with a large diameter; c.The working area worked under the condition of wet lubrication is shorter than the working area worked under the condition of dry lubrication. As for the <b>taper</b> <b>angle,</b> the <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> is smaller when stretching steel, while the cone angle should be larger when stretching non-ferrous metals and its alloys.|$|E

In this work, the optical transmittance of the non-vertical profile nano-hole array with different <b>tapered</b> <b>angle</b> (α) and structural periodicity (P) was numerically investigated. The optimum <b>tapered</b> <b>angle</b> in case of positive profile of the nano-hole arrays was found as 10 ° and 12 ° at structural period of 450 and 500 nm, respectively.

We studied the impact of growth rates and steric hindrance effects on the nano-twin formation at the STI side walls.

The STI side wall <b>tapering</b> <b>angle</b> and the substrate miscut angle induced streric hindrance between the InP facets and the STI side walls also contribute to defect formation.

50|$|The Lorestan (or Lurestan) domain {{forms the}} northerly {{of the two}} main salients in the Zagros FTB. The {{structural}} style of the simply folded zone is interpreted here {{to be dominated by}} detachment folding with some degree of disharmonic folding (folding of differing wavelengths at different structural levels). The disharmony occurs between a deeper layer bounded by the basal and Dashtak Formation décollement levels and shallower one between the Dashtak décollement and the surface. There is also evidence of a thick-skinned element to the deformation. The lack of Hormuz salt exposed at the surface makes the nature of the basal detachment less certain than in the Fars domain, but the presence of this salt layer is inferred from the observation that the <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> (the angle between the basal detachment and the current topographic slope) is identical to that where the salt is proven further south.|$|E

In the next step, the method has been extended to the podded drive unit for both puller and pusher configurations. The yaw angles of the podded drives are set to vary from - 300 to + 300 with 50 increments. The propulsive characteristics, including the torque and thrust of the propeller, the axial force, and the side force of the unit are presented as functions of the advance velocity ratio and yaw angle.
