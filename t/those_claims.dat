5|$|The Apple A5 chip doubles {{processing}} speed and has graphics processing {{that is up}} to nine {{times faster than the}} previous iPad. However, benchtests and hardware assessments performed by various third party news sources and technology blogs indicate that <b>those</b> <b>claims</b> are exaggerated; the benchmark assessment conducted by Anandtech showed that the GPU of the iPad 2 is only 3 times faster than that of the original iPad. CPU benchmarks conducted on the iPad 2 by iOSnoops indicate a 66% performance increase compared to the original iPad.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Corzine, and {{managers}} including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine {{made clear that}} the appeal was not an attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how <b>those</b> <b>claims</b> would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E
5|$|In September 2005, an Israeli-declared AIDS expert {{claimed that}} Arafat bore all the {{symptoms}} of AIDS based on obtained medical records. But others, including Patrice Mangin of the University of Lausanne and The New York Times disagreed with this claim, insisting that Arafat's record indicated that it was highly unlikely {{that the cause of}} his death was AIDS. Arafat's personal doctor Ashraf al-Kurdi and aide Bassam Abu Sharif maintained that Arafat was poisoned, possibly by thallium. A senior Israeli physician concluded that Arafat died from food poisoning. Both <b>those</b> <b>claims</b> were rejected by Haaretz and The New York Times. Then-Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath had also ruled out poisoning after talks with Arafat's French doctors.|$|E

5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after demanding {{a share of the}} profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There were a number of rumours: that she had died in the 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all <b>those</b> <b>claims,</b> detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1992, {{a pair of}} Italian Army Agusta-Bell AB-206L LongRanger {{helicopters}} operated by ECMM observers entered Croatian air space from Hungary. The helicopters were white-painted and unarmed. They were flying from the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to Zagreb via Kaposvár, Hungary. Authorities in Belgrade claim the helicopters were authorised to fly to Hungary, but that the pilots were warned they {{were not allowed to}} fly to Zagreb because no flights in Croatian airspace were permitted. The EC dismissed <b>those</b> <b>claims,</b> saying that the flight was approved in advance by Yugoslav air controllers. The approval was forwarded to the Yugoslav Air Force operations centre, but the order was never forwarded to the 5th Aviation Corps in Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{official}} had {{stated that}} by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (sometimes {{referred to as}} Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait). One of <b>those</b> <b>claims</b> came from Mohammed al-Qahtani, a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{who was part of}} the inner circle of al-Qaeda. Later in 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged operational chief of al-Qaeda, stated that he was acquainted with al-Kuwaiti, but that the man was not active in al-Qaeda, according to a U.S. official.|$|E

5|$|The ousting of {{the merchants}} from Constantinople {{was a heavy}} blow for Bulgarian {{economic}} interests. The merchants complained to Simeon I, who in turn raised the issue to Leo VI, but the appeal was left unanswered. Simeon, who according to the Byzantine chroniclers was seeking a pretext to declare war and to implement his plans to seize the Byzantine throne, attacked, provoking what has sometimes been called (inappropriately) the first commercial war in Europe. However, many historians including Vasil Zlatarski and John Fine consider <b>those</b> <b>claims</b> unlikely, arguing that {{in the beginning of}} his reign Simeon needed to consolidate his power and imperial ambitions had not yet been crystallised, therefore his military intervention was a defensive act to protect the Bulgarian commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|Bowie and {{his brother}} John were {{involved}} in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of <b>those</b> <b>claims,</b> the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.|$|E
