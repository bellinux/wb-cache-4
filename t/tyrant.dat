5|$|Eventually, {{the player}} {{character}} discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. In the lab, the player finds Jill or Chris {{in a cell}} and encounters Wesker programming a <b>Tyrant,</b> a giant humanoid supersoldier. Wesker reveals {{that he is a}} double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the <b>Tyrant</b> to kill the remaining STARS members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats the <b>Tyrant.</b> After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction. The game features multiple endings depending on the player's actions at key points {{over the course of the}} game. In the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter after defeating the <b>Tyrant</b> one last time. In contrast, in the worst possible ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy’s first {{recording}} experience {{occurred in}} Adelphia Cable’s Van Nuys Public-access television studio, after AbbeAbbe {{had suggested that}} shooting some lip sync footage from the Meet The <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy studio album might help them secure a new booking agent. The results, although very rough, were encouraging enough to convince the <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy to book more studio time. This material then {{became the basis for}} the Meet The <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy television program.|$|R

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{doubt this}} traditional account, arguing instead that the monarchy {{evolved into a}} government led by elected magistrates. Remnants of the monarchy, however, were reflected in republican institutions, such as the religious office of rex sacrorum ("king of the sacred") and the interregnum (a period of time presided over by an interrex when the offices of consul, praetor, and dictator were all vacant). There, is, however, certainly evidence that the early Republic {{was a time of}} violent change, with the word rex carrying the same connotations as <b>tyrant</b> and laws which declared forfeit the life and property of any man who plotted to install himself as a king or <b>tyrant.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Tyrant</b> is {{the code}} {{name of a}} series of boss {{characters}} in the Resident Evil horror video game series by Capcom, introduced in the original Resident Evil in 1996.

5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} {{for the social}} and political upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly the establishment of the first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the <b>tyrant</b> Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian <b>tyrant</b> Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands. Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona's European contemporaries {{generally}} condemned her {{policies and}} characterized {{her as a}} <b>tyrant</b> at best and insane at worst.

Recent academic research has recast Ranavalona's actions as those of a queen attempting to expand her empire while protecting Malagasy sovereignty against the encroachment of European cultural and political influence.|$|E
5|$|The Greco-Persian Wars {{had their}} roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and in {{particular}} Ionia, by the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a <b>tyrant</b> in each Ionian city. While Greek states {{had in the past}} often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian place-men. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the <b>tyrant</b> of Miletus, Aristagoras. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy. This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, and indeed Doris and Aeolis, beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian Revolt and {{associated}} revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus, and Caria were military rebellions by several regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 to 493 BC. At {{the heart of}} the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with opposition to the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, Histiaeus and Aristagoras. In 499 BC the then <b>tyrant</b> of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus (both financially and in terms of prestige). The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as <b>tyrant,</b> Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.|$|E

50|$|At first, the <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy {{directed}} themselves, but for {{the third}} episode, director/choreographer Ceil Gruessing, a friend of AbbeAbbe’s from Antioch College, was enlisted to direct. While problems were encountered with sound, lighting and framing, the <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy persevered, {{and went on to}} work with several other stage directors, including Debra De Liso, Steven Memel, Betsey Cassell, Tanya Kane-Parry and Tracy Winters. And when none of them were available, the <b>Tyrants</b> in Therapy reclaimed sole charge of the directing.|$|R
5|$|The Ionian Revolt, and {{associated}} revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus and Caria, were military rebellions by several Greek regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 BC to 493 BC. At {{the heart of}} the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, Histiaeus and Aristagoras. The cities of Ionia had been conquered by Persia around 540 BC, and thereafter were ruled by native tyrants, nominated by the Persian satrap in Sardis. In 499 BC, the <b>tyrant</b> of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as <b>tyrant,</b> Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.|$|E
5|$|The Persians {{found the}} Ionians {{difficult}} to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus {{was able to}} identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects – such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a <b>tyrant</b> in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a <b>tyrant</b> might develop an independent streak, {{and have to be}} replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Naxos (499 BC) was {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} Milesian <b>tyrant</b> Aristagoras, {{operating}} with support from, and {{in the name of}} the Persian Empire of Darius the Great, to conquer the island of Naxos. It was the opening act of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would ultimately last for 50 years.|$|E

5|$|The queen's foreign contemporaries {{strongly}} condemned her {{policies and}} viewed {{them as the}} actions of a <b>tyrant</b> or even a madwoman, a characterization that persisted in Western historical literature until the 1970s. Although Ranavalona has traditionally been depicted as a cruel and xenophobic <b>tyrant,</b> in more recent historical analyses she is commonly viewed as an astute politician who effectively protected the political and cultural sovereignty of her nation from European encroachment. In Madagascar today, the Malagasy of the central highlands hold complex and diverse views ranging across this spectrum. Most condemn her reign, in line with negative depictions of Ranavalona in current Malagasy history textbooks; this view is most common among Malagasy Christians. Others admire her effort to preserve Malagasy traditions and independence. The majority, regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies, consider her a remarkable figure in Malagasy history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with European powers.|$|E
