5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} {{important as a}} political document in arguments over {{the authority of the}} English monarchy. James I and Charles I both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the divine right of kings, and Magna Carta was cited extensively by their opponents <b>to</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> monarchy.|$|E

The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806.

5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience.
