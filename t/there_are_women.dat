5|$|In chapter 157 of Njáls saga, a {{man named}} Dörruð {{witnesses}} 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>women</b> within, {{and that they have}} set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð, which Dörruð memorizes.|$|E

25|$|According to Armenian lore, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>women</b> who, in {{consequence}} of deadly sins, are condemned to spend {{seven years in}} wolf form. In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With her better nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives' children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and locks springing open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary, but there are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.|$|E

25|$|Based {{on a study}} {{released}} by Dallas Women's Foundation, sex trafficking of young girls {{is not an isolated}} phenomenon, but a widespread criminal activity in Texas. The research found that 740 girls under age 18 were documented being marketed for sex during a 30-day period in Texas, of whom 712 of these girls were being marketed through Internet classified web sites and 28 were being marketed through escort services.

There are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are females of all ages who died from complication due to AIDS in one year in Texas.

500|$|Fuller was {{an early}} proponent of {{feminism}} and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical [...] "feminine" [...] roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, [...] "If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>women</b> well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women {{to be careful about}} marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, [...] "I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: [...] "There is no wholly masculine man... no purely feminine" [...] but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the [...] "lyrical" [...] or [...] "Femality" [...] side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared [...] "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed [...] "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including [...] "Mrs. Sigourney" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Stowe", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as [...] "Margaret".|$|E
2500|$|Greek {{words for}} a woman who prefers sex with another woman include hetairistria (compare hetaira, [...] "courtesan" [...] or [...] "companion"), tribas (plural tribades), and Lesbia; Latin words include the loanword tribas, fricatrix ("she who rubs"), and virago. An early {{reference}} to same-sex relations among women is found in the Roman-era Greek writer Lucian (2nd century CE): [...] "They say <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>women</b> like that in Lesbos, masculine-looking, but they don't want to give it up for men. Instead, they consort with women, just like men." ...|$|E

[...] "For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow. But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rock critic Michael Azerrad {{writes that}} K was [...] "a {{major force in}} {{widening}} {{the idea of a}} punk rocker from a mohawked guy in a motorcycle jacket to a nerdy girl in a cardigan". That the label was co-owned by a woman reflected an openness to women's participation. Pedersen is quoted in Toby Vail's Riot Grrrl zine, Jigsaw, saying [...] "I think it's really important that people know <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>women</b> ... girls who ... do more than package up things. ... It's really important that people to know that there are girls out there making decisions and doing stuff.".|$|E
