25|$|Moths {{frequently}} {{appear to}} circle artificial lights, although {{the reason for}} this behavior remains unknown. One hypothesis to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of celestial navigation called transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in {{the upper part of the}} visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> thereby causing airborne moths to come plummeting downward, and resulting in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Birkett was {{involved}} in the so-called Blazing Car murder case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man come out of a ditch {{at the side of the}} road, glance back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and say [...] "looks like somebody has had a bonfire". The two young men ran <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by Donald Finnemore, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and Richard Elwes. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as [...] "I'm very glad it's over" [...] and [...] "I'm responsible" [...] and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While he was doing this, Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} {{interaction}} (as {{distinct from the}} sum of the components) involves familiarity from childhood. [...] In a number of species, individuals prefer to associate with familiar individuals but prefer to mate with unfamiliar ones (Alcock 2001:85–89, Incest taboo, Incest). [...] By inference, genes affecting living together interact with the environment differently from genes affecting mating behaviour. [...] A homely example of interaction involves plants: Some plants grow <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> (phototropism) and some away from gravity (gravitropism).|$|E
2500|$|Unger {{produced}} a site-specific installation called Tweed Garden at Tweed Courthouse in New York in 1985. It was an environmental work clustered like a forest with passageways. [...] The 10 painted hexagonal columns are each 9 {{feet tall and}} flared like trees or flowers. [...] The columns are open {{in the middle and}} rise in layers, reaching <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> from the glass dome above. [...] It has been described as heavy with meaning yet light and ornamental in architecture.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{portrait}} {{was painted}} in 1900, during Williams' first year {{living in the}} Eakins home. A pendant to the first portrait, the second painting has been called [...] "a romantic fantasia, or unrestricted variation and development on the original theme"; it is more richly and loosely painted than its predecessor. In this version Addie Williams is turned fully <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> appears less troubled, with more richly colored skin and mouth. Her lips are fuller, eyes moister, and her hair less constrained and more natural in appearance. The characterization is more intimate, with {{the angle of the}} head implying the sense of resignation that Eakins favored in his later portraits. To Goodrich, she appears to be [...] "a kindly woman, wise, gentle, and warm, with a sense of humor— as I found her to be." [...] Her striped dress is adorned with bows and flounces which hide the body beneath vigorous strokes of red-orange paint; the handling of multi-colored drapery has been compared to virtuoso passages by Eakins' American Impressionist contemporaries. The Philadelphia Museum of Art received the painting as a gift from Susan Macdowell Eakins and Addie Williams in 1929.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Chatterton, glancing down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> that twinkled {{apparently}} vertically beneath her, and the glimmering {{plain of}} the Atlantic very far below, somewhat naturally hesitated, {{and was about}} to speak, when Lilian thrust a gold coin into the man's brown palm.|$|R

This dual push of the film - half <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighter</b> side and half <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> darker side, led to a work that nobly yet unsuccessfully attempted to appeal to both toddlers and families, and sophisticated filmgoers and lovers of Victor Hugo's book.|$|R
60|$|The sun set, the {{darkness}} fell, {{and it began}} to rain and blow. We started quite unobserved, {{so far as we}} could tell, and, travelling downward from the overgrown, ruined town, gained the old road, and in complete silence, for the feet of camels make no noise, passed along it <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> of Harmac, which now and again, when the storm-clouds lifted, we saw glimmering in front of us and somewhat to our left.|$|R
60|$|I saw the ceiling-cloth {{nearly in}} {{the centre of}} the room bag with a shape that was {{pressing}} it downward and downward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> lamps on <b>the</b> table.

Then the cloth ripped out from the walls, tore, split, swayed, and shot down upon the table something that I dared not look at till Strickland had slid down the ladder and was standing by my side.|$|R

60|$|Samoa's aspect, {{sleeping}} at the tiller, was almost appalling. His large opal eyes were half open; and turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of the binnacle, gleamed between the lids like bars of flame. And added to all, was his giant stature and savage lineaments.|$|E
6000|$|I {{decided to}} turn <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{right-hand}} <b>light,</b> for <b>the</b> conductor had said [...] "down the street." [...] I set forth at a brisk pace, but the loneliness and strangeness of the place were rather depressing.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{thinking}} this {{now as he}} strode across <b>the</b> spongy sod <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> windows of <b>the</b> shanty. The air was damp and chill, for the ice was not yet out of the ponds or swamps of tall grasses. An occasional prairie-cock sent forth a muffled, drowsy [...] "boom"; low-hung flights of geese, gabbling anxiously, or the less-orderly ducks, with hissing wings, swept by overhead, darkly limned against the stars. There was a strange charm in the raw air. The weary man almost forgot his pain as he drew deep breathings of the night.|$|R

60|$|It was in {{this way}} that the grey cub learned other {{attributes}} of his mother than the soft, soothing, tongue. In his insistent crawling <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> he discovered in her a nose that with a sharp nudge administered rebuke, and later, a paw, that crushed him down and rolled him over and over with swift, calculating stroke. Thus he learned hurt; {{and on top of}} it he learned to avoid hurt, first, by not incurring the risk of it; and second, when he had incurred the risk, by dodging and by retreating. These were conscious actions, and were the results of his first generalisations upon the world. Before that he had recoiled automatically from hurt, as he had crawled automatically <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> After that he recoiled from hurt because he knew that it was hurt.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 19 mm.

This <b>light</b> area is edged on its basal half by a deep blackish brown area, which is gradually suffused into the ground color dorsally, but which <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> costal <b>light</b> area is sharply drawn as an undulating edge. There is a submarginal series of small ochreous dashes around the apical and terminal edge. The hindwings are dark brownish fuscous, <b>lighter</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> base.|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{with green}} {{seedlings}} of sunflower (Helianthus annuns L.) indicate {{the existence of}} a phototropic mechanism which involves the leaves or cotyledons, and which can produce an asymmetry of auxin content without the involvement of lateral auxin transport, the classic explanation of phototropism in etiolated seedlings. The basic lines of evidence for the leaf-mediated tropism are: 1) darkening of one cotyledon will cause curvature of <b>the</b> stem <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> cotyledon: 2) <b>the</b> darkened cotyledon sustains an enhanced growth rate in the stem below it: 3) conversely, <b>light</b> suppresses <b>the</b> growth-stimulating effects of a single cotyledon: and 4) more diffusible auxin is obtained from the stem below darkened cotyledons than below lighted ones...|$|R

50|$|In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel used unarmed U.S. Ryan Firebee target drones to spur Egypt into firing {{its entire}} arsenal of {{anti-aircraft}} missiles. This mission was accomplished with no injuries to Israeli pilots, who soon exploited the depleted Egyptian defenses. In the late 1970s and 80s, Israel developed the Scout and the Pioneer, which represented a shift <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighter,</b> glider-type model of UAV in use today. Israel pioneered {{the use of}} unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for real-time surveillance, electronic warfare, and decoys. The images and radar decoying provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses in Operation Mole Cricket 19 {{at the start of}} the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed.|$|R
