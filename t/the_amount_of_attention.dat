5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E

Tripp argues that psychoanalytic ideas can be modified and elaborated {{in such a way that}} they can be made to provide at least apparent explanations for any case of homosexuality. He rejects the idea that homosexuality is caused by identity problems, fear of the opposite sex, castration anxiety, weak fathers, or the influence of dominant or close-binding mothers. Tripp argues that [...] "the mother-son closeness" [...] sometimes associated with male homosexuality is better interpreted as a result than a cause of homosexuality. Tripp maintains that psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality were never carefully formulated. In his view, the theories are based on the flawed assumption that the [...] "real or imagined negations in a person's life" [...] impair the development of heterosexuality and must be incorrect because [...] "all sexual attractions are based on positive motives". Referring to anthropological evidence, Tripp denies that family structure, or <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> fathers give to their sons, has any effect on the development of homosexuality.|$|E

She largely applauded the episode's exploration of the various characters, and its central motif, noting that [...] "the conspiracy [...] is no longer the threat now.

Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "The 'Two Fathers'/'One Son' was extremely powerful stuff. Tightly written, beautifully filmed and filled with more affirmations than revelations, but fascination looks at the characters in the drama".|$|E

At first, the party goes along smoothly. Andy makes a toast to Robert {{in order to get}} his fellow employees to toast him, as if to show to his parents and California that he is valued by his employees. His plan backfires, however, and instead more people toast Robert. To get everybody's mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing [...] "More Than Words" [...] as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Upset, Andy takes his guitar and storms off. His father confronts him privately about his outburst, and when Andy admits to trying to win his father's affection, he reacts with annoyance. This conversation is overheard by the other staff on the baby monitor Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) brought for their daughter, and Pam quickly turns off the monitor to let Andy save face. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confide to the camera that they now understand why Andy feels he needs to prove himself to everyone. After his family leaves, a dejected Andy, feeling unwanted by his family and co-workers, says goodbye to the office staff as they turn the garden party into a barbecue. Darryl and Oscar, however, convince Andy to stay with a cheeseburger and a beer.|$|E
