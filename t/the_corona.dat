5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than <b>the</b> <b>corona.</b> According to the point reached in the solar cycle, <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>corona</b> is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, near {{the surface of the}} Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The average temperature of <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>corona,</b> at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of the photosphere is approximately 6,000K, whereas the {{temperature of}} <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> reaches 1,000,000–2,000,000K. The high temperature of <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.|$|E

5|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} whether waves are an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching <b>the</b> <b>corona.</b> In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in <b>the</b> <b>corona.</b> Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>corona,</b> or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup shaped) or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> is a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. <b>The</b> <b>corona</b> is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, Table I).|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, <b>the</b> <b>corona,</b> though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> surrounding it.|$|E

5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>corona,</b> {{a stellar}} wind of plasma {{particles}} expands {{outward from the}} star, until it interacts with the interstellar medium. For the Sun, the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the heliosphere.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to heat <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in <b>the</b> <b>corona,</b> depositing their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E
5|$|The Roman army {{awarded a}} variety of {{individual}} decorations (dona) for valour to its legionaries. Hasta pura was a miniature spear; phalerae were large medal-like bronze or silver discs worn on the cuirass; armillae were bracelets worn on the wrist; and torques were worn round the neck, or on the cuirass. The highest awards were the coronae ("crowns"), of which the most prestigious was <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> civica, a crown made of oak-leaves awarded for saving {{the life of a}} Roman citizen in battle. The most valuable award was <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> muralis, a crown made of gold awarded to the first man to scale an enemy rampart. This was awarded rarely, as such a man hardly ever survived.|$|E

5|$|The chromosphere, {{transition}} region, and corona {{are much}} hotter than {{the surface of}} the Sun. The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat <b>the</b> <b>corona.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>corona</b> is the {{extended}} {{atmosphere of the}} Sun, which has a volume {{much larger than the}} volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|During a total solar eclipse, {{when the}} disk of the Sun {{is covered by}} that of the Moon, parts of the Sun's {{surrounding}} atmosphere can be seen. It is composed of four distinct parts: the chromosphere, the transition region, <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> and the heliosphere.|$|E
5|$|Remote {{observation}} of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy. For example, in high-energy environments such as <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions {{that can be}} detected by using radio telescopes.|$|E
5|$|There are six stamens in one to {{two rows}} (whorls), with the {{filaments}} separate from <b>the</b> <b>corona,</b> attached at the throat or base of the tube (epipetalous), often of two separate lengths, straight or declinate-ascending (curving downwards, then upwards). The anthers are basifixed (attached at their base).|$|E

5|$|In {{the north}} of the {{constellation}} is <b>the</b> <b>Corona</b> Australis Molecular Cloud, a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae, including NGC 6729, NGC 6726–7, and IC 4812. A star-forming region of around , it contains Herbig–Haro objects (protostars) and some very young stars. About 430 light years (130 parsecs) away, {{it is one of the}} closest star-forming regions to the Solar System. The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865. The Coronet cluster, about 554 light years (170 parsecs) away at the edge of the Gould Belt, is also used in studying star and protoplanetary disk formation.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) {{satellite}} observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed {{scientists to}} identify several {{different types of}} flares, and demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding {{the floral}} tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) {{from the rest}} of the {{perianth}} are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and <b>the</b> <b>corona</b> is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E
