25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Ethiopian Revolution in 1974, the name of the university was changed to Addis Ababa University (AAU). By 1974, despite efforts by the government to improve the situation, less than 10 {{percent of the total population}} was literate. The national literacy campaign began in early 1975 when the government mobilized more than 60,000 students and teachers, sending <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country for two-year terms of service. Most critics however saw this as the government's way to silence rising opposition while at the same time creating a network of government spys in the rural areas. Generally the campaign to increase literacy remained illusive even though government reports showed improvements.|$|E
25|$|Further on the way, they {{encountered}} a small settlement called Cavett's Station on September 25. After they had surrounded the place, Benge {{negotiated with the}} inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared. However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead's group and his Muscogee allies attacked and began killing <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pleas of Benge and the others. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto his saddle, only to have Doublehead smash the boy's skull with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muscogee for safe-keeping; unfortunately, one of the Muscogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later.|$|E
500|$|In December 2012, the University of Chicago's admissions {{department}} {{received a}} package {{in the mail}} addressed to Henry Walton Jones, Jr., Indiana Jones' full name. The address on the stamped package was listed for a hall that was the former home of the university's geology and geography department. Inside the manila envelope was a detailed replica journal {{similar to the one}} Jones used in the movie, as well as postcards and pictures of Marion Ravenwood. The admissions department posted pictures of the contents on its Internet blog, looking for any information about the package. It was discovered that the package was part of a set to be shipped from Guam to Italy that had been sold on eBay. The package with the journal had fallen out in transit and a postal worker had sent it to the university, as it had a complete address and postage, {{which turned out to be}} fake. All contents were from a Guam [...] "prop replicator" [...] who sells <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world. The university will display its replica in the main lobby of the Oriental Institute.|$|E

2500|$|The {{creation}} of Somb {{by the supreme}} being is found within the hermeneutics of Serer religion and [...] traditions. By thought, Roog first plotted the shapes of all the trees or plant species yet to come. Through the mythical words, Roog fashioned its placenta on the primordial seed − the seed of the Somb tree. Within this seed, Roog placed all the plant species including their reproductive energies − male and female. Through its feminine principle, Roog opened up and [...] "projected the germ of Somb" [...] which became the bearer of all the plant species found on earth and the underworld. The Somb seed penetrated the earth, the placenta of Roog where it took root and grew. Growing from this placenta, it kept all the plant species within its trunk. When it became a big tree, its trunk swelled diminutively and opened up as if by caesarean section or explosion. From this event, it opened up all the plant species found on Earth, and the rotational movement of the Universe scattered <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

60|$|The moral {{position}} {{taken by}} Mr Tigg was something quite tremendous; and the deaf cousin, {{who had the}} complicated aggravation of seeing all the proceedings and hearing nothing but the catastrophe, actually scraped her shoes upon the scraper, and afterwards distributed impressions of <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top step, in token that she shook the dust from her feet before quitting that dissembling and perfidious mansion.|$|E

60|$|The duke {{said what}} he was after was a printing-office.
