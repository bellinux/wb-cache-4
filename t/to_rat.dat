5|$|Another risk <b>to</b> <b>rat</b> owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{was born}} in born in Rat Portage, Ontario on May 5, 1883, the {{youngest}} of three children to James and Marcelline Phillips. James, who {{was born in}} Fifeshire, Scotland on October 14, 1822, had trained as a stonemason and immigrated to Canada to help build railways. He had previously been married, with a son and two daughters. He married Marcelline (née Bourassa), a native of Buckingham, Quebec on April 30, 1877. Their first child, a son named Robert, was born in 1878, followed by a daughter, Margaret, in 1879; both were born in Ottawa. In 1882 James took up a job in Western Ontario as superintendent of construction for the Canadian Pacific Railway transcontinental rail line, and family moved <b>to</b> <b>Rat</b> Portage, located near the Ontario border with Manitoba.|$|E

25|$|Two {{introduced}} mammals {{are established}} on the islands. The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) was introduced <b>to</b> <b>Rat</b> Island around 1900, {{and the house}} mouse (Mus musculus) was introduced onto North Island in the 1970s, presumably with food.

In addition, three introduced mammals were previously established in the Houtman Abrolhos, but have since been eradicated. The black rat (Rattus rattus) was established on Pigeon and Rat Islands, but has been eradicated by poisoning. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has been introduced at various times onto Leo Island, Middle Island, Morley Island, Pelsaert Island and Wooded Island. In the case of Pelsaert Island, {{it is not clear whether}} it ever established; in all other cases, established populations have been eradicated by poisoning.

25|$|The caged rats (Groups CC and PC) {{took to the}} {{morphine}} instantly, {{even with}} relatively little sweetener, with the caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males {{in one of the}} experimental conditions. The rats in Rat Park resisted the morphine water. They would try it occasionallywith the females trying it more often than the malesbut they showed a statistically significant preference for the plain water. He writes that the most interesting group was Group CP, the rats who were brought up in cages but moved <b>to</b> <b>Rat</b> Park before the experiment began. These animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger, but as it became sweeter and more dilute, they began to drink almost as much as the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment. They wanted the sweet water, he concluded, so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior. Even more significant, he writes, was that when he added a drug called Naloxone, which negates the effects of opioids, to the morphine-laced water, the Rat Park rats began to drink it.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, the EIC {{squadron}} under Commodore Charles Mitchell passed Singapore on 2 January 1794, sailing eastwards {{in search}} of French raiders. As the British squadron travelled along the northern coast of Sumatra, two French privateers attacked Bencoolen on the southern coast. The privateers were the 30-gun Vengeur and the 26-gun Résolu. On 17 January they approached the mouth of Rat Island Basin close to Bencoolen where Pigot lay at anchor, completely unprepared for action. At 08:15 Vengeur opened fire at , maintaining the battle {{for an hour and}} 45 minutes before hauling off so that Résolu could continue the combat. Ballantyne defended his vessel intelligently, positioning Pigot so that the French could only approach one at a time through the narrow mouth of the bay. This allowed him to drive off each ship in turn, the privateers falling back together at 10:20 with damaged rigging. Pigot too had suffered, with one man mortally wounded and sufficient damage to the rigging to require several weeks of repairs. After immediate repairs had been completed, next day Corosin abandoned Bencoolen and retreated to the Sunda Strait {{in search of}} weaker targets. The governor at Bencoolen sent over reinforcements to Pigot {{in the form of a}} lieutenant, 40 sepoys, and two 18-pounder guns. They arrived too late to assist, and Ballantayne sent them <b>to</b> <b>Rat</b> Island to establish a battery as he could not use the guns.|$|E

[...] The alternative was the historic route of the rival North West Company's voyageurs from Montreal through Lake Huron to Fort William on Lake Superior. Above Superior, this route followed rivers and lakes to Lac la Croix and west along the international border through Lake of the Woods <b>to</b> <b>Rat</b> Portage, and then down the Winnipeg River to the Red.

500|$|In 2009, {{one case}} of {{sympathomimetic}} toxicity {{was reported in}} the UK after a person took 0.2g of mephedrone orally, and after this did not achieve the desired effect, subcutaneously injected 3.8g mixed with water into his thighs. Shortly afterwards, the user [...] "developed palpitations, blurred tunnel vision, chest pressure and sweating". The patient was treated with 1mg of lorazepam and the sympathomimetic features decreased and the user was discharged within six hours of arrival. One case of serotonin syndrome has been reported, where the patient was already prescribed fluoxetine and olanzapine, and then took 40 tablets containing mephedrone in one night. He was treated with lorazepam and discharged 15 hours after admission. Both enantiomers of methcathinone, which differs only in the lack of the methyl group on the aryl ring when compared to mephedrone, {{have been shown to be}} toxic <b>to</b> <b>rat</b> dopamine neurons, and the S-enantiomer was also toxic against serotonin neurons. Simon Gibbons and Mire Zloh of the School of Pharmacy, University of London stated, based on the chemical similarities between methcathinone and mephedrone, [...] "it is highly likely that mephedrone will display neurotoxicity". However, Brunt and colleagues stated, [...] "extreme caution" [...] should be used when inferring the toxicity of mephedrone from methcathinone, noting some of the toxicity associated with methcathinone is due to manganese impurities related to its synthesis, rather than the compound itself. They concluded more experimental research is needed to investigate the toxicity of mephedrone.|$|E

Rat Portage changed its name from to Kenora in 1905. Due to their proximity to Manitoba, the Thistles played in the Manitoba Hockey League. In the 1904–05 season Phillips had the second-most goals on the team and league, with twenty-six, two behind Billy McGimsie. The Thistles won the Manitoba league championship, which allowed them to challenge for the Stanley Cup. By this time Phillips was {{regarded as one of the}} best players in Canada, compared to Frank McGee of the Senators.

6000|$|The {{real story}} of the {{negotiations}} that followed we shall perhaps never learn. But so much is plain: that while Becker was thus outwardly straining decency {{in the interest of}} Tamasese, he was privately intriguing, or pretending to intrigue, with Mataafa. In his despatch of the 11th, he had given an extended criticism of that chieftain, whom he depicts as very dark and artful; and while admitting that his assumption of the name of Malietoa might raise him up followers, predicted that he could not make an orderly government or support himself long in sole power [...] "without very energetic foreign help." [...] Of what help was the consul thinking? There was no helper in the field but Germany. On the 15th he had an interview with the victor; told him that Tamasese's was the only government recognised by Germany, and that he must continue to recognise it till he received [...] "other instructions from his government, whom he was now advising of the late events"; refused, accordingly, to withdraw the guard from the isthmus; and desired Mataafa, [...] "until the arrival of these fresh instructions," [...] to refrain from an attack on Mulinuu. One thing of two: either this language is extremely perfidious, or Becker was preparing to change sides. The same detachment appears in his despatch of October 7th. He computes the losses of the German firm with an easy cheerfulness. If Tamasese get up again (gelingt die Wiederherstellung der Regierung Tamasese's), Tamasese will have to pay. If not, then Mataafa. This is not the language of a partisan. The tone of indifference, the easy implication that the case of Tamasese was already desperate, the hopes held secretly forth to Mataafa and secretly reported to his government at home, trenchantly contrast with his external conduct. At this very time he was feeding Tamasese; he had German sailors mounting guard on Tamasese's battlements; the German war-ship lay close in, whether to help or to destroy. If he meant to drop the cause of Tamasese, he had him in a corner, helpless, and could stifle him without a sob. If he meant <b>to</b> <b>rat,</b> it was to be with every condition of safety and every circumstance of infamy.|$|E
6000|$|We {{could well}} believe, as the steamer ran into English Harbour, that Antigua was still subject to earthquakes; {{and had been}} shaken, with great loss of {{property}} though not of life, in the Guadaloupe earthquake of 1843, when 5000 lives {{were lost in the}} town of Point- a-Pitre alone. The only well-marked effect which Dr. Davy could hear of, apart from damage to artificial structures, was the partial sinking of a causeway leading <b>to</b> <b>Rat</b> Island, in the harbour of St. John. No wonder: if St. John's harbour be--as from its shape on the map it probably is--simply an extinct crater, or group of craters, like English Harbour. A more picturesque or more uncanny little hole than that latter we had never yet seen: but there are many such harbours about these islands, which nature, for the time being at least, has handed over from the dominion of fire to that of water. Past low cliffs of ash and volcanic boulder, sloping westward to the sea, which is eating them fast away, the steamer runs in through a deep crack, a pistol-shot in width. On the east side a strange section of gray lava and ash is gnawn into caves. On the right, a bluff rock of black lava dips sheer into water several fathoms deep; and you anchor at once inside an irregular group of craters, having passed through a gap in one of their sides, which has probably been torn out by a lava flow. Whether the land, {{at the time of the}} flow, was higher or lower than at present, who can tell? [...] This is certain, that the first basin is for half of its circumference circular, and walled with ash beds, which seem to slope outward from it. To the left it leads away into a long creek, up which, somewhat to our surprise, we saw neat government-houses and quays; and between them and us, a noble ironclad and other ships of war at anchor close against lava and ash cliffs. But right ahead, the dusty sides of the crater are covered with strange bushes, its glaring shingle spotted with bright green Manchineels; while on the cliffs around, aloes innumerable, seemingly the imported American Agave, send up their groups of huge fat pointed leaves from crannies so arid that one would fancy a moss would wither in them. A strange place it is, and strangely hot likewise; and one could not but fear a day--it is to be hoped long distant-- when it will be hotter still.|$|E
