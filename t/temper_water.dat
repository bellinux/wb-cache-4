40|$|Received 27 December 2015, Revised 14 March 2016, Accepted 19 March 2016, Available online 31 March 2016 The {{effects of}} {{fragmentation}} on acorn production should be mediated by their {{impacts on the}} physiological status of oaks during seed development particularly in water-limited systems, such as Mediterranean forests. The creation of forests edges reduces tree-to-tree competition, which may in turn <b>temper</b> <b>water</b> shortage during summer and, as a result, enhance acorn production. To test these two hypotheses we monitored acorn production and predawn water potential during the 2012 – 2014 period in two holm oak (Quercus ilex) forest archipelagos of the Iberian Peninsula. Acorn production and fragmentation effects did not differ between localities despite of their contrasting climatic conditions (accumulated water deficit from April to August was a 60...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of cell-wall-degrading enzymes added to <b>temper</b> <b>water</b> on wheat milling performance and flour quality. An enzyme cocktail consisting of cellulase, xylanase, and pectinase and five independent variables (enzyme concentration, incubation time, incubation temperature, tempered wheat moisture content, and tempering water pH) were manipulated in a response surface methodology (RSM) central composite design. A single pure cultivar of hard red winter wheat was tempered under defined conditions and milled on a Ross experimental laboratory mill. Some treatment combinations affected flour yield from the break rolls more than that from the reduction rolls. However, a maximum for flour yield was {{not found in the}} range of parameters studied. Though treatments did not affect the optimum water absorption for breadmaking, enzyme-treated flours produced dough exhibiting shorter mixing times and slack and sticky textures compared with the control. Regardless of differences in mixing times, specific loaf volumes were not significantly different among treatments. Crumb firmness of bread baked with flour milled from enzyme-treated wheat was comparable to the control after 1 day but became firmer during storage up to 5 days...|$|E

Five independent variables, enzyme concentration, incubation time, incubation temperature, tempered wheat moisture content, and tempering water pH, were studied. An enzyme cocktail consisting of cellulase, xylanase, and pectinase was used at 5 different concentrations. A single pure variety of hard red winter wheat was tempered under defined conditions following an RSM central composite design which required 33 tests including 7 replicates.

An average coefficient of performance of 4. 05 was realized for the heat pump, indicating that with rigid water (energy) conservation practices improved performance would result.

40|$|International audience"This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the diffusion of morpho-functional traits across social boundaries. A present-day situation is examined. It describes the widespread adoption of a granite <b>tempered</b> <b>water</b> jar by two social communities of potters who used to produce distinct ranges of morpho-functional vessels. The analysis of the transmission mechanisms shows that diffusion of such traits occurred both through indirect and direct transmission. Indirect transmission occurred at the inter-group level while direct transmission under the form of technical guidance occurred at the intra-group level. These were triggered by the intention of the artisans to produce a model valued by the consumers and which sells well. This intention took place in a context of collapse of the previous economic system. These results suggest that in a context where ceramic production was previously diversified and economically complementary, the standardization of morpho-functional traits signals that an established «rule» was transgressed and therefore that major socio-economic changes took place. ...|$|R

40|$|Clay {{obtained}} from lgbokoda {{in the southwestern}} part of Nigeria has been analysed and developed as a binder for synthetic moulding sand. The analysis was compared with the analytical results obtained for the pre-treated bentonite clay imported from the U. S. A. and used by the Nigerian Foundries Ltd. (NFL). X-ray analysis indicated the presence of kaolin, illite and montmorillonite (parent mineral of bentonite), with kaolin having the highest percentage in the lgbokoda clay and montmorillonite was further confirmed by the flame test which shows the existence of exchangeable cations not present in kaolin.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the effect of sodium citrate on the {{formation}} of a cement stone in the aluminous binder. Formation of cement stone framework in cement hydraulic binder is accompanied with complicated physical and chemical processes of interphase interactions and dispersion, these processes are predicated on qualitative and quantitative composition of the cement mortar, continuous changes in its properties from preparation stage till curing. Addition of sodium citrate to <b>tempering</b> <b>water</b> enhances hydration of both Portland cement and calcium aluminate cement. Process pertaining to an increase of cement hydration rate is considered as a consequence of destruction in surface formations and exclusion of damping effect in respect of hydration rate and hydrolysis of products resulted from interaction of clinker material with tempering. It has been established that sodium citrate makes it possible to control processes of hydration, hydrolysis, binding and curing for cement mass. High degree of hydration of aluminous cement in the presence of sodium citrate provides fast binding and curing of binder, low porosity and rather high compression breaking strength of cement stone for all curing stages. An increase in concentration of sodium citrate in cement mixture up to 10 % of the cement mass exerts an influence not only on the process of cement mortar liquefaction, reduction of time for cement mass setting and hardening but also increases compression strength of cement stone. An analysis of the structure for cleavage surface of cement stone gives ground to declare that the addition of sodium citrate provides cement stone sealing and reduces its water absorption. </p...|$|R

Parameters influencing burn severity, such as clothing thickness, liquid temperature, removal of fabric and thermal effects of post scald water cooling are analyzed. The fabric cools the water some but represents a threat since the entrapped water results in a prolonged heat supply. The liquid temperature {{turned out to be the}} most important injury parameter, where liquid temperature of about 80 – 85 °C seems to be a limit for developing superficial partial-thickness burns in the present minimum case, i. e., where the liquid just wets the fabric.

Higher liquid temperatures will nearly instantly develop more severe burns.

The general advice is therefore to avoid excessive heating of beverages and, if the beverage is spilled, to quickly remove the wetted clothing.
