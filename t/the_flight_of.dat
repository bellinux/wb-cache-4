5|$|Basiliscus had {{relied on}} the support of some major figures of the court in his bid for power. However, he quickly lost most of them. First, Basiliscus alienated his own sister Verina's support, {{executing}} the Magister Officiorum Patricius. Patricius was the lover of Verina, and the empress had planned to raise him to the imperial rank and to marry him: the very revolt against Zeno was organised to make Patricius emperor. Basiliscus, however, had out-witted his sister, and, after <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> Zeno, had the ministers and the Senate choose him, and not Patricius, as Emperor. Basiliscus ordered the death of Patricius, as the officer was a natural candidate to overthrow the new Emperor; as a consequence, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus, because of her lover's execution.|$|E
5|$|Clashes in {{the capital}} between Habré's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became {{progressively}} more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000–1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> about half the capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau, Habsburg was {{transferred}} to the IV Division along with her sisters when the first new s came into service in 1912. After Italy entered World War I on the side of France and Great Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Navy bombarded several Italian port cities along the Adriatic coast. Habsburg took part in the bombardment of Ancona on 23 May 1915. During the attack on the Italian port city, Habsburg bombarded the town's train station, the St. Stefano military camp and Ancona coastal batteries. The bombardment of Ancona was Habsburgs only combat operation.|$|E

This capability is critical to future prototype integration, evaluation, and demonstration. This will provide the ability for WEAR Lab products, EV 3 human interface prototypes, and technologies from other JSC organizations to be evaluated and tested while in <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> Deck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Future. All WEAR Lab products must be integrated with the interface that will connect them to <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> Deck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Future. The WEAR Lab products will primarily be programmed in Arduino. Arduino will be used for the development of wearable controls and a tactile communication garment. Arduino will also be used in creating wearable methane detection and warning system...|$|R

5|$|In late July and August 1914, Habsburg {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the III Battleship Division of the Austro-Hungarian navy, {{under the command of}} Captain Miklós Horthy. The battleship, along with her sister ships {{and the rest of the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, were mobilized to support <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau from 28 July to 10 August 1914. The two German battlecruisers were stationed in the Mediterranean Sea and were attempting to break out of the strait of Messina, which was surrounded by British troops and vessels, and make their way to Turkey. After the Germans successfully escaped the strait, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was recalled. The fleet had advanced as far south as Brindisi in southeastern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Lunney worked {{both in the}} Control Center and at remote sites; during <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> John Glenn, America's first orbital spaceflight, he {{was serving}} as the FIDO in Bermuda.

In Houston, he became head of the Mission Logic and Computer Hardware section, where he defined and oversaw the {{computing}} and display requirements of the flight dynamics division within the new Mission Control Center.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Andrée's heroic motives {{have been}} questioned, {{beginning}} with Per Olof Sundman's bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, <b>The</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>of</b> the Eagle.

Sundman's interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind spots of the Swedish national culture, {{and the role of the}} press is reflected in the film adaptation, Flight of the Eagle (1982), based on his novel and directed by Jan Troell. It was nominated for an Oscar.|$|E
