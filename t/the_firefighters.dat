5|$|Using a {{searchlight}} {{the helicopter}} crew searched {{the exterior of}} the building and at 1:17 AM February 23, the helicopter spotted a broken window on the 28th floor located in an area that could not be seen from the street. At about 2:15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters unconscious and out of air in their SCBAs. <b>The</b> <b>firefighters</b> were brought to a medical triage set up on the 20th floor. There were attempts at resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful and <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> were pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00am another alarm sounded: the planing {{mills and}} lumber yard of J. Turner & Cate, near the Philadelphia Wilmington & Baltimore rail depot, {{had been set}} on fire.

50|$|Phase-two mode {{can only}} be {{activated}} by a key switch located inside the elevator on the centralized control panel. This mode was created for firefighters {{so that they may}} rescue people from a burning building. The phase-two key switch located on the COP has three positions: off, on, and hold. By turning phase two on, <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> enables <b>the</b> car to move. However, like independent-service mode, the car will not respond to a car call unless <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> manually pushes and holds the door close button. Once the elevator gets to the desired floor it will not open its doors unless <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> holds <b>the</b> door open button. This is in case the floor is burning and <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> can feel <b>the</b> heat and knows not to open <b>the</b> door. <b>The</b> <b>firefighter</b> must hold door open until the door is completely opened. If for any reason <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> wishes to leave the elevator, they will use the hold position on the key switch to make sure the elevator remains at that floor. If <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> wishes to return to the recall floor, they simply turn the key off and close the doors.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if a firefighter’s fundamental movement patterns can act as predictors for occupational injury and performance during <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> academy training. <b>The</b> study consisted of 23 <b>firefighter</b> candidates entering <b>the</b> 16 -week <b>firefighter</b> academy training. <b>The</b> <b>firefighter</b> candidates’, VO 2 Max, 1. 5 mile-run and Firefighter Physical Conditioning Course and movement patterns were assessed at the on-set of the 16 -week training. <b>The</b> <b>firefighter</b> movement patterns were assessed utilizing the Functional Movement Screen, which was designed to identify flaws in fundamental movement patterns. <b>The</b> <b>firefighter</b> candidates were then observed and their injuries documented during <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> academy training. <b>The</b> injury results as well as the initial performance tests were then compared to the results obtained by the Functional Movement Screen. There were no significant findings when comparing the Functional Movement Screen to the performance tests.

5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty people in one of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and fire hydrants was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher up off the ground, and thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. <b>The</b> <b>firefighters</b> received assistance several hours after the fire started by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> were treated for hypothermia after treading through the cold temperatures of the flood water. The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
50|$|Autopsy reports {{confirmed}} that <b>the</b> three <b>firefighters</b> were Collins and Dean from River Oaks and Sanders from Sansom Park.

50|$|Once {{cleared for}} training, <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> {{will need to}} train a minimum of 4 weeks before the test with the boots and gear needed for the job. It is {{recommended}} that <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> train for <b>the</b> arduous test by building up their aerobic fitness, first by hiking 3 miles with no pack, then by jogging on a flat course without a pack, then later add the pack and hike hills to build leg strength. Increase weight slowly until <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> can hike 3 miles in 45 minutes while carrying 45 pounds.|$|R
40|$|Using {{the latest}} in technology, we wish to assist firefighters, who {{routinely}} encounter hazardous situations in their occupation. One plausible way of offering assistance without risking additional human lives is by deploying a robot team, equipped with various sensors, alongside a firefighter. While {{it is difficult for}} humans to function well in a smoke filled, high temperature environment, there are sensors available which are designed to operate in such conditions. A robot team can potentially provide a number of services to improve <b>the</b> safety of <b>firefighters,</b> but knowing <b>the</b> <b>firefighter’s</b> location is essential for the team to coordinate these services. In our proposed system, range measurements from sensors mounted on robots will be used for firefighter position estimation. Using only range sensors introduces the challenge that the location of the robot team members with respect to <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> will affect <b>the</b> uncertainty of <b>the</b> <b>firefighter’s</b> location. This paper discusses a cooperative control algorithm to minimize the uncertainty in <b>the</b> location <b>the</b> <b>firefighter</b> by actively positioning a robot team with respect to <b>the</b> <b>firefighter’s</b> location.

5|$|The London Fire Engine Establishment (LFEE)—an {{organisation}} run {{by several}} insurance {{companies in the}} absence of a publicly run brigade—was alerted at about 7:00pm, by which time the fire had spread from the House of Lords. The head of the LFEE, James Braidwood, brought with him 12 engines and 64 firemen, even though the Palace of Westminster was a collection of uninsured government buildings, and therefore fell outside the protection of the LFEE. Some of <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> ran their hoses down to the Thames. The river was at low tide and it meant a poor supply of water for the engines on the river side of the building.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. <b>The</b> <b>firefighters</b> concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but is cut off by the ending credits.|$|E

5|$|On 13 October, the JNA mostly {{destroyed}} and abandoned its barracks at Oštarije, and a JNA weapons storage facility in Rijeka was damaged {{in a fire}} caused by a thunderstorm. The ZNG removed some weapons from the latter while <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> were called in to save individual storage structures. The next day, the JNA began moving the remaining weapons from the damaged storage to elsewhere in the city. While a convoy of 18 trucks was moving through Rijeka, 15 vehicles carrying weapons were diverted and captured by the ZNG. At the same time, personnel at the JNA's Borongaj barracks in Zagreb were allowed to evacuate in return for free passage of a convoy carrying humanitarian aid to Vukovar, where the battle to control the city was in progress.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day ETA claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> of Calvià, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>firefighters</b> built bashings, {{walls of}} sandbags, turf and sand, {{approximately}} 18feet (5.5metres) deep and 17feet (5.2metres) {{up to the}} tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling {{the rest of the}} workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of smoke was reduced. Although the fire was contained, miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped firedamp. The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris, while another fall was more than 300feet (91.5metres) long and 30 to 40feet (10–12metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November for the first of the 4 working districts to be explored and cleared of bodies. Many victims were unidentifiable—either the explosion, fire or subsequent decomposition had taken its toll—and many had to be identified by their personal effects, although some bodies remained unidentified.|$|E

5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of <b>the</b> <b>firefighters</b> wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts.

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>firefighter</b> {{problem is}} defined as follows. Initially, a fire breaks out at a vertex r of a graph G.
