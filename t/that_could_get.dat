5|$|Historian Ron Chernow is of {{the opinion}} that his frustrations in dealing with {{government}} officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> results; other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service. He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars. On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1,000 men and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations that he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton, and Philadelphia.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, {{one of his}} father's {{customers}} {{was attempting}} to modernize the snowshoe with experimental materials such as titanium. At the time, lacrosse sticks were made of aluminum <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> bent during the game. [...] Morrow was breaking and bending sticks at a rapid rate. [...] Morrow noticed titanium was lighter and more durable than aluminum. [...] Thus, at his father's suggestion, he incorporated it into the lacrosse stick the following year. [...] A year later, he began his own business, selling his first sticks in February 1993. In 1993, he was affiliated with the Philadelphia Wings but became a free agent. Morrow was selected for Team USA that would compete at the 1994 World Lacrosse Championship.

500|$|In 2009, Limp Bizkit {{reunited with}} Borland playing guitar and {{launched}} the Unicorns N' Rainbows Tour. Durst {{announced that they}} had begun to record a new album, which Borland titled Gold Cobra. Borland said that the title {{does not have any}} meaning, and that it was chosen because it fit the style of music the band was writing for the album. The band recorded a spoken intro written by Durst and performed by Kiss member Gene Simmons for the album, but it was left off the completed album. The band also recorded additional [...] "non-album" [...] tracks, including [...] "Combat Jazz", which featured rapper Raekwon and [...] "Middle Finger", featuring Paul Wall. [...] "Shotgun" [...] was released as a single on May 17, 2011. The song is noted for featuring a guitar solo by Borland, something that the band is not known for.

500|$|Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{commented that}} the [...] "menacing rhythm and chanted vocals" [...] on [...] "Diva", mark the album's biggest departure. Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times felt that the song was {{influenced}} by Beyoncé's husband, American rapper Jay-Z as it has a [...] "bad soft-core gangster rap". He also noted that its contains words <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> an [...] "explicit" [...] sticker by the chain stores. Similarly, Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix remarked that the song is [...] "particularly intriguing" [...] as it progresses through [...] "hard-knockish robbery scenarios" [...] which does not resemble Beyoncé's clean public image. Stacey Anderson of Spin magazine noted that [...] "Diva" [...] places a [...] "startling, sexy snarl over window-rattling bass". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted Beyoncé turns out [...] "modal-sounding hooks" [...] over 808 bass on the song. The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond described Sasha Fierce as [...] "suffer no such identity crisis, brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty...", reflected on [...] "Diva". James Reed of The Boston Globe described [...] "Diva" [...] as a [...] "glitchy, bass-heavy thumper with the most ridiculous chorus of the year". Reed nevertheless added that the song is [...] "insanely catchy, but then, when you hear something looped incessantly, no matter how mindless, it's bound to stick".|$|E
500|$|Although jams {{had always}} been an {{integral}} aspect of song creation for the Chili Peppers, Blood Sugar Sex Magik saw songs being created with more structure. One specific jam {{would lead to the}} breakout song on the album: Frusciante, Flea and Smith were all playing together—with Kiedis at another part of the room watching—when [...] "...Flea started playing this insane bass line, and Chad cracked up and played along... I always had fragments of song ideas or even specific isolated phrases in my mind. I (Kiedis) took the mic and belted out 'Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now." [...] The philosophy behind the lyrics originated from a conversation Kiedis had with Nina Hagen, regarding selflessness and how insignificant material possessions were in his life. It, thus, gave birth to the song [...] "Give It Away." [...] He'd also been reminiscing about late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, composing [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] in his tribute. Kiedis wrote [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] to be an over-zealous and overly exaggerated version of himself; a figure <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> any woman, and do anything he pleased to them. [...] "The Power of Equality" [...] confronted topics concerning racial equality, prejudice and sexism. Kiedis wrote [...] "I Could Have Lied" [...] to document the brief relationship he had with Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor.|$|E
500|$|Although Washington never {{gained the}} {{commission}} in the British army he yearned for, {{in these years}} the young man gained valuable military, political, and leadership skills, and received significant public exposure in the colonies and abroad. [...] He closely observed British military tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution. He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats. He developed a command presence—given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question. Washington gained connections because of his popularity, which would serve him well later in the Revolution. His involvement in the war, given the circumstances, was just {{enough for him to}} be able to craft his own idea of what a leader looked like. Washington learned to organize, train, and drill, and discipline his companies and regiments. From his observations, readings and conversations with professional officers, he learned the basics of battlefield tactics, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics. [...] Historian Ron Chernow is of the opinion that his frustrations in dealing with government officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> results; other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service. [...] His dealings also gave him the diplomatic skills necessary to negotiate with officials at the local and provincial levels. [...] He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars. On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of about 1,000 men, and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations he faced during the revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton and Philadelphia.|$|E

Construction of the highway began by the Roads Department of the Ministry of Communications, {{with the help of the}} military engineering battalion. It was planned to be built parallel along the railway line, as much as possible. The construction of the new port was also aimed to break another UFCO monopoly: Puerto Barrios was owned and operated solely by The Great White Fleet, another UFCO's subsidiary.|$|E

The Mark VIII cartridge had a maximum range of approximately [...] Mk VIII ammunition was described as being for [...] "All suitably-sighted [...]303-inch small arms and machine guns" [...] but caused significant bore erosion in weapons formerly using Mk VII cordite, ascribed to the channelling effect of the boat-tail projectile. As a result, it was prohibited from general use with rifles and light machine guns except in emergency.

2500|$|Two related {{theories}} {{are based on}} military development and warfare, and the role that these forces played in state formation. Charles Tilly developed an argument that the state developed {{largely as a result}} of [...] "state-makers" [...] who sought to increase the taxes they could gain from the people under their control so they could continue fighting wars. According to Tilly, the state makes war and war makes states. In the constant warfare of the centuries in Europe, coupled with expanded costs of war with mass armies and gunpowder, warlords had to find ways to finance war [...] and control territory more effectively. The modern state presented the opportunity for them to develop taxation structures, the coercive structure to implement that taxation, and finally the guarantee of protection from other states <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> much of the population to agree. Taxes and revenue raising have been repeatedly pointed out as a key aspect of state formation and the development of state capacity. Economist Nicholas Kaldor emphasized on the importance of revenue raising and warned about the dangers of the dependence on foreign aid. Tilly argues, state making is similar to organized crime because it is a [...] "quintessential protection racket with the advantage of legitimacy." ...|$|E

2500|$|More {{orders were}} {{received}} at 3pm {{to move to}} Varesnes on the south bank of the River Oise but whilst en-route they were countermanded with surprise orders to counter attack and retake a village called Babouef. Therefore, the war worn Brigade who had been fighting and marching for four punishing days solid were about faced and moved off to the attack with an enthusiasm that {{is nothing short of}} incredible. By rights, the Brigade should have been incapable of the action yet those quoted as being there remark that it was the most memorable event of the entire rearguard action. At 5pm, with the Fusiliers on the right, the Bedfords on the left and the Northamptons in reserve, the Brigade formed up with the Babouef to Compeigne road on their right and the southern edge of the woods above Babouef to their left. The Germans had not expected a British counter attack, thinking there was nothing but ragged French units in their area, so were surprised at the arrival of three small but determined British battalions. They put little fight up and many Germans fell in the hand to hand fighting that lasted for around [...] before the village was secured and the remaining enemy – <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> away – fled. Ten machine guns and [...] prisoners were taken with very light casualties recorded by the Brigade; an incredible feat whatever way you view it. They dug in on the German side of the village amongst the cornfields and settled in for the night.
