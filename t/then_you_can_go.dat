500|$|The {{gameplay}} generally received {{praise from}} reviewers, with some caveats. While IGN's Steve Butts [...] "loved" [...] the game's new units and operations, he complained of a predictability in the missions, {{asking for more}} surprises. GameSpot's Jason Ocampo agreed, noting that the [...] "campaigns feature familiar plot twists", while praising the [...] "new twists" [...] on the Age of Empires series-style gameplay.

5000|$|The three criticise {{the sheer}} {{amount of money}} people have to spend just to play golf, and they claimed that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> invest less money in car racing, or in this case, rallycross. To prove this, each of the presenters must find a cheap, race-worthy car and modify it {{so it can be}} race-ready. Clarkson bought a BMW 328i, Hammond bought a Citroen Saxo 1.6 VTS, and May bought a Toyota MR2. Hammond was the most {{successful}} of the three, finishing third in two heats and coming second in the final, ahead of Clarkson. Meanwhile, May was the least successful, finishing last in two heats and third in the [...] "loser's final".

Knowing where the cataract was, {{they were able to}} calculate pretty accurately where they had best dismount. This they did in a small clump of trees.

He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesnât know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, âI donât know how to start this shit,â and Iâm counting him in [...] One, two, three. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear him <b>go,</b> âYo,â and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didnât know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. Iâm actually yelling, âWeâre recording!â and banging on the [...] window. âCome on, get ready!â You hear him start the shit: Rappersâ¦. And then everyone in the studio was like, âOh, my Godâ, âcause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, this guy is gonna be big.'" ...|$|R

On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>go</b> home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. Heâs very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesnât hide his emotions. Heâs honest. Heâs a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|R

The film {{appears to be on}} the lines of Ravi Teja"s earlier hits like Anjaneyulu, Vikramarkudu and Don Seenu. The audiences could enjoy the film in a festival mood and relax without cursing the hero or the director." [...] Sify.com gave a review stating [...] "Despite a banal storyline, the film has entertainment value, punch and a decent presentation. The director purely depends on the energy levels of Ravi Teja and the comedy angle. Ravi Teja proves that he can hold the audience purely with his high-energy levels in action, comedy and romance scenes. He is the life and blood of the movie. You can't go wrong with a title as racy as Mirapakay. And fortunately, this Ravi Teja starrer comes as a pucca mass entertainer for Sankranthi." [...] Supergoodmovies.com gave a review stating [...] "If you have no complaints to watch an entertaining film even though it is a routine fare, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> happily <b>go</b> for Mirapakay. On content wise this Mirapakaya isnât spicy." [...] telugucinema.com gave a review stating [...] "If you are not tired of seeing Ravi Teja doing same role again and again, showing off same histrionics without much variation, then Mirapakay may seem time-pass one. For others, it looks tepid and boring." [...] chitramala.in gave a review stating [...] "A middle aged married man was once talking to me about âAnjaneyuluâ and I tried my best to keep him away from the film and then he says [...] "Ravi Tejaâs film has a minimum guarantee, thereâll be jokes, there are fun songs and thereâs Ravi Teja.

It's a Ravi Teja movie and he never disappoints a fan who is in search of some good old fun. And whats more it is festival time and a few laughs will definitely do you a world of good." [...] telugu.way2movies.com gave a review stating [...] "Ravi Teja is the only aspect to watch Mirapakaay, It doesnât offer anything new, a simple Police catching thief, How? Is the story. Mirapakaay have lots of action mixed comedy as we find in all recent movies of Ravi Teja. Watch it for Ravi Teja." [...] idlebrain.com gave a review stating [...] "It is a proven fact that Ravi Tejaâs movies have scant respect for story and screenplay and majorly depend on the entertainment aspect.
