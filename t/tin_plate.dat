5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert water into a leat to the Melingriffith <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory salmon and sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the U.S. Steel trust in 1901 threatened the AA with ruin. The trust incorporated plants of the American <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Co. into U.S Steel. If the AA was to save its existing locals at American <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> and American Sheet Steel, it had to organize all the plants of U.S. Steel. But before an organizing drive could get under way, U.S. Steel's <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> subsidiary withdrew recognition from the AA and refused to bargain at unionized plants. The independent American Sheet Steel did the same.|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{formalin}} on <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> in acidic <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> bath {{were studied}} through {{measurements of the}} differential capacity. The addition of 0. 3 g/l benzalacetone and 5 ml/l formalin into the plating bath showed the finest brightening effect. By increasing the additional amount of formalin, the desorption potential on differential capacity-potential curves was shifted to possitive potential, and the potential range which indicated the adsorption was narrowed.

25|$|In the 1870s, {{the city}} {{became a major}} hub of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. New Castle's {{population}} swelled from 11,600 in 1890 to 28,339 in 1900, and to 38,280 in 1910, as immigrants, particularly from Italy, flocked {{to the city to}} work in the mills and nearby limestone quarries. Italian laborers of the era were frequent victims of the Black Hand society, which employed blackmail and extortion to rob the workers of their pay. In 1907 the headquarters of the Black Hand for the entire region was discovered in the village of Hillsville a few miles west of New Castle. By this time New Castle was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, and with the construction of the largest <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> mill in America, the city became the <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> capital of the world. The <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> industry marked a new increase in the city's prosperity.|$|E

25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began {{organizing}} unskilled {{iron and}} steel workers into federal unions in 1901. Local groups of wire drawers, house men, tube workers, blast furnace men and others had all formed unions. The Federal Association of Wire Drawers was chartered in 1896, the <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Workers' Protective Association in 1899, the International Association of Blast Furnace Workers in 1901, and the International Association of Tube Workers in 1902. Most internationals disbanded after a short time, but many local federal unions became deeply entrenched in the workplace.|$|E
50|$|While it was {{the growth}} of the iron {{foundries}} and <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> that gave birth to japanning on metal, <b>tin</b> <b>plated</b> iron was not the only metal used. There are examples of brass, copper and bronze used as substrates. In France copper was the metal primarily used. Because it had to be hammered into shape rather than rolled and stamped the surface was uneven. This did not provide the best surface for japanning thus it has a greater tendency to flake off than the smoother English tinware. When the French made tinware it was often trimmed with bronze.|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{emphasis}} on play value, the scale of pre-World War II O gauge trains varied. The Märklin specifications called for 1:43.5 scale. However, many designs were 1:48 scale or 1:64 scale. Early Marx Trains and entry-level trains, usually made of lithographed <b>tin</b> <b>plate,</b> were not scaled at all, made to whimsical proportions about the same length of an HO scale ("half O") piece, but about the same width and height of an O scale piece. Yet all of these designs ran on the same track, and, depending on the manufacturer(s) of the cars, could sometimes be coupled together and run {{as part of the}} same train.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} in America, Grimshaw had {{developed}} pro-Confederacy tendencies. In general, there was some support for the Confederacy among people who were affected by the shortage in cotton from America caused by the American Civil War, such as traders and mill-owners. On a personal level, Grimshaw was opposed {{to the growth of}} capitalism in the United States and described the notions of American freedom and liberty as [...] "farce and humbug". In 1862 he became part {{of a small group of}} working-class Lancashire men, all of whom had been involved in various strikes in the 1850s, assembled by Liverpool-based <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> merchant James Spence. The group held meetings with the intention of rallying support for the Confederates within northern England, particularly in Lancashire and Cheshire. However, when a vote regarding the support of British mediation in America was taken at one meeting in Blackburn, only 12 out of more than 4,000 workers voted in favour of Grimshaw. The local Weavers' Association consequently declared themselves in favour of Abraham Lincoln and his Union. Ultimately, the group's efforts were handicapped by an inability to maintain activity throughout the duration of the Civil War; by 1864 only two of the original company remained.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by James Dooley, Bryan [...] "Brain" [...] Mantia, the New Orleans band Galactic, and Jonathan Mayer. All {{of the music}} was recorded live {{with a total of}} four hours of music being recorded. Starting from the first day of recording, the music was composed in a year. Many of the music's sounds were produced unconventionally, with some of the largest percussion coming from things such as fingernails on an amplified <b>tin</b> <b>plate.</b> Collaboration was considered a major part of writing the music, with the composers [...] "ripping each other off." [...] Themes were composed for the main characters, such as Cole and Nix. A dynamic music system was developed for non-mission gameplay. The game would track a music tension value with thresholds set to determine what the music would be. While missions used the dynamic music system too, the music was laid out more like a movie with set music occurring for specific events. The music of the game was inspired by the city, meant to be [...] "organic" [...] compared to the industrial and electronic music of the first Infamous. The score was released as two soundtracks, Infamous 2 The Blue Soundtrack and Infamous 2 The Red Soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Bellingham {{was born}} in about 1770, in the county of Huntingdonshire. His father, also named John, was a land agent and miniaturist painter; his mother Elizabeth was from a well-to-do Huntingdonshire family. In 1779 John senior became mentally ill, and, after {{confinement}} in an asylum, died in 1780 or 1781. The family [...] were then provided for by William Daw, Elizabeth's brother-in-law, a prosperous lawyer who arranged Bellingham's appointment as an officer cadet on board the East India Company's ship Hartwell. En route to India the [...] ship mutinied and was wrecked of {{the coast of the}} Cape Verde islands; Bellingham survived and returned home. [...] Daw then helped him to set up in business as a <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> manufacturer in London, but after a few years the business failed, and Bellingham was made bankrupt in 1794. He appears to have escaped debtors' prison, perhaps through the further intervention of Daw. Chastened by this experience, he decided to settle down, and obtained a post as a book-keeper with a firm engaged in trade with Russia. He worked hard, and was sufficiently regarded by his employers to be appointed in 1800 as the firm's resident representative in Archangel, Russia. On his return home, Bellingham set up his own trading business, and moved to Liverpool. In 1803 he married Mary Neville from Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|But the AA seriously misjudged {{both the}} {{economics}} {{and the technology}} underlying the tin industry. [...] The formation of the American <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Company, a monopoly trust, on December 14, 1898, brought a number of nonunion plants into the union facilities of the American Tinplate Company. Daniel G. Reid, primary owner of the <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> trust, agreed to recognize the AA at the nonunion plants after a token strike in 1899. The formation in March 1900 of the American Sheet Steel Company, another trust, also brought a number of nonunion plants together with unionized facilities. But this time the company refused to recognize the AA in the nonunion plants. Instead, the American Sheet Steel Co. idled its union facilities while keeping its nonunion works running at full speed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{formation}} of the U.S. Steel trust in 1901 threatened the AA with ruin. U.S. Steel not only combined Elbert Gary and J.P. Morgan's Federal Steel with Andrew Carnegie's steel operations, it also incorporated the plants of the American <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Co. The AA was confronted with a crisis: It had to organize the plants of U.S. Steel before the corporation, with its relatively infinite resources, could stop the union drives. But the executive committee of U.S. Steel was equally aware of the threat the AA posed, and the company's board of directors secretly adopted a resolution on June 17, 1901, opposing any unionization attempt. [...] U.S. Steel's <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> subsidiary reneged on promises to recognize the AA {{on the grounds that}} the union had not won contracts at every plant owned by the American Sheet Steel Co. [...] Sheet Steel executives, meanwhile, not only refused to recognize the union at its nonunion plants but also began withdrawing recognition and refusing to bargain at its unionized plants.|$|E

Examples of several significant failures are readily available that demonstrate implications for space systems and space control systems.
