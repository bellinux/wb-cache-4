5|$|After {{the success}} of Platoon (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to {{research}} and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in Crime and Punishment. The director had been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> kind of a movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.|$|E

25|$|Plato's philosopher, {{in search}} of the real and the true, must turn away from this {{transitory}} realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper's painting is positioned between the lure of the earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the melancholic.|$|E

500|$|When {{the games}} are {{broadcast}} on Fox, Joe Buck and Tim McCarver call the game and, thus the duo has called many significant moments in the rivalry. In 2004, {{the first game of}} the season between the two teams, on April 16, a Friday night, was nationally broadcast on Fox, because it marked the first time the two teams were facing each other since the memorable 2003 ALCS. Fox Sports President Ed Goren said of decision to have the game broadcast on Fox: [...] "If were up to me, we'd take the whole series and come back a week later and carry all their games at Yankee Stadium...We started <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> at some point after the Yankees closed the deal with A-Rod. ... This is sort of a relaunch of the season in the middle of April. This is going to be an event." [...] MLB Commissioner Bud Selig called the broadcast [...] "an extension of the postseason brought into April." [...] This was the first broadcast of a regular season game in prime-time since Mark McGwire hit his 62nd home run to break Roger Maris' record in 1998. In October, when the two teams met in the ALCS, Selig moved Game 5 of the series to primetime due to the rematch.|$|E
500|$|At the lighthouse, Mr. Briscoe {{decides to}} brave the storm in a landing craft, but is {{immediately}} swamped {{with water and}} carried by the tide towards the mainland. After Castro avails himself of {{the services of a}} prostitute, he rampages around the property searching for Picasso. The storm crashes through the inn. A guest is killed by a billiards table that falls on top of him and is dragged off into the sea. Mr. Glowery is also dragged off into the sea by the storm. Castro and his assistant round up the guests and interrogate them about the location of the $1.5 million Picasso stole. In another part of the inn a fire starts. Finally, Mr. Briscoe shows up and kills Castro's assistant before knocking Castro unconscious. While Hawthorne learns his wife is leaving him for the prostitute, the inn becomes completely engulfed in flames. Picasso, Hawthorne, and Briscoe motor a lobster boat over to the lighthouse, and dump Castro's dead assistant into the sea along with Castro himself, weighed down with two cinder blocks chained to his ankles. When they land on the island, Briscoe runs into the lighthouse and blows himself up. Amongst the rubble of the lighthouse, Picasso notices the inscription [...] "MORTE D'AUTHOR" [...] painted on one of the surrounding rocks and says to the innkeeper [...] "He's been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> for some time, George." ...|$|E

The poet asks the Tágides (nymphs of the river Tagus) to give him [...] "a high and sublime sound,/ a grandiloquent and flowing style" [...] ("um som alto e sublimado, / Um estilo grandíloquo e corrente").

50|$|Furthermore, {{adolescence}} {{is characterized by}} a series of changes in the biological, cognitive, and social realms. In the cognitive area, {{it is worth noting that}} the brain's prefrontal cortex as well as the limbic system undergoes important changes. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is active when engaged in complicated cognitive activities such as planning, generating goals and strategies, intuitive decision-making, and metacognition (<b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>thinking).</b> <b>This</b> is consistent with Piaget's last stage of formal operations (McLeod, 2010). The prefrontal cortex becomes complete between adolescence and early adulthood. The limbic system is the part of the brain that modulates reward sensitivity based on changes in the levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine) and emotions.|$|R

2500|$|Hughes {{was accused}} of being a Communist by many on the {{political}} right, but he always denied it. When asked why he never joined the Communist Party, he wrote, [...] "it was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept." [...] In 1953, he was called before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He stated, [...] "I never read the theoretical books of socialism or communism or the Democratic or Republican parties for that matter, and so my interest in whatever may be considered political has been non-theoretical, non-sectarian, and largely emotional and born out of my own need to find some way of <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> whole problem of myself." [...] Following his testimony, Hughes distanced himself from Communism. He was rebuked by some on the Radical Left who had previously supported him. He moved away from overtly political poems and towards more lyric subjects. When selecting his poetry for his Selected Poems (1959) he excluded all his radical socialist verse from the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{assume that}} S and S are Riemann surfaces, {{and that the}} map π is complex analytic. [...] The map π {{is said to be}} {{ramified}} at a point P in S if there exist analytic coordinates near P and π(P) such that π takes the form π(z) = z'n, and n>1. [...] An equivalent way of <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> is that there exists a small neighborhood U of P such that π(P) has exactly one preimage in U, but the image of any other point in U has exactly n preimages in U. [...] The number n is called the ramification index at P and also denoted by e'P. [...] In calculating the Euler characteristic of S we notice the loss of eP1 copies of P above π(P) (that is, in the inverse image of π(P)). Now let us choose triangulations of S and S with vertices at the branch and ramification points, respectively, and use these to compute the Euler characteristics. Then S will have the same number of d-dimensional faces for d different from zero, but fewer than expected vertices. Therefore we find a [...] "corrected" [...] formula ...|$|E
