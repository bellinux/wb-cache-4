5|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} {{to place the}} work within a particular genre. MTV compared the song's style to the group Devo and new wave music. El País described <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> as an electropop song {{that contributed to the}} viral spread of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. Dose described it as an electro jam session which made adept use of sampling from the audio of Bale's rhetoric. The Los Angeles Times called <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today called the song fun dance music and creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun praised its original lyrics and use of audio from the incident, and described <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> as a fusion of electro-pop styles and a good song for dancing. New Musical Express recommended <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> and described it as electro-rock which astutely sampled Bale throughout the song. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> as a form of new wave music which used the most spasmodic segments of the incident, and commented that the end product was comedic. The Arizona Daily Star described <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> as a pop music dance song.|$|E

The second movement modulates from A minor to F major, while the fourth movement mirrors this motion.|$|E

5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses at the start of <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the mood of the music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, the triumph of the hero is represented by the victorious coda. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song was Dvořák's last orchestral {{work and}} the final of his five symphonic poems, the others being The Water Goblin, The Noon Witch, The Golden Spinning Wheel, and The Wild Dove (Opp. 107–110). It is also the last {{instance}} of him writing purely instrumental music, as he dedicated himself to vocal and operatic works after its completion. He began working on <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> on August 4, 1897, immediately after revising the third act of his opera The Jacobin. The work was completed in three months, during which time Dvořák lived at his summer residence {{in his hometown of}} Příbram, and spent time at his chateau of the patron Josef Hlávka in Lužany. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> was completed on October 25 of the same year, and was published in 1899 by Fritz Simrock in Berlin. The symphonic poem coincidentally anticipated Richard Strauss's similar tone poem Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life), which was composed a year later. In fact, Dvořák originally intended to title <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> A Hero's Life, a name which had been suggested to him by his pupil Vítězslav Novák.|$|E

5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
