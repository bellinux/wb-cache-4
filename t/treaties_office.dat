40|$|Understanding Conceptions of Land Tenure in the Lake Babine Nation {{is about}} {{evolving}} {{values and the}} leaders who navigate them. The traditional territory of the Lake Babine Nation (LBN) is situated on Babine Lake, east of Smithers and north of Burns Lake - a community adjacent to the Lake Babine Nation's largest community by population. Ownership and stewardship {{of land in the}} LBN has been rapidly evolving since the imposition of the Indian Act and other government legislation in the early 20 th century, forcing the Babine to adapt their social and land management techniques. With the prospect of self-governance on the horizon and pressure from the Federal and Provincial governments to adopt a system of land tenure based on private property, the LBN is at a crossroads. In this work, leaders from Chief and Council, the LBN <b>Treaty</b> <b>Office,</b> and the Hereditary Chiefs, expressed their vision for the management of the traditional territories, including traditional and western forms of ownership and stewardship, with an emphasis on collective responsibility. This work is designed to facilitate a discussion about the fundamental land values of the LBN and how they can be represented in the governance structure of a self-governing nation. [...] Leaf ii.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the Earth’s crust at oceanic volcanic islands is of interest for the information it provides both about the processes involved {{in the formation of}} these islands and about the rheology of the underlying oceanic lithosphere, which deforms in response to the island load. Since some of the acoustic energy from large underwater explosions is commonly coupled into the oceanic sound channel as socalled “T-phases”, hydrophones around several such islands and broad-band seismic stations on the islands are being used for monitoring of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Cruise JR 42 involved a four-day seismic experiment around the island of Ascension, a 4 -km-high volcano some 90 km west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. During the experiment, a 6186 cu. in. airgun array was fired at one-minute intervals for about two days along a series of lines extending up to 45 km from the coast of the island. These shots were received by hydrophones and sonobuoys offshore and seismometers onshore. The shots were used to locate and calibrate three permanently installed hydrophones, to study the coupling of seismic energy into the island slope, and to study the {{structure of}} the crust beneath the island. The experiment was funded by the US Department of Energy (through Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)), the US Office of Naval Research, the UK Natural Environment Research Council, the United Nations (through the Comprehensive Test Ban <b>Treaty</b> <b>Office</b> in Vienna), IFREMER’s Centre de Brest, and funds held at the University of Southampton by T. A. Minshull. On the passage from Montevideo to Ascension Island, an unrelated scientific party conducted oceanographic measurements as part of the “Atlantic Meridional Transect”...|$|R
40|$|A {{revolution}} {{took place}} in Sliammon, BC, between the late 1800 s and 1970 s. As with colonialism elsewhere in Canada, this included changes in Indigenous religion, health, governance, and every other mechanism of life, including architecture. By the 1970 s, the Tla’amin, who were once longhouse people, came to live in two-level former military base houses from Ladner, BC. Using oral history holdings at the former Sliammon <b>Treaty</b> <b>Office</b> and personal interviews, the impact that changes in housing architecture had on individual, family, community life and relationships to environmental territories, is reviewed. Tla’amin housing is first seen as a site for displaying personal power and territory, both physically and metaphorically in stories. Through decades of housing architecture changes, including a transition to single-family dwellings and then to segregated spaces, including bedrooms, consequent shifts in power and authority impeded the ability to pass on cultural knowledge through intergenerational sharing, which once happened in open spaces within the longhouse or one-room shack. Additionally, residential school attendance disrupted family relationships and transformed how Tla’amin young people carried out coming of age ceremonies. Throughout these challenges, Tla’amin people used strategies to maintain cultural continuity and Indigenous knowledge, including emphasizing accessible ceremonies, enforcing intergenerational relationships, ensuring strong connections to their territories and natural environments both through travel and symbolism, and encouraging youth to maintain knowledge that {{could be found in}} the environments and within themselves. This dissertation examines the Tla’amin relationship to created and naturalspaces, developing a deeper understanding of human–architecture and human-land relationships. Additionally, it demonstrates historical approaches to Indigenous education. The Tla’amin have their own residential school stories, and this dissertation reveals some of them, and the impact these particular experiences had on the community. Oral history is extensively use...|$|R

Refusal to swear a lawful oath (sacramentum) and breaking a sworn oath carried much the same penalty: both repudiated the fundamental bonds between the human and divine.
