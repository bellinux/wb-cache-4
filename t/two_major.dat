5|$|A {{modicum of}} peace was {{eventually}} established, {{leading to the}} National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the <b>two</b> <b>major</b> leagues and {{between them and the}} National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the <b>two</b> <b>major</b> league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Double {{majors and}} double degrees== Double degrees {{should not be}} {{confused}} with double major, or with the occasional practice of awarding a further qualification with a worked-for (especially research) degree, nor with the awarding of a single degree by multiple institutions. Double majors or dual <b>majors</b> consist of <b>two</b> <b>majors</b> attached to a single degree, as opposed to two separate degrees each with its own field of study. In some schools, students will earn a double <b>major</b> when the <b>two</b> <b>majors</b> lead to the same degree name (such as: B.A., B.S., B.F.A.) and they will earn a double degree when the <b>two</b> <b>majors</b> lead to differently-named degrees (such as: B.A. and B.M., B.S. and B.F.A.). In general, the number of hours and required courses are more in a dual-degree program than a double major.|$|R
