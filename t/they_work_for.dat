When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E
5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers <b>they</b> <b>work</b> <b>for.</b> Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} marketed as an {{important}} milestone in television history {{because it was the}} debut of the first television show with an all Latina leading cast. However, {{in the days leading up}} to the debut, there was controversy surrounding the concept of having Latina actresses glorify the stereotypical roles of maids, nannies and gardeners. On May 3, Tanisha Ramirez criticized the show in The Huffington Post as a wasted opportunity, but executive producer Longoria countered that the show presents [...] "modern day woman's view on universal themes." [...] Cosmopolitan for Latinas editor Michelle Herrera Mulligan responded to Longoria by calling the show an [...] "insulting disgrace". Cherry defended the show for its substantive themes: [...] "Devious Maids deals with themes of racism, classism and immigration. These women all work in the homes of rich people, but they have goals and dreams that are much greater than the people <b>they</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> realize." ...|$|E

500|$|Krabs values money {{more than}} his own {{well-being}} and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff {{is so strong that}} it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because <b>they</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if he gets in trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that [...] "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter how Mr. Krabs treats him. I try to replicate that in my own life in every way." ...|$|E
500|$|Bain Capital's {{leveraged}} buyouts sometimes led to layoffs, either {{soon after}} acquisition or later after {{the firm had}} concluded its role. Exactly how many jobs Bain Capital added compared to those lost because of these investments and buyouts is unknown, owing {{to a lack of}} records and Bain Capital's penchant for privacy on behalf of itself and its investors. Maximizing the value of acquired companies and the return to Bain's investors, not job creation, was the firm's primary investment goal. Bain Capital's acquisition of Ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and management fees, even though the subject company itself later went into bankruptcy. Dade Behring was another case where Bain Capital received an eightfold return on its investment, but the company itself was saddled with debt and laid off over a thousand employees before Bain Capital exited (the company subsequently went into bankruptcy, with more layoffs, before recovering and prospering). Referring to the layoffs that sometimes occurred, Romney said in 2007: [...] "Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary {{to save the life of}} the patient. My job was to try and make the enterprise successful, and in my view the best security a family can have is that the business <b>they</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> is strong." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the Memorial {{described}} suggestions for the social and political organization of Indian communities relative to colonial ones. Las Casas advocated the dismantlement of the city of Asunción and the subsequent gathering of Indians into communities of about 1,000 Indians to be situated as satellites of Spanish towns or mining areas. Here, Las Casas argued, Indians could be better governed, better taught and indoctrinated in the Christian faith, and would be easier to protect from abuse than if they were in scattered settlements. Each town would have a royal hospital built with four wings {{in the shape of a}} cross, where up to 200 sick Indians could be cared for at a time. He described in detail social arrangements, distribution of work, how provisions would be divided and even how table manners were to be introduced. Regarding expenses, he argued that [...] "this should not seem expensive or difficult, because after all, everything comes from them [...] and <b>they</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> it and it is theirs." [...] He even drew up a budget of each pueblo's expenses to cover wages for administrators, clerics, Bachelors of Latin, doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, advocates, ranchers, miners, muleteers, hospitalers, pig herders, fishermen, etc. He showed that this arrangement could easily be maintained and gold still be extracted at a profit.|$|E

2500|$|B {{specifically}} {{looks at}} tribal {{law as a}} basis for law in the future.

[...] Instead, he argues that the laws and customs that arise from each tribe are sustainable and “right” in their own way because <b>they</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the tribe. Tribal societies offer a tested-true way for people to live and work today as well as they ever did.|$|E
