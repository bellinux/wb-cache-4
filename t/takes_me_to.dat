He spent time in Bhopal with the people, to listen to their stories. In a later radio interview in February 2010 Rollins summed up his approach to activism, [...] "This is where my anger <b>takes</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> places like this, not into abuse but into proactive, clean movement." ...|$|E
500|$|In Charlotte, Benjamin {{stayed in}} the home of a Jewish {{merchant}} as surrender negotiations dragged. [...] Here, Benjamin abandoned Davis's plan to fight on, telling him and the Cabinet that the cause was hopeless. [...] When negotiations failed, Benjamin was part of the shrunken remnant of associates that moved on with Davis. The party reached Abbeville, South Carolina on May 2, and Benjamin told Davis that he wanted to separate from the presidential party temporarily, and go to the Bahamas to be able to send instructions to foreign agents before rejoining Davis in Texas. According to historian William C. Davis, [...] "the pragmatic Secretary of State almost certainly never had any intention of returning to the South once gone". When he bade John Reagan goodbye, the postmaster general asked where Benjamin was going. [...] "To the farthest place from the United States, if it <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the middle of China." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Reed of Paste Magazine {{called it}} [...] "a driving pop anthem that moves from a punchy, 'Roxanne'-esque new-wave groove to a soulful, synth-driven chorus." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters further {{explained}} the track, writing, [...] "It starts out like an early Police single, with some straight-up Reggatta de Blanc syncopation and a shockingly good Sting vocal impression. But the chorus opens up {{to turn into}} something less Police-y and more, dare I say it, Bruno Mars-y." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that the song [...] "channels the Police, but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson. It's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels." [...] Jason Lipshut of Billboard gave a very positive review, stating that [...] "'Locked out of Heaven' is Mars' best solo single to date, with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act. Sometimes, the perfect lead single is hard to find; other times, it walks right {{up to you and}} delivers a big, cozy hug." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix praised [...] "Mars' singing and the catchy little background vocals," [...] which according to her, [...] "keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace." [...] She also noted that [...] "Even clumsy lyrics like 'your sex <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> paradise' can’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring." ...|$|E

500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie. It {{was written in}} the key of D minor, with Mars's vocals range from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that is so good that he repeats to his love [...] "Your sex <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I just stay here, {{spend the rest of my}} days here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in your water is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "took me to a Leafs game" [...] {{was used}} as a {{euphemism}} for an attempted male-on-male sexual encounter. The gag originated in a sketch in which Scott Thompson played a homophobic man who took offense at another man's (McKinney) attempt to seduce him by taking him to a Maple Leafs game: [...] "Every time I come to this city, some guy picks me up at the bus station, <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a Leaf game, gets me pissed, then tries to blow me. Why can't people like me for me?" ...|$|E

She also stated [...] "The album is almost like a diary I have been keeping over the last two years", [...] "Every track has a meaning behind it that's personal to me. I have been looking forward to this day {{for a long time and}} I just hope that everyone likes the music as much as I loved making it".|$|E

2500|$|During the 1983 season, Boros gained {{note for}} his {{pioneering}} use of [...] "sabermetrics" [...] {{and a computer}} to help guide his managerial decisions. In his book on baseball innovations, historian Peter Morris wrote that Boros was [...] "the first manager to make extensive use of computers in his decision-making process." [...] After every game, Boros had pitch-by-pitch data fed into a mainframe computer at Digital Equipment Corporation in Philadelphia. He would retrieve the data before the next game, analyzing how each pitcher and hitter matched up. Jay Alves, a [...] "sabermetrician" [...] hired by Boros to run the computer system, later recalled: [...] "With Steve, we tracked (on paper) virtually every pitch and where it was hit. Then I'd type it into the computer after the game, but that would {{take a couple of}} hours. That's how long it <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do it with pencil and paper." ...|$|E

For the Lions' 1937 Thanksgiving Day {{game against the}} Bears, the team held a [...] "Dutch Clark Day". Before a capacity crowd of 26,000, the Lions presented Clark with an automobile, and his wife received a platinum wrist watch set with diamonds. After the game, a punishing loss, Clark announced his retirement as a player, saying: [...] "I'm too old. Look how long it <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get undressed." [...] Tod Rockwell of the Detroit Free Press wrote that, as Clark announced his retirement, he was [...] "bruised from head to foot", his left hand was [...] "swollen double its normal size", there were [...] "welts on his legs, a lump over one eye, and a belt on the mouth had split open his lips in several places." ...|$|E
