30|$|Interactions among {{resource}} agents, workflow agents, order {{agents and}} collaborative scheduling agents are through a mechanism that extends the well-known contract net protocol originally proposed by Smith (1980) by {{taking into account}} the dependency between workflows in supply chains. In contract net protocol, there are two roles an agent can play: manager or bidder. Four stages are involved to establish a contract between a manager and one or more bidders: (1) call for proposals (CFP): The manager announces a task to all potential bidders. The announcement contains the description of the task. (2) Submission of proposals: On receiving the <b>tender</b> <b>announcement,</b> bidders capable of performing the task draw up proposals and submit them to the manager. (3) Awarding of contract: On receiving and evaluating the submitted proposals, the manager awards the contract to the best bidder. (4) Establishment of contract: The awarded bidder may either commit itself to carry out the task or refuse to accept the contract by sending messages to the manager. For the latter case, the manager will reevaluate the bids and award the contract(s) to another bidder(s).|$|E
40|$|In 2004 the {{competitive}} dialogue (CD) {{was introduced by}} the European Parliament and the Council. It was presented as a public sector procurement procedure for particularly complex contracts. The purpose of CD is to provide the public client with a flexible procedure to enable a discussion concerning {{all aspects of the}} contract with several contenders - to identify and define the means best suited to meeting its objectives - in an intervening stage between the <b>tender</b> <b>announcement</b> and the submission of final tenders. The discussions during the drafting of the CD procedure pivoted around transparent trust based collaboration, preserving fair competition and providing stimulus for innovation. This paper presents the first results of an evaluation study of 15 CD projects (partly still ongoing) in the realm of construction. The findings indicate that clients as well as contenders struggle with a number of practical issues related to the organisation of the dialogue. Furthermore, both struggle with the dynamics of risk avoidance pushing them towards detailing and high transaction costs. The research indicates that {{the competitive}} dialogue is an ambivalent procedure: both parties involved in the procedure balance between the wish to cooperate and the sensed need of keeping information to themselves because of competition. Nevertheless both see the potential of the CD procedure. Further research is needed to find out how the two principles of cooperation and competition during the CD procedure are related...|$|E

I find that laws that prosecute insider trading fail to eliminate profits made by insiders, and make acquisitions more expensive.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we formalize the {{information}} acquisition process by a potential bidder {{and its relationship}} with the target firm's capital structure. We show that debt increases prior to an acquisition are negatively related to the precision of the bidder's information. Incumbent managers, by means of leverage, offset shareholders' losses derived from information acquisition about the firm's prospects by potential acquirors. This explanation for the use of capital structure to deter rivals for control complements the ones provided by the literature. We test our model with a sample of 739 U. S. targets of hostile tender offers, and show that informational variables (such as toehold size and nature of target and bidder industries) are significant determinants of the decision to adjust leverage. The paper shows that target firms display slightly higher debt levels than their industry peers, and that target firms significantly reduce leverage in the year prior to the <b>tender</b> offer <b>announcement.</b> The latter result indicates t...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{anomalous}} {{price behavior}} around repurchase tender offers. Buying shares before the expiration date of a repurchase tender offer and tendering {{to the firm}} produces, on average, abnormal returns of more than 9 percent over a period shorter than one week. In addition, we find that repurchasing companies experience economi-cally and statistically significant abnormal returns {{in the two years}} after the repurchase. The upward price drift is mainly caused by the behavior of the small firms in the sample. STOCKREPURCHASE TENDER OFFERS have been analyzed extensively by Dann (1981), Masulis (1980), Rosenfeld (1982), and Vermaelen (1981, 1984). These event studies focus on explaining the abnormal price increase around repurchase <b>tender</b> offer <b>announcements.</b> After testing for the relevance of (personal and corporate) tax savings and benefits arising from expropriation of creditors, Dann and Vermaelen conclude that the abnormal returns following the announcement are best explained by the information signalling hypothesis. Empirically, the signalling explanation seems to work well for relatively small firms. This is no...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Market Abuse Directive (MAD) in reducing the possible profits of insider trading during voluntary tender offers with the purpose of delisting initiated by controlling shareholders in Italy. Our results suggest that the introduction of the MAD did not produce appreciable effects on the magnitude of abnormal returns and volumes noted in the period preceding the <b>announcement</b> of a <b>tender</b> offer. However, a regression analysis reveals that the MAD has changed the manner in which certain corporate characteristics influence the capacity of insiders to achieve profits. In particular, in the post-MAD period, the market reaction to <b>tender</b> offer <b>announcements</b> tends to be greater for bigger firms. On the other hand, the effect of ownership concentration has become virtually null. We interpret the results in light of the economic problem of the potential insider who chooses the optimal level of insider trading by considering the marginal costs and benefits of the illegal activity...|$|R

40|$|Abnormally high net insider selling is {{commonly}} observed after repurchase <b>tender</b> offer (RTO) <b>announcements</b> although, on average, firms experience positive abnormal returns {{in the years}} after the repurchases. We explore two potential explanations: liquidity trade timing and informed trading. Consistent with the notion that fixed price RTOs are more likely than Dutch-auction RTOs to signal undervaluation, the results suggest that insider selling after fixed price RTO announcements are driven largely by insiders who time their trades with the repurchase announcements. In contrast, selling after Dutch-auction RTOs seems to be driven primarily by informed traders who exploit mispricing associated with the repurchase announcements.

40|$|Most of the {{theoretical}} literature on tender offers {{has been devoted to}} illustrating the positive effects of the toehold on the bidder's profits. Empirical research, however, shows that a high proportion of bidders do not trade on the target's shares prior to the <b>tender</b> offer <b>announcement.</b> This paper presents a model in which the bidder trades in the open market before announcing a tender offer and the incumbent shareholders form beliefs about the rival's quality given the order size. Market liquidity allows the potential bidder to partially hide her trade, and thus insiders are not able to ascertain whether an increase in volume indicates toehold acquisition. Stock price prior to the announcement date and market perception about the probability of a takeover are therefore contingent on players actions. We show that in some situations no trade will be optimal, and a negative relationship between takeover premium and toehold size arises. Interestingly, stock liquidity and initial stake are positively related. Our results also provide a theoretical basis for the observed pre-bid stock price dynamics. In particular, we show that the ratio between price runup and bid premium is increasing in the toehold size. The model's implications are then tested with a sample including tender offers in the US and the UK, estimating a bivariate generalization of the tobit model. We find a broad support for the model and significant differences across countries. We show that toeholds and probability of an acquisition are negatively related, and that companies in which the appropriation of private benefits of control is more...|$|R
40|$|Microstructure {{effects of}} tender offer {{acquisitions}} on targets and acquirers differentiated by listing venue and payment method are examined. Trading activity increases more for targets than for acquirers upon offer announcement. Investors {{are more likely}} to sell targets upon announcement using direct market orders against ask limit orders for cash payment offers. While target liquidity improves as spread costs fall and quoted depths increase, acquirer liquidity falls continuously to successful offer completion. Due to increased trading differences, temporary trade costs fall more for targets than for acquirers. Permanent trade costs decline over the tender offer cycle for both parties, and especially for targets for cash tender offers and for acquirers for shares tender offers. The probability of informed trading declines (remains constant) for targets (acquirers) because increased trading intensity is greater (the same) for uninformed versus informed traders. As expected, abnormal returns and changes in own-firm permanent return volatility are negatively (but weakly) and positively (and strongly) related, respectively, to changes in information asymmetry upon <b>announcement.</b> <b>Tender</b> offers, microstructure, trade behaviour, liquidity, informed trading, asymmetric information, volatility,...|$|R
