While conventional <b>troughed</b> <b>belt</b> conveyors have been used since the late 1800 's, a wide range of specialised belt conveyor systems have since been developed to meet the specific requirements of a diverse range of conveying applications. These requirements include; environmental limits and controls, topographical conditions, bulk material characteristics, and minimising energy intensity, to name but a few. The main characteristics of a number of specialised systems will be presented, highlighting the wide range of options currently available, in addition to their specific advantages and typical areas of application...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the energy {{management}} of belt conveyor systems (BCS) under various demandside management (DSM) programmes. The primary objective of this work is to model the energy consumption and energy related cost of operating <b>troughed</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor systems under different electricity pricing tariffs. This research is motivated by the increasing need for energy efficiency and energy cost reduction {{in the operation of}} BCS. This is as a result of technological improvements in BCS technology leading to increasingly longer belts being commissioned {{and as a result of}} rapidly rising electricity costs. An energy model derived from established industry standards is proposed for long conveyors. The newly proposed model uses a first-order partial differential equation (PDE) in order to capture the state of material on the belt. This new model describes the conveyor's power requirement using an equation with two parameters. A system identification set-up involving a recursive parameter estimating algorithm is simulated for measurements with varying degrees of noise. The results show that the proposed model estimates conveyor power and material delivered by long conveyors more accurately than the existing steady-state models. Downhill conveyors (DHCs) are important potential energy sources that can be tapped to improve the overall energy efficiency of BCSs. A generic optimisation model that is able to optimally schedule three configurations of BCS with DHC is proposed. The economic assessment of implementing dynamic braking and regenerative drives technology on downhill conveyors is undertaken with the help of the model. The assessment shows that combining regenerative drives and optimal operation of BCS with DHC generates energy savings that give attractive payback period of less than 5 years. A chance-constrained model predictive control (cc-MPC) algorithm is proposed for scheduling belt conveyor systems with uncertain material demand on the output storage. The chance-constraints are based on the modelling of material demand by a sum of known mean demand and, zero-mean and normally distributed random component. The cc-MPC algorithm is shown to produce schedules that give a smaller number and smaller magnitude of storage limit violations compared to normal MPC and chance-constrained optimal control algorithms. An equation that gives the amount of effective storage required to meet storage constraints for a given value of standard deviation is established. The optimal scheduling of BCS under the real-time pricing (RTP) tariff is considered. This study develops a methodology for establishing the economic value of price forecasting schemes for loads capable of load-shifting. This methodology is used to show that the economic benefit obtained from a forecast is highly dependent on the volatility of the electricity prices being predicted and not their mean value. The methodology is also used to illustrate why the commonly used indices mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are poor indicators of economic benefit. The proposed index using Kendall's rank correlation between the actual and predicted prices is shown to be a good indicator of economic benefit, performing far better than RSME and MAPE.

40|$|As {{electricity}} prices continue to rise, the increasing need for energy management requires {{better understanding of}} models for energy-consuming applications, such as conveyor belts. Conveyor belts are used {{in a wide range}} of industries, including power generation, mining and mineral processing. Conveyor technological advances are leading to increasingly long conveyor belts being commissioned. Thus, the energy consumption of each individual belt conveyor unit is becoming increasingly significant. This paper proposes a generic energy model for belt conveyors with long <b>troughed</b> <b>belts.</b> The model has a two-parameter power equation, and it uses a partial differential equation to capture the variable amount of material mass per unit length throughout the belt length. Verification results show that the power consumption calculations of the newly proposed simpler model are consistent with those of a known non-linear model with an error of less than 4 %. The online parameter identification set-up of the model is proposed. Simulations indicate that the parameters can be identified successfully from data with up to 15 % measurement noise. Results show that the proposed model gives better predictions of the power consumed and material delivered by a long conveyor belt than the steady-state models in the current literature.

Results from Cassini suggest that tectonics is the dominant mode of deformation on Enceladus, including rifts, {{one of the more}} dramatic types of tectonic features that were noted. These canyons can be up to 200km long, 5–10km wide, and 1km deep. Such features are geologically young, because they cut across other tectonic features and have sharp topographic relief with prominent outcrops along the cliff faces.|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} is mainly {{concerned}} with the description {{and analysis of the}} available aeromagnetic anomalies using different methodologies. Some structural elements could be deduced from the qualitative interpretation of such magnetic anomalies. The analysis of the worked magnetic maps, which included the total intensity magnetic map, reduced to-pole map, upward-continued maps, downward-continued maps, anomaly separation based on their wavelengths, or anomaly widths and enhanced horizontal gradient filtering aided in divulging the structural regime of the basement rocks, as well as the shallower features. As a result of the investigation, a basement tectonic map of the study area was constructed. This map shows that the area is portrayed by the presence of several major alternating basement swells and <b>troughs</b> in <b>belts</b> trending ENE–WSW, N–S, NE–SW and E–W. These major trends with the other minor trends dissected the basement surface into several tilted fault blocks forming anticlinal and synclinal zones with various depths and directions.

40|$|The Jackfork (~roup in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas is an Upper Mississippian flysch {{succession}} that displays readily distinguishable lithofacies. The frontal Ouachitas {{contain a}} preponderance of disturbed beds which are interbedded with turbidite sandstones. These disturbed and disrupted beds developed {{at the foot of}} a northern unstable slope, the resultant bedding dependent upon the type of material involved, its state of consolidation, and the distance moved. Information gathered concerning the progressive changes from one type of sedimentary structure to another gives a qualitative measure of downslope distance. Muds which undergo submarine deformation upon a sloping sea floor first become flowage shales which change to blocky mudstones with continued failure. Failure of plastic muds and cohesive sandstone progressively form con-torted, chaotic, and. rubble bedding. Deformation of muds and sands form slurried bedding and breecias. Movement of flowing, creeping, or sliding clean sand may have occurred but is not considered to be a type of disruptive bedding. The deformation of mobilized, liquefied sand under some sediment cover produced load structures, audstone dikes, and intrastratal flow structure. The Ouaehita trough possibly consisted of an offsetting series of unstable shale slopes deepening southward to a gentle, west-dipping abyssal plain. The muds and channel sands upon the slope frequently slumped south-wards, sometimes flowing out over the abyssal floor at right angles to basinal turbidites flowing westward down the <b>trough</b> axis. <b>Belts</b> where disturbed bedding comprises the greatest percentage of the entire section define the unstable margins of the flysch trough while the highest sand-shale ratios parallel the axis of the trough...|$|R
40|$|Antarctic sea-ice is {{potentially}} {{one of the}} most sensitive global warming indicators. Some re- cent studies using coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models suggest that C 0,- induced warming and concomitant sea-ice re- duction might be less marked than in the Arctic (Gordon and O’Farrell 1997); certainly the moderating influence of the Southern Ocean as a heat store must be considered. On the other hand, because Antarctic sea-ice is generally much thinner (typically 0. 3 - 1. 0 m) than its boreal counterpart (about 3. 0 m), changes in its extent are possibly more temperature-sensitive than in the Arctic (Rind zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA et zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA al. 1997).

Stratigraphic correlation is shown with focus on a comprehensive geophysiXcal survey line run front offshore NW Sabah to offshore SE Vietnam. According to the varying tectono-stratigraphy from southeast to northwest, five tectonic belts can be determined i. e. the Palawan-Borneo Nappe, Nansha <b>Trough.</b> Nanwei-Liyue Compressive <b>Belt,</b> Zheng'he Extensional Belt and the Circum-Southwest Subbasin Belt. In the Palawan-Borneo Nappe. Neogene-Quaternary deposits were highly upthrust northwestwards, resulting {{in a series of}} moderately to tightly folded anticlines separated by open synclines. The Nansha Trough was a narrow. deep-water belt filled with thick. undisturbed Neogene-Quaternary deposits. The Nanwei-Liyue Compressive Bell was dominated by strongly folded paleo-anticlines: overlain by an undeformed sedimentary cap with a pronounced hiatus of Paleogene sediments. The Zheng'he Extensional Belt consisted of a rugged topography and Paleogene half-grabens bounded by listic faults. The major extensional faults were reactivated to cut through the overlying Neogene-Quaternary deposits. Over the Circum-Southwest Subbasin Belt. Neogene-Quaternary deposits draped on the largely subsided, fault blocks related to the Late Oligocene-Mid-Miocene seafloor spreading. Based on the regional stratigraphic correlation, the prominent paleo-anticlines found within the Nanwei-Liyue Compressive Belt are deduced to consist of mainly Mesozoic marine sediments that were compressed in the Late Mesozoic Era. Therefore, the Nansha Microcontinent Block is shown to be a collision complex assembled during Late Mesozoic Era. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Cytherean ridge arcs {{resulted}} in crustal shortening in places {{with either the}} strongest compression or weakest surface layers. Arcuate scarps on or {{close to the edge}} of the ridge arcs were compressional fronts formed by overthrust over or subduction of adjacent lowland. These ridge arcs became wider due to the propagation of new ridge formation close to previous one(s). As this process repeated itself with time, the crust became thicker and the foreland was bent either due to the excess load, overthrust or subduction event. The Salme Dorsa arc measures 100 km in width and 600 km in length. It consists of a horseshoe-like set of ridges and grooves on a gently sloping lowland. The westward arcuate ridge belt indicates lateral compressional stresses and crustal deformation from SE against the southern Ishtar Terra foreland plain. The trough on the western side of the ridge belt and tensional grabens close to the crest of the bulge to the west of the trough are due to the crustal bending and indicate effects of the load and thrust. Compression and relative movement from southeast against and over the foreland planitia have {{resulted in}} ridge <b>belt,</b> <b>trough</b> and bulge formation. The load- and/or stress-induced bending of the uppermost crust allows some estimations of the uppermost elastic lithosphere thickness. Repeated folding and thrust faulting of surface layers due to compression are indicated by four more ridge belts located close to Salme Dorsa.

30|$|The Japanese {{islands are}} {{situated}} on the western Pacific convergent margin and were formed through subduction and accretion processes (e.g., Maruyama et al. 1997; Taira et al. 1989). The Shimanto Belt is an ancient accretionary complex formed during the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods and is now exposed in southwest Japan parallel to the trench axis of the Nankai <b>Trough.</b> The Shimanto <b>Belt</b> is divided into a northern and southern section by a major boundary fault called the Aki Tectonic Line in the Shikoku and Kii regions and the Nobeoka Thrust in Kyushu (Imai et al. 1971). The Nobeoka Thrust is well exposed along the coastline in the Miyazaki Prefecture and {{is responsible for the}} exhumation of the deeper Morotsuka and Kitagawa groups (hanging wall) in the north onto the shallower Hyuga group (footwall) in the south (Kondo et al. 2005; Okamoto et al. 2006, 2007; Raimbourg et al. 2009). Thermal structures along the Nobeoka Thrust studied by vitrinite reflectance, fluid inclusion, illite crystallinity, and fission-track analyses indicated that the maximum experienced temperatures of the hanging wall and footwall are approximately 320 °C and 250 °C, respectively (Kondo et al. 2005; Hara and Kimura 2008; Raimbourg et al. 2009). This thermal gap across the fault suggests that the Nobeoka Thrust had been active as an out-of-sequence-thrust or megasplay fault at depths of several to 11  km beneath the sea bottom surface (Kondo et al. 2005). Assuming a geothermal gradient of 28 to 47 °C km− 1 and a fault dip angle of approximately 10 °, the thermal gap corresponds to 8.6 to 14.4  km displacement along the thrust in the seismogenic zone (Kondo et al. 2005). A large displacement of several kilometers along the splay fault at similar depths in the modern Nankai Trough is also suggested from the tilting of the forearc basin sediments observed in seismic images (Park et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{variation}} of crustal thickness is essential in many applications, such as forward dynamic modelling, numerical heat flow calculations, seismologic applications and geohistory reconstructions. We present a 3 -D model of the Moho undulations over the entire Tibetan plateau derived from gravity inversion. The gravity field has been obtained by using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) potential field development which has been integrated with terrestrial data, and is presently the best available in the studied area. For the effective use of the global geopotential model that has no height information of observation stations, upward continuation is applied. The Moho model {{is characterized by a}} sequence of troughs and ridges with a semi-regular pattern, which could reflect the continent-continent collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The three deep Moho <b>belts</b> (<b>troughs)</b> and shallow Moho belts (ridges) between them are clearly found to have an E-W directional trend parallel to the border of the plateau and tectonic lines, while variation of the directionality is observed in central to southeast Tibet. To describe the distinctive shape of the Moho troughs beneath Tibet, we introduce the term, 'Moho ranges'. The most interesting aspects of the Moho ranges are (1) that they run in parallel with the border and tectonic sutures of the plateau, (2) that the distances between ranges are found at regular distances of about 330 km except in northeast Tibet and (3) that the splitting of the ranges into two branches is found as the distance between them is increasing. From our study, we conclude that the distinctive undulations of the Tibetan Moho have been formed by buckling in a compressional environment, superimposed on the regional increase in crustal thickness. According to our analysis, the GRACE satellite-only data turns out to have good enough resolution for being used to determine the very deep Moho beneath Tibet. Our Moho model is the first one that covers the entire plateau...|$|R
