The person most strongly associated with the scientific investigation of UG is Noam Chomsky, although the idea of Universal Grammar has clear historical antecedents at least as far back as the 1600s, in the form of the Port-Royal Grammar.|$|E
25|$|By rationally {{seeking the}} truth, {{thinking}} freely, holding free discussions and testing teachings and authorities, freethinkers strive towards the full {{development of the}} human personality, {{with the emphasis on}} moral and rational conscience. This includes amongst other things an atheistic worldview, the choice for solidarity with fellow human beings, and the realisation that life is finite and a one-off occurrence. Also, physical and emotional development is considered important for a healthy and happy life. Precisely because life is finite, it is unique and valuable, and should be experienced to the fullest. Emotionally, one needs to cope with doubt, because the critical examination of one's own dearly held beliefs, and letting go of them if <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be false, is necessary to seek the truth.|$|E

500|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, and claimed that many of the film's ideas for {{altering}} its familiar storyline [...] "sound better on paper than <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> in execution." [...] Finding it tedious to view the film's story told multiple times, he wrote that the film [...] "slips into boredom." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film {{two and a half}} stars, and although he praised its [...] "snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C+ and called it [...] "a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children." [...] He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, [...] "Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania...

[...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, saying [...] "Monsters University, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 Pixar hit Monsters, Inc., is no better or worse than the average (and I mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying that it [...] "never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop {{in the manner of}} the best Pixar stories. Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four, and said it [...] "may not be as inventive as Inc., but it's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four, saying [...] "It may be children's terror that powers the movie's fictional universe, but it's the energy of its stars that lights up Monsters University." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A− and said it [...] "is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after 2011's Cars 2 left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic. The delightful story of when Mike met Sulley puts those concerns to rest." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three stars out of four and wrote [...] "Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids." ...|$|E

For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.

2500|$|As {{in other}} novels by Vonnegut, certain {{characters}} cross over from other stories, making cameo appearances and connecting the discrete novels {{to a greater}} opus. Fictional novelist Kilgore Trout, often an important character in other Vonnegut novels, in Slaughterhouse-Five is a social commentator and a friend to Billy Pilgrim. In one case, {{he is the only}} non-optometrist at a party, therefore, he is the odd-man-out. He ridicules everything the Ideal American Family holds true, such as Heaven, Hell, and Sin. In Trout's opinion, people do not know if the things they do turn out to be good or bad, and if <b>they</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> to be bad, they go to Hell, where [...] "the burning never stops hurting." [...] Other crossover characters are Eliot Rosewater, from God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater; Howard W. Campbell, Jr., from Mother Night; and Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, from The Sirens of Titan. While Vonnegut re-uses characters, the characters are frequently rebooted and do not necessarily maintain the same biographical details from appearance to appearance. Kilgore Trout in particular is palpably a different person (although with distinct, consistent character traits) in each of his appearances in Vonnegut's work.|$|E
