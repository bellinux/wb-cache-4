5|$|A variant, {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>motif</b> is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies <b>the</b> <b>motif,</b> is not Palladian, though Burlington {{seems to have}} assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed <b>the</b> <b>motif</b> in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
5|$|Another change {{under the}} second and third Qajar king was the Africanization of <b>the</b> <b>motif.</b> At this time, the lion was an African lion which had a longer mane and bigger body {{compared}} to the Persian lion. Yahya Zoka suggests that this modification was influenced by contact with Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal frames often {{featured}} in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings. <b>The</b> <b>motif</b> {{may have been}} borrowed from the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, who Bacon greatly admired and often corresponded with. Giacometti had employed the device in The Nose (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in Fragment, Zweite mentions that the diagonal lines transform the cross into a guillotine.|$|E
50|$|The Minangkabau {{traditionally}} embellish {{the wooden}} walls, pillars, and ceilings of the rumah gadang with bas-relief carved wooden motifs that reflect and symbolize their adat. <b>The</b> <b>motifs</b> consists of profuse floral designs {{based on a}} simple underlying geometric structure. <b>The</b> <b>motifs</b> {{are similar to those}} of the Minangkabau woven songket textiles, with colors thought to have been derived from Chinese brocades. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>motifs</b> do not show animals or humans in a realistic form, although some may represent animals, human beings, or their activities or behavior. <b>The</b> <b>motifs</b> are based on the Minangkabau concept of aesthetics, which is part of their view of their world (Alam Minangkabau) in which expression is always based upon the natural environment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this text is to show how <b>the</b> mother <b>motif</b> is portrayed in four {{selected}} novels by Alfred Kämpe, but the thesis also serves the purpose of emphasizing the fact that <b>the</b> mother <b>motif</b> can be seen interacting with <b>the</b> class <b>motif.</b> This text will account for a new insight into <b>the</b> <b>motifs</b> in Alfred Kämpe’s Trälar. Known {{as one of the}} first authors to write in the genre of working-class literature in Sweden Kämpe’s texts provide motifs common for this genre such as class, identity and solidarity. As this thesis shows there is yet another motif that should be included among these typical Swedish working class literature motifs: the mother motive. Based on Nina Lykke’s theory of intersectionality, this text will show how <b>the</b> mother <b>motif</b> is portrayed in four of the short stories in Alfred Kämpe’s Trälar (1907) (“Valle”, ”Svinsjukan”, ”Mamsell Johansson”, ”Hjälpareflickorna”) and further more show how <b>the</b> mother <b>motif,</b> by interacting with <b>the</b> class <b>motif,</b> contributes to <b>the</b> construction of gender and class in the short stories. The short stories have been chosen due to the simple fact that they are the novels in Trälar that portray <b>the</b> mother <b>motif</b> in its clearest. The analysis demonstrates that Alfred Kämpe’s Trälar shows a positive approach to the normalized conceptions about the mother. This positive approaching shows how <b>the</b> mother <b>motif</b> helps constructing both gender and class in this iconic Swedish working-class collection of short stories Furthermore the analysis also shows that it is in the context of <b>the</b> class <b>motif</b> that <b>the</b> mother <b>motif</b> appears. Due to the fact that <b>the</b> mother <b>motif</b> can be seen interacting with this, for <b>the</b> genre, important <b>motif</b> I would argue that <b>the</b> mother <b>motif</b> is of <b>the</b> same importance when we, as literature scholars, talk about Alfred Kämpe’s Trälar...|$|R

5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. <b>The</b> <b>motif</b> was {{developed}} from sources including medical textbooks, and images of the nurse in the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin.

5|$|The Palladian, Serlian, or Venetian window {{features}} {{largely in}} Palladio's work and {{is almost a}} trademark of his early career. It consists of a central light with semicircular arch over, carried on an impost consisting of a small entablature, under which, and enclosing two other lights, one on each side, are pilasters. In the library at Venice, Sansovino varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters. To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate; <b>the</b> <b>motif</b> was first used by Donato Bramante and later mentioned by Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554) in his seven-volume architectural book Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture, this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings, a motif that {{first appeared in the}} triumphal arches of ancient Rome. Palladio used <b>the</b> <b>motif</b> extensively, most notably in the arcades of the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. It is also a feature of his entrances to both Villa Godi and Villa Forni Cerato. It is perhaps this extensive use of <b>the</b> <b>motif</b> in the Veneto that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has probably {{become one of the most}} enduring features of Palladio's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism. According to James Lees-Milne, its first appearance in Britain was in the remodelled wings of Burlington House, London, where the immediate source was actually in Inigo Jones's designs for Whitehall Palace rather than drawn from Palladio himself.|$|E

The wall painting in Qatna's royal palace attests to contact with the Aegean region; they depict typical Minoan motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>motif</b> {{has many}} {{historical}} meanings. First, {{as a scientific}} and secular motif, it was only an astrological and zodiacal symbol. Under the Safavid and the first Qajar kings, it became more associated with Shia Islam. During the Safavid era, the lion and sun stood for the two pillars of society, {{the state and the}} Islamic religion. It became a national emblem during the Qajar era. In the 19th century, European visitors at the Qajar court attributed the lion and sun to remote antiquity; since then, it has acquired a nationalistic interpretation. During the reign of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar and his successors, the form of <b>the</b> <b>motif</b> was substantially changed. A crown was also placed {{on the top of the}} symbol to represent the monarchy. Beginning in the reign of Fat′h-Ali, the Islamic aspect of the monarchy was de-emphasized. This shift affected the symbolism of the emblem. The meaning of the symbol changed several times between the Qajar era and the 1979 revolution. The lion could be interpreted as a metaphor for the Shia Imam Ali or it could be symbolizing Rostam, the legendary hero of Iranian mythology. The Sun has alternately been interpreted as symbol of motherland or Jamshid, the mythical Shah of Iran.|$|E
5|$|Jolin {{started to}} depict Stockholm {{when he moved}} to Fiskargatan, on the tall cliffs of {{southern}} Stockholm in 1914. From his studio he could see most of the city. He divided the view, facing Stadsgården or Riddarholmen, into smaller frames for his painings. Noted works from that time are: Strömmen mot Kastellholmen (Over the Strömmen on to the Kastellholmen) 1914, now in the Stockholm City Museum; Utsikt över Riddarholmen (View of Riddarholmen) 1914, bought by the Nationalmuseum but kept in the Moderna Museet, and Utsikt mot Kastellholmen (View towards the Kastellholmen) 1915, now in the Malmö Konstmuseum. In the Stockholm från Söders höjder (Stockholm from the heights of Söder) 1938, elements from Oriental art are present in the naked, branches of the trees and the red buoys looking like Chinese lanterns hanging in the trees. These paintings are defined by swift, flowing brushwork and forceful contours framing fresh, light colours. His composition of <b>the</b> <b>motif</b> involved putting details against big blocks of cool pink, sheer blue, ivory turquoise and emerald, thereby creating a populated setting. There is always an air of teaming citylife along the docks and busy boating on the water of the Strömmen in these paintings.|$|E

Theiss and Haynes would later go on to form The Castiles and in June 1965 they were joined in that band by Bruce Springsteen. <b>The</b> <b>Motifs</b> were managed by Norman Seldin, a local musician-entrepreneur whose own band, The Joyful Noyze, included Clarence Clemons.
