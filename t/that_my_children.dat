500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter. Randolph Churchill claimed that George was a strict father, {{to the extent that}} his {{children}} were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby: [...] "My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going to see to it <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> are frightened of me." [...] In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.|$|E
500|$|Stating {{that such}} a {{conservative}} criticism of his film's [...] "strong environmental anti-war themes" [...] was not unexpected, Cameron stressed that he was [...] "interested in saving the world <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> are going to inhabit", encouraged everyone to be a [...] "tree hugger", and urged that we [...] "make a fairly rapid transition to alternate energy." [...] The film and Cameron's environmental activism {{caught the attention of}} the 8,000-strong Dongria Kondh tribe from Orissa, eastern India. [...] They appealed to him to help them stop a mining company from opening a bauxite open-cast mine, on their sacred Niyamgiri mountain, in an advertisement in Variety that read: [...] "Avatar is fantasy... and real. [...] The Dongria Kondh... are struggling to defend their land against a mining company hell-bent on destroying their sacred mountain. Please help...." [...] Similarly, a coalition of over fifty environmental and aboriginal organizations of Canada ran a full-page ad in the special Oscar edition of Variety likening their fight against Canada's Alberta oilsands to the Na'vi insurgence, —a comparison the mining and oil companies objected to. [...] Cameron was awarded the inaugural Temecula Environment Award for Outstanding Social Responsibility in Media by three environmentalist groups for portrayal of environmental struggles that they compared with their own.|$|E

Sheen stated, [...] "I've decided <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> deserve my focus more than a relationship does right now.
