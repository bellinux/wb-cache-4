The focus of this work is to design a bench-scale apparatus, for laboratory applications, that will perform solid processing operations for carbon black obtained through the <b>thermal</b> catalytic <b>depolymerization</b> of scrap tires. These operations are as follows: filtration and washing, extraction, and fine/coarse particle separation. It is beneficial to perform the three processing steps in a single apparatus to minimize, both, the amount of solid product lost and the time required for processing. By minimizing the time, a greater number of samples may be analyzed in a given amount of time. Thus, the effects of variations in process conditions can be determined in a shorter time span. The final design of the apparatus was formulated through combining the requirements of the three individual processing steps. Theoretical aspects, as well as quantitative and qualitative observations were important tools in generating the final design specifications. Without a doubt, the practical experience of working with the carbon black was the most important aid in performing this work...|$|R
40|$|An {{a priori}} Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{of the product}} spectrum resulting from the <b>thermal</b> and catalytic <b>depolymerization</b> of lignin has been developed. The simulation combines model com-pound reaction pathways and kinetics, deactivation parameters, and stochastic models of poly-mer diffusion into a Markov-chain based simulation of the reaction of lignin polymers. Predicted product class ratios of single-ring phenolics were in reasonable agreement with experimental data pertaining to lignin liquefaction, especially as regards neat pyrolysis. The advantage of catalytic liquefaction was suggested by the increase in single-ring product yields, especially those of phenols and hydrocarbons, relative to pyrolysis. Introduct ion The intensity {{of research in the}} U. S. and abroad into the liquefaction of coal has largely been directed toward reduction of the demands on petroleum feedstocks. Both traditional fossil fuel feedstocks and alternative feeds are rich in sulfur and nitrogen, and removal of these heteroatoms has therefore been studied in detail.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research program was to develop and test a small-scale system that used a novel Coandă burner for tar destruction through partial oxidation. An experimental rig consisting of a tar injector, in which wood pellets were pyrolyzed, and a Coandă tar cracking unit was designed, constructed, and operated to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} unit. The experimental program was divided into two phases, so that comparisons of the tar composition with and without treatment could be made. In the first phase, wood pellets were pyrolyzed at a range of temperatures between 500 and 800 °C and the pyrolysis products (gas, tar, and char) were analyzed. Increasing the temperature from 500 to 700 °C caused an increase in the production of hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. As the pyrolysis temperature increased from 500 to 800 °C, there was a decrease in the yield of gravimetric tar in the sampled gas from 67. 2 to 15. 7 g/nm 3. This reduction can be attributed to higher pyrolysis temperature, causing an increase in <b>thermal</b> cracking and <b>depolymerization</b> reactions, which, in turn, promotes production of permanent gas species. In the second phase, the gas produced in the first phase was treated in sub-stoichiometric conditions in the Coandă tar cracker. When the yield of tar species found in the treated and untreated gases is compared when the pyrolysis temperature of the tar injector was set at 800 °C, benzene was reduced by 95 %, toluene was reduced by 96 %, naphthalene was reduced by 97. 7 %, and the gravimetric tar yield was reduced by 86. 7 %. The Coandă tar cracker was shown to be effective at significantly reducing the tar content in the product gas. The reduction {{can be attributed to the}} high flame temperature (> 1000 °C) and the addition of oxygen, which leads to the formation of free radicals, causing tar destruction...|$|R
