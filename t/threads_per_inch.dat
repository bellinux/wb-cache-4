50|$|In American {{engineering}} drawings, ANSI Y14.6 defines {{standards for}} indicating threaded parts. Parts are indicated by their nominal diameter (the nominal major {{diameter of the}} screw threads), pitch (number of <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch),</b> and the class of fit for the thread. For example, “.750-10UNC-2A” is male (A) with a nominal major diameter of 0.750 in, 10 <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and a class-2 fit; “.500-20UNF-1B” would be female (B) with a 0.500 in nominal major diameter, 20 <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and a class-1 fit. An arrow points from this designation to the surface in question.|$|E
50|$|Number of {{vertical}} (warp) and horizontal (woof) <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> square <b>inch.</b> These <b>threads</b> vary from 120 to 150 <b>per</b> square <b>inch.</b> A higher thread count {{is synonymous with}} a higher quality including higher tensile strength, better adhesive, easier removal, longer lasting, and more expensive.|$|R
50|$|Sun {{protective}} clothing is clothing {{specifically designed for}} sun protection and is produced from a fabric rated for its level of ultraviolet (UV) protection. A novel weave structure and denier (related to <b>thread</b> count <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> may produce sun protective properties. In addition, some textiles and fabrics employed {{in the use of}} sun {{protective clothing}} may be pre-treated with UV-inhibiting ingredients during manufacture to enhance their effectiveness.|$|R
5000|$|Mako cotton: A {{high grade}} of cotton, the long staple or long fibre of Egyptian-grown cotton has more {{continuous}} fibres {{to use when}} creating threads or yarns. The yarn is smaller in diameter yet stronger than other cottons. Smaller yarn means that more <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> {{can be used to}} create stronger fabrics which are lighter in weight yet breathe well. Mako cotton is frequently used to make upscale sheets and towels, which are marketed as a luxury product.|$|R

50|$|The term Egyptian cotton {{is usually}} {{applied to the}} extra-long-staple cotton {{varieties}} produced in Egypt (Giza 45, Giza 70, Giza 77, Giza 87, Giza 88, Giza 92, Giza 93) and used in luxury and upmarket brands worldwide. Giza 45 has the highest thread count, ranging up to 1000 <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> square <b>inch.</b> The majority of Egyptian cotton export is long-staple cotton, not ELS cotton. Egyptian ELS varieties amount to about 7% of annual global ELS/LS cotton exports, and amount to approximately 25% of Egyptian cotton exports.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quality of}} bed sheets is often {{conveyed}} by the thread count—the number of <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> of material. In general, {{the higher the}} thread count, the softer the sheet, but the weave and type of thread may affect the [...] "hand" [...] of the material so that a sheet with a lower thread count may actually be softer than one with a higher count. Yarn quality also plays {{a part in the}} look and feel of sheets, as finer yarns tend to create a finer sheet fabric. The ply also plays a role in how heavy the sheet feels. Ply represents how many fibers are twisted together as the sheet is being created. A 2 ply 300 thread count sheet will feel heavier than a single ply 600 thread count sheet. [...] The most common constructions are muslin, percale, sateen, flannel, and knitted jersey. In a plain weave the warp and weft cross each other one at a time, and sateen, has multiple threads (usually three or four) over, and one under.|$|R
50|$|One <b>thread</b> <b>per</b> dent is {{most common}} for coarse work, for finer work (20 or more ends <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> {{two or more}} threads are put through each dent. Threads can be doubled in every other space, so that a reed with 10 dents <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> could give 15 ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> or 20 if the threads were simply doubled. Also, threads can be put in every other dent {{so as to make}} a cloth with 6 ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> from a reed with 12 dents <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Putting more than one thread through each dent reduces {{friction}} and the number of reeds that one weaver needs, and is used in weaving mills. If too many threads are put through one dent there may be reed marks left in the fabric, especially in linen and cotton.|$|R

50|$|Both {{the wires}} and the slots in the reed {{are known as}} dents (namely, teeth). The warp threads pass through the dents after going through the heddles and before {{becoming}} woven cloth. The number of dents <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (or <b>per</b> cm or per 10 cm) indicates the number of gaps per linear width, {{the number of the}} warp thread ends by weaving width determines the fineness of the cloth. One or more warp threads may go through each dent. The number of warp threads that go through each dent depends on the warp, and {{it is possible that the}} number of threads in each dent is not constant for a whole warp. The number of <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> dent might not be constant if the weaver alternates 2 and three <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> dent, in order to get a number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> that is 2.5 times the number of dents <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> or if the thickness of the warp threads were to change at that point, and the fabric to have a thicker or thinner section.|$|R

5000|$|Points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (25 mm): The {{most common}} {{measurement}} of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade. It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then {{counting the number of}} points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than there are teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (e.g., a saw with 14 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 13 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and a saw with 10 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 9 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Some saws {{do not have the same}} number of teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do. Those with more teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> at the toe are described as having incremental teeth, in order to make starting the saw cut easier.|$|R

50|$|Suppose a {{magnetic}} tape can contain up to 3,200 flux reversals <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A Modified Frequency Modulation or (1,3) RLL encoding stores each data bit as two bits on tape, but {{since there is}} guaranteed to be one 0 (non flux reversal) bit between any 1 (flux reversal) bits then {{it is possible to}} store 6,400 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, or 3,200 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A (1,7) RLL encoding can also store 6,400 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, but since it only takes 3 encoded bits to store 2 data bits this is 4,267 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A (2,7) RLL encoding takes 2 encoded bits to store each data bit, but since there is guaranteed to be two 0 bits between any 1 bits then it is possible to store 9,600 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, or 4,800 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes [...] "special" [...] {{diameter}} and pitch combinations (UNS) are used, for example a 0.619 in major diameter with 20 <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> UNS threads are rarely used for bolts, {{but rather on}} nuts, tapped holes, and threaded ODs. Because of this UNS taps are readily available. Most UNS threads have more <b>threads</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than the correlating UNF or UNEF standard, therefore they are often the strongest thread available. Because of this they are often used in applications where high stresses are encountered, such as machine tool spindles or automotive spindles.|$|E

50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (and picks <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic yarns and fibers.|$|R
