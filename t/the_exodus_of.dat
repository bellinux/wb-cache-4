5|$|It was {{not until}} 1894 that Stroma gained its first {{artificial}} landing point, a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown {{at a cost of}} £800. In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was intended to help stem <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> people from the island, Stroma was abandoned only a few years after the harbour's completion.|$|E
5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E

5|$|The longest-serving non-royal head {{of state}} in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro {{polarized}} world opinion.

Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> a large number of Cubans and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world.|$|E

5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{alliance}} contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia {{declared war on}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their goal was to definitely expel Turks from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. The Turkish forces had left the city the day before. The Serbian annexation led to <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> many Turks: 725 Turkish families left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{claimed that}} {{there was no mention of}} the case in police records held by {{archives}} in Adelaide, but that instead, the incident had been related to him by residents of the district who had known Brown. He also placed it as having occurred between 1860 and 1870. Foster et al. note that this date is highly unlikely, as frontier violence in the district began when squatters arrived in 1843, and was tapering off by 1848 when the murders occurred. By the 1860s, Aboriginal labour was highly sought after by pastoralists in the district due to <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> white labourers to the Victorian gold rush.|$|E

5|$|The city {{struggled}} to make a transition to new industries. During {{the second half of}} the 20th century, the city's recessions were longer than the national average. <b>The</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> defense companies (such as Lockheed Martin, formed from the merger of the Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in 1995) and the electrical-manufacturing industry played a major role in Utica's recent economic distress. From 1975 to 2001, the city's economic growth rate was similar to that of Buffalo, while other upstate New York cities such as Rochester and Binghamton outperformed both.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was well-received in Serbia and abroad; {{it has since}} attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture. An allusion to it is made in Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground, in which war refugees are depicted marching towards Belgrade in similar fashion, following the German bombing {{of the city in}} April 1941. Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history. Historian Katarina Todić observes that there are striking similarities between the painting and photographs of the Royal Serbian Army's retreat to the Adriatic coast during World War I. Judah remarks that the composition resembles images of <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> Krajina Serbs following Croatia's Operation Storm in August 1995.|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> several {{manufacturing}} companies, the area's {{industrial economy}} {{began to decline}} during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led {{to the collapse of}} the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics. This decline would continue into the later half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000. The 1969 closure of the Springfield Armory, in particular, spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1992, Croatia gained {{diplomatic}} recognition by the European Economic Community members, and subsequently the United Nations. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory by Croatia. This {{was accompanied by}} <b>the</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> about 200,000 Serbs from the rebel territories, whose lands were subsequently settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The remaining occupied areas were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, with the process concluded in January 1998. Croatia became a World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 30 November 2000. The country signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union in October 2001. Croatia {{became a member of}} NATO on 1 April 2009, and joined the European Union on 1 July 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 2008, {{the state}} government, which {{was accused of}} {{reluctance}} to take immediate action, ultimately arrested Raj Thackeray and Abu Asim Azmi (a local SP leader) on charges of instigation of violence and causing communal disturbance. Although released that same day, a gag order was imposed on both leaders {{to prevent them from}} making further inflammatory remarks. Meanwhile, tensions in Maharashtra rose as the news of Raj's possible arrest, and his subsequent actual arrest, angered his supporters. Incidences of violence against North Indians and their property by MNS workers were reported in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Beed, Nashik, Amravati, Jalna, and Latur. Nearly 25,000 North Indian workers fled Pune, and another 15,000 fled Nashik {{in the wake of the}} attacks. <b>The</b> <b>exodus</b> <b>of</b> workers caused an acute labour shortage, affecting local industries. Analysts estimated financial losses of –. Although the violence receded after the arrests of the two leaders, sporadic attacks were reported until May 2008. After months of lull, on 19 October 2008, MNS activists beat up North Indian candidates appearing for the all-India Railway Recruitment Board entrance exam in Mumbai. The incident led to Raj's arrest and fresh violence. Later on 28 October 2008 a labourer from Uttar Pradesh was lynched in a Mumbai commuter train.|$|E
