5|$|At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration {{among the}} {{teachers}} {{as well as}} students. He befriends an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel. He casts a powerful spell intended to raise <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dead woman, but the spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle banishes the shadow and saves Ged's life, although it costs Nemmerle his own.|$|E

On 3 January 1804, a member of one of the armed patrols set up {{in the wake of the}} reports shot and killed a bricklayer, Thomas Millwood, mistaking the white clothes of Millwood's trade for a ghostly apparition.

25|$|Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848 as the {{beginning}} of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, reported that they had made contact with <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> murdered peddler. What made this an extraordinary event was that the spirit communicated through audible rapping noises, rather than simply appearing to a person in a trance. The evidence of the senses appealed to practical Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. Demonstrations of mediumship (seances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable business, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Foxes earned a living this way, as did many others.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} their aunt in October {{of the same year}} forced them to return once more to Haworth. Aunt Branwell had left all her worldly goods in equal shares to her nieces and to Eliza Kingston, a cousin in Penzance, which had the {{immediate}} effect of purging all their debts and providing a small reserve of funds. Nevertheless, they were asked to return to Brussels as they were regarded as being competent and were needed. They were each offered teaching posts in the boarding school, still English for Charlotte and music for Emily. However, Charlotte returned alone to Belgium in January 1843, while Emily remained critical of Monsieur Heger, in spite of the excellent opinion he held of her. He later stated that she 'had <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man', and would probably become a great traveller due to her being gifted with a superior faculty of reason that allowed her to deduce ancient knowledge of new spheres of knowledge, and her unbending willpower would have triumphed over all obstacles.|$|E
