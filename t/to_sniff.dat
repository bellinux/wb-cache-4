5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops <b>to</b> <b>sniff</b> and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian gerbils out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4â€“5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E
5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf <b>to</b> <b>sniff</b> its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E

Many people assume computers connected to a switch are safe from sniffing here we go for Antisniffing [2]. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth. Computers connected to switches are just from vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>sniffing.</b> Computers connected <b>to</b> switches are just as vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>sniffing</b> as those connected to a hub. Here in this paper we propose Mobile Agents to detect sniffers. Mobile agents perform a task by migrating and executing on several nodes connected to the network. Ignored to detect sniffers [3], the network administrator sends some special types of mobile agents in the network and collects information from different nodes. After analyzing this information the network administrator can identify the computer system running in promiscuous mode...|$|R

25|$|About 70% of {{domestic}} cats are especially attracted to, and {{affected by the}} plant Nepeta cataria, otherwise known as catnip. Wild cats, including tigers, are also affected, but with unknown percentage. The first reaction of cats is <b>to</b> <b>sniff.</b> Then, they lick and sometimes chew the plant and after that rub against it, with their cheeks and the whole body by rolling over. If cats consume concentrated extract of the plant, they quickly show signs of over-excitement such as violent twitching, profuse salivation and sexual arousal. The reaction {{is caused by the}} volatile terpenoids called nepetalactones present in the plant. Although they are mildly toxic and repel insects from the plant, their concentration is too low to poison cats.|$|E

Between {{the reading of the}} sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on a redheaded girl (Karoline Herfurth) selling yellow plums, following her and repeatedly attempting <b>to</b> <b>sniff</b> her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.|$|E

500|$|Following Katz, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy, but in United States v. Jones (2012), the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law, but rather, has supplemented it. In Jones, law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car's exterior without Jones' knowledge or consent. The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to the car, and so had a property interest in the car. Therefore, since the intrusion on the vehicleâ€”a common law trespassâ€”was for the purpose of obtaining information, the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court used similar [...] "trespass" [...] reasoning in Florida v. Jardines (2013), to rule that bringing a drug detection dog <b>to</b> <b>sniff</b> at the front door of a home was a search.|$|E
500|$|Themes from Old English literature, and {{specifically}} from Beowulf, shape {{the ancient world}} Bilbo stepped into. Tolkien, a scholar of Beowulf, counted the epic among his [...] "most valued sources" [...] for The Hobbit. Tolkien {{was one of the}} first critics to treat Beowulf as a literary work with value beyond the merely historical, and his 1936 lecture [...] is still required in some Old English courses. Tolkien borrowed several elements from Beowulf, including a monstrous, intelligent dragon. [...] Certain descriptions in The Hobbit seem to have been lifted straight out of Beowulf with some minor rewording, such as when the dragon stretches its neck out <b>to</b> <b>sniff</b> for intruders. Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in Beowulf. Other specific plot elements and features in The Hobbit that show similarities to Beowulf include the title thief, as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaug's personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town. Tolkien refines parts of Beowulf plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.|$|E
500|$|Koalas are asocial {{animals and}} spend just 15 {{minutes a day}} on social behaviours. In Victoria, home ranges are small and have {{extensive}} overlap, while in central Queensland they are larger and overlap less. Koala society appears to consist of [...] "residents" [...] and [...] "transients", the former being mostly adult females and the latter males. Resident males appear to be territorial and dominate others with their larger body size. Alpha males tend to establish their territories close to breeding females, while younger males are subordinate until they mature and reach full size. Adult males occasionally venture outside their home ranges; when they do so, dominant ones retain their status. When a male enters a new tree, he marks it by rubbing his chest gland against the trunk or a branch; males have occasionally been observed to dribble urine on the trunk. This scent-marking behaviour probably serves as communication, and individuals are known <b>to</b> <b>sniff</b> {{the base of a}} tree before climbing. Scent marking is common during aggressive encounters. Chest gland secretions are complex chemical mixturesâ€”about 40 compounds were identified in one analysisâ€”that vary in composition and concentration with the season and the age of the individual.|$|E

500|$|The koala {{has one of}} the {{smallest}} brains in proportion to body weight of any mammal, being 60% smaller than that of a typical diprotodont, weighing only [...] The brain's surface is fairly smooth, typical for a [...] "primitive" [...] animal. It occupies only 61% of the cranial cavity and is pressed against the inside surface by cerebrospinal fluid. The function of this relatively large amount of fluid is not known, although one possibility is that it acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the brain if the animal falls from a tree. The koala's small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain. Because of its small brain, the koala has a limited ability to perform complex, unfamiliar behaviours. For example, when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface, the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves. The koala's olfactory senses are normal, and it is known <b>to</b> <b>sniff</b> the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility. Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin. Its round ears provide it with good hearing, and it has a well-developed middle ear. A koala's vision is not well developed, and its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits. Koalas make use of a novel vocal organ to produce low-pitched sounds (see social spacing, below). Unlike typical mammalian vocal cords, which are folds in the larynx, these organs are placed in the velum (soft palate) and are called velar vocal cords.|$|E
500|$|While {{open fields}} are not {{protected}} by the Fourth Amendment, the curtilage, or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home, is protected. Courts have treated this area {{as an extension of}} the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person's home (unlike a person's open fields) under the Fourth Amendment. The curtilage is [...] "intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically," [...] and is where [...] "privacy expectations are most heightened." [...] However, courts have held aerial surveillance of curtilage not to be included in the protections from unwarranted search so long as the airspace above the curtilage is generally accessible by the public. An area is curtilage if it [...] "harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life." [...] Courts make this determination by examining [...] "whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by." [...] The Court has acknowledged that a doorbell or knocker is typically treated as an invitation, or license, to the public to approach the front door of the home to deliver mail, sell goods, solicit for charities, etc. This license extends to the police, who have the right to try engaging a home's occupant in a [...] "knock and talk" [...] for the purpose of gathering evidence without a warrant.

40|$|Olfactory {{perception}} {{relies on}} an active sampling process, <b>sniffing,</b> <b>to</b> rapidly deliver odorants {{from the environment}} to the olfactory receptors. The respiration cycle strongly patterns {{the flow of information}} into the olfactory systems, but the behavioral significance of particular sniffing patterns is not well understood. Here, we monitored the frequency and timing of nasal respiration in rats performing an odor mixture discrimination task that allowed us to test subjects near psychophysical limits and to quantify the precise timing of their behavior. We found that respiration frequencies varied widely from 2 - 12 Hz, but odor discrimination was dependent on 6 - 9 Hz sniffing: rats almost always entered and maintained this frequency band during odor sampling and their accuracy on difficult discrimination dropped when they did not. Moreover, the switch from baseline respiration <b>to</b> <b>sniffing</b> occurred not in response to odor delivery but in anticipation of odor sampling and was executed rapidly, almost always within a single cycle. Interestingly, rats also switched from respiration <b>to</b> rapid <b>sniffing</b> in anticipation of reward delivery, but in a distinct frequency band, 9 - 12 Hz. These results demonstrate the speed and precision of control over respiration and its significance for acquisition of olfactory information...|$|R
