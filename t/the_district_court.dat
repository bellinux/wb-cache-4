40|$|The theory {{behind this}} project is that as Congress {{increases}} jurisdiction the workload of <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> increases through more cases being filed in <b>the</b> federal <b>district</b> <b>courts.</b> <b>The</b> increase in <b>district</b> <b>court</b> workload results in a need for new resources for <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts.</b> When Congress does {{not respond to the}} increases in workload in <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> <b>the</b> United States Supreme Court responds by reducing workload in <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> through placing limits on congressional jurisdiction. ^ The topic of the dissertation is the influence of congressional jurisdiction increases on the workload of <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts,</b> and <b>the</b> Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to those increases. The dissertation begins by investigating the influence of increases in federal criminal jurisdiction on the number of criminal cases filed in <b>district</b> <b>courts.</b> I have found a strong correlation among these two variables. I use the connection between criminal jurisdiction and increases in criminal cases in <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> to infer that congressional increases in other areas will result in similar increases in the overall workload of <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts.</b> From this inference I examine how the courts respond to increased workload through requests for new judges. I have also found a strong correlation in this regard. From the requests for new judges I look at the reaction to these requests by Congress. I have found that Congress is fairly responsive to requests for new judges by the judiciary. Finally, I look at 3 cases in which the Court restricts and expands the commerce clause; Usery v. National League of Cities, Garcia v. San Antonio Metro., and Lopez v. U. S. These cases illustrate the reaction of the Court to the action or inaction of Congress to requests for new judges by the judiciary. ...|$|R

5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>court</b> found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>court</b> ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E

5000|$|During the appeal, Fujitsu claimed [...] "synchronously" [...] {{does not}} mean “at the same time”.

Netgear argued <b>the</b> <b>district</b> <b>court’s</b> interpretation was correct. The circuit court defined synchronous to mean “just before or at the same time” and thereby slightly relax the limitation.
