5|$|Originally, NY5 entered Buffalo {{from the}} south on Fuhrmann Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and {{followed}} South Park Avenue and Main Street through the city before rejoining its modern alignment at Goodell Street. In the mid-1950s, a new limited-access highway was constructed along Fuhrmann Boulevard from Lackawanna to the Buffalo River. At the river, the new roadway broke from Fuhrmann and continued directly into downtown, returning to grade level two blocks south of Niagara Square. The expressway, known as the Buffalo Skyway, became part of a rerouted NY5 by 1956. Visually, the Skyway cuts off the city from the Buffalo inner harbor. In 2008, there was momentum to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> but the momentum has passed.|$|E
5|$|Placed on {{an upper}} {{floor of the}} State House, the bell was rung {{in the early years}} of {{independence}} on the Fourth of July and on Washington's Birthday, as well as on Election Day to remind voters to hand in their ballots. It also rang to call students at the University of Pennsylvania to their classes at nearby Philosophical Hall. Until 1799, when the state capital was moved to Lancaster, it again rang to summon legislators into session. When Pennsylvania, having no further use for its State House, proposed to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and sell the land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, together with the building, including the bell, for $70,000, equal to $ today. In 1828, the city sold the second Lester and Pack bell to St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church, which was burned down by an anti-Catholic mob in the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844. The remains of the bell were recast; the new bell is now located at Villanova University.|$|E
25|$|On August 5, 2013, Congress {{allowed the}} lease between GSA and The Trump Organization {{to go into}} force. The Washington Business Journal {{reported}} that the lease called for a 263-room (another source said 270-room) hotel and for Trump to spend $250 million on renovations. The D.C. Preservation League (the former Don't <b>Tear</b> <b>It</b> <b>Down)</b> said it supported the Trump redevelopment of the site.|$|E

25|$|The {{restaurant}} was closed in 2001, and {{a used car}} dealership leased the property. In January 2007, the lessees of Johnie's started to illegally <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> The destruction of the building was halted, with extreme damage to the building, though the sign is intact. Tenants made significant alterations {{to the dining room}} without permits, and the City of Downey had to issue several stop work orders and citations.|$|E
25|$|After {{nearly a}} hundred years of use, Old Main had really begun to show its age, and in 1981 the {{building}} was closed for safety reasons. After a considerable period of debate over whether to restore the old building or <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> restoration work began {{in the summer of}} 1989 and Old Main was renovated extensively. The renovation proceeded ahead of schedule, and it was finished during the spring semester of 1991 at a cost of $10 million. It was rededicated during the Fall of 1991.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} practice, Zhou Tong enters his {{students}} into the Tangyin County military examination, in which Yue Fei wins first place by shooting a succession of nine arrows through the bullseye of a target 240 paces away. After this display of archery, Yue is asked to marry the daughter of Li Chun (李春), {{an old friend of}} Zhou and the county magistrate who presided over the military examination. However, Zhou soon dies of an illness and Yue lives by his grave through the winter until the second month of the new year when his sworn brothers come and <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> forcing him to return home and take care of his mother.|$|E

50|$|Finally, in October 1929, Midway Gardens {{was closed}} {{permanently}} and demolished. A testament to Wright's design, {{the building was}} so solidly constructed that <b>tearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> sent the wrecking company into bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} was purchased in 2014, {{with plans to}} tear down the remains of Halcyon Hall, and develop a park.. As of 2016, the developers were not close to <b>tearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{elevated}} section {{between the}} Don River and Leslie Street, intended for {{connection to the}} cancelled Scarborough Expressway, was eventually demolished in 2001. Demolition was first proposed in 1990 by the Crombie Commission and the Lake Shore-Gardiner Task Force. The segment {{was in need of}} expensive repairs and a 1996 environmental assessment determined that it would cost $48 million to refurbish the Gardiner from the Don Valley Parkway to Leslie St., but only $34 million to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> The final cost of the demolition was $39 million. Eastbound traffic now exits to a newly constructed off-ramp that connects with Lake Shore Blvd. East, just west of Carlaw Avenue. In the wake of the eastern demolition, Lake Shore Boulevard East has been revealed from the cover of the highway. Green boulevards have been implemented along the wide thoroughfare. Paved bicycle paths extend eastward for approximately two kilometres from the Martin Goodman Trail at Cherry Street to Coxwell Avenue. A local artist created a commemorative piece for the demolished elevated expressway out of several of its giant supportive concrete pillars.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Pei {{was asked}} to {{initiate}} a project for his home country. After surveying {{a number of different}} locations, Pei {{fell in love with a}} valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as Fragrant Hills. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find [...] "a third way".|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Ian Watson {{states that}} the Athshean forest itself {{is a metaphor for}} {{consciousness}} in the novel. The Terrans, distanced from their own tangled subconscious, are afraid of the forest, and seek to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> The Athsheans, in contrast, are integrated with it at a subconscious level. The entire forest is also seen as a collective Athshean consciousness. Although the forest in The Word for World is Forest is not actually sentient, Le Guin explores the idea of a sentient forest further in the short story [...] "Vaster than Empires and More Slow", which shares many thematic parallels with the former.|$|E
50|$|The school {{district}} closed Lapham {{and turned it}} into the {{school district}} office and community center. The school district later closed Sudman, <b>tearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and leaving the property as a public park by the name, Sudman Park.|$|R

500|$|In 2000, the Howard Van Doren Shaw-designed 1907 Georgian Revival Platt Luggage Building at 2301 South Prairie was {{the subject}} of {{preservation}} debates when McCormick Place attempted to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> to build a parking garage. [...] The conflict, which was not settled before wreckers had knocked a hole {{in a corner of the}} building and which included protests and a petition to the Illinois Supreme Court, was described on the front page of The New York Times. Preservationists, including the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, eventually dropped their appeals once the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority committed to incorporating the original facade of the building into the exterior of the parking garage at an additional cost of $2.5million to the project. The Harriet F. Rees House at 2110 South Prairie was spared demolition in 2014 and moved one block north to 2017 South Prairie.|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, Broadwater Development LLC – {{a casino}} holding company owned by two local {{construction}} figures, Roy Anderson III and Cotton Fore – won a [...] bankruptcy auction {{bid for the}} casino and resort for $82 million, amid speculation that they had overpaid. Anderson said of the barge, [...] "It's a nice structure. But overall aesthetically, it's not going to fit into our master plan." [...] On April 15, 2005, the deal closed; as part of it, the President Casino barge was purchased for $6.8 million by Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC {{with the intention of}} operating it under the name of President Casino until it could be moved to their site in Hancock County, Mississippi, where the Silver Slipper operators thought it would fit in. [...] On July 31, 2005, the Broadwater Beach Resort closed its doors, with Broadwater Development announcing plans to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and build a new resort and casino.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{exterior}} {{scenes were}} shot in Vancouver, Canada's Chinatown while the crematorium scenes were shot on a soundstage. Interior {{shots of the}} gambling parlor were shot at the Welsh Irish Scottish English (W.I.S.E.) Hall, a community building in Vancouver. The production staff created a second balcony in the hall exclusively for the episode, with an agreement to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> once the episode was filmed. However, after the filming ended, the W.I.S.E. Hall's owners requested that the balcony be left in place [...] "for aesthetic reasons". The vase and tiles used in the episode were created entirely by the show's production department. The scene where a frog pops out of a victim's chest was created by using molds to create a fake human torso, which was then placed over the actor. For a close-up shot, the torso was placed on {{a table with a}} hole on it, allowing the show's animal wrangler to push a live frog through the opening in the torso. Actors Michael Yama and Lucy Liu had to redo all of their dialogue in a Cantonese accent in post production. Their re-recorded lines were dubbed over the original soundtrack.|$|E

50|$|In 1945, the {{original}} railroad depot was torn down {{and replaced with}} a new one. Ten years later, that depot was no longer needed, and the railroad sold it to the Methodist Church in 1958. They <b>tore</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and used the materials for an addition to their church.|$|R

500|$|In April 1873, the Town of Hanover seized {{part of the}} {{southeast}} corner of the green to align East and West Wheelock Streets; the town moved the fence thirty feet to the north of its original position. Dartmouth students protested by tearing down and burning the rebuilt fence; the town responded by threatening to reopen Main Street on its previous route from the Green's southwest corner across to the northeast. In an effort to quickly replace the fence and prevent the road from being reopened, College President Asa Dodge Smith convinced students to pay for the new fence. In 1893, when the fence's original purpose of keeping out livestock was no longer needed, the College decided to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> to much student and alumni outcry. The class of 1893 restored and sponsored part of the fence as a [...] "senior fence," [...] and today the Senior Fence runs along the parts of the southern and western borders closest to the southwest corner. [...] Only senior students were allowed to sit on it, and underclassmen in violation of this policy were soaked in a nearby watering trough.|$|E
2500|$|By 1902, {{the depot}} {{constructed}} in 1870 {{had become an}} eyesore. The residents of Allendale were pressuring the Erie Railroad to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> and replace it. The railroad responded to the complaints by moving the depot across the tracks in 1902 and partially refurbishing it at a total cost of $1,100 (...) [...] Its new location {{on the west side}} of the tracks was considered a better location; a new freight depot was built on the former site.|$|E
2500|$|Unable {{to reach}} an agreement, Driscoll and several others women formed a {{competing}} chapter of the DRT named the Alamo Mission chapter. [...] The two chapters argued over which had oversight of the Alamo. [...] Unable to resolve the dispute, in February 1908 the executive committee of the DRT leased out the building. [...] Angry with that decision, de Zavala announced that a syndicate wanted to buy the chapel and <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> [...] She then barricaded herself in the Hugo and Schmetlzer building for three days.|$|E

50|$|According to legend, Yatsugatake {{was once}} higher than Mount Fuji, but Konohanasakuya-hime, {{the goddess of}} Mount Fuji, <b>tore</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> out of jealousy, leaving the {{collection}} of peaks we have today. Paul Hunt muses that {{this might not be}} far from the truth considering that Yatsugatake is older than Fuji and as Fuji rose in prominence Yatsugatake wore away.|$|R

2500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{transformed}} into an apartment building and renamed the Perry Apartments. [...] Future US President Ronald Reagan lived in the building when he worked for radio station WOC in 1932–1933. [...] In 1939 the building was heavily damaged by fire. [...] Bill Vale was paid $5,000 to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> and then bought the property for $25,000. [...] He put in bout $12,000 in repairs, and renamed the building the Vale Apartments. [...] As time went on the building started to decline. [...] While {{attempts were made to}} save it, the building had become structurally unsafe and was torn down in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Those indicted {{said that}} their {{behavior}} {{was caused by the}} resentment and bitterness that had accumulated from the decades of suffering due to the Navy's bombing practices on the island. Norma Burgos, a Senator of Puerto Rico, who had formerly been imprisoned for trespassing on the bombing range several months earlier, justified the behavior by comparing it to the fall of Saddam Hussein's statue in the recent invasion of Iraq [...] in which U.S. soldiers used an Army tank (a property of the U.S. government) to <b>tear</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> Their defense failed, {{and more than a dozen}} of those charged were imprisoned for “damages and destruction of public property.” ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{attempt to}} {{demolish}} the Old Post Office Pavilion began in February 1970. The National Capital Planning Commission, {{a federal agency}} with legal jurisdiction over major building projects in the Washington metropolitan area, agreed (although it said the tower might be preserved). Within days, Wolf Von Eckardt, the influential architectural critic ofThe Washington Post, began campaigning for the structure's preservation. No action was taken on the demolition project in 1970, and Von Eckardt continued to press for the building's preservation in 1971. By early 1971, a group of local citizens and architects formed a group known as [...] "Don't Tear It Down" [...] (predecessor to the D.C. Preservation League). The group's members included Nancy Hanks, the politically influential chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Don't <b>Tear</b> <b>It</b> <b>Down</b> began heavily lobbying the PADC, General Services Administration (which owned the building for the federal government), White House, Congress, and D.C. city government to stop the demolition. Opposition to the demolition began {{to grow in the}} U.S. Senate, which held hearings on the buildings in April 1971. [...] Preservation forces received a major boost in May 1971 when the federal Advisory Council on Historic Preservation recommended retaining it.|$|E
