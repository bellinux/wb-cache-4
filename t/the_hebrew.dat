5|$|Biblical Hebrew is best-attested in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> Bible, the {{collection}} of Judaic religious and historical texts which reflect various stages of <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> language in its consonantal skeleton, {{as well as a}} vocalic system which was added in the Middle Ages by the Masoretes. There is also some evidence of regional dialectal variation, including differences between Biblical Hebrew as spoken in the northern Kingdom of Israel and in the southern Kingdom of Judah.|$|E

25|$|During {{the exodus}} from Egypt, <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> follow Moses' {{original}} {{path through the}} desert and towards the Red Sea. Still grieving for his son, Ramesses decides to go after <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> with his army. After making {{their way through a}} dangerous mountain pass, Moses and <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> arrive at <b>the</b> edge of the sea, uncertain about what to do. Out of despair, Moses flings his sword into the sea, which begins to recede. Ramesses and his army pursue <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews,</b> but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts to its normal state, drowning the majority of the Egyptians (crossing the Red Sea). Moses survives and makes his way back to <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews.</b> Ramesses is revealed to have survived, but he is distraught over the destruction of his army. Moses leads <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> back to Midian, where he reunites with Zipporah and Gershom. At Mount Sinai, after seeing Malak's displeasure at the Hebrews' construction of the Golden Calf, Moses transcribes the Ten Commandments. Years later, an elderly Moses riding with the Ark of the Covenant sees Malak walking with <b>the</b> <b>Hebrews</b> through <b>the</b> desert.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was {{repopulated}} with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood {{in which many}} Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location. The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from {{the name of the}} high priest Caiaphas. Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keiphah. Another theory holds it could be derived from <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> verb root חפה (hafa), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible origin in <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> word חוֹף (hof), meaning shore, or חוֹף יָפֶה (hof yafe), meaning beautiful shore.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hebrew</b> {{alphabet}} is, {{like the}} Persian alphabet, an abjad. It {{is used for}} the Jewish Bukhori dialect primarily in Samarkand and Bukhara. Additionally, since 1940, when Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia, the use of <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> Alphabet outside Hebrew liturgy fell into disuse and Bukharian Jewish publications such as books and newspapers began to appear using the Tajik Cyrillic Alphabet. Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian and went to Tajik or Russian schools in Central Asia only know the Tajik Cyrillic Alphabet when reading and writing Bukharian and Tajik.|$|E

Some Rebbes requested from the Hasid a sum of money equal to twice the numerical value of <b>the</b> <b>Hebrew</b> word Chai (life), which equals 18.
