5|$|Article I {{contains}} the entire original Virginia Declaration of Rights from the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights, {{including the right}} to due process, the prohibition against double jeopardy, and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b> Like the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in §17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people.|$|E
5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the images}} of warriors like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was dominated by a military aristocracy, whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms,</b> represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{society in}} the Middle Ages is the social {{organisation}} {{of what is now}} Scotland between the departure of the Romans from Britain in the fifth century and the establishment of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Social structure is obscure {{in the early part of}} the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship groups probably provided the primary system of organisation and society was probably divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners.|$|E

5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} is obscure {{in the early}} part of the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship probably provided the primary unit of organisation and society was divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners. By the thirteenth century there are have sources that allow greater stratification in society to be seen, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen with more modest landholdings.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the region fell to the Ottoman Turks shortly after 1369 and the coastal towns were conquered in 1453. Under Ottoman rule, many villages provided auxiliaries to the Ottoman army or had to protect the mountain passes and therefore enjoyed a more favourable status— they paid no taxes and the men had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b> There were 17 privileged villages in {{the territory of the}} modern park where Muslims were not allowed to settle. During the time of internal disorder in the Ottoman Empire in 1785–1810, brigand bands wreaked havoc in Strandzha resulting in the migration of thousands of people. Another massive migration wave followed the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29) and many Bulgarians settled in the southern areas of the Russian Empire. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Strandzha remained outside the borders of the reborn state. In July 1903 in the historic area Petrova Niva the delegates of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) discussed the outbreak of an anti-Ottoman rebellion. The Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising broke out in Strandzha and Macedonia in August 1903 and lasted for about twenty days before being suppressed by the Turks who committed great atrocities to the local population. Over 60 villages were burned down and thousands were massacred. Strandzha was liberated during the First Balkan War (1912–1913) and formally joined Bulgaria after the Second Balkan War in 1913.|$|E

25|$|Criminal {{violence}} {{was not merely}} {{in the domain of}} the ethnic Chinese, however. Rivalries between Malay princes and communities also often result in acts of violence, which prompted the passing of Singapore's first arms law in March 1823 restricting <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> to 24 of the Malay Sultan's followers. Nearly two centuries later, these anti-arms laws continue to be strictly enforced, resulting in a society relatively free from firearms-related criminal offences.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} Mennonites assimilated {{more and}} more. In the liberation wars of 1813, some young Mennonites {{were prepared to}} join the forces against Napoleon. In the Spring of Nations of 1848, Mennonites joined the armed municipal militia (Bürgerwehr), which included <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b> When, after {{the foundation of the}} North German Confederation, a general conscription was invented, the Danzig community managed to receive the exceptional permission to serve only in non-combat troops; however, a group of Mennonites emigrated to North America to avoid all kind of military service.|$|E
25|$|Wayne Chiang, a Fall 2006 {{graduate}} of Virginia Tech and an ardent supporter of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms,</b> was widely mistaken as the killer, as his profile matched several key {{attributes of the}} suspected shooter falsely reported by the Chicago Sun-Times. After receiving a deluge of hate-mail and death threats, he came out declaring {{he was not the}} shooter. Following the identification of the perpetrator, several media outlets named Chiang, including Geraldo Rivera on Fox News and CNN. His picture was also included twice in a CTV montage of pictures of the actual shooter, even after the shooter had been positively identified as Cho Seung-Hui.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 15th century, several factors came into play that had a major impact on the global wine market. The Venetian traders were losing their supply of sweet wine from the lands of Cyprus, Greece, Romania and Hungary to the {{emerging}} dominance of the Ottoman Empire. War with France had lost the English their access to the wines of Bordeaux. Seeing an opportunity to capitalize on this, the Spanish Duke of Medina Sidonia made several moves to put Sherry into the forefront of the world's wine market. In 1491, the export tax on wine was abolished for both Spanish and foreign vessels coming into Sanlúcar. In 1517, English merchants were given preferential merchant status-including <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> in the region.|$|E

25|$|The Chechen-Ingush Republic {{split in}} two in June 1992, amidst the {{increasing}} Ossetian-Ingush conflict. After Chechnya had announced its initial declaration of sovereignty in 1991, its former entity Ingushetia opted to join the Russian Federation as a federal subject (Republic of Ingushetia). The remaining rump state of Ichkeria (Chechnya) declared full independence in 1993. That same year the Russian language stopped being taught in Chechen schools {{and it was also}} announced that the Chechen language would start to be written using the Latin alphabet (with some additional special Chechen characters) rather than Cyrillic in use since the 1930s. The state also began to print its own money and stamps. One of Dudayev's first decrees gave every man <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent {{personally}} mounted {{an expedition}} in 1537 that destroyed or captured many surrounding villages {{but did not}} manage to subdue the area. The Ottomans {{found it necessary to}} compromise with the inhabitants by giving them a series of privileges: local self-government, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms,</b> exemption from taxes, the right to sail under their own flag into any Ottoman port and to provide military service in time of war. However, despite the privileges, the Himariotes revolted during the following conflicts: Ottoman–Venetian War (1537–40), Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–73), Morean War (1684–99), Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18) and the Russo-Turkish wars of the 18th century. On the other hand, Ottoman reprisals depopulated the area and led to forced Islamizations which finally limited the area's Christian population by the 18th century to the town of Himarë and six villages. Additionally the Himariotes were often attacked by the Labs, a nearby Albanian tribe, on the grounds of race and religion. In one occasion, in 1577, the chieftains of Himarë appealed to the Pope for arms and supplies promising to fight the Ottomans. They also promised to transfer their religious allegiance to Rome, provided that they will retain their Eastern Orthodox liturgical customs since {{the majority of the population}} was Greek and didn't understand the Frankish language.|$|E
