40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the performance of}} a thermo-electric air duct system (TE-AD), which employs the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>module</b> (TEMs) inside an air duct for providing thermal comfort in Malaysian environment. Twenty human subjects were exposed to test room equipped with TE-AD system operating at six different input current supply from 2 A to 7 A. Both objective and subjective measurements were carried out. Results show that with the increment of input current supply to the TE-AD system, subject's thermal response related to indoor condition of test room shifted from warm to neutral. Optimum performance of the TE-AD system was obtained at the input current supply of 6 A, more than 80 % of subjects responded in the range of ± 1 and meets ASHARE standards of acceptability criteria. Further increase in input current supply deteriorates the cooling performance of the TE-AD system. Economic comparison of the TE-AD system with the existing air conditioning system shows that economic saving of US$ 127. 34 /year can be achieved with additional benefits of Freon free, convenient installation, no moving part and reliable operation...|$|E

This research work focus on optimization of the design of exhaust heat exchanger by removing the internal fins and changing the cross-sectional area of heat exchanger to minimize the problem of pressure drop. The designs of exhaust heat exchangers used in the previous research works recovers maximum heat from an engine exhaust but they have main problem of pressure drop or back pressure which can stops engine functioning. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{is used in the}} simulation of the exhaust gases flowing inside the heat exchanger. The isothermal modelling technique is used in simulation process of the heat exchanger. The thermal simulation is done on heat exchanger to check the surface temperature, heat transfer rate, and pressure drop in three different driving cycles (urban driving, suburban driving and max. power driving) for a vehicle with 1. 2 L petrol engine. The Rectangular shaped heat exchanger is used in exhaust manifold of internal combustion engine (ICE) is modelled numerically to recoverthe lost heat from engine exhaust. We find the Rectangular shaped heat exchanger with gradually increasing cross sectional area minimizes pressure drop and gives better temperature at the surface and increase the heat transfer rat...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a review}} of the {{possible}} sources of water is presented. Paper concentrates on the drinking water needs, especially with respect to the remote / rural arid places. In the case of remote villages in developing countries, {{there is a need for}} systems, which produce clean potable water and development of effective methods to use water. In the first part of the review, most common processes that can be used to produce water are discussed. Humidification and De-Humidification (H & DH) appears to be very popular to produce water in small quantities. The literature reviews cover different H & DH techniques in which air is used as a medium to carry water in the form of vapor. In this paper, appropriate techniques reviewed include the usage of passive and active systems, which are operated with or without the support of solar energy. Use of fog harvesting, and <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>module</b> are also discussed in brief. A concept of producing water from a SWRO plant with wind power is also discussed. In the second part, techniques for conservation of natural resources and the effective methods to use water and energy are discussed. To conserve water, rainwater accumulation, pot in a pot system to store vegetables, solar powered absorption refrigeration units, drip irrigation and use of desert coolers are advocated. In order to save energy, ideas of using small wind powered ventilation systems, energy conserving designs of modern air-conditioned buildings conserve energy and provide good ventilation are proposed. Use of bags made of bio-degradable materials like paper or cloth is encouraged rather than the not bio-degradable plastics...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermo-electric</b> <b>modules</b> (TEMs) {{can be used}} {{to convert}} heat into {{electricity}} by utilizing the Seeback effect. It is now possible to buy BiTe <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>modules</b> that can operate up to temperatures of around 300 °C. However, many applications, such as the harvesting of excess gas turbine heat, may occur at higher temperatures. Therefore, new materials and manufacturing processes need to be developed to produce packaged TEMs that can operate at a maximum operating temperature of 650 °C. Two critical areas in the manufacture of a SiGe TEM are the choice and strength of materials used to both sintered joint the TE material {{to the rest of the}} module and the metal used for the interconnects. The interconnection material needs to be sufficiently strong to withstand large temperature fluctuations while maintaining a low contact resistance, as well as being compatible with the nano-Ag sintered joint. Shear force tests of the sintered thermo electrical leg material showed that the joints are brittle when sintered to W metallized AlN substrates are used and ductile fracture behavior when sintered to Cu metallized AlN substrates using the NanoTach K nano silver paste. Almost all of the joints were found to be brittle when using the NachTach X nano silver paste. Shear testing of the sintered joints showed that the X paste joints were variable in strength and stiffness, having a typical Young's modulus between 10 and 100 MPa at room temperature. The K paste joints were stiffer, but had a similar strength as compared to the X paste joints...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{arrangement is}} demonstrated that over-comes some difficulties in thermo–mechanical testing of thin Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires under uniaxial tension. It is now {{well known that}} stress–induced transformations in some SMAs under uniaxial loading can lead to mechanical instabilities and propagating phase transformation fronts. Critical parame-ters, such as nucleation barriers are difficult to measure by con-ventional testing techniques and are often masked by unavoid-able stress concentrations at grips. In addition, simultaneous full field measurements of localized deformation and tempera-ture fields are difficult to obtain for different ambient conditions. The current scheme uses a temperature–controlled conduction block and a non–uniform temperature field induced by <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>modules</b> to uncover the underlying thermo–mechanical response of the wire. The approach also allows access for optical and infrared imaging of the specimen deformation and tempera-ture fields...|$|R

The {{introduction}} of intermetallic semiconductor materials, with higher thermoelectric performances than their metallic counterparts, {{has resulted in}} their practical application in <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>modules.</b> These modules can be found as Peltier devices, when used for refrigeration purposes, or Seebeck devices when used for electrical energy generation.

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{deals with}} thermal rendering for telepresence applications. We present the modeling and identification of <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>modules</b> (TEMs) {{to be used}} either {{as part of a}} thermal display or a remote thermal probe. First, TEMs are modeled in steady- and unsteady-state dynamics using recursive nonlinear autoregressive moving average models for both temperature and heat flux. The proposed models are convenient for simulation, control, electronic, and thermal engineering. They allow understanding the functionality of the heat pumps and facilitate the solving of cooling/heating problems without the need for expertise in thermal theory. Then, these models are used in a novel thermal rendering approach that is based on the estimation of the temperature in contact for both the finger and the probed remote object in a telepresence setup. The thermal feedback is provided by a bilateral control between the master (thermal display) and the slave (thermal probe robotic finger). Experimental results validating the models and the proposed thermal rendering scheme are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} problem in thermo-electric generators is the thermal {{design of the}} heat sink because it affects the performance of <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>modules.</b> As compared to conventional cooling systems, heat pipe heat sink have numerous advantages. Some of these advantages are: high heat-transfer rates; absence of moving parts and lack of auxiliary consumption (passive system). This paper presents the analysis of power generation using the combination of heat pipes and thermo-electric generators. The aim is to improve power output by an appropriate design of the heat sink. The average geometrical parameters of heat sink (fin height, fin space and fin thickness) were obtained from data collected from previous studies closely similar to this prototype. The prototype was tested and the temperature, voltage and current data were collected. All data were recorded by using a temperature data recorder, power meter and multimeter. It {{was found that the}} highest maximum power output was 1. 925 watts at a temperature difference of 85 °C. However, the prototype did not achieve the maximum output expected. This was a result of limitation of TEG model (where only one TEG was used) and the limitation of the performance of the prototype. The prototype successfully generated enough power to charge a cell phone and laptop when connected to two or three TEGs. Moreover the heat pipe heat sink needs optimization to meet the design output from the manufacturer of the TEG at hot side temperature and cold side temperatur...|$|R
40|$|<b>Thermo-Electric</b> <b>Modules</b> (TEMs) {{are being}} {{increasingly}} used {{in power generation}} as a valid alternative to batteries, providing autonomy to sensor nodes or entire Wireless Sensor Networks, especially for energy harvesting applications. Often, manufacturers provide some essential parameters under determined conditions, like for example, maximum temperature difference between the surfaces of the TEM or for maximum heat absorption, but in many cases, a TEM-based system is operated under the best conditions only {{for a fraction of}} the time, thus, when dynamic working conditions occur, the performance estimation of TEMs is crucial to determine their actual efficiency. The focus of this work is on using a novel procedure to estimate the parameters of both the electrical and thermal equivalent model and investigate their relationship with the operating temperature and the temperature gradient. The novelty of the method consists in the use of a simple test configuration to stimulate the modules and simultaneously acquire electrical and thermal data to obtain all parameters in a single test. Two different current profiles are proposed as possible stimuli, which use depends on the available test instrumentation, and relative performance are compared both quantitatively and qualitatively, in terms of standard deviation and estimation uncertainty. Obtained results, besides agreeing with both technical literature and a further estimation method based on module specifications, also provides the designer {{a detailed description of the}} module behavior, useful to simulate its performance in different scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the study on {{performance}} characteristics of <b>thermo-electric</b> generator <b>modules</b> used in Compression Ignition engines for production of an electrical energy. Exhaustive studies are being done in utilizing the heat rejected through exhaust gases of a Compression Ignition engine working in a cycle to raise the overall efficiency. It is observed that about 35 – 45 % of heat generated is being wasted through exhaust gases. Hence, an attempt is made to utilize the energy lost in exhaust gases to recharge the battery without effecting the performance of an engine. An experimental set up was designed and fabricated to make the performance test for utilization of exhaust gases. Further, the performance characteristics of the thermo-electric generator consisting of thermo electric modules are studied in detail. The thermal energy from temperature gradient is converted into electrical energy by using the working principle of Seebeck and Peltier Effects...|$|R
