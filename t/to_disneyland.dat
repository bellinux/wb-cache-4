5|$|Once Ebbsfleet International railway station, also {{designed}} {{to serve the}} Kent region, had opened, only three trains a day to Paris and one <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> Paris called at Ashford for {{a considerable amount of}} time. There were fears that services at Ashford International might be further reduced or withdrawn altogether as Eurostar planned to make Ebbsfleet the new regional hub instead.|$|E
5|$|The London {{terminus}} is St Pancras International, {{the other}} British calling points being Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International in Kent. Calling points in France are Calais-Fréthun and Lille-Europe, with trains to Paris terminating at Gare du Nord. Trains to Belgium terminate at Midi/Zuid station in Brussels. In addition, there are limited services from London <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> Paris at Marne-la-Vallée – Chessy, services to southern France as of 1 May 2015 and seasonal {{services to the}} Alps in winter.|$|E
5|$|The casting of {{low-profile}} actors aided {{in keeping}} the production budget low by avoiding the larger salaries attached to stars. To prepare for the role and create a believable friendship between the leads, Brown, Cooper, and Mann were sent <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> together and spent a weekend in a cabin at Big Bear City, California.|$|E
50|$|Flying Dutchman {{was a dark}} ride {{similar in}} theme <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland's</b> Pirates of the Caribbean but without the animatronic figures.|$|R

5|$|Following {{several more}} troubled months, Jackson {{ended up in}} the hospital; he had {{collapsed}} while rehearsing for a concert in New York. Presley arrived to meet her ill husband, and yet another heated debate ensued. The argument ended after Jackson warned her that she was making his heart rate go up and asked her to leave. She obliged, and was admonished by a doctor and Jackson's mother Katherine along the way. Presley subsequently returned to Los Angeles. Upon being discharged from hospital, Jackson went <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> Paris to recover.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the final, Hamm {{collapsed in the}} locker room from severe hydration. She was treated by medical staff with an intravenous drip and three liters of fluids. After 12 hours of sleep, she joined the team for magazine cover shoots, went <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> for a celebration rally, and made numerous television appearances. A week later, the team met President Clinton at the White House and flew with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton on Air Force One to Cape Canaveral. Her leadership and performance at the 1999 World Cup cemented Hamm as a soccer icon.|$|E
5|$|The team realize Travers has valid criticisms {{and make}} changes, though she becomes {{increasingly}} disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking {{to understand what}} troubles her, Disney invites Travers <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland,</b> which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, {{and the addition of}} a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when Travers discovers that there is to be an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{collaborated with}} filmmakers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute 3D film Captain EO, which debuted in September 1986 {{at both the}} {{original}} Disneyland and at Epcot in Florida, and in March 1987 at Tokyo Disneyland. The $30 million movie was a popular attraction at all three parks. A Captain EO attraction was later featured at Euro Disneyland after that park opened in 1992. All four parks' Captain EO installations stayed open well into the 1990s: the Paris installation {{was the last to}} close, in 1998. The attraction would later return <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> in 2010 after Jackson's death. In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses, in response to their disapproval of the Thriller video.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} before the debut of the No. 5 locomotive, the railroad, {{for the first time in}} its history, hosted a privately owned train on its track. On the morning of May 10, before Disneyland opened for the day, a private {{ceremony}} was held at New Orleans Square Station to honor Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ollie Johnston, supposedly to thank him for helping to inspire Walt Disney's passion for trains, which led to the creation of Disneyland. The true motive for having Johnston there was soon revealed when a simple steam train not part of the DRR's rolling stock, consisting of a locomotive named Marie E. and a caboose, rolled towards the station and stopped at its platform. Johnston, a previous owner of the steam train, used to run it on his vacation property, which he sold, along with the train, in 1993. The man who now owned the train was Pixar film director John Lasseter, who had brought the train <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> in order to give Johnston, his mentor, an opportunity to reunite with and drive his former locomotive. Johnston, then in his nineties, was helped into the Marie E., and with Lasseter at his side, he grasped the locomotive's throttle and drove his former possession three times around the DRR's main line. Although Johnston died in 2008, Lasseter continues to run the Marie E., the caboose, and an assortment of train cars on his private Justi Creek Railway, which is complemented by the depot building and water tower from Ward Kimball's former Grizzly Flats Railroad.|$|E

25|$|Disneyland Park, {{originally}} Disneyland, is {{the first}} of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Walt Disney was a guest, {{primarily}} {{to promote his}} production of Mary Poppins. Benny persuaded Disney to give him over 110 free admission tickets <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> for his friends and one for his wife, but {{later in the show}} Disney apparently sent his pet tiger after Benny as revenge, at which point Benny opened his umbrella and soared above the stage like Mary Poppins.|$|E
25|$|Following a visit <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> in Anaheim, California, {{shortly after}} its opening, wealthy real estate {{developer}} Angus G. Wynne, Jr. decided that {{his home state of}} Texas should have a local park for entertainment. Planning for such a place began in 1959, under the leadership of Wynne and the Great Southwest Corporation, along with the backing of various New York City investors. Construction on the park began in August 1960.|$|E

500|$|The crest was {{redesigned}} {{and updated}} by London design agency Springett Associates {{in the late}} 1990s, featuring a wider yellow castle with fewer cruciform [...] "windows" [...] along with the peaked roofs being removed; {{the tops of the}} towers had previously made the castle appear more akin <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland's</b> Sleeping Beauty's Castle than a functioning fortress. The designer also altered other details to give a more substantial feel to the iconography.|$|R

25|$|In 1983, Barks {{relocated}} {{one last}} time to Grants Pass, Oregon near where he grew up, partly {{at the urging of}} friend and Broom Hilda artist Russell Myers, who lived in the area. The move also was motivated, Barks stated in another famous quip, by Temecula being too close <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> and thus facilitating a growing torrent of drop-in visits by vacationing fans. In this period Barks made only one public appearance, at a comic book shop near Grants Pass.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} cases in 2014 quadrupled to 644, {{including}} transmission by unvaccinated visitors <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland</b> in California. Some 97% of cases {{in the first half}} of the year were confirmed to be due directly or indirectly to importation (the remainder were unknown), and 49% from the Philippines. 165 of the 288 victims (57%) during that time were confirmed to be unvaccinated by choice; 30 (10%) were confirmed to have been vaccinated. The final count of measles in 2014 was 668 cases in 27 states.|$|E
5000|$|At Tokyo Disneyland, {{the ride}} {{was known as}} Grand Circuit Raceway. This version of the ride opened with the park in 1983 and {{remained}} largely unchanged.

The track {{was described as a}} [...] "figure eight" [...] shape, but was actually quite longer. A new ride, Aquatopia, opened at neighboring park Tokyo DisneySea in 2001, but other than the name similarity <b>to</b> the <b>Disneyland</b> car ride (it is an homage) Aquatopia is closer (as an attraction) <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland's</b> former Motor Boat Cruise. Tokyo Disneyland's version closed on January 11, 2017 {{to make way for a}} Beauty and the Beast themed area ...|$|R
50|$|The Gullywhumper {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Disneyland's</b> Rivers of America as a prop and was moored on Tom Sawyer Island where {{passengers on}} the Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes, the Sailing Ship Columbia, and the Mark Twain Riverboat could see it while passing.
