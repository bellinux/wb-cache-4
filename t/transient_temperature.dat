5000|$|This {{method is}} based on observing the average power in {{a certain amount of}} time which determines the {{temperature}} variations. This idea can be implemented with a fast run-time thermal simulation algorithm at architectural level. [...] This method also presents a new way to compute the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> changes based on the frequency domain moment matching concept. The moment matching concept is basically said that the transient behaviors of a dynamic system can be accurately described by a few dominant poles of the systems. The moment matching algorithm is required to compute the temperature variation response under initial temperature conditions and average power inputs for a given time. This method also follows circuit level thermal RC modeling at the architectural level as described in reference. The unit temperature variation during run-time is because of the irregular power trance generated by each unit in their architectural blocks. This power input is consistent of DC and small AC oscillation. It was also shown and proven that most of the energy in the power trace concentrates on the DC component. Therefore, the average power can be described as a constant DC input to thermal circuit. After all a thermal moment marching (TMM) with initial condition and DC input is required to be implemented.

40|$|Through the {{international}} work carried out recently by International Maritime Organization Marine Environment Protection Committee, {{the need for}} improved selective catalytic reduction systems for marine applications at low and <b>transient</b> <b>temperatures</b> has been acknowledged. It is of importance to improve the low-temperature activity to achieve compliance with the upcoming stricter International Maritime Organization NOX regulation (Tier III, 80 % reduction) for ships. This study therefore investigates the possibilities to improve the low-temperature activity for a commercial vanadium-based urea-selective catalytic reduction catalyst for marine applications. By altering the NO 2 /NOX ratio, the reaction proceeds in the fast selective catalytic reduction reaction regime, which is especially beneficial at low and <b>transient</b> <b>temperatures</b> and in combination with SO 2 and H 2 O. For both steady-state and transient modes, {{it is suggested that}} an improved low-temperature activity for the marine selective catalytic reduction system can be achieved by increasing the NO 2 /NOX ratio to 50 %, whereby utilizing the fast selective catalytic reduction reaction scheme. The fast selective catalytic reduction can significantly improve the NOX reduction already at 250 degrees C in the presence of water or sulfur. The fast selective catalytic reduction will, however, require an increased NO 2 fraction in the exhaust gases, preferably 50 %, which may be achieved by placing an oxidation catalyst upstream of the selective catalytic reduction. The use of an oxidation catalyst upstream of the selective catalytic reduction can offer a possibility to achieve International Maritime Organization Tier III compliance at low and <b>transient</b> <b>temperatures,</b> but to avoid formation of ammonium nitrates and possible ammonium sulfates, temperatures should be kept above 250 degrees C in combination with marine fuels with a maximum of 0. 10 wt% S...|$|R

The laser induced plasma micro-machining (LIP-MM) is a novel multimaterial and tool-less micro-machining process that also removes material through plasma. Since, both processes remove material through melting and vaporization, machining is always accompanied with heat affected zone.
