40|$|The {{allelopathic}} {{effect of}} medicinal plant, Piper sarmentosum Roxb., against 12 <b>test</b> <b>plant</b> species was evaluated. Four different concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1 and 0. 3 g dry weight equivalent extract mL - 1 {{were used in}} the study. The hypocotyl and root length were measured compared with control treatments. It was observed that the aqueous methanol extracts of P. sarmentosum <b>plants</b> inhibited all <b>test</b> <b>plant</b> species with different inhibition values. The variation may result, in part, from the different <b>test</b> <b>plant</b> species with different sensitivity to allelochemicals. The shoot and root growth of <b>test</b> <b>plants</b> were inhibited at the concentration greater than 0. 03 g dry weight equivalent extract mL - 1 and increasing the extract concentration increased inhibition.

Transmission rates of PVY and PLRV from potato to other <b>test</b> <b>plants</b> were investigated by DAS-ELISA assays. All experiments were carried out at 26 : 22 ± 2 °C (day:night) under a 16 : 8 h (light:dark) photoperiod conditions. Late 4 th instar or early adult M. persicae and A. gossypii apterae were used in the transmission experiments. The aphids were not subjected to preacquisition starving in the assays. Each aphid species were reared on PVY-infected source potato plants for 5 h as Acquisition Access Period (AAP). Then, aphid group including 10 individuals were taken from donor plants were transplanted on to healthy receptor <b>test</b> <b>plants</b> for 15 h as Inoculation Period (IP). For PLRV transmissions, two aphid species reared on source potato plants for 24 h as AAP were transferred on to each healthy <b>test</b> <b>plants</b> as a group including 10 individuals for 24 h as IP. After IP, the aphids were removed from plants mechanically. PVY and PLRV were transmitted in higher rates by M. persicae. PVY and PLRV were more efficiently transmitted from potato to pepper seedlings among the other inoculated solanaceous <b>test</b> <b>plants</b> by both aphid species. The lowest transmission was occurred in tomato (2 / 15) and P. floridana (3 / 15) by using A. gossypii.

40|$|Test {{automation}} {{is adopted}} {{by the majority of}} software and hardware producers since it speeds up the testing phase and allows to design and perform a large bunch of tests that would be hardly manageable in a manual way. When dealing with the testing of hardware instruments, different physical environments have to be created so that the instruments under test can be analyzed in different scenarios, involving disparate components and software configurations. Creating a test case is a time consuming activity: test cases should be reused as much as possible. Unfortunately, when a physical <b>test</b> <b>plant</b> changes or a new one is created, understanding if existing test cases can be executed over the updated or new <b>test</b> <b>plant</b> is extremely difficult.
