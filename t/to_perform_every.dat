25|$|Educational {{outreach}} at the Folger {{began in}} the early 1970s; today, the Folger Education department continues those early efforts with a variety of programs for K–12 students and teachers that emphasize an active learning approach to Shakespeare. Teachers gather at the Folger for day-long and month-long programs to work to incorporate Shakespeare and performance in the classroom. The department also publishes a variety of materials for classroom use. Student programs include workshops, local residency initiatives, and a high school fellowship program during which students study Shakespeare at the Folger. The Emily Jordan Folger Children's Shakespeare Festival, founded in 1980, allows elementary students <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> spring. The Secondary School Shakespeare Festival, founded the following year, brings students from grades 7–12 to perform half-hour collections of Shakespeare scenes in the Folger theater.|$|E
25|$|Second, it {{is assumed}} that while faster than light starships produce prodigious amounts of energy just for the needs of propulsion, there is not enough energy {{available}} <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> possible function simultaneously. Therefore, each ship has to fill out an Energy Allocation form {{at the beginning of a}} turn, and 'pay' for all the functions (such as movement, shields and weapons) that it can then use during the turn. This procedure forces players to plan their actions for the following game turn, because systems left unpowered during the Energy Allocation Phase cannot be used during the turn (there is a rule for Reserve Power which a player can use to power up a ship system mid-turn, but this power comes from the ship's batteries which are few).|$|E

She also embarked on a theater tour {{in the fall of}} 2006. It was her first club-sized tour in roughly two decades. Cole had chosen to sing her 1970s hits in an attempt to draw more R fans.

2500|$|Monolithic kernels, {{which have}} {{traditionally}} been used by Unix-like operating systems, contain all the operating system core functions and the device drivers. This is the traditional design of UNIX systems. A monolithic kernel is one single program that contains all of the code necessary <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> kernel related task. Every part {{which is to be}} accessed by most programs which cannot be put in a library is in the kernel space: Device drivers, Scheduler, Memory handling, File systems, Network stacks. Many system calls are provided to applications, to allow them to access all those services. A monolithic kernel, while initially loaded with subsystems that may not be needed, can be tuned to a point where it is as fast as or faster than the one that was specifically designed for the hardware, although more relevant in a general sense. Modern monolithic kernels, such as those of Linux and FreeBSD, both of which fall into the category of Unix-like operating systems, feature the ability to load modules at runtime, thereby allowing easy extension of the kernel's capabilities as required, while helping to minimize the amount of code running in kernel space. In the monolithic kernel, some advantages hinge on these points: ...|$|E

6000|$|We found a repast {{prepared}} {{for us in}} the ante-room, which we partook of slightly, and rejoined the same servant of Sir Hildebrand who had taken our horses at our entrance, and who had been directed, as he informed Miss Vernon, by Mr. Rashleigh, to wait and attend upon us home. We rode a little way in silence, for, to say truth, my mind was too much bewildered with the events of the morning, to permit me {{to be the first to}} break it. At length Miss Vernon exclaimed, as if giving vent to her own reflections, [...] "Well, Rashleigh is a man to be feared and wondered at, and all but loved; he does whatever he pleases, and makes all others his puppets--has a player ready <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> part which he imagines, and an invention and readiness which supply expedients for every emergency." ...|$|E
6000|$|Vance Corliss {{proceeded}} at a fair rate {{to adapt}} {{himself to the}} Northland life, and he found that many adjustments came easy. While his own tongue was alien to the brimstone of the Lord, he became quite used to strong language {{on the part of}} other men, even in the most genial conversation. Carthey, a little Texan who went to work for him for a while, opened or closed every second sentence, on an average, with the mild expletive, [...] "By damn!" [...] It was also his invariable way of expressing surprise, disappointment, consternation, or {{all the rest of the}} tribe of sudden emotions. By pitch and stress and intonation, the protean oath was made <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> function of ordinary speech. At first it was a constant source of irritation and disgust to Corliss, but erelong he grew not only to tolerate it, but to like it, and to wait for it eagerly. Once, Carthey's wheel-dog lost an ear in a hasty contention with a dog of the Hudson Bay, and when the young fellow bent over the animal and discovered the loss, the blended endearment and pathos of the [...] "by damn" [...] which fell from his lips was a relation to Corliss. All was not evil out of Nazareth, he concluded sagely, and, like Jacob Welse of old, revised his philosophy of life accordingly.|$|E

60|$|Which {{of these}} two men was the more fit {{to come to the}} Communion? Most of you will answer, The publican: for he was more justified, our Lord himself says, than the Pharisee. True: but would you have said so of your own accord, if the Lord had not said so? Which of the two men do you really think was the better man, the Pharisee or the publican? Which of the two do you think had his soul in the safer state? Which of the two would you rather be, {{if you were going to}} die? Which of the two would you rather be, if you were going to the Communion? For mind, one could not have REFUSED the Pharisee, if he had come to the Communion. He was in no open sin: I may say, no outward sin at all. You must not fancy that he was a hypocrite, in the sense in which we usually employ that word. I mean, he was not a man who was leading a wicked life secretly, while he kept up a show of religion. He was really a {{religious}} man in his own way, scrupulous, and over-scrupulous <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>every</b> duty to the letter. He went to his church to worship; and he was no lip-worshipper, repeating a form of words by rote, but prayed there honestly, concerning the things which were in his heart. He did not say, either, that he had made himself good. If he was wrong on some points, he was not on that. He knew where his goodness, such as it was, came from. 'God, I thank thee,' he says, 'that I am what I am.' What have we in this man? one would ask at first sight. What reason for him to stay away from the Sacrament? He would not have thought himself that there was any reason. He would, probably, have thought- -'If I am not fit, who is? Repent me truly of my former sins? Certainly. If I have done the least harm to any one, I shall be happy to restore it fourfold. If I have neglected one, the least of God's services, I shall be only too glad to keep it all the more strictly for the future.|$|E
