He sinks {{into a state of}} sadness and begins to drink away <b>their</b> <b>savings.</b> On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E

40|$|Our paper empirically {{considers}} {{two general}} hypotheses {{related to the}} literature of behavioral economics. First, we test the null hypothesis that individuals behave, on average, in a manner more consistent with the rational expectations hypothesis than {{with the idea of}} self-control in the face of hyperbolic discounting in <b>their</b> <b>saving</b> decisions. Second, along a variety of dimensions, we examine whether individuals exhibit Herbert Simon’s notion that the goal formation of individuals will differ depending upon their relative levels of experience and knowledge. Perhaps there are significant differences among groups in <b>their</b> <b>saving</b> decisions that depend upon their apparent levels of intelligence, education, and knowledge. Finally, using a variety of individual-specific control variables, we test for robustness of the results. ...|$|R

25|$|Under the {{chairmanship}} of Matt Ridley, Northern Rock had a business plan which involved borrowing heavily in the UK and international money markets, extending mortgages to customers based on this funding, and then re-selling these mortgages on international capital markets, {{a process known as}} securitisation. In August 2007, when the global demand from investors for securitised mortgages was falling away, the lack of money raised by this meant that Northern Rock became unable to repay loans from the money market. This problem had been anticipated by the financial markets, which drew greater attention to it. On 14 September 2007, the bank sought and received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, to replace funds it was unable to raise from the money market. This led to panic among individual depositors, who feared that <b>their</b> <b>savings</b> might not be available should Northern Rock go into receivership. The result was a bank run – the UK's first in 150 years – where depositors lined up outside the bank to withdraw all of <b>their</b> <b>savings</b> as quickly as possible, particularly since everyone else was doing the same.|$|E
25|$|After {{conducting}} {{a research project}} that documented a dramatic decrease in mortgage lending between 1968 and 1972, activists launched the Jamaica Plain Community Investment Plan. The plan called upon local citizens to pledge to move <b>their</b> <b>savings</b> accounts to a local institution that would guarantee to invest that money in mortgages within Jamaica Plain. The plan eventually generated five hundred thousand dollars in pledges. In 1975 a contract was signed with the Jamaica Plain Cooperative Bank to implement the Community Investment plan.|$|E
25|$|When people draw <b>their</b> <b>savings</b> {{and invest}} in shares (through an IPO or the {{issuance}} of new company shares of an already listed company), it usually leads to rational allocation of resources because funds, {{which could have been}} consumed, or kept in idle deposits with banks, are mobilized and redirected to help companies' management boards finance their organizations. This may promote business activity with benefits for several economic sectors such as agriculture, commerce and industry, resulting in stronger economic growth and higher productivity levels of firms.|$|E

30|$|From an {{economic}} policy point of view, the results we have obtained in models that relate expectations to socio-economic characteristics contain {{both good and}} bad news, under the assumption that pessimism is justified and the more pessimistic respondents are also the most realistic.

The younger individuals, who are likely to witness changes to the pension system, have time and room to adapt their employment career and <b>their</b> life-cycle <b>saving</b> plans to this new reality, and can minimize an unwanted decline of well-being at retirement.|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{behaviour}} {{of private}} consumption {{is crucial for}} the assessment of the economic situation in the short and the medium term. As the largest expenditure component of GDP, household spending plays {{a central role in the}} cyclical fluctuations of activity around its long-term growth path. According to consumption theory, households endeavour to smooth their spending over the life-cycle, a behaviour which should contribute to dampen the strength of cyclical downswings. However, recent developments in private consumption in the euro area have been disappointing. Since 2001, growth in private consumption has been persistently sluggish and has been much weaker than in some other EU countries or in the USA. Furthermore, after years of a declining trend, households have responded to deteriorating growth conditions with a rise in <b>their</b> <b>saving</b> rate in 2001 - 02.

25|$|Banks {{began to}} fail in October 1930 (one {{year after the}} crash) when farmers {{defaulted}} on loans. There was no federal deposit insurance during that time as bank failures were considered quite common. This worried depositors {{that they might have}} a chance of losing all <b>their</b> <b>savings,</b> therefore, people started to withdraw money and changed it into currency. As deposits taken out from the bank increased, the money supply decreased because the money multiplier worked in reverse, forcing banks to liquidate assets (such as call in loans rather than create new loans.) This caused the money supply to shrink and the economy to contract and a significant decrease in aggregate investment. The decreased money supply further aggravated price deflation, putting further pressure on already struggling businesses.|$|E
