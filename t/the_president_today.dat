40|$|Twenty {{years after}} Ex Corde Ecclesiae, the papal {{proclamation}} that defined {{the relationship between}} the Catholic Church and Catholic institutions of higher education, these institutions continue to seek ways to strengthen their Catholic identities. As they do so they are faced with a decline number of religiously vowed men and women available to lead them. An institution 2 ̆ 7 s history is often linked to the mission of its founding congregation. As members of the congregation become less actively involved, the connection of the institution 2 ̆ 7 s mission to the founding congregation and their particular charism is likely less visbily evident. Additionally, the role of <b>the</b> American university <b>president</b> <b>today</b> is viewed by many to be an almost impossible job. As members of the laity are increasingly assuming the leadership of these institutions, it is important to presidents, their institutions, boards and founding congregations to have a deeper understanding of how <b>the</b> lay <b>president</b> understand <b>the</b> role of supporting and advancing the Catholic mission and how <b>the</b> lay <b>president</b> is prepared to do so. This dissertation provides a broad review {{of the history of the}} mission of Catholic institutions of higher education and of the changing role of <b>the</b> American college <b>president,</b> particularly presidents of Catholic institutions. An in depth qualitative study of one current lay president with ten years of service utilizing interviews, observations and artifact/document reviews was conducted. Three major themes emerged from the data: the significance of <b>the</b> <b>president</b> 2 ̆ 7 s own Catholic identity, his vocation as a Catholic educator, and the intentionality of his leadership for mission specifically. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> 2 ̆ 7 s leadership style is also discussed in relationship to the success of the institution he leads and in context with the leadership styles described in Catholic Higher Education: A Culture in Crisis (Morey and Piderit), 2006) ...|$|R

Jeff Cooper served as <b>the</b> first IPSC <b>President.</b> <b>Today</b> there are over 100 active IPSC regions, making practical shooting a major international sport which emphasizes firearms safety highly.

Only full caliber firearms are used, i.e. for handguns 9x19 mm is the smallest caliber, and the competitors try to achieve most points in the shortest time possible.|$|R

As usual with Dylan reviews the press complained about Dylan's changing of song, beyond recognition sometimes.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedMBA Professional ReportThe national security system <b>the</b> <b>President</b> uses <b>today</b> allows little flexibility and agility {{to protect this}} nation from ever changing national threats. The lack of a common national government culture that facilitates a shared vision is evident. Additionally, the lack of inter-agency coordination and cooperation forces departments to focus on their own objectives and goals. However, with today's challenges, the demand for inter-agency collaboration has grown, {{and it has been}} identified as a necessity to achieve an adequate level of national security for the nation. The national security structure needs to operate as a system rather than a collection of separate components. A whole of government approach to planning, and programming and budgeting national security is a concept that could establish a unified effort between inter-governmental agencies to maximize all available resources in a collaborative effort. "Addressing new security challenges is less about an objective of dominance and more about predicting, preventing, and managing disruptions, such as {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction, terrorist acts, global contagions, and natural disasters. This has led to the call for a whole of government approach to national security" (Gockel, 2008, p. 6). This project investigates how this approach could be developed and implemented across the federal government...|$|R
