5|$|The {{worship of}} Revanta was {{popular in the}} early-mediaeval period, {{particularly}} in Rajasthan. Revanta is mostly depicted in Vaishnava and Surya temples. There is a stone inscription that <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> temple to Revanta, as the principal deity, in Vikranapur (modern Kotgaph, Madhya Pradesh) built by the Kalachuri king Ratnadeva II.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd and 13th rock edicts of Ashoka (273–232 BCE) {{refers to}} the Pandyas, Cholas, Cheras and the Satiyaputras. According to the edicts, these kingdoms lay outside the {{southern}} boundary of the Mauryan Empire. The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga King, Kharavela, (c. 150 BCE) {{refers to the}} arrival of a tribute of jewels and elephants from the Pandyan king. It also <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> league of Tamil kingdoms that had been in existence 113 years before then.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{will analyze}} {{the use of}} the ﬁrst person pronoun “Watashi ha” and “Watashi φ” in conversations about “personal matters”. With {{reference}} to Kushida. s (2006) procedures in the opening of “personal matters talk”, in this paper I will present the following six ways of openings: <b>a)</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> new “personal matter” when inserting reason description/explanation, b) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> common experience as an example, c) emphasizing a contrasting experience as an example, d) creating <b>an</b> opportunity to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> one. s own experience, e) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a topic change, f) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a response. Moreover, I will analyze the frequency of “Watashi ha” and “Watashi φ” in each of the openings. The ﬁndings showed that “Watashi φ” can be used in most of the cases. However, in the case of c) emphasizing a contrasting experience as an example and f) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a response, the use of “Watashi ha” is preferred...|$|R

5|$|The Browns' perfect {{season and}} third {{championship}} victory came during a strong year for Cleveland sports teams. That April, the Cleveland Barons, the city's American Hockey League team, won the Calder Cup championship. The Cleveland Indians, the city's Major League Baseball club, set an all-time season attendance record {{and won the}} World Series. The Browns' success was also a major draw for fans: the team led professional football in attendance in 1948 {{with an average of}} 45,517 people per game, although that was still 10,000 lower than the year before. The distribution of talent and fortune among AAFC's teams was unbalanced, however, and while the Browns, the 49ers and the Dons were successes at the gate, teams including the Rockets and Colts languished financially. The NFL was also facing major financial trouble – nine of its ten teams lost money that year – and the two leagues' competition for talent led to <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> merger. Discussions centered around how many AAFC teams the NFL would absorb; most owners favored four teams, but the talks broke down when powerful owners George Preston Marshall of the Washington Redskins and Tim Mara of the New York Giants intervened and suggested only Cleveland and San Francisco should be absorbed. The AAFC continued play in 1949, but was disbanded after that season. The Browns, 49ers and Colts were merged into the NFL starting in 1950.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{two later}} {{historian}}s wrote about Praetextatus.

25|$|When Rebus recovers the book, one {{entry in}} {{particular}} catches his interest. Five years ago, a mysterious fire burned Edinburgh's seedy Central Hotel down.

The entry in the black book <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> poker game that took place on the night the fire happened. However, it is written in cryptic shorthand, with obscure nicknames instead of the real names of the poker players.|$|E
25|$|The union {{had both}} pragmatic and ideological elements. Because {{it was created}} in {{response}} to security concerns, when that threat was believed finished, the confederation's momentum began to die. Senegal unilaterally pulled out its troops from the Gambia when it was threatened by Mauritania (see Problems with Senegambia's border above). Gambia felt its interests were not being protected. The main platform on which union had been built was also the element on which it foundered. The end came on 23 August 1989, when President Diouf decided it was best that the confederation be placed aside after fruitless <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> customs union.|$|E

25|$|The {{size of the}} {{production}} vocabulary ranges from about 50 to 550 words {{at the age of}} 2 years. Influences on the rate of word learning, and thus on the wide range of vocabulary sizes of children of the same age, include the amount of speech children are exposed to by their caregivers as well as differences in how rich the vocabulary in the speech a child hears is. Children also seem to build up their vocabulary faster if the speech they hear is related to their focus of attention more often. This would be the case if a caregiver <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> ball the child is currently looking at.|$|E

25|$|The first track, «Babilla» (Puerto Rican jargon for Courage), {{serves as}} the album's intro, and its concept {{is similar to the}} one in his {{previous}} studio album, Desahogo, being a relief to all that annoys him, mentioning Donald Trump's xenophobia, sexual video games, religion and people who want to take advantage with his music. «Sentimiento» (Spanish for Feeling) <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> beautiful and attractive woman who wants a sincere romantic relationship and getting married instead of money and luxury. «Se Escapa» (Spanish for She Escapes) is about respecting and taking care of one's girlfriend in order to not lose her. «Moriré» (Spanish for I Will Die) is a romantic ballad about dying for a woman if she is no longer interesed in one's feelings after a long relationship, using a lot of analogies centered in animals and nature. «El Silencio Mata» (Spanish for Silence Kills) <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> woman who suffers of domestic violence but needs to talk to someone about that, although she's too scared to denounce his own spouse. «El Corazón Se Pone Bruto» (Spanish for The Heart Gets Stupid) is a moralizing reggaeton about thinking before acting and encouraging the use of preservative, telling two stories about girls that are attracted to men they recently know, both with terrible endings (one girl ends pregnant and the other contracting AIDS). «La Prueba de Farmacia» (Spanish for Pharmacy Test) tells the story about a pregnant teenager who tries to convince her mother that her boyfriend will take care of her whatever happens. «Angelina» tells the story about a low class single mother who have to work as a stripper in order to earn enough money to feed her baby after being abandoned by her boyfriend. «Agua» is about Vico's detention in late 2002 because of porting heroin in his car, complaining about the police and Puerto Rican justice. The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E

Even though no game based on the band was released, Lego avatars of the band members appeared in Lego Rock Band. Roger Daltrey of The Who had stated that a Rock Band-title based on his group's music would be available in 2010; however, no such title was released in 2010, or after that year for that matter. Though Janie Hendrix had stated she allowed for Jimi Hendrix's works {{to be used for}} a Rock Band game to be released in 2010, this was later clarified as licensing several full albums from Hendrix to be made as downloadable content. Harmonix had also considered standalone band games for Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, but neither project proceeded past developing concept art and cinematics.|$|E
