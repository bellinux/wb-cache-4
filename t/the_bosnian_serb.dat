5|$|On 5 March, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> TO {{requested}} {{equipment for}} two companies mobilised in villages around Kupres—Malovan, Rilić and Ravno. The mobilisation {{was motivated by}} poor military intelligence provided by the 30th Partisan Division. It indicated the presence of thousands of HV and Bosnian Croat troops {{in the vicinity of}} Kupres, supported by Leopard 1 tanks drawn from a contingent of approximately 100 Leopards that the JNA believed had been delivered to Croatia. In response, the division was tasked to deploy its elements to Kupres, Ključ, Mrkonjić Grad, Šipovo, Jajce and the Mount Vlašić, take command of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> TO and repel the expected Croatian attack. In order to achieve this, the division mobilised the 1st, 13th and 19th Partisan Brigades—assigning Kupres to the 19th Brigade as its AOR. By 23 March, the brigade received mobilised troops sufficient to set up three companies. Their immediate task was to block the Malovan and Kupreška Vrata mountain passes. The next day, the divisional commander toured the plateau and was informed that the Bosnian Croat forces were in control of the villages of Olovo, Osmanlije and Zlosela, in addition to Kupreška Vrata. On 26 March, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> TO battalion based in Malovan was subordinated to the 19th Partisan Brigade. At this time, both sides had a relatively small portion of their force inside Kupres, while the Bosnian Croat TO held the area adjacently surrounding the town. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> TO and the JNA completely controlled the areas surrounding the Bosnian Croat TO force.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} achieved its objectives, {{and significantly}} contributed, along with Operations Sana and Maestral 2 to forcing <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> leadership to serious peace negotiations.

In the final days of March, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> army started artillery attacks on Bosanski Brod, and the HV 108th Brigade crossed the border adjacent to the town in reply. On 4 April, Serb artillery began shelling Sarajevo. Even though the war originally pitted Bosnian Serbs against non-Serbs in the country, it evolved into a three-sided conflict {{by the end of the}} year, as the Croat–Bosniak War started. By that time, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> army—renamed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) after the Republika Srpska state proclaimed in the Bosnian Serb-held territory—controlled about 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That proportion would not change significantly over the next two years. Republika Srpska was involved in the Croatian War of Independence in a limited capacity, through military and other aid to the RSK, occasional air raids launched from Banja Luka, and most significantly through artillery attacks against urban centres.|$|E
5|$|Operation Mistral 2, officially codenamed Operation Maestral 2, was a Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) and Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO) {{offensive}} in western Bosnia and Herzegovina on 8–15 September 1995 {{as part of}} the Bosnian War. Its objective was to create a security buffer between Croatia and positions held by <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS) and to put the largest Bosnian Serb-held city, Banja Luka, in jeopardy by capturing the towns of Jajce, Šipovo and Drvar.

5|$|Operation Winter '94 was {{the first}} in a series of {{successful}} advances made by the HV and the HVO in or near the Livanjsko field, an elongated flat-bottomed valley surrounded by hills. The region was formally controlled by the HVO, but the HV contributed a substantial force, including commanding officers. The attacks were primarily designed to draw the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) away from the besieged city of Bihać. The secondary objective was threatening the single direct supply route between Drvar in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> Republika Srpska and Knin, the capital of the Croatian Serb Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK).|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kupres (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: Bitka za Kupres) was {{a battle}} of the Bosnian War, fought between the Bosnian Croat Territorial Defence Force (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) {{supported}} by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) troops {{on one side and}} the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA), augmented by <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> TO on the other at the Kupres Plateau, on 3–11 April 1992. During the fighting on 8 April, the Bosnian Croat TO was reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO). The objective of the battle was to control the strategic Kupres Plateau, a major supply route.|$|E
5|$|Following a new {{military}} {{strategy of the}} United States endorsed by Bill Clinton since February 1993, the Washington Agreement was signed by Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1994. The agreement ended the Croat–Bosniak War and established the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The political settlement allowed the ARBiH and the HVO to deploy additional troops against the VRS {{in a series of}} small-scale attacks designed to wear down <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> military, but the attacks claimed no territorial gains before October. The ARBiH adopted an attrition warfare strategy relying on its numerical superiority compared to the VRS, which suffered from manpower shortages. This strategy aimed for limited advances, without support of heavy weapons and means of transportunavailable to the ARBiH at the time.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Republika Srpska {{authorities}} charged seven Bosnian Croat {{officials and}} HVO officers with the killings of 19 Serb civilians and 20 members of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> TO {{in the area}} of Kupres in 1992. The charges also pertained to the abuse of 18 prisoners of war captured in the Battle of Kupres. In 2013, Croatian authorities in Šibenik charged 21 former members of the JNA with the abuse of 23 HVO prisoners of war. The charges specify that the prisoners were detained and abused in Knin prison between 24 April and 14 May. The abuse is alleged to have caused the deaths of two of the prisoners and grave injuries to three others.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1992, a Bosnian Serb {{state was}} declared, {{ahead of the}} 29 February1 March {{referendum}} on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinalater cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War). <b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> state was later renamed Republika Srpska. As the JNA withdrew from Croatia it started to transform into a Bosnian Serb army, handing over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops. The process was completed in May, when <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> army became the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). It was faced by the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), established in April, and the Bosnia and Herzegovina TOrenamed the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH) in May. Formal establishment of these forces was preceded by the first armed clashes in the country as the Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1March and the situation rapidly escalated. Bosnian Serb artillery began shelling Bosanski Brod {{by the end of}} March, and Sarajevo was first shelled on 4April. By the end of 1992, the VRS held 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina, following a large-scale campaign of conquest and ethnic cleansing backed by military and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Bosnian War gradually evolved into a three-sided conflict. The initial ARBiH–HVO alliance soon deteriorated as the forces became rivals for control of parts of the country. Ethnic tensions escalated from apparently insignificant harassment in July, to an open Croat–Bosniak War by October 1992. The Bosnian Croat authorities, organized in the Herzeg-Bosnia territory, were intent on attaching the region to Croatia. This was incompatible with Bosniak aspirations for a unitary state.|$|E
5|$|According to the JNA, the Bosnian Croat TO {{attacked}} {{in the morning}} of 3 April, reached the village of Donji Malovan and blockaded the Kupreška Vrata Tunnel by 7:30a.m. The village was captured by Croats after three hours of combat, and the fighting shifted towards the village of Gornji Malovan and Kupres. By the end of the day, <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> TO force in Gornji Malovan was besieged. The JNA instructed the Yugoslav Air Force to attack after it received reports that 15 HV tanks had appeared on the battlefield. The 30th Partisan Division staff amended the plans formulated the previous day and advanced with elements of the 11th Motorised Brigade towards Kupres via Zlosela, against positions held by the Kupres Battalion at 1:15p.m. The change of plans enabled elements of the 13th Partisan Brigade to catch up to them by 6:00p.m. and caused the attack to fail.|$|E

5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. At the same time, the JNA and <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April.|$|E
5|$|In September 1991, Bosnian Serbs proclaimed a Serbian Autonomous Oblast with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the Bosnian {{referendum}} on independence was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, although Bosnian Serbs either boycotted it or were prevented from voting by Bosnian Serb authorities. A poorly organized, local Bosniak Patriotic League paramilitary group {{had been established}} in response to <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> proclamation. On 31 March, the Patriotic League in Bijeljina was provoked into fighting by local Serbs and the SDG. On 1–2 April, the SDG and the JNA took over Bijeljina with little resistance; murders, rapes, house searches, and pillaging followed. These actions were described as genocidal by the historian Professor Eric D. Weitz of the City College of New York. Professor Michael Sells of the University of Chicago concluded that they were carried out to erase the cultural history of the Bosniak people of Bijeljina.|$|E
5|$|Operation Sana, {{as well as}} Operation Maestral 2, {{were crucial}} in {{applying}} pressure on the VRS in the final weeks of the Bosnian War. A Central Intelligence Agency analysis comparing the effects of Operation Deliberate Force, Sana and Maestral 2 on the VRS noted that the NATO campaign did not degrade the combat capability of the VRS as much as was initially assumed, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units, rather they targeted the command and control infrastructure of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> military. The analysis concluded that, while NATO degraded {{the capabilities of the}} VRS, the final HV, HVO and ARBiH offensives inflicted the most damage. It further noted that those offensives, rather than the NATO bombing, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table and ending the war. Author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV, HVO and ARBiH would not have advanced as rapidly as they did had NATO not intervened and denied the VRS its long-range communications.|$|E

Shortly thereafter the Serbs threatened to overrun the Muslim city of Goražde in eastern Bosnia.

5|$|The Battle of Vrbanja Bridge was {{an armed}} {{confrontation}} which occurred on 27 May 1995 between United Nations (UN) peacekeepers from the French Army and elements of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). It occurred after the VRS seized French-manned United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) observation posts {{on both ends}} of the Vrbanja Bridge crossing of the Miljacka river in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War. Upon seizing the bridge, the VRS took the French peacekeepers hostage. A platoon of 30 French peacekeepers subsequently re-captured the bridge with the support of 70 French infantrymen and direct fire from armoured vehicles, in an action which saw the first French Army bayonet charge since the Korean War. During the French assault, elements of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) opened fire on the VRS-held observation posts, accidentally wounding one French hostage.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} of the HV increased dramatically {{in the first few}} months of 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February1 March 1992 referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the HVO.|$|E

Dangić also obtained a law degree and spent some time as a district officer in Belgrade, Subotica, Kratovo and Vlasenica. By 1928, he had achieved the rank of cavalry sub-lieutenant. He joined the gendarmerie on 3 January 1928, and worked his way up to the rank of major. Over the course of his gendarmerie service, he served in Skopje, Tuzla, Virovitica, and Zagreb. In 1940, he was appointed to lead the gendarmerie detachment stationed at the Yugoslav royal palace. He was married and had two daughters, born in 1931 and 1937.|$|E
