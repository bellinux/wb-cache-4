5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pinnacle of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king {{feared that the}} Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs {{was so great that}} the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
5|$|Douglas MacArthur (26 January 18805 April 1964) was an American five-star {{general and}} Field Marshal of the Philippine Army. He was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s {{and played a}} {{prominent}} role in the Pacific theater during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign, which made him and his father Arthur MacArthur Jr., the first father and son to be awarded the medal. He was one of only five men ever <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rank of General of the Army in the US Army, and the only man ever to become a field marshal in the Philippine Army.|$|E

5|$|During the Tudor {{conversion}} of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, {{as well as those}} of local lords, were kept.|$|E
5|$|Opponents in The Baltimore Sun {{alleged that}} Byrd {{emphasized}} athletics over academics and belittled {{him as the}} only college football coach <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> position of university president. Among the campus expansions, Byrd {{was responsible for the}} construction of Byrd Stadium in 1950 and Cole Field House in 1955, which at the time was the largest basketball arena in the Southern Conference. Critics alleged that both facilities were constructed at the expense of campus libraries. Byrd also built the University of Maryland Golf Course in 1959. Byrd resigned from the post in 1953 and his tenure ended effectively on December 31.|$|E
5|$|Patroclus was {{a leading}} {{official}} and admiral under Ptolemy II, {{best known for his}} activity during the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). His early career is obscure, but it must have been distinguished enough for him <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chief priesthood of Alexander and the Theoi Adelphoi in 271/270 BC. After the outbreak of the Chremonidean War, he led a diplomatic and military expedition to the Aegean Sea that expanded Ptolemaic control by establishing bases at Crete, Ceos, Thera, Attica and the Argolid. From these bases he tried, without much success, to aid the Athenians against Antigonus II Gonatas, King of Macedon. He may have been the defeated Ptolemaic commander at the Battle of Cos, which marked the end of Ptolemaic thalassocracy.|$|E

5|$|Sheev Palpatine, {{also known}} as Darth Sidious and The Emperor, is a fictional {{character}} {{and one of the}} primary antagonists of the Star Wars franchise, mainly portrayed by Ian McDiarmid. In the original trilogy, he is depicted as the aged, pale-faced and cloaked Emperor of the Galactic Empire and the master of Darth Vader. In the prequel trilogy, he is portrayed as a charismatic Senator from Naboo who uses deception and political manipulation <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> position of Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, and then reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on plant matter and animals both {{on land and}} in water. It eats prey such as beetles, millipedes, and slugs. Also, wood turtles consume {{specific}} fungi (Amanita muscaria and Leccinum arcolatum), mosses, grasses, various insects, and also carrion. On occasion, {{it can be seen}} stomping the ground with alternating hits of the left and right front feet. This behavior is thought to imitate the sound of falling rain, sometimes causing earthworms <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface where they quickly become easy prey. When hunting, the wood turtle pokes its head into such areas as dead and decaying logs, the bottoms of bushes, and in other vegetation. In the water, it exhibits similar behavior, searching algae beds and cavities along the sides of the stream or river.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects. Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation, to discontinuous gas exchange. During continuous gas exchange, oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle. In discontinuous gas exchange, however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest. Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. As larvae, many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water, while others need <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water surface to replenish air supplies, which may be held or trapped in special structures.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E
