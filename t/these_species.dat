5|$|In March 2013, three {{endangered}} commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip, and porbeagle {{were added}} to Appendix II of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of <b>these</b> <b>species</b> under licensing and regulation.|$|E
40|$|In Barents Sea, {{there are}} {{especially}} three species of zooplankton preying fish {{which have been}} of great commercial value: the Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod (Gadus morhua), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring (Clupea harengus). There is a prey-predator relationship between <b>these</b> three <b>species,</b> that is, capelin is predated by the juvenile herring and cod, whereas the cod may also feed on juvenile herring. On the other hand, the fishmen harvest <b>these</b> three <b>species</b> to gain profit as many as possible. Therefore, the harvesting of <b>these</b> three <b>species</b> has both biological and economic value. This thesis seeks to find an optimal policy of harvesting <b>these</b> three <b>species</b> so as to maximize the net present value...|$|R

5|$|Puerto Rico's turtle fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of <b>these</b> <b>species,</b> the hawksbill turtle and the leatherback sea turtle, are critically endangered. Threats to <b>these</b> <b>species</b> include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The spectacled caiman, an introduced species, {{is the only}} representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} {{to the expansion}} of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most of <b>these</b> <b>species</b> occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species seems to have taken place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of <b>these</b> <b>species</b> cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E

50|$|Laidlaw and Fraser {{considered}} {{that this can}} be a synonym of L. concinna. M.A. Lieftinck (1934) synonymised <b>these</b> two <b>species</b> and after that <b>these</b> two <b>species</b> were considered synonyms until 1960; he himself restored the status of these as two different species (Lieftinck 1960).|$|R
5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all <b>these</b> <b>species</b> increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of <b>these</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} 14 species of {{amphibians}} in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, of which 11 breed in the watershed. <b>These</b> <b>species</b> consist of 6 salamanders, 6 frogs, one newt, and one toad. There are seven species of reptiles in the watershed, of which five breed there. Five of <b>these</b> <b>species</b> are snakes and two are turtles. The biodiversity of birds in the watershed {{is much greater than}} that of amphibians or reptiles; there are approximately one hundred different species of birds in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. A total of 29 mammals have been observed in the creek's watershed, including three species of bats, two species of mice, and two species of foxes.|$|E

5|$|Amanita ceciliae is {{considered}} an edible mushroom and used as food, although many field guides recommend to avoid eating it. Others recommend it as a good edible species. A study of 16 edible mushrooms was done to learn about their chemical compositions and antioxidant activities. Among <b>these</b> <b>species,</b> A.ceciliae and Pleurotus ostreatus were the two mushrooms that showed most powerful radical scavenging activities.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{living on}} the volcano include the {{mountain}} tapir and spectacled bear, {{both of which are}} designated as threatened. Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the rufous-fronted parakeet, bearded helmetcrest, and Herveo plump toad. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of <b>these</b> <b>species</b> confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, <b>these</b> <b>species</b> rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. <b>These</b> <b>species</b> live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|Aside from carp, {{several species}} of fish and {{amphibians}} still inhabited the creek up to the 1980s, when floods destroyed much of the remaining riparian habitat. These included the mosquito fish, bluegill, bass, and channel catfish, as well as {{several species of}} native frogs. After the floods, most of <b>these</b> <b>species</b> were reported to have disappeared completely.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes readily hybridises with Banksia hookeriana (Hooker's banksia) under {{experimental}} conditions, {{indicating that}} <b>these</b> <b>species</b> have highly compatible pollen.

5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of <b>these</b> <b>species</b> are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|Brooding {{species are}} most often ahermatypic (not reef-building) in areas of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is {{negatively}} buoyant, sinking on to the waiting egg carriers who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks. Synchronous spawning events sometimes occurs even with <b>these</b> <b>species.</b> After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but <b>these</b> <b>species</b> only grow on pine cones.|$|E
40|$|Sexual isolation, {{the reduced}} {{tendency}} to mate, {{is one of}} the reproductive barri-ers that prevent gene flow between different species. Various species-specific sig-nals during courtship contribute to sexual isolation between species. Drosophila albomicans and D. nasuta are closely related species of the nasuta subgroup within the Drosophila immigrans group and are distributed in allopatry. We analyzed mating behavior and courtship as well as cuticular hydrocarbon profiles within and between species. Here, we report that <b>these</b> two <b>species</b> randomly mated with each other. We did not observe any sexual isolation between species or between strains within species by multiple-choice tests. Significant difference in the courtship index was detected between <b>these</b> two <b>species,</b> but males and females of both species showed no discrimination against heterospec-ific partners. Significant quantitative variations in cuticular hydrocarbons between <b>these</b> two <b>species</b> were also found, but the cuticular hydrocarbons appear to play a negligible role in both courtship and sexual isolation between <b>these</b> two <b>species.</b> In contrast to the evident postzygotic isolation, the lack of sexual isolation between <b>these</b> two <b>species</b> suggests that the evolution of pre-mating isolation may lag behind that of the intergenomic incompatibility, which might be driven by intragenomic conflicts...|$|R
