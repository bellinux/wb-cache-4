[...] "They {{were out of}} their element in New York, hustled by a chap with an English accent," [...] said Dowd of Barber.

[...] "Dreams", which later gained regard among band members as {{the high point of}} the record, was the only song in which the group got stuck, due to Duane Allman's displeasure with his guitar solo. The performance captured on record came when Duane instructed the other members to turn off all the lights in the studio after the day's session, and sat in a corner beside his amp and baffle. Allman played slide guitar (which was not employed in previous attempts) and improvised the overdubbed performance, bringing all of the members to tears. [...] "It was unbelievable," [...] recalled Trucks. [...] "It was just magic. It’s always been that the greatest music we played was from out of nowhere, that it wasn’t practiced, planned, or discussed." ...|$|E
