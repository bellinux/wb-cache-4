5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with such moments of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the political control of England, first from the Crown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce {{the power of the}} Lords. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has absolute power when it comes to money bills.|$|E

He was a national political figure by this point, and his third delegate service touched on such national issues as the sale of public lands.|$|E

5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E
5|$|At the 1953 election, {{the young}} lawyer Don Dunstan was elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Assembly as the Labor member for Norwood, ousting the LCL incumbent.

Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|E
