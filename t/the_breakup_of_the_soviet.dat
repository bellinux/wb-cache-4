5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and unemployment {{of many of the}} weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E

5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Russia {{inherited}} most of {{its military}} arsenal including its large complement of MRLs. In recent history, they {{have been used by}} Russian forces during the First and Second Chechen Wars and by Armenian and Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Georgian government forces are reported to have used BM-21 or similar rocket artillery in fighting in the 2008 South Ossetia war.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union a {{few years}} earlier, the Russian economy had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, {{a great deal of}} Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E
5|$|The 1789 {{discovery}} of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot {{was the first}} person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety.

25|$|The {{cultural}} and linguistic effects of russification manifest themselves in persistent identity questions.

25|$|With {{the victory}} of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the red flag, with a hammer to symbolize the workers and sickle to symbolize peasants, became the {{official}} flag of Russia, and, in 1923, of the Soviet Union.

25|$|In 1978, {{construction}} was {{started on the}} Saint Petersburg Dam aiming to protect Saint Petersburg from the frequent floods.

25|$|The Russian seal hunt has {{not been}} well {{monitored}} since <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. The quota in 1998 was 35,000 animals. Reportedly, many whitecoat pups are not properly killed and are transported, while injured, to processing areas.

25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, {{the former}} Sino-Soviet border was now shared by Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. While the {{majority}} of the disputed territories lay in the west, the Russian Federation inherited only about 50km (26mi) of the former western Sino-Soviet border. China negotiated separate border agreements with each of the post-Soviet republics on its western borders. (See e.g. the China–Kazakhstan border).|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} their {{critical}} and commercial success, the band's music was often eclipsed by its internal conflicts, stemming from Doherty's addictions to crack cocaine and heroin, which eventually led to <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band. Doherty has since stated that <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band was due to relationship difficulties between Barât and himself that were not related to his drug addictions. <b>The</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Libertines went on to form new bands {{with varying degrees of}} success.|$|R
25|$|In summary, the country's {{participants}} earned 15 medals: 3 gold, 5 {{silver and}} 7 bronze. The 3 gold medals {{was the worst}} ever result for Russia since competing after <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, while the 15 total medals were the country's second lowest output after the 2002 Winter Games.

25|$|The 1991 Sino-Soviet Border Agreement was {{a treaty}} between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union {{that set up}} {{demarcation}} work to resolve most of the border disputes between the two states.

25|$|The {{population}} of Russia peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, just before <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Low birth rates and abnormally high death rates caused Russia's population to decline at a 0.5% annual rate, or about 750,000 to 800,000 people per {{year from the}} mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. The UN warned in 2005 that Russia's then {{population of}} about 143 million could fall by a third by 2050, if trends did not improve.|$|E
