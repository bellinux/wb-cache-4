Coarse threads install much faster as they require fewer turns per unit length. Finer threads are stronger as they have a larger stress area for the same diameter thread.

In C. japonica, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and thread torque follow {{the profile of}} clamp force: first rising, then falling after reaching a peak value. The initial, sharp rise in <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and thread torque is likely the initial driving torque when the lag screw head pressed against the bearing surface. Similar behavior was observed in P. menziesii at all tightening speeds and in C. obtusa at tightening speeds of 10 and 20  rpm.

30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{equipment}} for bolting, {{there are two main}} methods for increasing bolt’s prestress (Kang and Wang 2007): one is to increase the bolt-nut tightening torque; the second is to use a bolt tensioning device, which is similar to imposing large prestresses on anchor bolts. The methods for improving bolt-nut <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> include: (1) high torque jumbolter. With a high torque jumbolter, it can not only increase the bolt <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> but also achieve an integration of bolt installation to improve installation speed. For instance, the torque of the jumbolter used with continuous miner can reach more than 300  N m. The rated torque of a single jumbolter in China is not greater than 150  N m, and unable to meet the requirement of high <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> of the bolt. (2) Torque multiplier. In order to improve the installation torque of the jumbolter, a torque multiplier can be used on the jumbolter to multiply the nut <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> when installing bolt. (3) Torque wrench. Using a large torque preload wrench to tighten the bolts and nuts is an effective way to improve the prestress of anchor bolts.|$|E

The first phase of this study used nine EH implants and abutments that were divided into three groups with different amounts of bacterial suspension (n= 3) : V 0. 5 : 0. 5 µL; V 1. 0 : 1. 0 µL e V 1. 5 : 1. 5 µL, and tightened to the manufacturer's recommended torque. The second phase of this experiment used 27 assemblies that {{were similar to those}} used in the first phase. These samples were inoculated with 0. 5 µL of bacterial suspension and divided into three groups (n= 9). T 10 : 10 Ncm; T 20 : 20 Ncm and T 32 : 32 Ncm. The samples were evaluated according to the turbidity of the broth every 24 hours for 14 days, and the bacteria viability was tested after that period. The statistical evaluation was conducted by Kruskal-Wallis testing (p<. 05). RESULTS: During the first phase, groups V 1. 0 and V 1. 5 was presented with bacterial contamination in all samples after 24 h.

Since a major percentage bolt <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> is resisted by frictional forces especially {{towards the end of}} tightening, and since the coefficient of friction in threads and under the bolt head to a large degree is indeterminate, the best method of ensuring desired clamping load is by measurement of bolt elongation, or by a load cell. However in large number of cases the incorporation of load cell is not practical and bolt elongation is insufficient to allow accurate measurement. ln such cases it becomes necessary to produce the desired end load by applying a specified torque to the bolt leading to the determination of nut factor. for each of the cases Here an attempt has been made to obtain the quantitative values of nut factors for bolted joints as a function of bolt diameter and <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> applied on bolted joints.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the fatigue}} {{behaviour}} of aluminium alloy 7075 -T 6 in bolted joints {{has been studied}} where the joint plates may suffer from fretting fatigue phenomenon under applied clamping forces and oscillatory displacements. The main aim was to improve the fretting fatigue resistance of the aluminium joint by means of surface coatings method. First, the isolated effect of the bolt clamping force on the fatigue strength of a bolt-filled hole was studied {{in the absence of}} fretting. The results showed beneficial compressive stresses around the aluminium bolted holes with localised maximum magnitudes at the critical edge of the hole where there is a high tensile stress concentration {{as a result of the}} applied tensile load. The presence of the clamping compressive stresses was confirmed at different environmental temperatures of - 50, 25 and 60 °C as typical flight temperatures. The compressive stress clearly reduced the net effect of the damaging cyclic longitudinal tensile stress which causes fatigue crack initiations and propagation due to the applied loads. Therefore, the fatigue strength of the bolted plates was substantially improved using higher <b>tightening</b> <b>torques</b> at the three tested environmental temperatures. In the second part of this study, the fatigue behaviour of Al 7075 -T 6 plates coated with two different coating materials was investigated. Titanium nitride (TiN) and nickel-phosphorous (Ni-P) coatings were deposited onto the aluminium substrate using physical vapour deposition (PVD) and electroless nickel (EN) plating processes, respectively. These coating materials were selected because of their favourable characteristics mainly for fretting fatigue considerations such as high hardness, low friction and good wear resistance. However, high operating temperature of the PVD process reduced the mechanical properties as well as fatigue strength of the aluminium substrate coated with TiN. Therefore, a post heat treatment was developed to restore the lost properties. Although the applied heat treatment substantially improved the tensile and fatigue strengths of the coated material, the lost properties were not fully recovered to achieve the original properties of Al 7075 -T 6. A double-lap bolted joint specimen was then designed and manufactured from the aluminium plates and subsequently coated with Ni-P coatings with a high phosphorous content of 10 - 13 wt%. Different <b>tightening</b> <b>torques</b> were applied to clamp the plates together with the aim of studying the effect of clamping force on the fretting fatigue life of the coated joints. Ni-P coatings were successfully found to protect Al 7075 -T 6 clamped plates against fretting fatigue damages even at low fatigue loads where the uncoated joints showed a large reduction in their fatigue life due to the fretting effects. Fretting fatigue life of moderately and firmly clamped plates was improved by 35 % and 59 % respectively after the application of Ni-P coatings...|$|R

The process of pre-tightening of bolted joints was simulated to validate the finite element model. The curves for the relationship between the torque and initial load obtained from finite element analysis agree well with those calculated from theoretical equations.

40|$|Surgeons {{generally}} use subjective feel {{to tighten}} bone screws {{as much as}} possible without stripping the threads; however, subsequent fixation failures are common, particularly in osteoporotic bone. We hypothesise that if the preload generated in reduced bone quality and it’s dissipation over time was better understood, then some of these failures could be avoided through the use of more appropriate fastening torques or a different number of screws. This ongoing study aims to develop a validated finite element model capable of predicting the preload generated for different bone densities and cortical thicknesses. To date, experimental tests (n= 10) were conducted using bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the bone-implant pressure (LLW Prescale Fuji Film) and surface strains (Ncorr v 1. 2, G. I. T.) for a range of <b>tightening</b> <b>torques.</b> The bone density (assessed using CT-images) and cortical thickness of each specimen were recorded.

The predicted bone-implant pressure also compared favorably with a pressure varying between 2. 5 and 0 MPa. Using an experimentally derived relationship between fastening torque and bone-implant pressure, the model has the potential to predict preload for any bone quality.
