50|$|Contrary {{to common}} {{belief in the}} United States, the largest {{financial}} center for derivatives (and for foreign exchange) is London. According to MarketWatch on December 7, 2006,The global foreign exchange market, easily the largest financial market, is dominated by London. More than half of <b>the</b> <b>trades</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> derivatives market are handled in London, which straddles the time zones between Asia and the U.S. And <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> rooms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Square Mile, as the City of London financial district is known, are responsible for almost three-quarters of <b>the</b> <b>trades</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secondary fixed-income markets.|$|R

5|$|Having earlier {{rejected}} the Western-led environmentalist movement, China changed its stance in the 1980s {{and became a}} party to the CITES treaty. By 1993 it had banned <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> tiger parts, and this diminished the use of tiger bones in traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E
5|$|Historically, tigers {{have been}} hunted {{at a large}} scale so their famous striped skins could be collected. <b>The</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before {{international}} conservation efforts took effect.

25|$|Williams {{specialised}} in {{the study}} of the abolition of <b>the</b> slave <b>trade.</b> <b>In</b> 1944 his book Capitalism and Slavery argued that the British abolition of their Atlantic slave <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> 1807 was motivated primarily by economics—rather than by altruism or humanitarianism. By extension, so was the emancipation of the slaves and the fight against <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> slaves by other nations. As industrial capitalism and wage labour began to expand, eliminating the competition from slavery became economically advantageous.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{evidence of the}} wealth brought by the slave trade there are several significant links to the abolitionists. Bristol's Hannah More was an influential member of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the African Slave Trade. In the Seven Stars Public House Thomas Clarkson collected evidence for William Wilberforce on the cruelty of <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> humans. Bristol Cathedral contains several memorials to people active in the abolition cause, including a bust of Robert Southey. John Wesley opposed <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> humans and in 1774 his sermon at the New Room against slavery was disturbed by explosion. Several plays adopted by the abolitionists were performed at the Bristol Old Vic, including Oroonoko, {{the story of an}} enslaved African and The Padlock, which was praised by Clarkson for its importance to the abolition cause.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are {{commonly}} used in traditional medicine across their geographic range, a practice that has been reported since at least 1900. Thousands of slow lorises are captured each year for such use. Many human factors drive <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> slow loris parts, including social customs, economic factors, and traditional belief systems.|$|E
5|$|The Kimberley Process was {{developed}} to monitor <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> rough diamonds and prevent their being used to fund violence. Before exporting, rough diamonds are certificated {{by the government of}} the country of origin. Some countries, such as Venezuela, are not party to the agreement. The Kimberley Process does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{international}} <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> parrots is {{a lucrative}} enterprise, and forms {{an important part}} of <b>the</b> international wildlife <b>trade.</b> As parrots have become increasingly endangered, many countries have placed restrictions on <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> and/or prohibited <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> altogether. Despite <b>the</b> restriction on <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> many countries however, the market still operates both legally and illegally.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} large dataset to explore whether <b>the</b> {{liberalization}} of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services is beneficial for <b>the</b> international <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods. We find empirical evidence supporting this notion. We investigate which types of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services are more important for <b>the</b> international <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods and find that <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> transportation and communication services generate the largest impacts on <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods. We also investigate which types of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods are likely to benefit from <b>the</b> liberalization of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> services and find that, under the 2 -digit ISTC classification, all the categories are likely to exhibit a positive impact.

5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari further developed <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his {{photographs in the}} images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E
5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Braşov was granted a staple right in 1369 with respect to <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.|$|E
5|$|Post-independence, {{there was}} growing black resentment towards the Asian {{domination}} of the small business sector. Kenyatta's government put pressure on these Asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with African-owned counterparts. In 1965, the government established the Kenya National Trading Corporation to ensure indigenous control over <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> essential commodities, while the Trade Licensing Act of 1967 prohibited non-citizens from involvement in the rice, sugar, and maize trade. During the 1970s, this was expanded to cover <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> soap, cement, and textiles. Many Asians had retained their British citizenship rather than taking on Kenyan citizenship and were affected by these measures, with their work permits not being renewed. The government established the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation to provide loans for black-owned businesses, and secured a 51% share in the Kenya National Assurance Company. It also passed laws to encourage foreign investment, recognising that Kenya needed foreign-trained specialists in scientific and technical fields to aid its economic development. Under Kenyatta, Western companies regarded Kenya as a safe and profitable place for investment.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{regional}} <b>trade</b> agreements (RTA) {{have been}} one of the important developments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>trading</b> system <b>in</b> 1990 s.

The study uses a panel regression analysis by using balance panel data. The study concludes that the FTA between India and Sri Lanka has brought positive results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> between these two nations by improving <b>the</b> bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> goods. <b>The</b> results of the study are important in the context of looking for the prospects of a free <b>trade</b> area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region by member nations...|$|R
5|$|The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 safeguarded {{the rights}} of labour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestock. This {{legislation}} ensured that such tenants could not be evicted without a court order or if they were {{over the age of}} 65. Recognising that arms manufacturing was a key industry for the South African economy, Mandela endorsed <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> weapons but brought in tighter regulations surrounding Armscor to ensure that South African weaponry was not sold to authoritarian regimes. Under Mandela's administration, tourism was increasingly promoted, becoming a major sector of the South African economy.|$|E
5|$|The Mail coach service began {{towards the}} end of the 18th century, adding to the {{existing}} use of fast coaches. The horses required for fast coaches were mainly produced by outcrossing heavy farm mares to the lighter racing type of horse, as a combination of speed, agility, endurance and strength was required. While the aristocracy and gentry paid high prices for matched teams of quality horses, farmers sold the best of their animals at a good profit, keeping lower-quality animals for themselves, or for sale as saddle horses. The coaching trade grew from <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> carriage of goods; some public transport was provided by farmers, who could keep large numbers of horses on their own farms more cheaply than those who had to buy in food and forage. However, proprietors of coaching inns accounted for most of <b>the</b> <b>trade.</b> <b>In</b> many cases a proprietor would work his horse teams only in his local district, but some owned many coaching establishments, and could provide transport over much greater distances. An advantage to proprietors of a string of coaching inns was that passengers on their coaches also used and paid for the services offered by their inns, often including overnight accommodation. Some inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, on March 3, 2010, Torres {{was traded}} to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for defenceman Nathan Paetsch and a second-round draft pick. He had recorded 19 goals and 31 points over 60 games with Columbus before <b>the</b> <b>trade.</b> <b>In</b> 14 games with Buffalo, he notched five assists. The Sabres entered the 2010 playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference. They were eliminated in the first round by the Boston Bruins. Torres' play struggled against the Bruins and he was benched for the final two games of the series. He recorded two assists over four playoff games.|$|E

5|$|The present {{town was}} {{established}} in 1764 by the General Trade Company as the trading post of Holsteinsborg ("Fort Holstein"), named for the first chairman of the Danish College of Missions in Copenhagen which underwrote and directed the missionary work in the colony. At {{the time of its}} founding, the Kalaallisut name of the place was Amerlok, after its fjord. The colonists formally established several villages in the region, of which only two remain to this day: Itilleq and Sarfannguit. Under the Royal Greenland Trading Department, Holsteinsborg was a center of <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> reindeer skins.|$|E
5|$|With {{his father}} usually not home (and {{eventually}} meeting his death) {{because of a}} military career, Van Rensselaer's mother sent him to apprentice with his uncle, Wolfert van Bijler, a jeweler and diamond merchant. At the time, the gem trade was a prosperous enterprise to join, being a well-developed craft. In those days, the diamond trade was nearly always combined with <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> pearls, other articles of luxury, and rarities of every description. Dutch jewelers found a ready market for their valuable wares at the Dutch imperial court and the smaller German courts. This realm of work promoted Van Rensselaer {{to a life of}} economic success.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Sélestat {{had a total}} {{population}} of 19,332, which makes it the eighth most populous town in Alsace.

Sélestat was founded in the 8th century as a port on the Ill and it experienced a long period of prosperity thanks to <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> wine and a thriving religious and cultural life. It gradually declined after the Reformation and the French conquest in the 17th century.
