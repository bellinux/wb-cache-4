40|$|Graduation date: 1991 This study {{examined}} the experience of three secondary science student teachers from Western Oregon State College in Monmouth, Oregon during the Spring quarter of 1990. The question was: What is student teaching like {{from the point of}} view of the student teacher?

Data sources included audio taped journals from the student teachers, transcribed audio tapes from seminars, video tapes of teaching, rich descriptions from field notes made by the researcher, a journal from one cooperating teacher, and a journal kept by the researcher. Analysis of the data set produced 81 coding categories. A data set was marked, cut and filed under these coding categories. Patterns and generalizations were drawn from the categorized data set. The three student teachers had widely varied experiences. The analysis of data resulted in the generation of seven hypotheses concerning student teaching. They were as follows: 1.

This study focused on preservice teachers' theoretical orientations to the reading process and examined the relationship of undergraduate coursework and the senior student teaching experience to these orientations. Theoretical orientations to the reading process were determined through the administration of DeFord's Theoretical Orientation to Reading Profile (TORP). Subjects included 35 undergraduate elementary education majors enrolled in reading methods courses and student teaching across three semesters, and the 35 cooperating teachers of the student subjects. Three hypotheses were tested during the five phases of the study. Hypothesis 1 examined the relationship between subjects' theoretical orientations to reading and their reading methods coursework. Hypothesis 2 focused on <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> and the theoretical orientations of the cooperating teachers. Hypothesis 3 examined changes that may have occurred in the subjects' theoretical orientations from pre-coursework to post-student teaching. Three conclusions can be drawn from the data analyses.

Efforts presume that an increased evidence-based education system will solve the problems facing education (Cochran-Smith, 2006). Conversations and subsequent policy development have targeted university teacher preparation programs with goals of improving candidate preparedness and effectiveness in the classroom {{in order to raise}} student achievement. In this paper I instead argue that a central problem with teacher preparation programs are issues embedded within a larger dilemma; the fragmentation and lack of programmatic structure between university preparation programs and school districts. I suggest that school districts should be the driving force in developing more integrative approaches to teacher preparation by investing in the preparation and induction of <b>student</b> teachers into <b>the</b> career. However, to realize this opportunity districts must reimagine their roles and responsibilities in the student-teaching preparation process. This paper will suggest and provide organizational structures, frameworks and tools to support school districts in looking at the investment beyond <b>the</b> initial <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> to align practices with induction and orientation practices in order to prepare, hire and retain more highly qualified teachers...|$|R
40|$|The {{semester}} {{an education}} major spends <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> {{continues to be}} both vital and significant {{as it is the}} culmination of three to four years of intense teacher training. A major becomes a teacher through the course of this semester, and a failure in this stretch of the course results in failure to become a teacher. An education major must put to practice the methods and philosophies he or she has studied, and some are not successful. For these reasons, <b>the</b> traditional <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> has grown obsolete. It no longer prepares education majors to become successful teachers. Schools and students are changing and these changes affect the methods and philosophies that student teachers are supposed to be putting to practice during their semester of <b>student</b> <b>teaching.</b> <b>The</b> traditional <b>experience</b> does not require student teachers to leave the safety of a classroom to explore the boundaries of the school. It does not require <b>the</b> <b>student</b> teacher to interact with <b>students</b> outside of <b>the</b> classroom. And it does not allow a student teacher to prepare academically for the challenge of teaching the variety of subjects offered students today. At this time, there must be change, which is why I chose to participate in <b>the</b> Carmel Clay <b>Student</b> <b>Teaching</b> Internship's pilot year. The purpose of this thesis is to not only explaining the program itself, but to detail some of my experiences as well as convey my retrospective opinions about the program. I hope that through my participation in the program and through my thesis, this program will be improved upon and eventually become the standard rather than <b>the</b> exception for <b>student</b> <b>teaching.</b> Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the views of}} student teachers, classroom teachers, and university-based personnel who participated in an alternative model of student teacher supervision and traditional triad model. A variety of data sources including surveys, interviews, and anecdotal evidence {{was used to determine}} the perceptions of the participants. Although there were concerns about the alternative model, the participants viewed it more positively than the traditional triad. Recommendations for teacher education programmes and <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> are made...|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> {{serves as}} a {{culmination}} of the teacher education process. It {{is a time for}} individuals preparing for a career in education to apply the theories and methods that they have studied during their teacher preparation program. The student teaching center and the supervising (cooperating) teacher are the most important ingredients in <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experience.</b> These components are essential if student teaching is to be a meaningful activity. Kuehl (1984) stated that: “Student teaching is a complex learning experience that requires careful supervision. Cooperating teachers must create a sustaining environment that will facilitate maximum development of student teachers ” (p. 2). However, this may not always be the case. Kuehl warned, “Despite its importance, there is no assurance that student teaching is a carefully controlled and supervised experience ” (p. 1). Much {{has been written about the}} roles that the student teaching center and the supervising teacher play in the development of the student teacher. Roe, Ross and Bums (1984) described student teaching as a time which should be spent: developing appropriate relationships with a variety of people-students, college supervisors, cooperating teachers, other school personnel, student teachers and parents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the experiences and reflections of four fourth year pre-service teachers from Federation University Australia who completed their three-week teaching placement in Anshan, Liaoning Province, China, in April 2014. The study also explores the perspectives and opinions of both the Chinese mentor teachers and Chinese <b>students</b> towards <b>the</b> Australian pre-service teachers. The research confirms the mutual benefits of cross-cultural teacher education professional experiences for pre-service teachers, Chinese mentor teachers and Chinese <b>students.</b> <b>The</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences</b> revealed major differences in educational concepts and teaching strategies and approaches between the two systems because of the different social and cultural contexts. The evidence from the voices of the participants indicates that the professional experience in these two Chinese schools fostered the Australian pre-service teachers’ cross-cultural communication skills, developed their confidence and skills as teachers and generally enriched their personal and professional lives...|$|R
40|$|The {{contradictory}} {{realities of}} <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> viewed through <b>the</b> <b>student</b> teachers’ eyes {{have been the}} focus of attention of some recent publications (Britzman, 1991; Knowles and Cole, 1994; Carel, S.; Stuckey, A.; Spalding, A.;Parish, D.; Vidaurri, L; Dahlstrom, K.; and  Rand, Ch., 1996; Weber  Mitchell, 1996). Student teachers are “marginally situated in two worlds” they are to educate others while being educated themselves (Britzman, 1991, p. 13). Playing the two roles simultaneously is highly difficult. The contradictions, dilemmas, and tensions inherent in such endeavor make the world of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> teacher increasingly problematic. This is further complicated by the power relationships that often permeate <b>the</b> <b>student</b> teacher cooperating teacher relationship. This paper describes salient aspects of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> journey of Sue, a white twenty-two year old student teacher of Spanish. It uncovers the tensions and dilemmas experienced by the participant in her quest for professional identity. Data collection sources for this study included (a) two open-ended interviews, each lasting approximately forty-five minutes; (b) one school-day long observation; and (c) a copy of the communication journal between the participant and her cooperating teacher. The data revealed that soon upon entering <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> field <b>experience,</b> Sue found herself torn by the ambiguous role in which student teachers are positioned: she was neither a full-fledged teacher nor a student. In trying to negotiate a teaching role for herself, Sue was pulled in different directions. She soon became aware of the powerful position of the cooperating teacher and of her vulnerability within the mentoring relationship. The main tension was manifested in Sue’s struggle to develop her own teaching persona on the one hand, and the pressure to conform to her cooperating teachers’ expectations on the other hand. The implications of the study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Statistics and Research Methods modules {{are often}} unpopular with {{psychology}} students; however, at Oxford Brookes University the seminar {{component of the}} second-year research methods module tends to get very positive feedback. Over half of the seminars work towards the submission of a research-based experimental lab report. This article introduces and reflects {{on some of the}} recent changes made to improve this coursework by increasing the similarities with staff research; specifically targeting the areas of supervision, ethical review, peer review and dissemination. These developments are aligned with the teaching fellowship project, Vertical Enhancement of Statistics and Psychology Research, and aim to encourage second-year students to treat their group experiments as part of the department’s research activity, rather than simply as pieces of coursework. Enhancing this research-based aspect of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>experience</b> <b>teaching</b> will hopefully, in turn, lead to higher quality third-year dissertations by increasing student enthusiasm for academic research...|$|R
