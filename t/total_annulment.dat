5000|$|A Jesus {{different}} to the Jesus of The New Testament is mentioned in Maimonides' Epistle to Yemen, written about 1172 to Rabbi Jacob ben Netan'el al-Fayyumi, {{head of the}} Yemen Jewish community Ever {{since the time of}} Revelation, every despot or slave that has attained to power, be he violent or ignoble, has made it his first aim and his final purpose to destroy our law, and to vitiate our religion, by means of the sword, by violence, or by brute force, such as Amalek, Sisera, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, Hadrian, may their bones be ground to dust, and others like them. This is one of the two classes which attempt to foil the Divine will.The second class consists of the most intelligent and educated among the nations, such as the Syrians, Persians, and Greeks. These also endeavor to demolish our law and to vitiate it by means of arguments which they invent, and by means of controversies which they institute....After that there arose a new sect which combined the two methods, namely, conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. It, therefore, resolved to lay claim to prophecy and to found a new faith, contrary to our Divine religion, and to contend that it was equally God-given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and to create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such is the remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.The first one to have adopted this plan was Jesus the Nazarene, may his bones be ground to dust. He was a Jew because his mother was a Jewess although his father was a Gentile. For in accordance with the principles of our law, a child born of a Jewess and a Gentile, or of a Jewess and a slave, is legitimate. (Yebamot 45a). Jesus is only figuratively termed an illegitimate child. He impelled people to believe that he was a prophet sent by God to clarify perplexities in the Torah, and that he was the Messiah that was predicted by each and every seer. He interpreted the Torah and its precepts in such a fashion as to lead to their <b>total</b> <b>annulment,</b> to the abolition of all its commandments and to the violation of its prohibitions. The sages, of blessed memory, having become aware of his plans before his reputation spread among our people, meted out fitting punishment to him.Daniel had already alluded to him when he presaged the downfall of a wicked one and a heretic among the Jews who would endeavor to destroy the Law, claim prophecy for himself, make pretenses to miracles, and allege that he is the Messiah, as it is written, [...] "Also the children of the impudent among thy people shall make bold to claim prophecy, but they shall fall." [...] (Daniel 11:14).|$|E
40|$|The thesis has as {{object of}} study the autobiographical memmorials. The general {{objective}} is to describe {{the history of the}} memmorial as an academic tradition of higher education in Brazil. Considered a hybrid genre, memmorials are known for focusing on life stories from a scientific perspective. The investigation revolves around three intertwined branches: History of Education, educational practices and language usages, which allow us to conduct a dialogue with multiple theoretical-methodological references with a view to supporting our analyses. The corpus used for the analysis was made up of 40 autobiographical memmorials, distributed as follows: 16 academic memmorials, dated from 1935 to 1970; 07 academic memmorials, dated from 1980 to 2007; and 17 formation memmorials, dated from 1995 to 2000. In this corpus, we also included official documents, which relate to legislation contained in edicts, resolutions, ordinances, regulations, which we used with a view to: 1) getting to know and understanding the big picture of higher education regulation in Brazil and the aspects related to the higher education teaching career; 2) investigating the text of memmorials {{in the light of the}} injunctive discourse characteristic of the edicts and resolutions in which they were based. The analysis of the memmorial supported by the legislation which regulates it allowed us to reconstitute the image of the professor throughout 80 years in the Brazilian public university. For this purpose, the study was conducted in the theoretical-methodological perspective of the (auto) biographical research in Education and of the sociolinguistic studies on discourse genres and discursive traditions. The investigations reveal the memmorial as an academic genre in which the professor's academic-professional history and the history of the higher education teaching career in Brazil intertwine. Anchored in the Bakhtinian perspective on discourse genres, according to which the memmorials evolve and become more complex as their contexts of usage also evolve and become more complex themselves, the results of our analyses allowed us to correlate genre changes to the sociohistorical context and to its usage as an educational practice in the university, in the decades under study. Therefore, the analyses showed that these self-writings: go from latent subjectivity to pure objectivity from the 1930 s to 1960 s; they show <b>total</b> <b>annulment</b> of the subject from the 1960 s to the 1970 s; they reappear in the 1980 s, having Professor Magda Soares' memmorial as perspective; they expand and diversify from the 1990 s onwards, taking on a formative role and a perspective of future as well. So far as language usages are concerned, we investigated the relationship of the subject with the language, especifically the manifestation of alterity on the discursive tissue of the memmorials. In this branch, the analyses pointed to the influence of the authoritative discourse on the formation of the professor and of the injunction and reinventing discourses on the authorship process. Therefore, the autobiographical memmorial reveals itself as a specific expression of the Brazilian academy's cultural sphere and allows us to confirm the hypothesis that each memorial tackles a singular-plural situation, by presenting a dialectical articulation between private and public, according to the institutional structures, in which and with which the professor has already formed him/herself and with which he/she dialoguesCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorA tese tem como objeto de estudo os memoriais autobiográficos. O objetivo geral é descrever o percurso histórico do memorial como uma tradição acadêmica do ensino superior no Brasil. Considerados um gênero híbrido, os memoriais trazem a peculiaridade de focalizar cientificamente trajetórias de vida. A investigação situa-se em três vertentes que se articulam: História da Educação, práticas educativas e usos da Linguagem, as quais nos permitem dialogar com múltiplas referências teórico-metodológicas na sustentação de nossas análises. O corpus utilizado para a análise constituiu-se por 40 memoriais autobiográficos, assim distribuídos: 16 memoriais acadêmicos, datados de 1935 a 1970; 07 memoriais acadêmicos, datados de 1980 a 2007; e 17 memoriais de formação, datados de 1995 a 2000. Nesse corpus reunimos, ainda, documentos oficiais, que dizem respeito à legislação disposta em editais, resoluções, portarias, regimentos, com os quais tivemos como propósitos: 1) conhecer e compreender o contexto maior de regulamentação do ensino superior no Brasil e seus aspectos concernentes à carreira do magistério superior; 2) investigar a escrita dos memoriais à luz do discurso injuntivo característico dos editais e resoluções nos quais se pautavam. A análise do memorial respaldada na legislação que o regulamenta permitiu reconstituir a imagem do professor ao longo de 80 anos na universidade pública brasileira. Para tanto, o trabalho foi desenvolvido no marco teórico-metodológico da pesquisa (auto) biográfica em Educação e dos estudos sociolinguísticos sobre os gêneros do discurso e as tradições discursivas. As investigações revelam o memorial como um gênero acadêmico no qual se entrelaça a história acadêmico-profissional do professor com a história da carreira do magistério superior no Brasil. Ancorados na perspectiva bakhtiniana sobre os gêneros do discurso, segundo a qual os gêneros evoluem e se complexificam à medida que seus contextos de uso também evoluem e se tornam mais complexos, os resultados de nossas análises permitiram correlacionar, nas décadas estudadas, as alterações dos memoriais ao contexto sociohistórico e ao seu uso como uma prática educativa no âmbito da universidade. Desse modo, as análises evidenciaram que essas escritas de si: passam da subjetividade latente para a pura objetividade entre as décadas de 1930 e 1960; apresentam total apagamento do sujeito entre as décadas de 1960 a 1970; ressurgem na década de 1980, tendo como marco o memorial da professora Magda Soares; expandem-se e diversificam-se a partir dos anos 1990, tornando-se também um dispositivo de formação e de projeção profissional. No que concerne aos usos da linguagem, investigamos a relação do sujeito com a linguagem, especificamente a manifestação da alteridade no tecido discursivo dos memoriais. Nessa vertente, as análises apontaram a influência do discurso de autoridade na formação do professor; dos discursos de injunção no processo de inserção profissional e de reinvenção de si no processo de autoria. Nesse sentido, o memorial autobiográfico revela-se como expressão específica da esfera cultural da academia brasileira e nos permite confirmar a hipótese de que cada memorial trata de uma situação singular-plural, ao apresentar uma articulação dialética entre o privado e o público, segundo as estruturas institucionais, nas quais e com as quais o professor|a se formou e com as quais dialog...|$|E
