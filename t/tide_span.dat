2500|$|Brunel had to {{take the}} two tracks of the South Wales Railway across the River Wye. The Admiralty had insisted on a [...] clear span over the river, with the bridge a minimum of [...] above high <b>tide.</b> The <b>span</b> would have to be self-supporting, since {{although}} the Gloucestershire side of the river consists of a limestone cliff, the Monmouthshire side is low-lying sedimentary deposit subject to regular flooding. Thus on that side, there was nowhere for an abutment capable of either resisting the outward push of an arch bridge, or the inward pull of a conventional suspension bridge. In any case, neither could be used: an arch bridge would not have met the height and width restrictions imposed by the Admiralty, and suspension bridges were notoriously unfit for carrying railway trains. The concentrated weight caused the chains to deflect, allowing the bridge-deck to ride dangerously up and down. A self-supporting truss bridge was the only option.|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} over 1, 800 {{globally}} distributed tide gauge stations, {{only a few hundred}} of them are suitable for monitoring and analyzing global mean sea level (MSL) changes. This is because several <b>tide</b> gauge records <b>span</b> short periods of time and therefore their trend estimates are adversely affected by unmodeled systematic sea level changes such as seasonal, interannual, decadal variations. This limitation can be improved by using more elaborate models that account for systematic fluctuations in MSL for shorter time-series. In this study, analytic expressions were derived to analyze and quantify the epoch-by-epoch and lump-sum effects of these systematic changes to the local MSL trend estimates {{as a function of the}} time-series‘ lengths. The numerical results reveal that systematic MSL variations, particularly transient/episodic ones, if they are not properly modeled or omitted from the models, will bias the trend estimates for the tide gauge data series around the world by up to 0. 6 mm/year for the 50 -year time-series that are needed for more reliable inferences about global MSL. Random effects, which are not a factor in estimating MSL trends for the long-term (> 50 years) time-series, need to be scrutinized together with the systematic errors for time-series shorter than 50 years.

40|$|Storm surges are a {{significant}} hazard to coastal communities around the world, putting lives at risk and costing {{billions of dollars in}} damage. Understanding how storm surges and high tides interact is crucial for estimating extreme water levels so that we can protect coastal communities. We demonstrate that in a tidal regime the best measure of a storm surge is the skew surge, the difference between the observed and predicted high water within a tidal cycle. Based on <b>tide</b> gauge records <b>spanning</b> decades from the UK, US, Netherlands and Ireland we show that the magnitude of high water exerts no influence {{on the size of the}} most extreme skew surges. This is the first systematic proof that any storm surge can occur on any tide, which is essential for understanding worst case scenarios. The lack of surge generation dependency on water depth emphasises the dominant natural variability of weather systems in an observations-based analysis. Weak seasonal relationships between skew surges and high waters were identified at a minority of locations where long period changes to the tidal cycle interact with the storm season. Our results allow advances to be made in methods for estimating the joint probabilities of storm surges and tides...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] and mooring data collected off the coast of New Jersey are used to describe the nonlinear internal wave (NLIW) field and the background oceanographic conditions that formed the waveguide on the shelf. The subinertial, inertial, and tidal circulation are described in detail, and the background fluid state is characterized using the coefficients of the extended Korteweg–de Vries equation. The utility of this type of analysis is demonstrated in description of an amplitude-limited, flat wave. NLIWs observed over most of the month had typical displacements of − 8 m, but waves observed from 17 – 21 August were almost twice as large with displacements near − 15 m. During most of the month, wave packets occurred irregularly at a fixed location, and often more than one packet was observed per M₂ tidal period. In contrast, the arrival times of the large-amplitude wave groups observed over 17 – 21 August were more closely phased with the barotropic <b>tide.</b> The time <b>span</b> in which the largest NLIWs were observed corresponded to neap barotropic conditions, but when the shoreward baroclinic energy flux was elevated. During the time of large NLIWs, near-inertial waves were a dominate contributor to the internal motions on the shelf and apparently regulated wave formation, as destructive/constructive modulation of the M₂ internal tide by the inertial wavefield at the shelf break corresponded to stronger/weaker NLIWs on the shelf...|$|R

At the Grau-de-la-Dent tide-gauge in the Camargue (Rhone delta, France), daily sea-level records are available since 1905. Hourly <b>tide</b> data <b>spanning</b> the period 1979 – 1995 were obtained through the digitisation of the original paper records: the local harmonic constants and the surges for the whole 20 th century have been computed from these hourly observations. It appears that the annual maximum observed sea-level height increases by 4 mm/yr {{at a rate that}} is two times faster than the average observed relative sea level. The increasing trend of the annual maximum positive sea surges (+ 1. 9 mm/yr), which is equal to the average relative sea-level rise, is thus responsible for this difference. The most important meteorological factor associated with local sea-surge occurrences is wind blowing from 1001 to 1201 sectors, which tends to push the water toward the coasts. Since 1961, the frequency and the speed of wind from this sector increased, although with some variability, thus contributing in part to the increase in the frequency and intensity of the surges. Due to the changing hydrodynamics phenomenon in the Camargue, a positive feedback mechanism between extreme marine events and shoreline regression is another factor to explain the sea-surge rise over the long term. The increase in sea-surge frequency and height during the last century is especially of concern in the deltaic area if the nearfuture global sea-level rise predicted by climate models is also taken into account. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords: Sea level; Surge; Tide; Wind; Flooding risk; Camargue; Rhone delta 1. Introduction Any rise in sea level will have adverse impacts such as coastal erosion and flooding, depending on the time scale and the magnitude of the rise and the human response to it (Paskoff, 1993). A rise in sea level may be due to several factors acting on various time scales, i. e., atmospheric storms (Bouligand and Pirazzoli, 1999; Pirazzoli, 2000; Trigo and Davies, 2002; Pirazzoli and Tomasin, 2002), river flooding in estuaries (Svensson and Jones, 2002), but also land sinking or similar non climate-related changes, linked to sediment compaction, isostasy, coastal geomorphologic evolutions or urban development.
