40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} hydrodynamic {{knowledge on}} schematized open-channel confluences is {{largely based on}} laboratory experiments in channels with a rectangular cross-section.

Therefore, this paper examines the influence of three cross-sectional shapes on the flow patterns in an asymmetric 90 ° open-channel confluence with fixed concordant bed and subcritical flows throughout. Large-eddy simulations are performed for a rectangular, a chamfered rectangular and a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>section.</b> The simulations for the non-rectangular sections show that the location of both the mixing layer between the incoming flows and the shear layer between the separation zone and the contracted section are altered {{in comparison to the}} rectangular section case.

40|$|In {{diversion}} flows, {{a portion}} of stream flow which enters the intake is diverted from upstream of the intake denoted by a surface and is called dividing stream surface (DSS). The amount of flow and sediment discharge entering the intake as well as design of submerged vanes to control sediment depends on determination of dividing stream width. In this study, the experimental tests were carried out at a 30 degree water intake from a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>section.</b> Three components of velocity data were obtained for different flow conditions.

More flow conditions such as the main channel with rectangular section were run using SSIIM 2 model to get enough hydraulic data.

It was found that in comparison to the rectangular section, in trapezoidal cross section, the DSS dimensions are modified in such a way that its width is increases at the surface and reduced at the bed for the same flow conditions. Relations for predicting the dividing stream width and diversion flow ratio have been presented in this paper for intake from both rectangular and trapezoidal cross sections...|$|E
40|$|The {{rational}} regime formulation, {{which was}} used by White, Bettess and Paris to predict the stable geometry of wide, trapezoidal alluvial channels and in producing the Wallingford Tables for the Design of Stable Alluvial Channels (Hydraulics Research, Wallingford, 1981), is reviewed. This approach (the Wallingford rational regime theory) is known to provide useful results for moderate-scale natural channels but deviates more widely from observed behaviour for laboratory channels and very large rivers. To explore possible reasons for this, wide and narrow trapezoidal channels have been examined in terms of wetted perimeter, hydraulic radius and side slope, and have been compared with equal-area rectangular channels. The effect of the hydraulic radius, via the threshold of motion, on the sediment transport prediction was studied. It is shown that the hydraulic radius associated with selection of side slope has {{a significant effect on}} the sediment concentration prediction. The threshold of motion is also an issue. The original method was modified by approximating the channel cross-section as an equivalent area <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>section.</b> Based on the results, an adjustment to the method in terms of hydraulic radius and threshold of motion is proposed.

40|$|Guttering, in a roofwater {{harvesting}} system, has {{the purpose}} of intercepting the roof run-off and conveying it to a downpipe (which in turn carries it to a store). The two phases of ‘interception ’ and ‘conveyance ’ make different and sometimes conflicting demands upon a guttering design. Their respective failures (overshoot and overflow) occur under similar circumstances, namely intense rain, and for most analytic purposes {{it is appropriate to}} consider as total water loss just the higher of the overshoot loss and the overflow loss, rather than their sum. A good gutter design must satisfy many criteria including durability, cheapness and ease of fixing. In this paper on gutter sizing, the primary approach is to find that gutter size and shape that maximises the ratio of water benefit to system cost. The work was motivated by field observation of evidently over-sized gutters and the absence of any published ‘informed ’ guidance on sizing. The study entailed theoretical analysis, laboratory experimentation and some field studies. The findings are that: (i) ‘U ’ or trapezoidal-section gutters give the best economy, (ii) roof area is the primary determinant of gutter size and (iii) a ‘U’-shaped or <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>section</b> gutter of width only 70 mm will be sufficient for most house roofs in the tropics.

40|$|Curved {{concrete}} bridge girders have very complex internal forces, {{stress and strain}} distribution. As a consequence of their shape, not only the usual bending moments and shear forces are generated, but also important torsion moments are created. These moments rotate the axes of principal tensional stresses and increasing the risk of cracking. A study of torsional moment is found limited in the literature. Post-tensioning can prevent the cracks, but the additional of compression forces in different directions increase the complexity of stress and strain fields sometimes tendons lead to break away the web. Therefore, the curved post-tensioned concrete girders must be particularly designed and carefully constructed. The complete Senai Bridge has been modeled and used for a case study. <b>Trapezoidal</b> <b>section</b> has been chosen in the present investigation.

Dead Load and Live Load according to British Standard code of practice, for zero torsion as well as maximum torsion are considered.
