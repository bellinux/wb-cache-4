2500|$|The ruling African National Congress (ANC) was {{the largest}} party overall, earning 53.9% of the total vote.

5000|$|The <b>Tshwane</b> Metro Council has advertised <b>Tshwane</b> as [...] "Africa's leading capital city" [...] {{since the}} name change was {{approved}} by the SAGNC in 2005. This has led to further controversy, however, as the name of the city had not yet been changed officially, and the council was, at best, acting prematurely. Following a complaint lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), it was ruled that such advertisements are deliberately misleading and should be withdrawn from all media. [...] Despite the rulings of the ASA, <b>Tshwane</b> Metro Council failed to discontinue their [...] "City of Tshwane" [...] advertisements. As a result, the ASA requested that <b>Tshwane</b> Metro pay for advertisements in which it admits that it has misled the public. Refusing to abide by the ASA's request, the Metro Council was banned consequently from placing any advertisements in the South African media that refer to <b>Tshwane</b> as the capital. ASA may still place additional sanctions on the Metro Council that would prevent it from placing any advertisements in the South African media, including council notices and employment vacancies.|$|E
