5|$|The {{senators}} obstructed his re-election. They also gathered {{an ad hoc}} force, {{with several}} of <b>them</b> <b>personally</b> marching to the Forum, and had Tiberius and some 300 of his supporters clubbed to death. This was the first open bloodshed in Roman politics for nearly four centuries.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 1813, General Harrison again wrote Shelby {{requesting}} volunteers, {{and this}} time he asked that Shelby lead <b>them</b> <b>personally.</b> Shelby raised a force of 3,500 volunteers, double the number Harrison requested. Future governor John J. Crittenden served as Shelby's aide-de-camp. Now a Major General, Shelby led the volunteers to join Harrison in a campaign that culminated in the American victory at the Battle of the Thames.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} <b>them</b> <b>personally,</b> and {{did not respond to}} direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E

5|$|With the 79th Infantry Regiment {{having lost}} around 50% of its {{strength}} and with ammunition and food running low (by {{the end of}} the month, they had been reduced to quarter rations), the Japanese divisional commander, Katagiri, made the decision to call off the attack in order to pull back from Jivevaneng and Katika and regroup on the higher ground further west around the mission. This order was passed on the morning of 24 October, and by the morning of 27 October the Japanese 20th Division's subunits had managed to regroup to the east of Sattelberg. Following this, Katagiri received orders from the 18th Army commander, General Hatazō Adachi, who delivered <b>them</b> <b>personally</b> at Sattelberg, for the 20th Division to prepare to hold the mission and to engage in offensive operations in the immediate vicinity.|$|E
5|$|With the {{invasion}} imminent, Henry mobilised his forces and fleet outside Pevensey, close to Robert's anticipated landing site, training some of <b>them</b> <b>personally</b> {{in how to}} counter cavalry charges. Despite English levies and knights owing military service to the Church arriving in considerable numbers, many of his barons did not appear. Anselm intervened {{with some of the}} doubters, emphasising the religious importance of their loyalty to Henry. Robert unexpectedly landed further up the coast at Portsmouth on 20 July with a modest force of a few hundred men, but these were quickly joined by many of the barons in England. However, instead of marching into nearby Winchester and seizing Henry's treasury, Robert paused, giving Henry time to march west and intercept {{the invasion}} force.|$|E
25|$|Part III {{contains}} odes to four writers: Hart Crane, Delmore Schwartz, George Santayana, and Ford Madox Ford. At {{the time}} that Lowell published these poems, only Schwartz was still alive, and {{with the exception of}} Hart Crane, Lowell knew all of <b>them</b> <b>personally</b> and considered them to be mentors at different stages of his career.|$|E

25|$|The public {{continue}} to externalize climate change to other people, places and times. It is increasingly {{perceived as a}} major global issue with far-reaching consequences for future generations—45% say {{it is the most}} serious threat facing the World today and 53% believe it will impact significantly on future generations. However, the issue features less prominently nationally and locally, indeed only 9% believe climate change will have a significant impact upon <b>them</b> <b>personally.</b>|$|E
25|$|Abbas gained {{strong support}} from the common people. Sources report him {{spending}} {{much of his time}} among <b>them,</b> <b>personally</b> visiting bazaars and other public places in Isfahan. Short in stature but physically strong until his health declined in his final years, Abbas could go for long periods without needing to sleep or eat and could ride great distances. At the age of 19 Abbas shaved off his beard, keeping only his moustache, thus setting a fashion in Iran.|$|E
25|$|German {{machine gun}} crews in the towers that guarded the western {{approach}} to the bridge opened up on the advancing American troops. At 3:20 pm, Friesenhahn made the last connections to the detonator and twisted the handle, but nothing happened. He tried again and all they heard {{was the sound of}} American shells hitting the area around them. Both Friesenhahn and Bratge knew the dire consequences to <b>them</b> <b>personally</b> and to the German defensive situation if they failed to destroy the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Rousey {{originally}} opposed {{using the}} nickname her friends gave her, [...] "Rowdy", feeling {{it would be}} disrespectful to professional wrestler [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper.

25|$|In December 2011, he donated his {{personal}} literary notes to the National Library of Ireland. Even though he admitted he {{would likely have}} earned a fortune by auctioning <b>them,</b> Heaney <b>personally</b> packed up the boxes of notes and drafts and, accompanied by his son Michael, delivered them to the National Library.|$|R
5000|$|Pick-your-own: Farmers {{open their}} fields to {{consumers}} and allow <b>them</b> to <b>personally</b> select and harvest {{various types of}} produce. This method offers the greatest potential savings for both farmers and consumers, because consumers are able to pick produce of the highest quality, and farmers save costs associated with harvesting and marketing.|$|R
25|$|Civil service reformers {{held out}} {{hope for the}} second Cleveland {{administration}} but saw Vice President Stevenson {{as a symbol of}} the spoils system. He never hesitated to feed names of Democrats to the Post Office Department. Once he called at the US Treasury Department to protest against an appointment and was shown a letter he had written endorsing the candidate. Stevenson told the treasury officials not to pay attention to any of his written endorsements; if he really favored someone he would tell <b>them</b> <b>personally.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though Jayewardene indeed did {{not take}} {{measures}} to stop the attack on Tamils, he was not opposed to <b>them</b> <b>personally,</b> only politically. One of his most esteemed friends was a supreme court judge of Tamil ethnicity, {{a member of an}} elite family and raised in Colombo, but who was strongly linked to his Jaffna Tamil heritage. This is but one close Tamil friend of the president's, and it is quite clear that he was not a racist but rather a man who knew how to exploit racism to win the majority.|$|E
25|$|Space Commander Travis, {{played by}} Stephen Greif {{in the first}} series and Brian Croucher in the second series. Travis is a {{dedicated}} and ruthless Federation officer, with the rank of Space Commander. His left eye and arm were destroyed by Blake, and replaced with an eye patch and a prosthetic arm fitted with a concealed weapon. Travis is known for treating his troops well and leading <b>them</b> <b>personally,</b> but also for his ruthlessness and contempt for human life. After his trial and conviction for killing civilians, Travis becomes increasingly obsessed with killing Blake.|$|E

25|$|As pope, Pius XII {{received}} Muench {{in several}} audiences, and after their second audience on July 12, 1946, the two always conversed in German. Muench also wrote many {{reports on the}} events in Germany directly to Pius XII between 1946 and 1958, {{and there is some}} evidence that Pius XII read many of <b>them</b> <b>personally,</b> even in 1953 when his health began to deteriorate. The reports spoke not only of the immediate, material needs of German Catholics, but also of the spread of communism, a fear shared by Muench and Pius XII, and the subject of another 1954 audience between the two.|$|E
25|$|Janković {{was then}} {{taken to the}} Staff Headquarters of the VRS 22nd Brigade in Kneževo, where he spoke to two survivors, Medo Sivac and Midhat Mujkanović, who told him how they had managed to survive by jumping down when the {{shooting}} started. He drove <b>them</b> <b>personally</b> to Banja Luka and later on they were transferred to the Islamic Humanitarian Association Merhamet. Jankovic said {{that because of the}} large number of victims he referred the case to the Public Safety Station in Banja Luka for further investigation and claimed {{that he did not know}} any further details concerning the perpetrators or victims.|$|E
25|$|Crews {{was born}} in {{suburban}} Philadelphia in 1933. Both of his parents were avid readers and were tremendously influential in his life, said Crews; “They had both been raised in considerable poverty, and books had been extremely important to <b>them</b> <b>personally,</b> in shaping them. My mother was very literary; my father was very scientific. I feel that I got a little something of both sides.” In high school, Crews was co-captain of the tennis team, and for decades he remained an avid skier, hiker, swimmer, and runner. Crews lives in Berkeley with his wife of 57 years, Elizabeth Crews, a photographer who {{was born and raised}} in Berkeley, California. They have two daughters and four grandchildren.|$|E

25|$|Later in his reign, {{when the}} empire had {{recovered}} territory and its economic condition had improved, the increased monetary revenue available allowed Alexios {{to impose a}} greater regularity on the army, with {{a higher proportion of}} troops raised directly by the state; however, the extended imperial family continued to play a very prominent role. In 1107 Alexios created an elite corps of 300 young, aspiring commanders. He brought them into his household and trained <b>them</b> <b>personally.</b> The best of them were then given commands in the army. In this manner Alexios improved the quality of his field officers and the level of control he could exercise over them. This was the army that his successors inherited and further modified.|$|E
25|$|Portraits of the Four Mohawk Kings {{that had}} been {{commissioned}} while the Aboriginal leaders were in London had then hung at Kensington Palace for nearly 270 years, until Queen Elizabeth II in 1977 donated them to the Canadian Collection at the National Archives of Canada, unveiling <b>them</b> <b>personally</b> in Ottawa. That same year, the Queen's son, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, visited Alberta to attend celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the signing of Treaty 7, when he was made a Kainai chieftain, and, as a bicentennial gift in 1984, Elizabeth II gave to the Christ Church Royal Chapel of the Mohawks a silver chalice to replace that which was lost from the 1712 Queen Anne set during the American Revolution. In 2003, Elizabeth's other son, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, opened the Regina, Saskatchewan, campus of the First Nations University of Canada, where the Queen made her first stop during her 2005 tour of Saskatchewan and Alberta and presented the university with a commemorative granite plaque.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} from Australia, Cowdrey decided {{to drop out of}} Oxford so he could {{concentrate}} on his career with Kent and England. No longer an undergraduate he was called up for national service, but discharged after two weeks in the Royal Air Force due to a hereditary disability of rigid toes on which he previously had an operation. This caused some controversy as he promptly made 44, 101, 5, 139, 48, 44, 115 not out and 103 not out, hardly the scores of an invalid. The press suggested that strings had been pulled on his behalf and questions were asked in the House of Commons by Gerald Nabarro MP, though he apologised after the true facts became known. Cowdrey received hate mail from the parents of national servicemen, and took great care to answer <b>them</b> <b>personally.</b> He was called up for the Third Test against South Africa, but was battered by the fast bowlers Peter Heine and Neil Adcock making 1 and 50, which he considered to be the worse bruising of his career and Cowdrey pulled out of the series rather than add to his injuries.|$|E
40|$|This {{volume is}} built around {{transcripts}} of interviews conducted in 1997 and 1998 with 11 noteworthy economists who had been graduate students in the 1930 s. They were invited to reflect on how the Great Depression affected <b>them,</b> both <b>personally</b> and professionally. As Ben S. Bernanke remarks in the foreword, this is first-rate highbrow gossip. The result is both instructive and entertaining. ...|$|R
