50|$|The Qur'an {{contains}} only three verses 4:12 and 4:176 which give specific details of inheritance and shares, {{in addition to}} few verses dealing with <b>testamentary</b> <b>power.</b> It has also been reported in Hadith that Muhammad allotted great importance {{to the laws of}} inheritance and ordered his followers to learn and teach them. Muslim jurists used these verses as a starting point to expound the laws of inheritance even further using Hadith, as well as methods of juristic reasoning, like Qiyas. In later periods, large volumes of work have been written on the subject.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the above changes, the Qur'an grants <b>testamentary</b> <b>powers</b> to Muslims in disposing their property.2:180-182, 2:240, 4:33, 5:106-107 In their will, called waṣeyya, Muslims are allowed to give out a maximum of one third of their property. Muslims are also encouraged to give money to the orphans and poor if they are present during the division of property.|$|R
50|$|The Quran {{introduced}} {{a number of}} different rights and restrictions on matters of inheritance, including general improvements to the treatment of women and family life compared to the pre-Islamic societies that existed in the Arabian Peninsula at the time. Furthermore, the Quran {{introduced a}}dditional heirs that were not entitled to inheritance in pre-Islamic times, mentioning nine relatives specifically of which six were female and three were male. However, the inheritance rights of women remained inferior to those of men. According to the Quran, for example, a son is entitled to twice as much inheritance as a daughter. The Quran also presented efforts to fix the laws of inheritance, and thus forming a complete legal system. This development was in contrast to pre-Islamic societies where rules of inheritance varied considerably. In addition to the above changes, the Quran imposed restrictions on <b>testamentary</b> <b>powers</b> of a Muslim in disposing his or her property. In their will, a Muslim can only give out a maximum of one third of their property.|$|R
40|$|Australia lacks a satisfactory, {{national}} {{paradigm for}} assessing competence and {{capacity in the}} context of <b>testamentary,</b> enduring <b>power</b> of attorney and advance care directive documents. Competence/capacity assessments are currently conducted on an ad hoc basis by legal and/or medical professionals. The reliability of the assessment process is subject to the skill set and mutual understanding of the legal and/or medical professional conducting the assessment. There is a growth in the prevalence of diseases such as dementia. Such diseases impact upon cognition which increasingly necessitates collaboration between the legal and medical professions when assessing the effect of mentally disabling conditions upon competency/capacity. Miscommunication and lack of understanding between legal and medical professionals involved could impede the development of a satisfactory paradigm. A qualitative study seeking the views of legal and medical professionals who practise in this area has been conducted. This incorporated surveys and interviews of 10 legal and 20 medical practitioners. Some of the results are discussed here. Practitioners were asked whether there is a standard approach and whether national guidelines were desirable. There was general agreement that uniform guidelines for the assessment of competence/capacity would be desirable. The interviews also canvassed views as to the state {{of the relationship between the}} professions. The results of the empirical research support the hypothesis that relations between the professions could be improved. The development of a national paradigm would promote consistency and transparency of process, helping to improve the professional relationship and maximising the principles of autonomy, participation and dignity...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to general and special powers, donors may limit {{when the power}} may be exercised by the donees. Testamentary powers are usually indicated by the inclusion of limiting language in the granting instrument such as [...] "to B for life, remainder to persons as B shall 'by will' appoint". General powers presently exercisable do not contain such limitations on power. Wording such as [...] "to B for life, and upon B's death to those that B shall appoint" [...] indicates a power presently exercisable, not a <b>testamentary</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Anglo-Saxon {{legal system}} cannot be {{understood}} unless one realizes the fundamental opposition between folk-right and privilege. Folk-right is {{the aggregate of}} rules, formulated or latent but susceptible of formulation, which can be appealed to as {{the expression of the}} juridical consciousness of the people at large or of the communities of which it is composed. It is tribal in its origin, and differentiated, not according to boundaries between states, but on national and provincial lines. There may be the folk-right of West and East Saxons, of East Angles, of Kentish men, Mercians, Northumbrians, Danes, Welshmen, and these main folk-right divisions remain even when tribal kingdoms disappear and the people are concentrated in one or two realms. The chief centres for the formulation and application of folk-right were, in the 10th and 11th centuries, the shire-moots, while the witan of the realm generally placed themselves on the higher ground of State expediency, although occasionally using folk-right ideas. The older law of real property, of succession, of contracts, the customary tariffs of fines, were mainly regulated by folk-right; the reeves employed by the king and great men were supposed to take care of local and rural affairs according to folk-right. The law had to be declared and applied by the people itself in its communities, while the spokesmen of the people were neither democratic majorities nor individual experts, but a few leading men—the twelve eldest thanes or some similar quorum. Folk-right could, however, be broken or modified by special law or special grant, and the fountain of such privileges was the royal power. Alterations and exceptions were, as a matter of fact, suggested by the interested parties themselves, and chiefly by the Church. Thus a privileged land-tenure was created—bookland; the rules as to the succession of kinsmen were set at nought by concession of <b>testamentary</b> <b>power</b> and confirmations of grants and wills; special exemptions from the jurisdiction of the hundreds and special privileges as to levying fines were conferred. In process of time the rights originating in royal grants of privilege overbalanced, as it were, folk-right in many respects, and became themselves the starting-point of a new legal system—the feudal one.|$|E
40|$|As {{the right}} to sell may exist either {{as a result of}} ownership, or by virtue of a power without or {{independent}} of ownership, it is sometimes a question whether words indicating a right to sell, contained in an instrument granting an estate, are intended to give a power, or are merely descriptive of the rights incident to the estate given. When property is devised without any designation of the estate given, and the devise is followed by words indicating that the devisee is to have the right of absolute disposal in fee, or to sell in fee, it has often been held that the words indicating an absolute power of disposal show that the devisee was intended by the testator to have an estate in fee, not a life estate with a <b>testamentary</b> <b>power</b> of appointing the reversion. (See note 18 L. R. A. N. S. 463.) If the devise were expressly of an estate for life, no such inference could be indulged; and {{it would have to be}} held that the right of disposal given was merely a <b>testamentary</b> <b>power</b> to appoint the reversion...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion that}} there are some powers falling between duties and {{discretionary}} powers is part of the conceptual framework of property law, and is deeply embedded in the law relating to powers under trust instruments. To demonstrate that the terms have been used in a variety of ways, producing considerable confusion and analytical difficulty, this article surveys the categories of power, their historical backgrounds, the role of the courts and the application of the principles in practice. Language relating to “trust powers” or “powers in the nature of trusts” has been unhelpful and sometimes misleading concerning releases, the implications of gifts in default, assignments, survivorship and delegation of <b>testamentary</b> <b>power.</b> The author expresses the hope that alternatives will be found to such language, especially with respect to the distinction between trust powers and bare powers regarding certainty of objects...|$|E
40|$|Professors Mark Reutlinger and John Weaver {{examine the}} {{conceptual}} dilemma that Professor Reutlinger {{encountered in the}} course of developing the series of diagrams to illustrate the Rule Against Perpetuities described in the accompanying article. To describe it briefly (if not simply), the perpetuities period for a special or <b>testamentary</b> <b>power</b> of appointment begins when the power is created (not exercised), and it ends when the appointed interest vests. Applying the 2 ̆ 2 relation back 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, the appointment is treated, for perpetuities purposes, {{as if it were a}} gift by the donor, rather than the donee. Under the 2 ̆ 2 second look 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, however, one may take into consideration events and circumstances existing at the time of exercise in determining whether, when viewed as of the time of creation, the appointed interest violates the Rule...|$|E
40|$|The {{commentators}} in {{the field}} of future interests have, for the most part, agreed there is a trend in the law toward piercing the fictional veil that a general power is a mere mandate or authority to dispose of property. The {{purpose of this article is}} to explore, in summary, the historical basis for the general power and the reasons for the current prevalence of its use. The question of whether the general power does have peculiar characteristics and advantages in intent effectuation is evaluated in more detail. In addition, the law as it relates to the rights of third parties claiming through or against the donee of the power (creditors, spouse, and heirs) is critically examined with a view to determining to what extent the donee 2 ̆ 7 s power is and should be treated as a property interest. Suggestions as to recommended changes in the law are advanced. Such changes of necessity would have to be by statute because of the properly strong judicial predisposition toward the doctrine of stare decisis in the property area. In traversing all these problems, the distinctions between a <b>testamentary</b> <b>power</b> and a power presently exercisable as well as between powers simply collateral, in gross, and appendant are of some convenience and should be kept in mind...|$|E
40|$|Main {{goal of the}} diploma thesis was {{to present}} {{historical}} development of a testament {{in the area of}} Bohemia. Chapters of the thesis are put in chronological order and all the periods with an influence on the development are mentioned. At first an approach to testament in Roman law is presented, followed by feudal approach, an approach of the General Civil Code, approaches of totalitarian civil codes from 1950 and 1964 including changes which appeared after the Velvet Revolution and finally a new approach of the new civil code, Act No. 89 / 2012, taking effect on the January 1, 2014. To be able to understand fully the testament and all the related institutes it is necessary to begin with Roman law. It was the Roman law which laid the foundations for civil codes in Europe. This applies also to the testament in our area. Development in the following feudal period however was not positive when it comes to succession. Testament is therefore coming on the scene much later - mostly in form of code called city rights, which began a renaissance of the Roman law. The first complete civil code from 1811 was revolutionary when it comes to, besides other things, testament and succession. The General Civil Code was based on the Roman law traditions, it introduced extraordinary <b>testamentary</b> <b>power</b> for a testator, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes to}} repeal the QTIP {{provisions}} in order to collect revenue now for transfers that are essentially transfers to third parties {{and not to the}} decedent 2 ̆ 7 s spouse. Because there are advantages of increased flexibility attendant to a QTIP as opposed to a PAT, this article proposes to take those repealed QTIP benefits and attach them to the PAT, which would greatly enhance that marital deduction trust form. A super-charged PAT would thereby be able to preserve the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s GST tax exemption (like a reverse QTIP), create a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s by-pass trust by allowing a PAT (or a partial PAT) 2 ̆ 2 election-out, 2 ̆ 2 and create a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s state-only PAT marital deduction. The super-charged PAT would provide for much desired post-mortem tax planning without the complex and strict requirements of a disclaimer. Moreover, the new PAT would eliminate conflicts of interest and fiduciary problems inherent in the QTIP form of the marital deduction. Lastly, by repealing the QTIP provisions and by super-charging the PAT, the marital deduction would truly be a marital deduction and not a third party beneficiary tax deferral device. I have criticized the QTIP trust on the basis that the QTIP provisions are both illogical and sexist. The QTIP provisions are illogical because they conflict with their stated public policy goal of taxing marital property when it leaves the marital unit and passes to other beneficiaries. Because the goal of the marital deduction is to tax property when it leaves the marital unit and because the QTIP expressly endorses passing the property to third parties at the first spouse’s death, the QTIP undermines the fundamental rationale for the marital deduction. Likewise, the QTIP provisions are sexist. They treat women as the invisible spouse and they equate giving an income interest to women with giving them the corpus. With the QTIP, the first spouse to die controls the disposition of the corpus and he selects the decision maker who will make the QTIP election. The QTIP provisions implicitly equate giving an income interest to women with giving them the property itself because unlike the other exceptions to the terminable interest rule in which the widow is given a rough equivalent to outright ownership of the corpus, the QTIP provisions allow a marital deduction for the full value of the property at the husband 2 ̆ 7 s death even though the surviving spouse, {{the other half of the}} marital unit, receives only the income interest in that property. A PAT provides the surviving spouse with both an income interest and a power to appoint the property to herself or to her estate; it is considered an equivalent to ownership although this article recommends that the PAT require that the surviving spouse be entitled to both an inter vivos and a <b>testamentary</b> <b>power</b> of appointment over the trust property. The PAT, however, has all but disappeared as a marital transfer because of the popularity of the QTIP. This article proposes {{to repeal the}} QTIP provisions but recognizes that repeal is virtually impossible because of certain well-liked features of the QTIP that have nothing to do with the decedent’s desire for dead hand control, but which provide advantages of increased flexibility in estate planning. Therefore, this article proposes to take those repealed QTIP “flexibility” benefits and attach them to the PAT to create a “super-charged” PAT to take the place of the QTIP trust...|$|E
