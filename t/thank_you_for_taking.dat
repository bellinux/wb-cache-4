40|$|I {{especially}} thank Fabrizio Perin for {{his efforts}} and patience during {{the development of this}} thesis. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> Prof. Dr. Nierstrasz for giving me the opportunity to work at the SCG and the given inputs which helped me to finally finish my work.

Quality assurance tools and metaprogramming are trending topics in PHP application development. Whilst not supported natively by the language itself, PHP applications and frameworks increasingly make use of annotations. The lack of native annotation support requires programmers to embed metadata in multi-line comments- so called doc blocks- and extract them in an additional parsing step. The separation of the actual program code and meta data into different domains and the absence of specifications in terms of syntax complicate the reasoning about annotations and corresponding behavior. To enable the analysis of PHP source code and annotation meta data in particular, this thesis presents a modular extension to the Moose suite. The implemented components enabl...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to firstly thank Dr. Maria Athanassenas for her great insights, {{wonderful}} remarks, and excellent supervision! <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> so much!

His incredible ability to draw pictures from even the most complex of definitions is awe-inspiring! Without both these terrific individuals, I {{would not have been}} able to achieve so much in this thesis. Dr. Marty Ross also deserves much credit and praise. His excellent lectures in Measure Theory at the AMSI summer school provided me with a solid foundation to work from. If it was not for his excellent Real Analysis lectures in 2003, I may not have fallen so hard in love with Analysis. As a result of this thesis, I have disturbed both Assoc.
