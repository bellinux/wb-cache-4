5|$|In 2010, {{international}} {{rail travel}} was liberalised by new European Union directives, designed {{to break up}} monopolies {{in order to encourage}} competition for services between countries. This sparked interest among other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and new services to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up <b>to</b> <b>now</b> is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated <b>to</b> <b>now</b> contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E

In the fourth series, the group is shown <b>to</b> <b>now</b> be a regular rival of the Whiskers. In the second episode, Zaphod and a band of roving males join the Aztecs, with Zaphod {{becoming}} the group's new dominant male. Right now, the Aztecs are left without a dominant male, since Zaphod has died.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago. A migrating hotspot thought <b>to</b> <b>now</b> exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million years ago but 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of forensic {{science and the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>now</b> obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible {{at the time of}} the original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.|$|E

5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. Although the entire coastal strip {{is often referred to as}} Soconusco, Soconusco proper is the southeastern portion characterised by a humid tropical climate and rich agricultural lands. The northwestern portion of the coastal strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El Despoblado ("The Unpopulated"); it is generally referred <b>to</b> <b>now</b> as the Isthmus Coast Region (Spanish: Istmo-Costa).|$|E
5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up <b>to</b> <b>now,</b> been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|Brought by JC's {{agents to}} Liberty Island, Alex learns that the island holds an old {{part of the}} pre-Collapse {{worldwide}} communication network {{which can be used}} by each faction. No matter what choices Alex has made up <b>to</b> <b>now,</b> they can choose to side with any faction, or kill all the leaders on Liberty Island. If Alex follows JC's plan, the biomods are distributed worldwide, giving Helios the ability to access all human thought, allowing it to govern humanity. If Alex sides with the Illuminati, they use the network to help create a global surveillance state where communication and the economy are controlled. If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, {{during an}} episode of Hollyoaks {{spin-off}} Hollyoaks Later, Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) and Zoe Carpenter (Zoë Lister) had a sexual encounter. Up <b>to</b> <b>now</b> both characters had previously been portrayed as heterosexual {{and this was the}} start of Sarah's on-going sexuality crisis. The character of Lydia Hart was created as the new love interest for the sexually confused already established character, Sarah. When the character first appeared on-screen she was revealed to have a younger sister, Persephone Hart (Elizabeth Hadley), who was attending the dance classes taught by Sarah. Little is known about the rest of Lydia's family, although the character did stay with her mother frequently off-screen. The character was also given links to Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki) who arrived in Hollyoaks in June 2009. It was soon revealed that Lydia was Charlotte's ex-girlfriend.|$|E
5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time <b>to</b> <b>now.</b> The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E
