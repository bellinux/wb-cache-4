5|$|Once {{secretory}} proteins are formed, <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> membrane separates {{them from}} the proteins that {{will remain in the}} cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit {{to another part of the}} cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by <b>the</b> <b>ER.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ER</b> is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> lumen and is also referred to as <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to making secretory proteins, the rough ER makes membranes that grows in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> membrane assemble phospholipids. <b>The</b> <b>ER</b> membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ERs</b> are {{regarded}} to be cytoplasmic receptors in their unliganded state, but visualization {{research has shown}} that {{only a small fraction of}} <b>the</b> <b>ERs</b> reside in <b>the</b> cytoplasm, with most <b>ER</b> constitutively in <b>the</b> nucleus.|$|R
5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. <b>The</b> <b>ER</b> membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes back across <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction {{of the muscle}} cell.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ER</b> is {{involved}} in cotranslational sorting of proteins. A polypeptide which contains an ER signal sequence is recognised by a signal recognition protein which halts {{the production of the}} protein. the SRP transports the polypeptide to <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> membrane where its released in through a membrane pore and translation resumes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ER</b> has {{a central}} role in producing, processing, and {{transporting}} biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of <b>the</b> <b>ER,</b> Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.|$|E

5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; rather, it is a two-way street. The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> membrane facilitate feedback regulation coordinated by MAM function. In particular, the clearance of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to reload <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ efflux at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; rather it helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} (also {{known as}} the Golgi body and the Golgi complex) is composed of separate sacs called cisternae. Its shape {{is similar to a}} stack of pancakes. The number of these stacks varies with the specific function of the cell. The Golgi apparatus is used by the cell for further protein modification. The section of the Golgi apparatus that receives the vesicles from <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> is {{known as the}} cis face, and is usually near <b>the</b> <b>ER.</b> The opposite end of the Golgi apparatus is called the trans face, this is where the modified compounds leave.

5|$|Other {{methods for}} elucidating the {{cellular}} location of proteins requires {{the use of}} known compartmental markers for regions such as <b>the</b> <b>ER,</b> the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.|$|E
5|$|Such {{trafficking}} capacity {{depends on}} the MAM, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate transfer of lipid intermediates between organelles. In contrast to the standard vesicular mechanism of lipid transfer, evidence indicates that the physical proximity of <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for lipid flipping between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein tethering structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter structure, or ERMES, although it remains unclear whether this structure directly mediates lipid transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for lipid flipping.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is {{enriched in}} enzymes {{involved}} in lipid biosynthesis, such as phosphatidylserine synthase on <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> face and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase on the mitochondrial face.

5|$|The fate {{of these}} puffs—in particular, whether they remain {{restricted}} to isolated locales or integrated into Ca2+ waves for propagation throughout the cell—is determined {{in large part}} by MAM dynamics. Although reuptake of Ca2+ by <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> (concomitant with its release) modulates the intensity of the puffs, thus insulating mitochondria to a certain degree from high Ca2+ exposure, the MAM often serves as a firewall that essentially buffers Ca2+ puffs by acting as a sink into which free ions released into the cytosol can be funneled.

The ability of mitochondria to serve as a Ca2+ sink is a result of the electrochemical gradient generated during oxidative phosphorylation, which makes tunneling of the cation an exergonic process.
