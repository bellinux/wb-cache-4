Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. <b>The</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E

Many regional markets have achieved some success and the ongoing trend continues to be towards deregulation and introduction of competition.

500|$|The Economists Free Exchange blog {{argued that}} Cowen [...] "undersold" [...] recent {{innovations}} in digital technologies and that society {{was still in}} the process of re-organising itself around them. A growth spurt should be expected but this could take anything from years to decades, it warned. Furthermore, there are particularly large gains to be had in the area [...] "cognition-augmenting innovations (as opposed to labor-augmenting innovations)". Writing in Forbes, Steve Denning described Cowen's [...] "low-hanging fruit theory" [...] as [...] "folkloric nonsense". The world of 1953, when Denning was young, is inconceivable to a young person today, he wrote, adding that the qualification [...] "apart from the Internet" [...] is equivalent to saying [...] "apart from the wheel" [...] when discussing transport. The Financial Times reviewer recognized that Cowen, a prominent blogger, [...] "is no Luddite...he thinks life is more fun and interesting with the internet around". He argued that most economists do not look at consumer technology to find the internet's effect on productivity but rather organizations: super-efficient retailers such as Wal-mart and Tesco have already incorporated it into their logistics. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> means it could be a generation at least before we see the full implementation. Timothy Noah seizes upon Cowen's [...] "concession" [...] that the internet could well increase scientific output by allowing better communication between scientists in remote places. Just as Davis and Wessel incorrectly predicted a coming boom in middle class incomes due to computers, Cowen [...] "seems equally wrong to suggest that computer technology is not on the verge of doing so." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1946, missile {{conversion}} projects for Kentucky and the incomplete large cruiser [...] were discussed. In the early 1950s, the advances in guided missile technology {{led to a}} proposal to create a large warship armed with both guns and missiles. To this end, the incomplete Kentucky was chosen for conversion from an all gun ship into a [...] "guided missile battleship". This proposal would have been relatively conservative, and would have involved the installation {{of a pair of}} twin arm launchers for the RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile (SAM) on the aft deckhouse, with a pair of antennas for the associated AN/APG-55 pulse doppler interception radar installed forward of these, and the AN/SPS-2B air search radar on a short mast. Since the battleship was already approximately 73% complete (construction had been halted at the main deck), installation of the missile system and associated electronics would have involved only adding the necessary equipment without any need to rebuild the ship to accommodate the system. Some guided missile concepts included one or two launchers for eight Regulus II or SSM-N-2 Triton nuclear cruise missiles. The guided missile battleship project was authorized in 1954, and Kentucky was renumbered from BB-66 to BBG-1, with the conversion due to be complete in 1956. However, the project was soon cancelled, with the conversion ideas transferred to a smaller platform that led to the [...] guided missile cruiser. [...] These partial conversions of two [...] heavy cruisers proved only partially successful in their new role, as <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in cruise missile technology rendered their new weapons systems obsolete, while their remaining heavy guns proved in demand.|$|E
500|$|Phi Tau {{was founded}} at Dartmouth College in 1905 as the Tau Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa. While the {{national}} fraternity {{proved to be}} an early leader among its peers in the area of non-discrimination, mid-1950s Tau Chapter leaders led the demand for such post-war era changes. <b>The</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> was contentious: Phi Sigma Kappa had previously had occasional foreign student members at many chapters. Unlike other fraternities, it had also welcomed Catholics and Jews {{at a time when most}} fraternity members were Protestant. But it did not yet welcome Blacks. In a reactionary response to a short-lived policy that limited pledging of Black students between 1952–56, and in a move that allowed it to avoid unpaid debts to the national, Tau broke with Phi Sigma Kappa and reformed itself as Phi Tau on March 7, 1956, naming the national fraternity as racist. [...] Yet ironically, the Dartmouth chapter won the debate over the issue: the same discriminatory policy that caused Tau to withdraw was itself rescinded by the national fraternity at its Summer Convention just two months later, leaving Phi Sigma Kappa chapters free to pledge Black members. There has been no reconciliation, even though both groups remain progressive. Today, Phi Tau prides itself on its progressiveness; when the house constitution was rewritten in 1956, references to gender were deliberately excluded, making the house officially coeducational even before Dartmouth College accepted women as students. [...] Phi Tau is the only coeducational Greek organization at Dartmouth that has always had female members since first admitting them, and was the first Greek house at Dartmouth to add sexual orientation to its non-discrimination clause. [...] Members of Phi Tau refer to one another as [...] "brothers" [...] regardless of gender. The fraternity is known for its quarterly [...] "Milque and Cookies" [...] party, featuring thousands of homemade cookies and milkshakes. [...] Phi Tau completely replaced their residence hall in 2002, at a cost of $1.8 million, funded in part by the sale of [...] of land to the college.|$|E

To answer this question, we adopt an inductive method that exploits historical facts and patent statistics to provide empirical data. Basing our rationale on the appropriation and structural inertia arguments, we show that the constraints imposed by reliability in the defense and space industries impedes the appropriation of supra profits from innovation and thus slows <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>change.</b> <b>The</b> main managerial implication of this result is that technical inertia contributes to competitive success when the reliability constraint reaches high levels.
