Previous approaches rely on significant speculation to accomplish this goal. Our proposal, NXA, is less speculative than previous proposals, relying heavily on software to guarantee thread correctness, though still allowing parallelism in the presence of ambiguous dependences. It divides a single thread of execution into multiple using the master-worker paradigm where some set of master threads execute code that spawns tasks for other, worker <b>theads.</b> The master threads generally consist of performance critical instructions that can prefetch data, compute critical control descisions, or compute performance critical dataflow slices. This prevents non-critical instructions from competing with critical instructions for processor resources, allowing the critical thread (and thus the workload) to complete faster. Empirical results from performance simulation show a 20 % improvement in performance on a 2 -way CMP machine, demonstrating that software controlled multithreading can indeed provide a benefit in the presence of hardware support. 1...|$|E

This is the casefor {{the analysis of the}} binding of radiolabeled [11 C]Pittsburgh Compound B ([11 C]PIB) to amyloid-β(Aβ) plaques in brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To resolve the issue of rapid clearancefrom the circulation, we here introduce the flow-independent Washout Allometric Reference Method(Warm) for the analysis of washout and binding of [11 C]PIB in two groups of human subjects, healthyaged control subjects (HC), and patients suffering from AD, and we compare the results to the outcomeof two conventional analysis methods. We also use the rapid initial clearance to obtain a surrogatemeasure of the rate of cerebral blood flow (CBF), as well as a method of identifying a suitable referenceregion directly from the [11 C]PIB signal. The difference of average absolute CBF values between <b>theAD</b> and HC groups was highly significant (P< 0. 003). The CBF measures were not significantly differentbetween the groups when normalized to cerebellar grey matter flow. Thus, when flow differences confoundconventional measures of [11 C]PIB binding, the separate estimates of CBF and BPND provide additionalinformation about possible AD. The results demonstrate the importance of data-driven estimation of CBFand BPND, as well as reference region detection from the [11 C]PIB signal. We conclude that the Warmmethod yields stable measures of BPND with relative ease, using only integration for noise reduction andno model regression. The method accounts for relative flow differences in the brain tissue and yieldsa calibrated measure of absolute CBF directly from the [11 C]PIB signal.

The objective of this project {{was to determine the}} thermal responses of Hybrid Converter Tom Turkeys when exposed to either the standard recommended rearing temperature or 4 °C below the standard, on a weekly basis. An infrared camera was used to measure surface temperatures of the breast (Tbreast), drumstick (Tdrum), head (<b>Thead),</b> shank (Tshank) and wing (Twing) of 12 turkeys exposed individually over a 2 hour period once each week (wk) for 12 wks. A small thermal data logger (Tlogger) was also used to measure the surface temperature of the skin beneath the wing. Cloacal temperature (Tcore) was measured once before and after the test period. Temperatures of the feathered locations (Tbreast, Tdrum and Twing) decreased from wks 1 – 7 and then remained constant from wks 8 - 12 (P 0. 05). The remaining featherless location (Tcore) was found to be lower during the first week before rising and remaining constant for the last 11 weeks. A decrease of 4 °C caused a decrease in the temperatures of the feathered locations (P 0. 05). The remaining featherless locations were found to have different temperatures between the treatment groups during the first few wks of growth (P< 0. 05).

To investigate this aspect, a number of sliding tests were carried out on baseline TiCN- 20 Ni cermet and TiCN- 20 wt%Ni- 10 wt% XC cermets (X = W/Nb/Ta/Hf) at varying loads of 5 N, 20 N, and 50 N against bearing steel. With these experiments, we attemptedto answer some of the pertinent issues: (i) how does the type of secondary carbide (WC/NbC/TaC/HfC) influence friction and wear behavior, and is such influence dependent on load?and (ii) how does the secondary carbide addition affect the stability and composition of the tribochemical layer under the selected sliding conditions? Our experimental results reveal that <b>theadded</b> secondary carbides influence chemical interactions between different oxides and such interactions dominate the friction and wear behavior. A higher coefficient of friction (COF) range, varying from 0. 75 to 0. 64 was recorded at 5 Nwhereas the reduced COF of 0. 46 - 0. 52 was observed at 20 N or 50 N. The volumetric wear rate decreased with load and varied on the order of 10 - 6 to 10 - 7 mm 3 /Nm for the cermets investigated. The cermet containing HfC exhibited high friction and poor wear resistance. At low load (5 N), the abrasion and adhesion of hard debris containing various oxides dominated the wear, and resulted in high friction and wear loss. In contrast, the more pronounced increase in friction-induced contact temperature (below 500 °C) andcompaction of hard debris resulted in the formation of a distinct tribochemical layer at higher loads (20 N and 50 N). The formation of a dense tribolayer containing oxides of iron and/or titanium is responsible for the reduced friction and wear, irrespective of secondary carbides...|$|R

The first {{aim was to}} examine the reproducibility and validity of the CFFQ in order to assess dietary intake among two groups; 3 - 11 year old children (YC group) and 12 - 16 year old children (AD group). The second aim was to use the CFFQ and the FFQ for adults (AFFQ), and to determine which was better suited for assessing the intake of children in each group. Methods A total of the 103 children participated in this study. The interval between the first CFFQ and AFFQ and the second CFFQ and AFFQ was one month. Four weighted dietary records (WDRs) were conducted once a week. Pearson's correlation coefficients {{between the first and second}} FFQs were calculated to test the reproducibility of each FFQ. Pearson's correlation coefficients between WDRs and the second FFQ were calculated for the unadjusted value and sex-, age-, and energy-adjusted values to determine the validity of each FFQ. Results The final number of subjects participating in the analysis was 89. The median correlation coefficients between the first and second CFFQs and AFFQs were 0. 76 and 0. 73, respectively. There was some over/underestimation of nutrients in the CFFQ of the YC group and in the AFFQ of the AD group. The medians of the sex-, age-, and energy-adjusted correlation coefficients were not different between the YC and AD groups for each FFQ. The correlation coefficient in sex-, age-, and energy-adjusted value revealed that the largest number of subject with high (0. 50 or more) value was obtained by the CFFQ in the YC group. Conclusions This study indicated that the CFFQ might be a useful tool for assessing habitual dietary intake of children in the YC group. Although the CFFQ agreed moderately with habitual intake, it was found to underestimate intake in <b>theAD</b> group. However, for the AFFQ, the ability to rank habitual intake was low. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new FFQ or modify an existing FFQ to accurately assess the habitual diet of children in the AD group. </p...|$|R

In recent years, TTII based on IAG are discussed in various fields. However, most ofthem are anecdotal and qualitative reports on the success factor based onquestionnaires and interviews, and to best of our knowledge,there is no quantitativeand systematic study on the issue. This study quantitatively analyzes 100 successful cases of TTII disclosed by thegovernment, starting with empirical analyses on the success factor. Firstly, we carry out functional classification in coordination since the key factor forsuccess(KFS) of individual cases is {{described in terms of}} the coordination functionpromoting IAG collaboration. As a result, we classify the functions of the coordinationinto the basic function such as matching between seeds and needs and the function toincrease the added value of the seeds. Since the ratio in the contribution of the twofunctions was 3 : 7, the function to increase the added value is more important than theother. We also illustrated the roles and the mutual relationship among the researcher,the corporation and the coordinator that consists of the basic framework of IAGcollaboration as a triangle model. In addition, through the multivariate analyses on the property of seeds and the factorfor success in the successful cases, we shed some light on to the current status of thecoordinators. Then, we analyze the conditions to form the IAG collaboration and its formation aswell as the mutual relationship the property of the seeds and KFS and find out theefficient cases using the data envelop analyses (DEA). Through the analyses,recognizing that the conditions to form the IAG collaboration and the importance ofincentive,we find that the incentive form including the consortium type is moreefficient than the distributional form in the collaboration form to promote TTII. We alsoclarify that the needs-driven case is more efficient than the seeds-driven case. Based on these results, in order to pursuit {{the effective}} management for TTII, weattempt to create measurement indices foe the effective management and to evaluate itnumerically utilizing T-Plan (R&D road map), Ellipse-cross concept (pair-strategic map) and Balanced scorecard (BSC) and to discuss the steps and the cycle for themanagement. As a result, we are able to provide a clue for effective management to improve thesuccess rate of TTII and also suggest the direction to which the coordinators’management ability should be developed. This paper consists of the following;Chapter 1 “Introduction” describes the objectives of this study, its background andhow we have proceeded with our study. Chapter 2 “Issues of IAG collaboration” considers the current situation, problems andmajor roles of the coordinators based on the past experience.

In addition, the issues of IAGcollaboration are schematized as a triangle model to visualize the relation among theresearcher, the corporation and the coordinator. Chapter 4 “Coordinator analyses” examines the degree of contribution by thecoordinator and the relation between the seeds property and KFS based on the resultsof the substantial data analyses using type I quantification method and type IIIquantification method and clarifies the current figure of the coordinators and therelation between the seeds property and KFS. Chapter 5 “Form analyses and effective case analyses for IAG collaboration” examinesthe conditions for forming collaboration and the form utilizing the game theory, etc. aswell as the efficient propulsion form and characteristics of the cases Through DEAusing 100 cases.
