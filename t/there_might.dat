5|$|The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species {{lists the}} Stresemann's bushcrow as {{endangered}} {{because of its}} very restricted range and loss of suitable habitat.

5|$|This crisis led him {{to apply}} to lecture on {{philosophy}} rather than mathematics.

5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Depending {{upon the}} size and {{economic}} well-being of the farm, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> also be a feast hall (oppstue), a house for the retired farmers (føderådstue), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), carriage house (vognskjul), and even distillery (brenneskur).

5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and <b>there</b> <b>might</b> even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E

5|$|This {{study has}} been criticized on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that measurement of the northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> be bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E

5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in a 2016 study, examination of melanosomes preserved in the specimen of Psittacosaurus preserved with integument indicated that the animal was countershaded, likely due to preferring a habitat in dense forests with little light, much like many modern species of forest-dwelling deer and antelope; stripes and spots on the limbs may represent disruptive coloration. The specimen also had dense clusters of pigment on its shoulders, face (possibly for display), and cloaca (which may have had an antimicrobial function), as well as large patagia {{on its hind legs}} that connected {{to the base of the}} tail. Its large eyes indicate that it also likely had good vision, which would have been useful in finding food or avoiding predators. The authors pointed out that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have been variation in coloration across the range of the animal, depending on differences in the light environment. The authors were unable to determine which species of Jehol Formation Psittacosaurus the specimen belonged to due to the way the skull is preserved, but ruled out P. mongoliensis, based on hip features.|$|E
5|$|Cominco's president, Selwyn G. Blaylock, was cautious. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> be no post-war {{demand for}} heavy water, and the patent {{on the process}} was held by Albert Edgar Knowles, so a {{profit-sharing}} agreement would be required. In response, Taylor offered $20,000 for plant modifications. There the matter rested until 6 December, when Blaylock {{had a meeting with}} the British physicist G. I. Higson, who informed him that Taylor had become discouraged with Cominco, and had decided to find another source of heavy water. Blaylock invited Taylor to visit Trail, which he did from 5 to 8 January 1942. The two soon found common ground. Blaylock agreed to produce heavy water at Trail, and quickly secured approval from the Chairman of the Board, Sir Edward Beatty. A contract was signed on 1 August 1942. The heavy water project became known as the P-9 Project in October 1942.|$|E
