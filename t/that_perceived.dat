5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school {{until he reached the}} fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later {{turn out to be a}} fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E
25|$|Hoover was {{concerned}} about what he claimed was subversion, and under his leadership, the FBI investigated {{tens of thousands of}} suspected subversives and radicals. According to critics, Hoover tended to exaggerate the dangers of these alleged subversives and many times overstepped his bounds in his pursuit of eliminating <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> threat.|$|E
25|$|Neutral monists {{adhere to}} the {{position}} <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> {{things in the world}} can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.|$|E

25|$|The thick {{underbrush}} {{prevented the}} Union Army from recognizing {{the proximity of}} the Confederates. Adding to the confusion, Meade received an erroneous report that the Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart was operating in his Army's rear, in the direction of Fredericksburg. He ordered the bulk of his cavalry to move east to deal with <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> threat, leaving his army blind. But he assumed that the corps of Sedgwick, Warren, and Hancock could hold back any potential Confederate advance until the supply trains came up, at which time Grant could move forward to engage in a major battle with Lee, presumably at Mine Run.|$|E
500|$|A related concern {{expressed}} by Stiles is <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> scarcity may lead countries still {{active in the}} ivory trade to create stockpiles of their own, owing to [...] "the senseless system now in operation" [...] in countries like the United States, Thailand, and China, whereby international ivory trade is considered illegal but domestic trade is permitted, ensuring at least some continued demand and, in Stiles's view, [...] "guaranteeing extinction of the elephant".|$|E

500|$|However, Mathews' {{frustration}} with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest. [...] In fact, {{there were numerous}} philosophers and theologians at Chicago's Divinity School <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications. [...] In 1927 they invited one of America's only Whitehead experts – Henry Nelson Wieman – to Chicago to give a lecture explaining Whitehead's thought. [...] Wieman's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years, and for at least thirty years afterward Chicago's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead's thought.|$|E
500|$|Setting [...] "prices" [...] in DKP for {{specific}} items can be difficult, as {{analysis of a}} particular item can be subjective and laborious. [...] In order to avoid this quandary, guilds may establish an auction system for items. [...] Points are awarded to the player at some specified rate and when the items are awarded to the raid group, players bid DKP for the item of their choice. [...] Auctions may be conducted in an open ascending fashion or through sealed bids over private messages to guild leaders. [...] While this process results in relatively efficient allocation of items to players willing to part with DKP, it presents the social consequence <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> selfish bidding could result in an item being awarded to a character who would not make {{the best use of}} it.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do it any other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E
500|$|General Lee also {{understood}} the defensive potential to the Union army if {{they held the}} high ground of Cemetery Hill. He sent orders to Ewell to [...] "carry the hill occupied by the enemy, if he found it practicable, but to avoid a general engagement until {{the arrival of the}} other divisions of the army." [...] In the face of this discretionary, and possibly contradictory, order, Ewell chose not to attempt the assault. One reason posited was the battle fatigue of his men in the late afternoon, although [...] "Allegheny" [...] Johnson's division of Ewell's Corps was within an hour of arriving on the battlefield. Another was the difficulty of assaulting the hill through the narrow corridors afforded by the streets of Gettysburg immediately to the north. Ewell requested assistance from A.P. Hill, but that general felt his corps was too depleted from the day's battle and General Lee did not want to bring up Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division from the reserve. Ewell did consider taking Culp's Hill, which would have made the Union position on Cemetery Hill untenable. However, Jubal Early opposed the idea when it was reported that Union troops (probably Slocum's XII Corps) were approaching on the York Pike, and he sent the brigades of John B. Gordon and Brig. Gen. William [...] "Extra Billy" [...] Smith to block <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> threat; Early urged waiting for Johnson's division to take the hill. After Johnson's division arrived via the Chambersburg Pike, it maneuvered toward the east of town in preparation to take the hill, but a small reconnaissance party sent in advance encountered a picket line of the 7th Indiana Infantry, which opened fire and captured a Confederate officer and soldier. The remainder of the Confederates fled and attempts to seize Culp's Hill on July 1 came to an end.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{theory and}} {{research}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>perceiving</b> shared humanity with others should be a positive force for intergroup relations. The present research considers the alternative possibility, that notions of shared humanity might protect people from feelings of guilt over ingroup perpetrated harm by obscuring the ingroup's unique role in these events. Consistent with this idea, Study 1 (N = 58) found <b>that</b> <b>perceiving</b> shared humanity with a harmed outgroup was associated with less guilt and stronger expectations of forgiveness {{among members of the}} perpetrator group. Study 2 (N = 52) demonstrated that these effects only occurred when the moral integrity of the ingroup was open to question. When ingroup morality was instead secure, defensive use of humanity was not apparent. Together, these studies suggest <b>that</b> <b>perceiving</b> harmful ingroup actions as 'only human' can sometimes be a moral defence that absolves group members of feelings of responsibility for wrongdoing.

[...] Leonard places Empson's interpretation [...] "in the [...] tradition of William Blake and Percy Bysshe Shelley."

In the second part of the essay, I present some reasons for thinking that one's justification, in cases of perceptual knowledge, consists not in the fact <b>that</b> one <b>perceives</b> <b>that</b> P but in the fact <b>that</b> one <b>perceives</b> such-and-such.

2500|$|The {{secondary}} {{function of}} medieval hospitals was charity to the poor, sick, and travellers. Charity provided by hospitals surfaced in different ways, including long-term {{maintenance of the}} infirm, medium-term care of the sick, short-term hospitality to travellers, and regular distribution of alms to the poor. Though these were general acts of charity among medieval hospitals, the degree of charity was variable. For example, some institutions <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> themselves mainly as a religious house or place of hospitality turned away the sick or dying in fear that difficult healthcare will distract from worship. Others, however, such as St. James of Northallerton, St. Giles of Norwich, and St. Leonard of York, contained specific ordinances stating they must cater to the sick and that [...] "all who entered with ill health {{should be allowed to}} stay until they recovered or died".|$|E
2500|$|Job {{characteristics}} are {{attributes of the}} job that people traditionally find important, including {{the extent to which}} they identify with the tasks they are doing (identity), {{the extent to which they}} are assigned diverse tasks (variety), extent to which they feel their work affects others (significance), extent to which they receive productive feedback from their job (feedback), and the extent to which they feel they are allowed to make their own decisions at their job (autonomy). [...] These characteristics play an important role in influencing the relationship between an individual's core self-evaluations and their satisfaction with their job. [...] Studies have found <b>that</b> <b>perceived</b> job characteristics partially mediate the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] In other words, a person who appraises themselves positively (i.e., has high core self-evaluations) and has acquired a job which encompasses the aforementioned characteristics of identity, variety, significance, feedback, and autonomy, will be more likely to be satisfied with the job.|$|E
