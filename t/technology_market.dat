On March 13, 2001, Eazel simultaneously launched the first release of its flagship Nautilus (version 1.0), and laid off most of its 75 employees in an attempt to secure funding in its final few months. The company attempted to sell its core development group but ceased operations on May 15, 2001.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the factors {{influencing}} performance of software companies. This model tests various theoretical research hypotheses related to innovation, standardization and <b>technology</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy and software type. Smart PLS (Partial Least Square) have been utilized for deriving the study results. The result of hypothesis testing is as follows. First, standardization and <b>technology</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy positively influence financial performance. Second, innovation, standardization and <b>technology</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy positively influence technical performance. Finally, mobile and non-mobile software companies was shown that innovation, standardization, and <b>technology</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy has different effects to financial and technical performance...|$|R

25|$|Instruments {{used by the}} {{original}} techno producers based in Detroit, {{many of which are}} now highly sought after on the retro music <b>technology</b> <b>market,</b> include classic drum machines like the Roland TR-808 and TR-909, devices such as the Roland TB-303 bass line generator, and synthesizers such as the Roland SH-101, Kawai KC10, Yamaha DX7, and Yamaha DX100 (as heard on Derrick May's seminal 1987 techno release Nude Photo). Much of the early music sequencing was executed via MIDI (but neither the TR-808 nor the TB-303 had MIDI, only DIN sync) using hardware sequencers such as the Korg SQD1 and Roland MC-50, and the limited amount of sampling that was featured in this early style was accomplished using an Akai S900.|$|E

As long as an enterprise belonged in an industry whose market, sources of raw materials, and production processes remained relatively unchanged, few entrepreneurial decisions have to be reached. In that situation, such a weakness was not critical, but where <b>technology,</b> <b>market,</b> and sources of supplies were changed rapidly, the defect of such a structure became more obvious.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Going [...] "upstream", {{from the}} market {{environment}} to the <b>technology,</b> <b>market</b> signals act to inform the producers of the technology about variations in relative prices. However, {{the extent to which}} technology producers can shift from more expensive to cheaper inputs, or modify technology toward the use of cheaper complement goods is bound by technical constraints. Such constraints emerge because inputs are characterized by low substitutability due to the physical and chemical limits involved in the production process. Consequently, the upstream incentives given by market signals affect only the rate of use of certain inputs as well as the rate of development of a trajectory but not the direction of technical change, which is bound by the technical constraints of production.|$|E
