40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{cause of}} {{the largest number of}} faults on the Eskom main {{transmission}} system is unknown. It is believed that a non-uniform pollution layer along an insulator string is the reason for these anomalous <b>flashovers.</b> This non-uniform <b>pollution</b> layer results in the highest electric field strength, and thus the highest voltage, across the cleanest and driest discs. There thus exists a strong possibility that the anomalous flashover phenomenon is caused by a combination of mechanisms involving <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> and air breakdown flashover mechanisms. This research project attempted to prove that flashover of the insulators is possible in accordance with the above model. Various experiments were set up in the high voltage laboratory and at a natural test site with a low source impedance supply attempting to simulate the conditions that lead to flashover in accordance with the hypothesis. All the tests done have not proven <b>the</b> non-uniform light <b>pollution</b> <b>flashover</b> mechanism successfully.

40|$|The {{cleaning}} {{effect of}} heavy rain (the rainfall reaches 5 mm every day) on surface contamination of insulators {{is more effective}} than dew, fog, mist, and other light rain conditions which can initiate leakage currents and increase the likelihood of flashover. It is well understood that heavy rain can wash away contamination from the surface of high voltage (HV) insulators and thereby reduce <b>the</b> risk of <b>pollution</b> <b>flashover.</b> This study examines the cleaning effect of natural wetting conditions on HV insulators on four 500 kV transmission lines in Hunan Province, China. Historical meteorological data, monthly equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) and non-soluble deposit density (NSDD) measurements taken over a period of five years were analyzed to investigate the relationship between rainfall intensity and insulator cleaning. The measured data show that the ESDD/NSDD changes with the seasonal variation, which accumulates in dry season (January–April, about 117 – 122 days) and is washed off in the wet season (June–October, about 118 – 127 days). According to the measured data, the ESDD and NSDD on the surface of insulators were affected by the rainfall intensity (in the dry season it is about 1 mm/day and in the wet season it is about 5 mm/day).

40|$|Pollution is {{the single}} largest cause of transmission/distribution line outages, next to lightning, which result in {{expensive}} power outages. A major significance {{of the problem is}} that it can repeatedly occur even at normal working voltages. As a result, it has become the most detrimental factor affecting the safe operation of extra and ultra high voltage (EHV/UHV) transmission lines and substations. In reality, the phenomenon of pollution-induced flashover is a very complex, and vexatious problem that continues to challenge high voltage engineers even today. In spite of knowing this phenomenon for the past several decades, a solution has remained still elusive. Although there exist some remedial measures, there are associated limitations, which will become evident on long runs. The guaranteed solution seems to be the washing and cleaning of insulators for which utilities spend significant amount of money. Therefore, there is a need to develop a suitable mitigation technique which is cost effective and yield better performance in the field. Motivated by this, the present study is undertaken and it essentially aims to seek simple alternative solutions for the problem for strings with ceramic insulator discs. All the ten types (normal and anti fog) ceramic insulators, which are commonly employed in our country, are considered in the study. Amongst the several controllable and uncontrollable physical quantities leading to <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>flashover</b> phenomena, the maximum surface field identified as on of the major influencing factor. In fact, the field concentration near the pin can lead to early formation of dry band and scintillation/partial arcs. Considering this, it is intended to seek possible minimization of the maximum surface field occurring at the pin region. This is expected to yield enhanced pollution/contamination flashover strength and in addition, show an improvement in normal operation. The intended study requires a detailed knowledge on field distribution. However, the required data is found to be rather scarce. In view of this a detailed study on field distribution is taken up for all the ten types of disc insulators used in our country. For the problem under investigation, the governing equation has been identified for both clean and polluted conditions along with pertinent boundary conditions. Considering the open geometry nature of the problem along with presence of multiple dielectrics, Surface Charge Simulation (SCSM) methodology was found to be most suitable and hence adopted for the work. In particular, the Galerkin method with piecewise linear interpolation function is employed in the formulation. The method employed and the codes developed are verified with suitable examples. First, a detailed quantification of the field distribution under clean conditions is made for all the ten types of discs in single disc and string configuration. Subsequently, the task of reducing the maximum surface field gradient, which occurs at the pin, is attempted. Several consideration lead to an artificial extension of pin as one of best feasible choice. However, any attempt to extend the pin would lead to some reduction in total creepage length, possible enhancement of bulk stress in air and enhancement of stress in triple junction. After a careful study, involving several experimental trials, a novel field control element (FCE) is developed both for normal and anti-fog types of insulator discs. From the electric field simulation study, it is shown that the use of field control element for uniform pollution deposition prevailing under laboratory test conditions yields a significant reduction of maximum surface field for discs by about 47 to 54 %. Similarly a reduction of about 37 % to 55 % in case of 3 -disc string (for 33 kV class), 30 % to 52 % in case of 9 -disc string (for 132 kV class), 27 % to 52 % in case of 14 -disc string (220 kV class), 27 % to 54 % in case of 23 / 20 disc string (for 400 kV class) and 41 % to 48 % in case of 35 / 29 disc strings (for 765 kV class) is achieved respectively for different strings. It is anticipated that this will lead to retardation in inception of scintillations/partial arcs, which in turn can reduce the risk of pollution induced flashover. Subsequently, it was aimed to experimentally evaluate the impact of field control element on the performance of disc/string under normal and that during polluted conditions. For this a national level unique artificial pollution test facility as per the international standards has been established for conducting pollution studies on disc insulator/strings up to 132 kV system voltage (The rating of test source: 150 kV/ 2 A, 100 kV/ 3 A, 50 kV/ 6 A of 300 kVA). Experimental investigations for the normal operation involving dry and wet power frequency flashover strengths, lightning impulse strength, radio interference level (RIV), visible discharge inception (Corona) level and voltage distribution along the string are carried out. The study showed that with the insertion of field control element, performance under normal condition is maintained and in fact noticeably improved in certain cases. Subsequently pollution flashover strength is evaluated using solid layer and cold fog methods. <b>The</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>flashover</b> strength exhibited an overall improvement 15 to 20 % for all types of discs considered in the study. Similarly an improvement of 16 to 19 % and 12 - 14 % is observed for 3 -disc string and 6 -disc string respectively. The reasons for relatively lower gain in <b>the</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>flashover</b> strength as compared to reduction in maximum surface field are investigated. In particular, the reduction in improvement with number of discs in a string is dealt with. The non-uniform wet-ting against highly non-uniform drying of insulator surface and discs in a string, are identified as the cause for deviation. For an experimental verification of the same, the pollution layer resistance of individual discs in a 3 -disc string is measured prior to and immediately after flashover. It is shown that the resistances of the different units become grossly different even though initial values were substantially the same. The values measured immediately after flashover show that the resistance of the top unit develops voltage enough to result in its flashover and subsequently, the flashover of the whole string. In summary, the main contribution of the present work is the development of novel field control element (FCE) for both normal and anti-fog type of ceramic disc insulators, which will enhance their pollution flashover strength. The actual cost of these elements is estimated to be about 1 - 2 % of the cost of the disc, while the gain in strength is shown to be more than 12 - 20 %...|$|E

Filling that gap, we proposed a novel evaluation framework of IC based on remote sensing and data mining. Varieties of products derived from satellite data, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD), digital elevation model (DEM), land use and land cover and normalized difference vegetation index were obtained to estimate the severity of IC along with the necessary field investigation inventory (pollution sources, ambient atmosphere and meteorological data).
