40|$|It is a {{commonly}} held view that returns to innovation are highly skewed, that is, not all firms innovate, and <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> received from innovation for the firms that are successful innovators are highly {{concentrated in the}} hands of the few.

It finds that <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> to innovation are indeed highly skewed, but the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> is shaped by the degree of novelty of the innovation - the more novel the innovation, the greater the concentration of <b>the</b> <b>returns.</b> <b>The</b> article also explores the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> across different sectoral contexts, finding that low-technology sectors are characterised by higher performance diversity among innovators than high-technology sectors.

We use the instrument developed by Altonji and Shakotko (1987) {{and used by}} Parent (2000) and Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) to estimate returns to tenure using the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS). The panel structure of the data allows us to construct respondents’ employment history between 1988 and 2007. We find that <b>the</b> 10 -year <b>return</b> to employer tenure is 24 % and <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> to potential experience are 18 %. Once we include occupation, industry, and sector tenure, we find that <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> to employer tenure and potential experience remain significant and of similar magnitude, {{while there is no}} significant return to sector tenure. However, when we allow <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> in <b>the</b> formal sector to differ from <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> in <b>the</b> informal sector, we find that <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> are much higher in the formal sector. All else equal, <b>the</b> 10 -year <b>return</b> to formal sector tenure is 35 %, while there is no significant return to tenure in the informal sector.|$|R
