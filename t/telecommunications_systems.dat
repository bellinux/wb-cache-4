5|$|Laying of {{the track}} was {{performed}} by Wiebe, signaling was installed by Norsk Jernbanedrift, Structon Rail installed the overhead wire, and YIT installed the power supply and <b>telecommunications</b> <b>systems.</b> The tunnel has the NSI-63 relay-based signaling system, although it {{was scheduled to be}} replaced by European Rail Traffic Management System shortly after 2015. The last six weeks before opening, the Vestfold Line was closed to allow the new and old sections to be connected. This was the most hectic part of construction, as it saw the tracks south of the tunnel be rearranged to allow trains to operate the opposite direction through the loop in Tønsberg. The work was performed by Reinertsen and took 100,000 man-hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} had a Simulation for Automatic Machinery computer {{built by}} FFI which allowed for real-time operations with the data. <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>systems</b> were {{operated by the}} Norwegian Telecommunications Administration, which established a two-way radio station at Ny-Ålesund. Communication from the satellites was relayed by radio to Ski and onwards with a leased line to the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Return information was relayed via a radio station at Jeløy. Magnetic tapes were sent to Darmstadt every other week, first via aircraft to Longyearbyen and then onwards to Germany. NTNF hired a nurse and had the Amundsen House refitted as a clinic {{for the duration of}} the telemetry station's operation.|$|E

25|$|The Ulvin Tunnel runs in {{the same}} area as the Morskogen Tunnel of said motorway. The route was {{controversial}} due to it hugging the shoreline of the lake Mjøsa. Local and environmental authorities wanted most of the railway and motorway to run in tunnels. It resulted in a compromise, where the Ulvin Tunnel allowed for a longer section of lakeshore to remain untouched. The groundwork contract was awarded to Veidekke and Hochtief, along with other works. The permanent way was laid by Infranord; Eltel installed the electrical and <b>telecommunications</b> <b>systems.</b> The tunnel is scheduled for opening on 23 November 2015.|$|E

25|$|The third-generation Range Rover was {{designed}} to accommodate BMW's M62 V8 engines for future models. The manual transmission was dropped entirely, leaving only the automatic transmission. The E38 7 Series electronics system were being phased out during {{the development of the}} third-generation Range Rover, and being replaced with the electronics from the BMW E39 5 Series. The entertainment system (Radio Function, Navigation System, Television and <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as the automotive computer bus system) on pre-facelift models were almost identical to those in the BMW E39 5 Series.

25|$|The British Telecommunications Act 1981 {{transferred}} {{the responsibility for}} telecommunications services from the Post Office, creating two separate corporations, Post Office Ltd. and British Telecommunications. At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into British telecommunications industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British Telecommunications, to license other operators to run public <b>telecommunications</b> <b>systems.</b> Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the British Standards Institution (BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and {{had the effect of}} requiring British Telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems. The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable & Wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary, Mercury Communications Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky is {{preparing}} to attend college, leaving his girlfriend Mikaela Banes and guardian Bumblebee behind. He finds a smaller AllSpark shard and picks it up, causing him to start seeing Cybertronian symbols and accidentally brings multiple kitchen appliances to life. After Bumblebee destroys the rampaging appliances (along with part of the Witwicky's house), Sam gives the shard to Mikaela, who later captures the Decepticon Wheelie when he attempts to steal it. The Constructicons resurrect Megatron by ripping apart the smallest Constructicon Scrapmetal to provide parts for him, as well as using the stolen shard. Megatron then travels to one of Saturn's moons, where he reunites with his master, the Fallen, who orders him to capture Sam alive and kill Optimus, the only Transformer who can defeat the Fallen. Sam, Mikaela and his college roommate, Leo are attacked by Alice, a Decepticon Pretender posing as a college student. After killing her, they are captured by the Decepticon Grindor and taken to an abandoned factory. Megatron reveals that the symbols in Sam's mind will lead the Decepticons to a new Energon source before the Autobots arrive to rescue the trio. Optimus rescues Sam and engages Megatron, who is accompanied by Starscream, and Grindor. Initially overpowered, Optimus manages to injure Starscream by cutting off his arm before killing Grindor. Megatron then ambushes Optimus and blasts his spark, destroying it and leaving him fatally wounded; Optimus dies shortly after telling Sam to run without him. The other Autobots arrive and repel the Decepticons, forcing Megatron and Starscream to retreat. The Decepticons launch devastating simultaneous attacks around the world, destroying ships in the Second Fleet and damaging Paris. The Fallen hijacks Earth's <b>telecommunications</b> <b>systems,</b> demanding that Sam be handed to him.|$|E

40|$|A cross impact {{model of}} the U. S. <b>telecommunications</b> <b>system</b> was developed. For this model, it was {{necessary}} to prepare forecasts of the major segments of the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>system,</b> such as satellites, telephone, TV, CATV, radio broadcasting, etc. In addition, forecasts were prepared of the traffic generated by a variety of new or expanded services, such as electronic check clearing and point of sale electronic funds transfer. Finally, the interactions among the forecasts were estimated (the cross impacts). Both the forecasts and the cross impacts were used as inputs to the cross impact model, which could then be used to stimulate the future growth of the entire U. S. <b>telecommunications</b> <b>system.</b> By varying the inputs, technology changes or policy decisions with regard to any segment of the system could be evaluated {{in the context of the}} remainder of the system.

When interviewed about E-Tech's founding, Robinson said [...] "I like to pioneer new fields, to start small businesses." [...] E-Tech acquired Scientific Atlanta's Special Products Division, which included staff, research contracts, patented products in solar energy, and specialized equipment. Its first product was an {{electric heat pump}} water heater, the Efficiency II, that reduced water heating bills by 50% and provided an equipment payback of three years. E-Tech worked {{on a range of}} United States Department of Energy contracts in the field of solar energy. In 1986, E-Tech merged with Crispaire Corporation, which specialized in cooling equipment for <b>telecommunications</b> <b>systems,</b> school classrooms, and commercial/industrial structures. The merger resulted in Robinson taking over the new entity, which also operated under the trade name Marvair. Crispaire Corporation/Marvair later joined with RV Products to form a new company, Airxcel, Inc. Robinson retired from this venture in 1997.|$|E
