All is not lost, though, for Shrift and Penance convince Mankind to repent and he {{is placed in the}} Castle of Perseverance where he will be protected from sin by the Seven Moral Virtues.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} how the corporeality (physicality and materiality) {{of language}} makes it untenable {{to view the}} body and language as entirely distinct categories, particularly in drama. When language is made to act instead of mean, {{the distinction between the}} body and language is removed. Schizophrenia is a good example to illustrate what is meant by the effacement of the boundary between the body and language, because it is the inability to coordinate between materiality and signification. Materialization of the fragmented body and subject through the physicality of language is where the distinction between the body and language gets lost. I <b>think</b> it is <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that theatre attempts to free itself from the constraints of representation. Instead of dealing with metaphors, symbols and analogies, a text is put into action through the materiality and physicality of language. The poststructuralist deconstruction of the unified subject and subjectivity, especially in relation to the constructive and performative aspects of language casts light on an important dimension of the move away from the classical representational paradigm and why theatre seeks to be nonrepresentational to find its own voice. Beckett is one of the writers who questioned and blurred the boundary between the body and language. In this thesis, I discuss the possibilities Beckett created in terms of freeing theater from the constraints of representation and meaning through the plays Not I, Act Without Words II, What Where, and Play...|$|R

Not twenty minutes had elapsed since our meeting with Mrs. Server on the terrace had determined Grace Brissenden's elation, but it was a fact that my nervousness had taken an extraordinary stride. I had perhaps not till this instant been fully aware of it--it was really brought out by the way Obert {{looked at me as if}} he fancied he had heard me shake. Mrs. Server might be natural, and Gilbert Long might be, but I should not preserve that calm unless I pulled myself well together. I made the effort, facing my sharp interlocutor; and I <b>think</b> it was <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that I fully measured my dismay. I had grown--that was what was the matter with me--precipitately, preposterously anxious. Instead of dropping, the discomfort produced in me by Mrs. Brissenden had deepened to agitation, and this in spite of the fact that in the brief interval nothing worse, nothing but what was right, had happened. Had I myself suddenly fallen so much in love with Mrs. Server that the care for her reputation had become with me an obsession? It was of no use saying I simply pitied her: what did I pity her for if she wasn't in danger? She was in danger: that rushed over me at present--rushed over me while I tried to look easy and delayed to answer my friend. She was in danger--if only because she had caught and held the search-light of Obert's attention. I took up his inquiry. [...] "The matter with them?

40|$|This is {{the first}} time in the history of the Senate that we have created a Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. I <b>think</b> it’s crucial <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in time. Repressive regimes that violate human rights create fertile {{breeding}} for terrorism, war, poverty, and exploitation. Our Nation and our world will never be fully secure as long as fundamental human rights are not honored. Our first hearing was just last month. We addressed the issue of genocide and the rule of law, focusing on the mass killings and genocide in Darfur. I’m proud to say that, as a result of that hearing, we’ve introduced bipartisan legislation to promote divestment in Sudan and to expand the reach of U. S. law so that we can prosecute non-U. S. nationals who are in this country for crimes of genocide they committed abroad. We will continue to try to make this a Subcommittee that focuses on legislation, not just lamentations. Today we’re going to take up a topic which may be as old as mankind. From the beginning of time there has been evidence of exploitation and slavery. We haven’t been spared in our generation. At today’s hearing, we will consider the issue of human trafficking. Few issues in the world today raise as many human rights implications as this insidious practice. It’s estimated that one million people are trafficked across international borders each year, pressed into labor, servitude, or commercial sex by the use of force, fraud, and coercion. Human trafficking represents commerce in human misery. As an introduction to today’s hearing, I would like to show a very brief video on human trafficking. It begins with a short public service announcement put together by the United Nations to help raise awareness of the issue. The second part of the video is an interview with a trafficking victim from Cambodia. The purpose of these videos is to put a human face on the issue that we will talk about today...|$|R
