5|$|The Lingbao School {{began in}} around 400 CE when the Lingbao scriptures were {{revealed}} <b>to</b> <b>Ge</b> Chaofu, the grandnephew of Ge Hong. Ge Chaofu {{claimed that the}} scriptures came {{to him in a}} line of transmission going back <b>to</b> <b>Ge</b> Hong's great-uncle, Ge Xuan (164-244). Ge Chaofu transmitted the scriptures to two of his disciples, and the scriptures quickly gained immense popularity. In 471, Lu Xiujing (406-477) compiled a catalogue of all the Lingbao texts, and also was responsible for reorganizing and standardizing Lingbao ritual. This organization of texts and ritual provided a solid foundation on which the Lingbao School prospered in the subsequent centuries. During the Tang Dynasty, the influence of the Lingbao School declined and another school of Daoism, the Shangqing School, became prominent. Borrowing many Lingbao practices, it was well accepted by the aristocracy and established an influence in court.|$|E

He graduated from the academy in 1857 with a gold medal for his painting The Witch of Endor Calling Up the Spirit of the Prophet Samuel. According <b>to</b> <b>Ge</b> himself, during that period he was strongly influenced by Karl Briullov.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 1977, Amtrak {{announced}} plans to spend $24.4 million to overhaul all 61 cars {{as part of a}} larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase I paint scheme with red, white and blue ends and a small Amtrak logo. On September 28, the Amtrak board approved a more limited overhaul program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 electric locomotives. On November 7, Amtrak released a specification for overhauling the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million overhaul contract <b>to</b> <b>GE</b> that month.|$|E

5|$|TFM traded 22 of the E60C-2s <b>to</b> <b>GE</b> for GE AC4400CW diesel locomotives. Three {{were sold}} to Texas Utilities to serve the company's Martin Lake line, {{displacing}} GE E25Bs. The E25Bs, smaller versions of the E60, had been in use since 1976. Another six went to the Black Mesa and Lake Powell, replacing its aging E60Cs. Five went to the Deseret Power Railroad. Texas Utilities discontinued electric operation in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work <b>to</b> <b>GE</b> when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
5|$|The E60s were {{successful}} in the coal-hauling role. They ran on the BM for decades and remain in use on several mining railroads in the Western United States. The passenger variants failed in their intended role. Problems with the truck design caused derailments above , rendering the locomotives unusable for high-speed service. By {{the end of the}} 1970s Amtrak abandoned the E60 in favor of EMD AEM-7 locomotives manufactured by Electro-Motive Division. In Mexico, the NdeM's project was delayed into the 1990s, then scrapped after three years of use. Most of the NdeM's electric locomotives never ran and were traded back <b>to</b> <b>GE</b> for diesels. Some were sold to various mining railroads.|$|E

5|$|Lingbao scriptures arose as {{a direct}} result of the success of earlier Shangqing texts. Lingbao scriptures are all based on a text known as the Text of the Five Talismans (Wufujing), which was {{compiled}} by Ge Chaofu between 397 and 402 and borrowed from the work of Ge Hong, his great uncle. Being the most ancient Lingbao text, the Five Talismans provided the framework of the remainder of the Lingbao canon, which was based on the five directions. Because all Lingbao texts descended from the Five Talismans, it was believed that they had been revealed <b>to</b> <b>Ge</b> Xuan, presumably the original owner of the Five Talismans. Ge Xuan is purported to have transmitted the Lingbao texts first to his disciple Zheng Siyuan, who then transmitted it to Ge's grandnephew Ge Hong (284-364), who is well known for his alchemical innovations. The claim that the Lingbao texts derive from Ge Xuan, however, was likely a way of legitimizing them through the exaggeration of their antiquity. In reality, they were likely assembled by Ge Chaofu himself. Within a few years of the texts' dissemination, they had become extremely popular.|$|E

5000|$|Ge {{states that}} the Baopuzi, taken as a whole, {{constitutes}} his attempt to establish a single school (yi jia) of thought. The division of the Baopuzi into [...] "Inner" [...] and [...] "Outer Chapters" [...] speaks <b>to</b> <b>Ge’s</b> interest in both esoteric studies and social philosophy. According <b>to</b> <b>Ge’s</b> own account, he wrote the [...] "Inner Chapters" [...] to argue for the reality and attainability of divine transcendence, while the [...] "Outer Chapters" [...] blends Confucian and Legalist rhetoric to propose solutions for {{the social and political}} problems of his era. For a long time, the two parts of the text circulated independently, and were almost always categorized under different headings in officially sanctioned bibliographies.|$|R

50|$|In the meantime, the King feels {{threatened}} {{when he sees}} Ge Li's growing popularity, so he plots <b>to</b> have <b>Ge</b> {{stripped off}} his post and executed on false charges. At the same time, the Liang forces receive news that the Zhao army has retreated. <b>Ge</b> Li plans <b>to</b> leave Liang since his mission is complete. He goes out to check that the Zhao army is indeed retreating. When he returns, he is stopped outside the gates and is accused of starting a war under false pretences and plotting to seize the throne. Just as the Liang soldiers are about <b>to</b> kill <b>Ge</b> Li, Liang Shi shows up, pretends <b>to</b> fight with <b>Ge,</b> and secretly tells <b>Ge</b> <b>to</b> take him hostage in order to buy time for <b>Ge</b> <b>to</b> escape. <b>Ge</b> Li manages <b>to</b> escape but Liang Shi is killed by a rain of arrows meant for Ge Li. Meanwhile, Ge Li's supporters, including Yiyue, are falsely accused of plotting a rebellion against the King and are arrested and tortured. Yiyue denounces the King and is sentenced to death. The King also has her rendered mute to prevent her from speaking up against him. Zituan refuses <b>to</b> turn against <b>Ge</b> Li, so he cuts off his right arm and leaves the Liang army.|$|R
40|$|Modularity {{has proven}} to be an {{important}} aspect of evolutionary computation. This work is concerned with discovering and using modules in one form of grammar-based genetic programming, grammatical evolution (GE). Previous work has shown that simply adding modules <b>to</b> <b>GE’s</b> grammar has the potential to disrupt fit individuals developed by evolution up to that point. This paper presents a solution to prevent the disturbance in fitness that can come with modifying GE’s grammar with previously discovered modules. The results show an increase in performance from a previously examined grammar modification approach and also an increase in performance when compared <b>to</b> standard <b>GE...</b>|$|R

25|$|A second {{effect is}} G × E correlation, in which certain alleles tend to {{accompany}} certain environments. If a gene causes {{a parent to}} enjoy reading, then children inheriting this allele {{are likely to be}} raised in households with books due <b>to</b> <b>GE</b> correlation: one or both of their parents has the allele and therefore will accumulate a book collection and pass on the book-reading allele. Such effects can be tested by measuring the purported environmental correlate (in this case books in the home) directly.|$|E
