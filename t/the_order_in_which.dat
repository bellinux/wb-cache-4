50|$|For example, in {{a service}} that uses locking to protect {{concurrently}} updated data, the messaging system can be instructed to use an inexpensive form of message <b>ordering,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> messaging system respects <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> individual senders send messages (FIFO guarantee) but does not attempt to impose an agreed order if messages are sent concurrently by different senders. Provided that the sender indeed held locks on the data, it can be shown that FIFO ordering suffices for correctness. The benefit is that FIFO ordering is much less costly to implement than total ordering for concurrent messages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} the state explosion problem in automata based LTL model checking. To deal with large space requirements {{we turn to}} use a distributed approach. All the known methods for automata basedmodel checking are basedon depth first traversal of the state space which is difficult to parallelise as <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> vertices are visitedplays an important role. We come up with entirely different approach which is dependent on locating cycles with negative length in a directed graph with real number length of edges. Our method allows reasonable distribution and the experimental results confirm its usefulness for distributed model checking. ...|$|R

40|$|Word-Level Decision Diagrams (WLDDs), like *BMDs and K*BMDs, have {{recently}} been introduced as a data structure for veri#cation. The size of WLDDs largely depends on <b>the</b> chosen variable <b>ordering,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> variables are encountered, and on the decompositions carried out in each node. In this paper we present a framework for dynamic minimization of WLDDs. We discuss the difficulties with previous techniques if applied to WLDDs and present a new approach that e#ciently adapts both variable ordering and decomposition type choice. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms "classical" reordering with respect to runtime and representation size during dynamic minimization of word-level functions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss how}} {{spreading}} processes on temporal networks are {{impacted by the}} shape of their inter-event time distributions. Through simple mathematical arguments and toy examples, {{we find that the}} key factor is <b>the</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> events take place, a property that tends to be affected by the bulk of the distributions and not only by their tail, as usually considered in the literature. We show that a detailed modeling of the temporal patterns observed in complex networks can change dramatically the properties of a spreading process, such as the ergodicity of a random walk process or the persistence of an epidemic. 1...|$|R
