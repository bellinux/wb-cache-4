500|$|When Behan {{said he had}} {{disarmed}} them, Virgil {{attempted to}} avoid a fight. [...] "I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and {{when he said he}} had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand." [...] Wyatt said I [...] "took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket." [...] The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot.|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{made his}} sophomore debut on November 7, 2010, in an {{exhibition}} game against East Stroudsburg. He added 10 points, 6 assists, and two steals. Frazier also recorded a team-high 4 turnovers. DeChellis commented, [...] "Offensively we were poor tonight and we had too many turnovers... something we've struggled with in practice." [...] On November 12, 2010, Frazier made his second appearance as a sophomore with 6 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1 steal. He shot 1-of-5 on field goals, while going a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. Frazier was named the game's starting shooting guard and was allowed 30 minutes of playing time. He made his first-ever appearance as Penn State's starting point guard on November 19 vs. Fairfield, and contributed 3 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1 steal. The team's coach commented on Frazier's powerful defensive performance, [...] "thought Tim Frazier did a very nice job defensively on the point guard for Fairfield who {{is a really good}} player. He bothered him all night." [...] Frazier made his first impression above the 10-points barrier on January 15, 2011 vs. Ohio State, with 11 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists. He shot 4-of-4 from the field and made three of four free throws. On March 12, 2011, Frazier scored 22 points against Michigan State, his season-high as a sophomore, helping the team pull off the upset victory in the semifinals of the 2011 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. He played in his first NCAA Tournament game against Temple, contributing 15 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals. He made a late miscue guarding Juan Fernández, allowing the opposing guard to close out the game with under one second remaining in regulation. Frazier recalled the moment, [...] "I closed out high end so he wouldn't be able to shoot over me. (He) made a great move, pivoted {{a couple of times and}} then stepped through." [...] Fernández said, [...] "I was thinking about shooting a jump shot but I killed my dribble and (Tim) Frazier was right there. For some reason he jumped over <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> and that gave me the space to go left." [...] By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 6.3 points, 5.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 0.1 blocks per game. He was named to the Academic All-Big Ten following 2010–11.|$|E
2500|$|Pilot Robert White {{commented on}} his high {{altitude}} X-15 flights, [...] "My flights to 217,000 feet [...] and 314,750 feet [...] were very dramatic in revealing the Earth's curvature... at my highest altitude I could turn my head through a 180-degree arc and wow!— the Earth is really round. At my peak altitude I was roughly over the Arizona/California {{border in the}} area of Las Vegas, and this was how I described it: Looking to my left I felt I could spit into the Gulf of California; looking <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> I felt I could toss a dime into San Francisco Bay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{this may}} be just as your Ladyship says," [...] he rejoined; [...] "but the {{interest}} of my kingdom, and a large family at home, make it necessary that I should look sharp <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rights.</b> Was there a flag in the vessel?" ...|$|R

60|$|I {{could not}} reach them in the swamp on horseback, {{and was in the}} act of {{dismounting}} when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the rear, still farther <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right,</b> beyond the swamp. I shouted, and one of the skirmishers came up. I asked him what the matter was.|$|E
60|$|I heard a {{creaking}} of hinges, and saw {{an opening}} in the wall <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right,</b> where I had perceived no door. Two men came forth--brawny, muscular, bearded men in coarse, black hose and leathern waistcoats cut deep at the neck and leaving their great arms entirely naked. The foremost carried a thong of leather in his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{consent to}} your proposition, Maule!" [...] cried he. [...] "Put me in {{possession}} of the document essential <b>to</b> establish <b>my</b> <b>rights,</b> and the House of the Seven Gables is your own!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right, Jethro," [...] Amuba {{said after}} a long silence; [...] "it is <b>my</b> duty <b>to</b> assert <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> and <b>to</b> restore the land <b>to</b> freedom. <b>My</b> mind is made up now. What is your advice in the matter?" ...|$|R

60|$|After this things grew very awful. Some fled, but {{the most}} stood and died where they were. Oddly enough during all this time I was never touched. Men fell <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> and left {{and in front of}} me; bullets and assegais whizzed past me, yet I {{remained}} quite unhurt. It was as though some Power protected me, which no doubt it did.|$|E
60|$|A slight noise {{attracted}} my notice, and, {{looking to}} the floor, I saw several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well, which lay just within view <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right.</b> Even then, while I gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by {{the scent of the}} meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.|$|E
60|$|A {{hundred yards}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> was the gate {{from which the}} troops were evidently {{expected}} to issue, but to reach it I must pass the flank of the green warriors within easy sight of them, and, fearing that my plan to warn the Kaolians might thus be thwarted, I decided upon hastening toward the left, where another gate a mile away would give me ingress to the city.|$|E
6000|$|... 'From this moment,' said Cadurcis, 'if {{you will}} admit me to your band. But what can I do? And I {{have nothing to}} give you. You must teach me <b>to</b> earn <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> our supper.' ...|$|R

60|$|The cry arose again, {{and there}} was a terrible and {{confusing}} rush of the women into the midst of the struggle. In another moment, something came tumbling down upon me that I thought was the wall. It was a heap of Sambos who had come over the wall; and of four men who clung to my legs like serpents, one who clung <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> leg was Christian George King.|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard {{a slight}} {{rustling}} {{in the deep}} grass <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right.</b> I turned and saw Kearny coming toward me. He was ragged and dew-drenched and limping. His hat and one boot were gone. About one foot he had tied some makeshift of cloth and grass. But his manner as he approached {{was that of a}} man who knows his own virtues well enough to be superior to rebuffs.|$|E
6000|$|... "They were {{certainly}} more severe," [...] Francis said smiling, [...] "for {{my right hand}} was chained to my left ankle, and the left hand to <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> ankle--not tightly, you know, but the chain was so short that I could not stand upright. But, on the other hand, I do not think my guards were as vigilant as yours. However, I {{will tell you the}} whole story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am sure I am {{not like}} myself when I am away,' said I. 'I seem <b>to</b> want <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, when I miss you. Though that's not saying much; for there's no head in <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, and no heart. Everyone who knows you, consults with you, and {{is guided by}} you, Agnes.' ...|$|R

60|$|I {{watched him}} swing the hound down a wall, {{and pull the}} slip noose free. Don slid {{to the edge of}} a slope, trotted to the right and left of crags, {{threaded}} the narrow places, and turned in the direction of the baying hounds. He passed on the verge of precipices that made me tremble for him; but sure-footed as a goat, he went on safely down, to disappear far <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
60|$|Next morning, thank Heaven, {{admitted}} me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> mind again. I {{got out of}} bed {{and peered}} through the window. It was Christmas Day. A thin scatter of snow was powdering down out of the grey sky. The fields were calm and frozen. I felt, as I might say, the hunger in my face, looking out. There was something astonishingly new in my life. Everything familiar had become a little strange.|$|E
60|$|It was an {{extraordinarily}} high pheasant, flushed, I think, outside the covert by a stop, so high that, as it travelled down the line, although three guns fired at it, including Van Koop, {{none of them}} seemed to touch it. Then I fired, and remembering Lord Ragnall's advice, far in front. Its flight changed. Still it travelled through the air, but with the momentum of a stone to fall fifty yards <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>right,</b> dead.|$|E
5000|$|Later that day, FIDE {{announced}} that Game 6 would {{be played on}} October 2, with the forfeit standing and the score Kramnik 3 - Topalov 2.
