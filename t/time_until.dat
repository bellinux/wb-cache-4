5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a <b>time,</b> <b>until</b> she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
5|$|After {{having been}} {{temporarily}} incapacitated by several severe health problems, President Dwight D. Eisenhower attempted to clarify procedures through a signed agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon, drafted by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr.. However, this agreement {{did not have}} legal authority. Eisenhower {{suffered a heart attack}} in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each <b>time</b> <b>until</b> Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public that the situation was under control. However, Nixon never made any effort to formally assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition. The player has {{a limited amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over <b>time</b> <b>until</b> the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E

5|$|Before the game, Cirque du Soleil, Romero Britto and Little Louie Vega {{performed}} as the pre-game act, and Billy Joel sang the National Anthem, accompanying himself on piano. He also performed at Super Bowl XXIII, which was {{played at the}} same venue. Joel became the second person to sing the National Anthem twice for a Super Bowl; Aaron Neville sang the national anthem before Super Bowl XXIV, in New Orleans, and Super Bowl XL (along with Aretha Franklin), in Detroit. This was also the last <b>time</b> <b>until</b> Luke Bryan sang at Super Bowl LI that a male artist had sung the national anthem at a Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Citizens were {{organized}} {{on the basis}} of centuries and tribes, which would each gather into their own assemblies. The Comitia Centuriata ("Centuriate Assembly") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a <b>time,</b> <b>until</b> a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had geimperium powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census. It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.|$|E

5|$|Courteney Cox portrays Monica Geller, {{the mother}} hen {{of the group}} and a chef, known for her perfectionist, bossy, competitive, and {{obsessive-compulsive}} nature. Monica is often jokingly teased by the others for having been extremely overweight as a child, especially by her brother Ross. Monica works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. Monica’s first serious relationship is with long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is twenty-one years her senior. The couple maintains a strong relationship for some <b>time,</b> <b>until</b> Richard expresses that {{he does not want to}} have children, much to Monica’s dismay. Monica and Chandler Bing later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and adoption of twins at the end of the series.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1946 season, Rocco was {{competing}} with Les Fleming and Eddie Robinson for the starting first baseman job. Fleming won {{the job and}} held it, though Rocco saw occasional playing <b>time</b> <b>until</b> June 26, when he was traded with cash to the Chicago Cubs for first baseman Heinz Becker in one of new owner Bill Veeck's first moves. However, Rocco refused to report the Nashville Volunteers, the Cubs' minor league organization, and considered quitting the game, which put the trade on hold. He eventually did report to Nashville, and finished the year having played 34 games in the majors and 37 games in the minors. After the season the Boston Red Sox signed him to a contract as a potential backup first baseman, {{but he did not}} make the cut, and was sent to the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League just before the 1947 season started.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were {{thought of as the}} air equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw them for the first <b>time.</b> <b>Until</b> then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} Roman {{citizens}} were also regularly recruited to the auxilia. Most likely, {{the majority of}} citizen recruits to auxiliary regiments were the sons of auxiliary veterans who were enfranchised on their fathers' discharge. Many such may have preferred to join their fathers' old regiments, which were a kind of extended family to them, rather than join a much larger, unfamiliar legion. There are also instances of legionaries transferring to the auxilia (to a higher rank). The incidence of citizens in the auxilia would thus have grown steadily over <b>time</b> <b>until,</b> after the grant of citizenship to all peregrini in 212, auxiliary regiments became predominantly, if not exclusively, citizen units.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Polish leader, Colonel Józef Beck, {{believed}} that Warsaw should act rapidly to forestall the German {{occupation of the}} city. At noon on 30 September, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czechoslovak troops and police and gave Prague <b>time</b> <b>until</b> noon the following day. At 11:45a.m. on 1 October the Czechoslovak foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague {{and told him that}} Poland could have what it wanted. The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed an area of 801.5km² with a population of 227,399 people. Administratively the annexed area was divided between two counties: Frysztat and Cieszyn County. At the same time Slovakia lost to Hungary 10,390km² with 854,277 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 1950 {{the brigade}} was first {{designated}} as the 20th Engineer Brigade and activated at Camp Leonard Wood, Missouri. It deployed overseas to France in November 1952 and established headquarters in Croix Chapeau. Comprising two battalions and six separate companies, the brigade provided engineer construction support to the Base Section of the European COMMZ in southwestern France. In August 1954, it redeployed back to the United States and was activated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 10 September 1954. From that <b>time</b> <b>until</b> its inactivation on 12 December 1958, the brigade provided engineer support to the XVIII Airborne Corps.|$|E
