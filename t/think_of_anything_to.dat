500|$|His {{attempt at}} children's comedies met {{additional}} criticism. Surf Ninjas (1993) and Mr. Magoo (1997) had scathing reviews. Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen's role in Surf Ninjas was only [...] "an extended cameo" [...] and Chris Hicks recommended that viewers [...] "avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen {{outside of the}} Naked Gun series." [...] Jeff Miller of the Houston Chronicle panned Mr. Magoo, a live action remake of the 1950s cartoon, by saying, [...] "I'm supposed to suggest how the film might be better but I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say other than to make the film again." ...|$|E
2500|$|One anecdote {{that should}} be {{interesting}} to longtime fans {{is the story of}} Van Halen’s [...] custom Marshall amp, rumored to have been rebuilt from scratch. As he explains it, after the band suffered through a disastrous radio interview where Eddie couldn’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say, David Lee Roth advised him, “Here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna lie. You’re gonna make up some s— so they don’t remember it.” So when he was asked about the amp during a later Guitar Player interview, he followed Roth’s advice.|$|E
2500|$|... "Fashion" [...] {{started as}} a song called [...] "Jamaica" [...] but Bowie was unable to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> write, so he almost {{discarded}} the song {{until late in the}} recording cycle, when it was transformed into the song as it appeared on the album. The track [...] "I Feel Free" [...] (by Cream) was recorded [...] "in rough mix" [...] for the album, but did not appear on a Bowie album until a re-recording for 1993's Black Tie White Noise. A few of the other tracks on the album started with different names: [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] began as [...] "People Are Turning to Gold" [...] and [...] "Teenage Wildlife" [...] was originally called [...] "It Happens Everyday". The track [...] "Scream Like a Baby" [...] was originally called [...] "Laser" [...] (the lyric [...] "Scream like a baby" [...] was sung as [...] "I am a laser"). [...] "Laser" [...] was originally written in 1973, and recorded by Ava Cherry and the Astronettes (made up of Bowie collaborators Ava Cherry and Geoff MacCormack), and a demo by Bowie was made during the sessions for [...] "Young Americans" [...] in 1975. The song [...] "Is There Life After Marriage?" [...] was fully written and recorded for the album, but for unknown reasons was never released.|$|E
6000|$|Turnbull, whose {{powers of}} {{surprise}} were exhausted, rolled his round grey eyes and said, [...] "Mr. Wilkinson, I think," [...] {{because he could}} not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> say.|$|R
60|$|I {{breathed a}} {{sympathetic}} snort. I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> noticeably suitable <b>to</b> say.|$|R
60|$|DAVID. You can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> clever for <b>to</b> go for to say now, John.|$|R
60|$|They were alone, and Jacob {{found it}} {{exceedingly}} difficult to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|E
60|$|Billy couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say. He {{turned to}} look {{up and down the}} canyon in search of the enemy.|$|E
6000|$|But we couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say. Directly, however, I thought I must do something, so I {{whispered to}} the Indian: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> do {{but come}} {{straight}} here to you," [...] said Honora, gazing at her friend. [...] "And oh, I'm {{so glad to}} find you. There's not another train to Quicksands till after nine." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} pause; but Clara again {{knew that the}} {{conversation}} was not over; and she knew also {{that it would be}} vain for her to endeavour to begin another subject. Nor could she <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> say, so much was she agitated.|$|R
60|$|All the {{servants}} appeared but poor Whittington, who, having neither money nor goods, could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> sending <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> try his luck; but {{his good friend}} Miss Alice, thinking his poverty kept him away, ordered him to be called.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a frightful {{character}} from all accounts." [...] Mike could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> {{say that was}} not rude, so said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] Sheldon said. [...] "I know my {{position}} is sound, {{and that is}} satisfactory enough." ...|$|E
60|$|She had me {{with the}} first shot. I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say. I couldn't tell her that Rocky was down in the country, {{watching}} worms.|$|E
60|$|But {{the men who}} {{had fled}} were too glad to have made their escape <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> but <b>to</b> make for their dens as quick as possible, and the party passed through the lanes into the open space in front of Parliament House without interruption.|$|R
6000|$|Again {{following}} a silence; {{no one could}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> consoling <b>to</b> suggest; all were unwilling to heap censure upon one who deserved it but too richly. Only Lionel was heard to give a sort of groan, find after a time Clara asked, [...] "Is it a Frenchwoman?" ...|$|R
60|$|He has {{no power}} of repartee, has the stage villain. All {{the good people}} in the play say rude and {{insulting}} things to him, and smack at him, and score off him all through the act, but he can never answer them back--can never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> clever <b>to</b> say in return.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say except:--"More fool you for proposing in a dust-storm." [...] But I {{did not see}} how that would improve the mistake.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{he did not}} {{understand}} you," [...] said Marian, unable to keep from saying something, though she could not in her agitation <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> the purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak {{quickly if}} you can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say. They are silent now because of their astonishment, but in another minute they will break out, and then----" ...|$|E
60|$|Ginger Dick {{coughed and}} began to think as 'ow old Sam was sharper than he 'ad given 'im credit for, but afore he could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> say Mrs. Finch looked at old Sam {{and began to}} talk about 'is ship, and to say 'ow much she should like to see over it.|$|R
5000|$|Amram is {{mentioned}} in the popular children's song [...] "Peanut Butter Sandwich" [...] by Raffi, in the line [...] "one for me and one for David Amram", a fact which Amram said [...] "impressed" [...] his children; Raffi later {{admitted that he had}} mentioned Amram because he [...] "couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> rhyme with 'jam'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, {{uncle and}} aunt only have great old stupid books! They {{wanted me to}} read those horrid {{tiresome}} things of Scott's, and Dickens's too, who {{is as old as}} the hills! Why, they could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> better <b>to</b> do on their wedding tour but to go to all the places in the Waverley novels.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Sampson flushed at his {{concluding}} words. Then silence ensued. I {{could not}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say and Sally was dumb. [...] "You all seem very strange," [...] said Miss Sampson.|$|E
60|$|He nodded, {{and took}} his pipe from his mouth, but, being unable to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say, he put it back again, {{although}} {{he would have been}} glad if she had stayed.|$|E
60|$|I winced {{a little}} {{at the idea of}} {{attending}} to the customers, but I was too bewildered by the fusillade that was still ringing in my ears to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} of the film, New York Times critic Stephen Holden wrote, [...] "The film’s clips of Miranda from the Hollywood years are like jolts of electricity, for she exudes an {{incandescent}} vitality along with a percussive vocal bravura. It is sad that Hollywood, after crowning her with bananas, couldn’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> do with her except to turn that image into a joke." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose there}} are lots of dogs who would have known exactly the right thing to do, but I could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> except <b>to</b> put my nose against his cheek and whine. He put his arm round my neck, {{and for a long time}} we stayed like that, saying nothing. It seemed to comfort him, for after a time he stopped crying.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I can't do that. I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else. It's <b>to</b> {{bridge over}} the day that's left before Seeing Ghosts. If it does freeze, you'll come to Mrs. Westangle's {{afternoon}} tea on the pond?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} are {{beginning}} to see it in that light, my dear, and if you can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do by morning I shall be humbly thankful. I don't expect to." ...|$|E
60|$|This was true. If the {{professor}} had appeared then and there, I should {{have found it}} difficult to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say to him which would have accounted to any extent for my anxiety to see him.|$|E
6000|$|... "When we ’eard {{that the}} tiger ’ad been seen within three miles of Claybury {{things began to}} look serious, and Peter Gubbins said that {{something}} ought to be done, but before we could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do something ’appened.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, who DOES {{tell you}} she has?' growled Mr Codlin, again {{glancing at the}} clock and from it to the cauldron, 'can't you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> more {{suitable}} <b>to</b> present circumstances than saying things and then contradicting 'em?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fancy now!" [...] said Mary {{who always}} said that when she couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{anything}}</b> else <b>to</b> say. She didn't know what Walter meant but she felt uncomfortable. Walter Blythe was always saying odd things. That old Piper of his--she hadn't heard anything about him since their playdays in Rainbow Valley--and now here he was bobbing up again. She didn't like it, {{and that was the}} long and short of it.|$|R
60|$|Ginger {{laid the}} letter down, {{and a little}} sound escaped him that was half a sigh, half an oath. He was {{wondering}} whether even now some desirable end might not be achieved by going to Chicago and breaking Gerald Foster's neck. Abandoning this scheme as impracticable, {{and not being able}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> do he re-lit his pipe and started to read the letter again.|$|R
