40|$|Abstract [...] Transformer {{short-circuit}} {{behavior is}} typically represented in electromagnetic transient simulation programs by the inverse of the leakage inductance matrix, {{also known as}} the A-matrix or [A]. The terms of [A] represent the magnetic coupling (flux linkages) between windings, i. e. between coils on the same core leg. In addition to the representation of coupling between windings of the same phase, intra-phase coupling effects can also be included. This paper investigates the sensitivities of results of EMTP-type simulation to intra-phase entries of [A]. A method for obtaining [A] that includes intra-phase coupling is developed and verified by comparing simulation results with laboratory measurements. The percent error between measured and simulated short-circuit currents that result from implementing a full and simplified [A] was quantified. A correlation {{of the size of the}} elements representing intra-phase coupling in [A] with <b>transformer</b> <b>MVA</b> size is investigated and valuable conclusions and recommendations are made...|$|R

40|$|AbstractModified {{vaccinia virus}} Ankara (MVA) was {{generated}} by serial passaging in chicken embryo fibroblasts. During this attenuation, <b>MVA</b> lost the <b>capacity</b> to productively grow in human {{and most other}} mammalian cell lines, as well as acquiring a multitude of deletions and mutations in the MVA genome. This means that the precise molecular basis for the MVA host-range restriction is still unknown. The vaccinia virus (VACV) genes F 11 L and K 1 L are mutated or truncated in MVA. F 11 L was previously implicated in VACV-induced cell motility and virion maturation. Here, we demonstrate that the restoration of F 11 L gene expression in MVA rescued virus-induced cell motility, but had no impact on MVA virion maturation and host-range restriction. Additional insertion of the K 1 L gene, which restores MVA replication in RK- 13 cells, was not sufficient to extend <b>MVA</b> growth <b>capacity</b> to other mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new {{three-phase}} four-wire distribution {{static compensator}} (DSTATCOM) {{based on a}} Phase-Shifting transformer (PST) and a three-leg voltage source converter (VSC) is proposed for power quality improvement. The Zigzag Phase-Shifting transformer mitigates the circulating power flows in interconnected utilities and the three-leg VSC compensates harmonic current, reactive power and balances the load. The principle of PST is to take harmonics generated from separate sources, shift one source of harmonics 180 º {{with respect to the}} other and then combine them together; this will result in cancellation. This type of transformer has patented built-in electromagnetic technology designed to remove high neutral current and the most harmful harmonics from the 3 rd through 21 st. The interesting aspect of such phase shifters is that despite their low <b>MVA</b> <b>capacity,</b> by controlling the phase shift, they exercise a significant real-power control. The insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) based VSC is supported by a capacitor and is controlled for the required compensation of the load current. The dc bus voltage of the VSC is regulated during varying load conditions. The performance of the three-phase four-wire DSTATCOM is validated using MATLAB software with its Simulink and power system blockset toolboxes...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} is clear enough [...] the ambiguities {{arise in the}} attachment. No I think {{you are trying to}} handle the case where the transmission system voltage becomes depressed to 0. 85 pu. This does not cause the voltage at the armature terminals of the generator to change, except in a transient time frame (or if the AVR is in manual or drooped). During the transient time frame, the armature terminal voltage would be depressed to 1 -(0. 15 * (Xd'/(Xd'+Xt)) pu volts (Xt=transformer reactance (pu), Xd'=transient machine reactance, pu), but this will reduce, not increase, the reactive power output, so the worst case for voltage support is in the steady-state time frame after the AVR corrects the voltage. After the AVR corrects the voltage, the armature terminals will return to approximately 1 pu voltage (or whatever it was set at before the disturbance) and the VAR outflow will be the <b>transformer</b> <b>MVA</b> times 0. 15 /%IZ (0. 15 = 1 - 0. 85 = amount voltage is depressed, %IZ transformer rated impedance). (This is just Ohm's law applied to the voltage difference across the output transformer between 1 pu armature voltage and 0. 85 pu system voltage.) There is no reason to require simulations to find this value; it can be easily calculated. (The 150 % assumption is another way of saying, "assume the output transformer impedance is 10 % on a base of the generator maximum real power " [...] and it often isn't.)
