5|$|In addition, the {{standard}} route shield of state highways in California {{is in the}} shape of a miner's spade to honor the California Gold Rush. Today, aptly named State Route 49 travels through the Sierra Nevada foothills, connecting many Gold Rush-era towns such as Placerville, Auburn, Grass Valley, Nevada City, Coloma, Jackson, and Sonora. This state highway also passes very near Columbia State Historic Park, a protected area encompassing the historic business district of the town of Columbia; the park has preserved many Gold Rush-era buildings, which are presently occupied by <b>tourist-oriented</b> businesses.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop running through St. Ignace. The loop starts at exit344 on I-75 as the continuation of US Highway2 (US2) into downtown. The highway carries the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT). It runs along a four-lane roadway {{on the north side}} of Straits State Park and curves northward into downtown St. Ignace along State Street. BL I-75 and three lanes and runs along the lakefront past the marina and docks for Mackinac Island ferry services. It widens back to four lanes to follow the curve of East Moran Bay and then turns inland past several hotels situated on a point jutting into the bay. North of the point, BL I-75 follows the Lake Huron shoreline past the Mackinac County Airport. North of the airport, the adjacent properties are primarily residential with a few <b>tourist-oriented</b> businesses. The business loop intersects County Road H-63 (Mackinac Trail) and comes to an end near Castle Rock at exit348 on I-75 in St. Ignace Township. On average each day in 2013, 4,327vehicles use the business loop near the northern I-75 interchange, and 8,819vehicles do so near the southern I-75 interchange, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E

25|$|Peshawar {{was also}} once the {{terminus}} of the Khyber Train Safari, a <b>tourist-oriented</b> train that provided rail access to Landi Kotal. The service was discontinued as {{the security situation}} west of Peshawar deteriorated {{with the beginning of}} the region's Taliban insurgency.|$|E

The service is primarily <b>tourist-oriented</b> {{and includes a}} dinner train over a scenic route between Hyannis and the Cape Cod Canal lasting about 2½ hours round trip. Limited service is also provided to Buzzards Bay {{and from there to}} North Falmouth.|$|E
25|$|Two Tanzanian art styles have {{achieved}} international recognition. The Tingatinga school of painting, founded by Edward Said Tingatinga, consists of brightly coloured enamel paintings on canvas, generally depicting people, animals, or daily life. After Tingatinga's death in 1972, other artists adopted and developed his style, with the genre now {{being the most}} important <b>tourist-oriented</b> style in East Africa.|$|E
25|$|The Valencian Community {{is served}} by two {{international}} airports, Alicante Airport, which is mainly <b>tourist-oriented</b> and Valencia Airport, which carries more business traffic. A third airport, in Castellón Province {{in the north of}} the Valencian territory, is a white elephant which was officially opened on 25 March 2011 but has received the first commercial flight on 15 September 2015.|$|E
25|$|Windsor & Eton Central {{station is}} one of two {{terminal}} stations serving the town of Windsor, Berkshire, England. Although a small part is still a railway station, most of the station building has been converted into a <b>tourist-oriented</b> shopping centre, called Windsor Royal Shopping. It is situated on the High Street, almost immediately opposite Castle Hill, the main public entrance to Windsor Castle.|$|E
25|$|Fairs, festivals, {{and local}} markets occur {{throughout}} the year, but the primary local and <b>tourist-oriented</b> events. Monthly markets are held on Saturdays, {{with the primary}} attractants occurring: on the first Saturday of the month in Canas de Senhorim; the second Saturday of the month in Nelas; the third Saturday of the month in Carvalhal Redondo, and on the last Saturday of the month in Santar.|$|E
25|$|East of Old San Juan {{lies the}} wealthy <b>tourist-oriented</b> {{neighborhood}} of Condado, which occupies land {{that used to}} be owned by entrepreneur Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, a Spanish railroad developer and Count of San José de Santurce under the Spanish colonial period. Beaches such as nearby Ocean Park, popular with swimmers, surfers and kitesurfers, are found all along the district's Atlantic coastline which is also the locus of numerous hotels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century, the Amsterdam city centre has {{attracted}} large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 million to 17 million. Real estate prices have surged, and local shops are making way for <b>tourist-oriented</b> ones, making the centre unaffordable for the city's inhabitants. These developments have evoked comparisons with Venice, a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx.|$|E
25|$|The {{two largest}} cities in Wallonia each have an airport. The Brussels South Charleroi Airport {{has become an}} {{important}} passenger airport, especially with low fares companies such as Ryanair or Wizzair. It serves as a low-cost alternative to Brussels Airport, and it saw 3 million passengers in 2008, almost 4 million in 2009. The Liège Airport is specialized in freight, although it also operates <b>tourist-oriented</b> charter flights. Today, Liège is the 8th airport for European freight and aims to reach the 5th rank in the next decade.|$|E
25|$|Two named {{passenger}} services operated on the line. The Rotorua Express was initiated in 1894 and in 1930 became the Rotorua Limited - {{the most prestigious}} train in New Zealand at that time. The service later reverted to the Rotorua Express with more stops; and in 1959 was replaced by 88-seater Fiat railcars, the NZR RM class. The Fiat railcar service ceased in 1968. In 1991 a new twice daily <b>tourist-oriented</b> service called the Geyserland Express was initiated, using Silver Fern railcars. This service lasted a decade and ceased in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Most Chinatowns are {{centered}} on food, {{and as a}} result Chinatowns worldwide are usually popular destinations for various ethnic Chinese and other Asian cuisines such as Vietnamese, Thai, and Malaysian. Some Chinatowns, such as in Singapore, have developed their own localized style of Chinese cuisine. Chinatown restaurants serve both as major economic components and as social gathering places. In the Chinatowns in many western countries, restaurant work may be the only type of employment available for poorer immigrants, especially those who cannot converse fluently {{in the language of the}} adopted country. Most Chinatowns generally have a range of authentic and <b>tourist-oriented</b> restaurants.|$|E
25|$|Horta {{today is}} {{polarized}} between the same dichotomy that {{existed between the}} hinter- and heartlands, with most primary economic activities (agricultural mostly) dispersed into the parishes, while the secondary and tertiary activities are concentrated in the three main parishes (Angústias, Conceição and Matriz). In addition, the prosperity of the early 20th century, concentrated on the transatlantic traffic, has developed into a <b>tourist-oriented</b> economy concentrated on the architecture, geographic, leisure and socio-cultural aspects of the island. This includes sightseeing tours and whale-watching expeditions that depart from the city, the arrival of semi-weekly cruise ships {{during the summer and}} cultural festivals that unite the local parishes and visitors throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{tourism is}} {{estimated}} to account for 85% of the islands' income. The islands {{have been successful in}} attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities. The majority of visitors stay on St Mary's, which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, Tresco is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously <b>tourist-oriented.</b> Bryher and St Martin's are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. St Agnes has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.|$|E
25|$|Dunedin Railway Station, located {{east of the}} Octagon, is the city's main railway station. Once the nation's busiest, {{decline in}} rail over the years saw the {{withdrawal}} of most services. Suburban services ceased in 1982, and the last regular commercial passenger train to serve Dunedin, The Southerner, was cancelled in February 2002. The Taieri Gorge Railway currently operates <b>tourist-oriented</b> services from the station, {{the most prominent of}} which is the Taieri Gorge Limited, a popular and famous train operated daily along the former Otago Central Railway through the scenic Taieri Gorge. Taieri Gorge Railway also operates to Palmerston once weekly. The station is also sometimes visited by excursions organised by other heritage railway societies, and by trains chartered by cruise ships docking at Port Chalmers.|$|E
25|$|National {{accounts}} show {{a combined}} total of retail and wholesale trade, with hotels and restaurants. in 2012 the sector provides over {{a fifth of}} GDP in <b>tourist-oriented</b> island economies, {{as well as in}} other major countries such as Brazil, Pakistan, Russia, and Spain. In all four of the latter countries, this fraction is an increase over 1970, but there are other countries where the sector has declined since 1970, sometimes in absolute terms, where other sectors have replaced its role in the economy. In the United States the sector has declined from 19% of GDP to 14%, though it has risen in absolute terms from $4,500 to $7,400 per capita per year. In China the sector has grown from 7.3% to 11.5%, and in India even more, from 8.4% to 18.7%. Emarketer predicts China will have the largest retail market in the world in 2016.|$|E
500|$|The {{lifetime}} of A. Farsari & Co. spanned {{the transition of}} Japanese photography from the early involvement and influence of foreign photographers {{to the emergence of}} an independent, native Japanese photographic identity. Coming after the first generation of photographers, the firm made significant contributions to the development of commercial photography in Japan by emphasising the excellence of materials, refining the practice of presenting photographs in albums (which became art objects in themselves), and making effective use of Farsari's own <b>tourist-oriented</b> publications to promote his photographic studio's work [...] an early, minor example of vertical integration.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism {{declared}} Tana Toraja Regency the prima donna of South Sulawesi. Tana Toraja was {{heralded as}} [...] "the second stop after Bali". Tourism was increasing dramatically: by 1985, a {{total number of}} 150,000 foreigners had visited the Regency (in addition to 80,000 domestic tourists), and the annual number of foreign visitors was recorded at 40,000 in 1989. Souvenir stands appeared in Rantepao, the cultural center of Toraja, roads were sealed at the most-visited tourist sites, new hotels and <b>tourist-oriented</b> restaurants were opened, and an airstrip was opened in the Regency in 1981.|$|E
500|$|The line {{is solely}} {{served by a}} <b>tourist-oriented</b> service {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways on behalf of Flåm Utvikling. From May through September, there are nine or ten departures in each direction per day. In {{the rest of the}} year, there are four. Fares do not follow the normal fares for NSB and are considerably higher than on other train routes. InterRail tickets are not valid for free travel, but give a 30 percent discount. Travel time varies between 50 and 59 minutes between the end stations. In 2007, the line was the third-most visited tourist attraction in Norway and carried 547,000 passengers in 2010. The service is provided by push–pull trains consisting of an El 17 at each end and with B3 carriages. The locomotives were built by Henschel in 1987, with electrical equipment from NEBB. They have a power output of [...] and a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement.|$|E

2500|$|Rail {{transport}} in Christchurch, {{the largest}} city in the Canterbury region of New Zealand's South Island, consists of two main trunk railway lines intersecting in the suburb of Addington, carrying mainly long-haul freight traffic but also two long distance <b>tourist-oriented</b> passenger trains. [...] The two lines are the Main North Line and Main South Line, collectively but unofficially known as the South Island Main Trunk Railway. [...] There is a heritage line at the Ferrymead Historic Park that is operated with steam, electric, and diesel motive power hauling <b>tourist-oriented</b> services.|$|E
2500|$|Dar es Salaam (and {{specifically}} {{the area of}} Oyster Bay) {{is home to the}} brightly coloured and <b>tourist-oriented</b> Tingatinga painting style. The Nyumba ya sanaa ("House of Art") is a cultural centre, workshop and shop dedicated to Tanzanian art, showcasing and promoting Tanzanian craftmanship. [...] Prominent Tanzanian sculptor George Lilanga has donated [...] some of his works to the centre, including decorations of the building's main entrance.|$|E
2500|$|Whitehorse Transit {{provides}} {{bus service}} on weekdays from morning until early evening and Saturdays during business hours. There is a waterfront tram, {{known as the}} [...] "trolley", which provides transport along a short rail section along the Yukon River; it is chiefly <b>tourist-oriented</b> and is not integrated into the municipal transit system. It runs from the Rotary Peace Park, located on {{the south end of}} the city centre, up to the north end of the city centre at Spook Creek Station.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the boutiques founded {{during the}} 19th and early 20th century, were still around {{until the late}} 1970s; the {{northern}} section packed with hotels, while the remaining street was renowned for its milliner's shops including up to 30 coat shops. [...] During the later half of the 20th century however, the scene started to change, increasing rents forcing many old shops to shut down or relocate, the oldest after more than 250 years in business, subsequently replaced by more or less fitting successors marketing <b>tourist-oriented</b> gewgaws.|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{overshadowed by}} its more prominent, <b>tourist-oriented</b> {{counterpart}} in San Francisco, Oakland's Chinatown is bustling with activity and {{considered to be}} more authentic to many. Other Asian cultures are represented in Oakland's Chinatown as {{it has also been}} settled by non-Chinese Asians such as ethnic Vietnamese (many of whom operate many of Chinatown's jewelry businesses), Koreans, and Thais making it more of a pan-Asian area as opposed to a [...] "Chinatown." [...] As is the case with other retail and commercial districts around Oakland, the many customers and thriving businesses in Chinatown generate sales tax revenue for Oakland city and Redevelopment Agency coffers.|$|E
2500|$|Fredericksburg in the 21st Century is in a {{state of}} flux. As each {{generation}} of descendants of the original settlers dies away, or moves to new horizons, the authenticity of the rural German farm culture of the Texas Hill Country communities also dies away. It is gradually blending with the customs of newcomers and being replaced by <b>tourist-oriented</b> concepts of both German heritage and the Texas cowboy culture. [...] In 1934, the Gillespie County Historical Society was formed and now houses over 300,000 artifacts. [...] Along with like-minded individuals and organizations, the historical society is dedicated to preserving artifacts, architecture and the history of Fredericksburg.|$|E
2500|$|By 1880, {{railways}} {{had been}} built in the Alpine regions to a few valleys and tourist areas. In the Graubünden, the Rhaetian Railway (RhB), founded in 1889, had developed lines by the outbreak of World WarI along the valleys of the Hinterrhein, Vorderrhein, the Albula, the Engadine and the Poschiavo. In the Bernese Oberland, railways were built to connect to the tourist region around Lake Thun. Narrow gauge lines were built in the western Alps, such as the Montreux-Oberland Bernois railway (MOB), the Furka Oberalp Bahn (FO) and the Gruyère-Fribourg-Morat Railway (GFM). The <b>tourist-oriented</b> Domodossola–Locarno line—also called the Centovalli (Italian for [...] "100 valleys") railway—was completed in 1923, connecting Ticino and the Valais via Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Other short-lasting {{entities}} followed {{such as a}} <b>tourist-oriented</b> laser tag business.
