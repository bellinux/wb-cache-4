5|$|Archeology {{nevertheless}} {{shows the}} evolution of the Oksywie culture to be the fundamental source of the Wielbark culture, as <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cultures</b> extended over exactly the same territory and continuously used the same cemeteries. The locally present Veneti and Rugians became influenced by the Goths or their Scandinavian protoplasts. It is presently believed that the Scandinavian arrivals directly settled the areas where the great cult kurgan and stone burial grounds are found. They are referred to as the Odry-Węsiory-Grzybnica type, were established {{in the second half of}} 1st century AD and occur in parts of Pomerania west of the Vistula, up to the Koszalin area. The contemporary and rather closely related Wielbark culture in (previously settled by the Przeworsk culture) Greater Poland, represented by the Kowalewko cemetery, lacks however for the most part the kurgans and the stone structures. The Wielbark people came here from Pomerania.|$|E
5|$|Yagan {{would have}} been about 35 years old in 1829 when British {{settlers}} landed {{in the area and}} established the Swan River Colony. For {{the first two years of}} the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources. The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as Djanga, the returned spirits of their dead. Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish. As time passed, conflicts between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cultures</b> gradually became more frequent. The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.|$|E
5|$|During the 640s, the Muslim {{conquest of}} Syria and Egypt {{created a new}} threat to Byzantium. Not only did the Arabs conquer {{significant}} recruiting and revenue-producing areas, but, after the utility of a strong navy was demonstrated by the short-lived Byzantine recapture of Alexandria in 644, they took to creating a navy of their own. In this effort the new Muslim elite, which came from the inland-oriented {{northern part of the}} Arabian peninsula, largely relied on the resources and manpower of the conquered Levant (especially the Copts of Egypt), which until a few years previously had provided ships and crews for the Byzantines. There is, however, evidence that in the new naval bases in Palestine shipwrights from Persia and Iraq were also employed. The lack of illustrations earlier than the 14th century means that nothing is known about the specifics of the early Muslim warships, although it is usually assumed that their naval efforts drew upon the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition. Given a largely shared nautical nomenclature, and the centuries-long interaction between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cultures,</b> Byzantine and Arab ships shared many similarities. This similarity also extended to tactics and general fleet organization; translations of Byzantine military manuals were available to the Arab admirals.|$|E

The first chapter {{provides}} an introduction to how Stursberg entered the CBC scene, how he viewed his role replacing the retiring Harold Redekopp as the executive {{vice president in charge}} of English services, and previews what challenges he would encounter. The second chapter covers his experience entering CBC senior management amid contract negotiations with its union, the resulting lock out during summer 2005, and the relations between what he labeled the Gang of Four (senior management) and the Central Committee (union representatives). In the third chapter, Entertainment, he explains his plan for re-orienting CBC television towards entertainment which would use audience numbers to gauge success. He cancelled critically acclaimed shows (Da Vinci's City Hall, This Is Wonderland, and Opening Night) which had low ratings and ordered what he expected would be more audience-friendly shows. Beginning in summer 2006, the first new show under Stursberg's strategy, , received very low ratings and was quickly cancelled. That Autumn's schedule, though, was successful, introducing Little Mosque on the Prairie, The Tudors, Heartland. The nest year's schedule introduced the successful The Border and Being Erica but also the unsuccessful MVP and jPod. Strusberg's move of Marketplace to Friday nights resulted in higher ratings but his plan to move The National to 11pm was denied by the CBC board of directors. In the fourth chapter, The French, he details his relationship with his French counterpart, the style differences between English and French television shows, the disproportionate funding given to the French services, and the lack of CBC Board members who can understand French. As a means of trying to bridge <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cultures,</b> he ordered English versions of the popular Quebec shows Rumours and Sophie but both received low ratings in English Canada.|$|E

30|$|Growth and {{survival}} which together determine the ultimate yield {{are influenced by}} a number of biological parameters such as genetic materials and managerial practices, including water and food quality, energy content of the food and stocking density (Ashagrie et al. 2008; El-Sayed 1999). In this study, O. niloticus reared in polyculture attained higher final mean body weight than those in monoculture. This difference in final mean weight between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>culture</b> systems may be related to water quality since DO differed between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>culture</b> systems. Food and dissolved oxygen are two interrelated factors that act to limit growth (Buentello et al. 2000) with higher DO levels expected to exhibit higher growth. Surprisingly although higher dissolved oxygen was found in the monoculture setup, the highest mean final weight was obtained in polyculture. The higher final mean weight obtained in polyculture is attributed to a reduced number of O. niloticus juveniles due to the presence of C. gariepinus. This provided for space and access to food for the adult O. niloticus to grow into bigger sizes (de Graaf et al. 1996).|$|R

40|$|Byssus play an {{important}} role in securing bivalve molluscs to their respective substrates. This study investigated the impacts of relative current strength and different culture apparatus on byssus secretion by the black-lip pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera. Oysters were either 'ear-hung or housed in panel nets before being transported to low (Nawi) and high (Raviravi) current sites. The quantity of new byssus produced by oysters in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>culture</b> apparatus at <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sites was counted 5, 10, 15 and 20 days after deployment. At the end of the experiment, the thicknesses and tensile strengths of randomly selected byssal threads from ear-hung oysters and oysters held in panel nets were determined. Ten days after deployment, there was no significant difference in the quantity of byssus produced by oysters in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>culture</b> apparatuses at both sites. An average of around two threads per byssus secreting oyster was recorded by the tenth day. However, after 15 and 20 days, ear-hung oysters had produced significantly more byssus (p < 0. 01) than those housed in panel nets at the high current site. On the twentieth day, ear-hung oysters had an average of six byssal threads while those housed in panel nets had an average of around three per oyster at the Raviravi site. In contrast, production of byssus by oysters in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>culture</b> apparatuses did not differ significantly for the same period at the low current site. Furthermore, ear-hung oysters produced significantly thicker byssus than those held in panel nets (p < 0. 01) which had significantly high tensile strengths (p < 0. 01). We hypothesise that secretion of an increased number of byssal threads by ear-hung oysters is a response to a greater degree of agitation than those held in panel nets...|$|R

Considering the application of stem cells in bone tissue engineering, there exists the necessity to investigate various culture methods and suitable fields and scaffolds. Thus, we decided to induce adipose-derived stem cells into osteoblast cells in two systems of pellet culture and monolayer and compare osteogenic markers. Methods: Stem cells have been separated via mechanical and enzymatic methods and cultured in monolayer and pellet culture models with osteogenic medium. Then, RNA was separated from differentiated cells, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized and amplified. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was transferred to electrophoresis gel. The intensity of the bands was measured by Image-J software and analyzed by SPSS. Results: average osteopontin, osteocalcin and Runx 2 genes in differentiated cells in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>culture</b> systems showed a significant difference. The expression of osteocalcin, osteopontin and Runx 2 gense in pellet system were more than monolayer systems in 21 days.
