5|$|On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard {{joined the}} strike, under the {{leadership}} of Marian Jurczyk. A <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.|$|E

At first, the Macintosh 128K suffered from a dearth of available software compared to IBM's PC, resulting in disappointing sales in 1984 and 1985. It took 74days for 50,000units to sell. Although Apple was not able to overcome the <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> IBM PCs and its clones, Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing.|$|E

The siege soon entered a stalemate, with the Malabari trenches being protected from Portuguese cannon fire by walls of cotton bales, and the Portuguese being slowly forced into starvation. Castanheda's detailed report of the siege states that they were then surprised - and saved - by a <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lobsters that washed ashore on 15 August.

[...] Bands like Coal Chamber and Limp Bizkit were inspired by the album's [...] "churning rage, emphasising similar grooves and song structures," [...] and [...] "the sound's hip-hop elements." [...] Slipknot, Machine Head, and Sepultura were also inspired by the album. The album launched the career of record producer Ross Robinson, who later produced albums such as Roots by Sepultura, Three Dollar Bill, Yall by Limp Bizkit, and the Slipknot albums Slipknot and Iowa. In 2014, Rolling Stone described Korn as [...] "the most important metal record of the last 20 years".|$|E
500|$|Music historians Schinder and Schwartz {{wrote of}} the {{transformation}} in popular music styles that took place between the 1950s and the 1960s.

Liam Gallagher and his group Oasis were among the many who acknowledged the band's influence; he identified Lennon as a hero. In 1999, he named his first child Lennon Gallagher in tribute. On National Poetry Day in 1999, the BBC conducted a poll to identify the UK's favourite song lyric and announced [...] "Imagine" [...] as the winner.|$|E

500|$|In 2005 {{there was}} a <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> new wizard rock bands. The {{brothers}} do-it-yourself musical ethos has caught on with bands forming as fellow Potter fans are picking up instruments for the first time. Like Harry and the Potters, these new bands also take on the persona, or dress as a Harry Potter-themed character. Though most fans of the music are previous fans of Harry Potter, some bands have attracted listeners outside of the Harry Potter fanbase. Paul and Joe are aware of around 200 other Harry Potter-related rock bands who at least record and post songs on the Internet. The Boston Phoenix wondered—in spite of fully booked calendars—how long wizard rock would last once there are no new stories to riff on, as their musical identity is contingent on the lasting success and popularity of a book series.

500|$|By 1989, the Soviet {{alliance}} {{system was}} on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the communist leaders of the Warsaw Pact states were losing power. [...] Grassroots organizations, such as Poland's Solidarity movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases. In 1989, the communist governments in Poland and Hungary became the first to negotiate the organizing of competitive elections. In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders. The communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled, in the latter case {{as the result of a}} violent uprising. Attitudes had changed enough that US Secretary of State James Baker suggested that the American government would not be opposed to Soviet intervention in Romania, on behalf of the opposition, to prevent bloodshed. The <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> change culminated with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, which symbolized the collapse of European communist governments and graphically ended the Iron Curtain divide of Europe. The 1989 revolutionary wave swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Soviet-style communist states: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria; Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Lundgren {{starred in}} The Last Warrior as Captain Nick Preston under {{director}} Sheldon Lettich. This post apocalyptic movie {{is set in}} 2006 {{in the context of}} a 9.5-magnitude earthquake which kills millions of people, with Preston leading a motley military patrol on the island to help survivors in the pole shift-affected world. The film was partly shot in Eilat, Israel. Later in 2000, Dolph appeared in Damian Lee's Agent Red (also known as Captured), alongside Alexander Kuznetsov, Natalie Radford and Randolph Mantooth. The film is set during the Cold War, and is about two soldiers trapped on a submarine with a group of terrorists who plan to use a chemical weapon against the United States. Lundgren's character, Matt Hendricks, must work with his wife, a virologist, to prevent the scenario occurring. After the film was completed, producer Andrew Stevens thought it was too poor to be released and multiple people had to be hired to at least make the film half-competent. The film was very poorly received, given its [...] "shoestring budget"; the DVD and Film Guide of 2005 wrote, [...] "low-budget mess stars Dolph Lundgren as a navy special operations commander trying to keep a deadly virus out of the hands of terrorists. This subpar effort sinks to the bottom of the ocean in a <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> cliche." [...] During an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in May 2008, Gladiator director Ridley Scott said Lundgren had been considered for the part of undefeated fighter Tigris of Gaul in 2000, but was eventually rejected because [...] "as an actor, he just didn't fit in with what we were trying to achieve".|$|E

[...] He complimented the primal energy of the music of [...] "Judas," [...] and felt that the breakdown was one of the weirdest moments to hit the pop music scene in 2011.

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the present ocean tide model cannot provide {{time-varying}} ocean loading effects, which is a possible source of temporal variation in the tidal parameters (Calvo et al. 2014). This study focuses on the FCN resonance variations in diurnal <b>tidal</b> <b>waves,</b> which primarily affect the K 1 and ψ 1 waves adjacent to the FCN frequency, as shown in Fig.  2. Time variance in the ocean loading effect should appear in all diurnal <b>tidal</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> one station with a similar pattern. Thus, by comparing the variation in diurnal waves and at stations located in different regions, the resonance variation can be distinguished from the time-varying ocean loading effect. Moreover, for most stations, SG instruments are installed in quiet inland areas, far from the ocean where the ocean tide effect is small.|$|R

While providing an interesting framework for understanding cerebellar function, the theory proposed by Braitenberg and colleaguesis limited mostly to neuroanatomical speculation.
