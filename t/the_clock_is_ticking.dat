500|$|The {{success of}} the game spawned a franchise, with 16 sequels or {{spin-offs}} released to date. Due to its complex physics engine and abundance of possible shortcuts, Super Monkey Ball has been popular with professional speedrunners. A 2006 {{study conducted by the}} Beth Israel Medical Center found that surgeons who played the game for 20 minutes prior to performing a surgical drill finished slightly faster and made fewer mistakes. Super Monkey Ball inspired Neverball, a free game for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Dreamcast, and iOS. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it the 38th best game available on Nintendo platforms, commenting [...] "who knew that such cute characters with cinnamon roll ears could be the source of so much tension (when <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> <b>ticking)</b> and so much relief (when they finally break the ribbon)?"

This has two aspects; the more obvious is exploiting the opponent's time pressure to perpetrate a swindle. Ali Mortazavi observes that [...] "when <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> <b>ticking</b> {{and time is}} pressing, a player's intuition {{is most likely to}} let him down, and this is where the swindler will get his opportunity." [...] He writes, [...] "It is of the utmost importance that the swindler conducts himself in the appropriate fashion when his opponent is in time trouble." [...] This includes calmly reflecting rather than rushing one's moves. GM Pal Benko notes that it is unpleasant for the player in time trouble to have to wait at the board, without daring even to get up to get a drink of water; this also makes the player in time trouble impatient, interferes with his concentration, and may cause him to mix up his planned responses. Mortazavi also advocates that, in general, one should avoid playing the most obvious moves (one-move traps, obvious pawn breaks, checks, etc.), since the player in time trouble will likely have analyzed and have responses ready for them.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAlthough {{small in}} size and simple in structure, {{influenza}} viruses are sophisticated organisms with highly mutagenic genomes and wide antigenic diversity. They are species-specific organisms. Mutation and reassortment have resulted in newer viruses such as H 5 N 1, with new resistance against anti-viral medications, and this might lead {{to the emergence of}} a fully transmissible strain, as occurred in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Influenza viruses are no longer just a cause of self-limited upper respiratory tract infections; the H 5 N 1 avian influenza virus can cause severe human infection with a mortality rate exceeding 50 %. The case death rate of H 5 N 1 avian influenza infection is 20 times higher than that of the 1918 infection (50 % versus 2. 5 %), which killed 675000 people in the USA and almost 40 million people worldwide.

40|$|Abstract: Managing {{people is}} a {{continuing}} leadership challenge. The foundation discipline for managing people relates to human resource management and faculty development in academic settings. In human resource management, administrators are challenged to balance the needs of individuals and {{the expectations of the}} organization for the mutual benefit of both. A primary goal of management is to lead and develop people and manage the organization in alignment with the mission and vision of the organization. The purpose of this paper is, first, to present an overview of human resource management and faculty development fundamentals including motivating, mentoring, and performance counseling. Second, a hypothetical case is presented for readers to apply theory to situation. Finally, the case is analyzed by reviewing central issues and the management concepts that may apply to the scenario. These include managing resources, mentoring, motivation, and development. In this case-based analysis, Dr. Orsten is a junior faculty member employed in a developing school. With a shortage of faculty in her field, she succumbs to the pressures of teaching and administration at the expense of her own professional advancement through research. <b>The</b> tenure <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> <b>ticking,</b> however, and Dr. Orsten has serious doubts about her ability to redirect her priorities and earn tenure.

40|$|A {{career in}} {{academics}} entails far beyond teaching. Being an academician {{is a very}} good job. The freedom to think creatively and learn is priceless. In addition, an academician working towards a PhD goes through intellectually stimulating experience to be shared. Having a PhD is a must to all academics since the PhD experience is about much more than learning to do deep work in some technical area of expertise and being constructively critical. The key is to figure out ways of moving between the different facets of the job without becoming too crazy. In another aspect, an academician is most likely to encounter his role model in teaching, research and professional service environments which are the platforms in pursuit towards excellence. In fact, these are the three main areas within which a faculty member must demonstrate excellence and achievement in order to be promoted: research, teaching and professional service. Indeed, there may be an array of promotion tracks to fit such different career paths; these tracks may have different requirements for promotion. It is critically important that the junior faculty member be familiar with the requirements of their particular track early {{in the course of their}} career.
