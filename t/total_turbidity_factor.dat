We investigate the {{atmospheric turbidity}} over Ghardaı̈a city using two turbidity parameters, the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> and the Angström turbidity coefficient. Their values and temporal variation are obtained from data recorded between 2004 and 2008 at Ghardaı̈a. The results show that both parameters have the same trend along the year. They reach their maximum around summer months and their minimum around winter months. The monthly average value varies between 1. 3 and 5. 6 for the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> and between 0. 02 and 0. 19 for the Angström turbidity coefficient. We find that 39. 8 % of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> values are less than 3, 47. 5 % are between 3 and 5 and only 12. 7 % are greater than 5.

Linke <b>Turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> (LT) is commonly used to model the attenuation of solar radiation in the atmosphere. The probable dependence on the water vapor content of the relationship linking LT to Angstromâs turbidity coefficient B, is discussed. In this study, a procedure for calculation of Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> is adopted using pyrheliometric measurements by Egyptian Typical Meteorological Year (ETMY) at a Thirteen stations at Egypt, during (from 1969 to 2006).

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of direct solar radiation and diffuse radiation for locations in Israel as hourly values. The model {{is based on the}} calculation of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors</b> for the stations Bet-Dagan, Jerusalem, Beer Sheva, Sedom and Eilat, which have been determined from radiation measurements. The <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors</b> for clear sky conditions showed a characteristic yearly pattern and the differences between the stations were related to their geographical locations. The model requires different algorithms for calculations in the Rift Valley system and the rest of Israel. The calculations proved to be very accurate for clear sky conditions with high radiation values (average deviation: 7. 3 % or 61. 6 W/m 2 for values above 600 W/m 2). The presence of clouds and lower sun angles lead to less accurate results, which are nevertheless still acceptable within the range for further applications.

40|$|International audienceThe Heliosat-II {{method was}} {{developed}} to process Meteosat satellite images {{in order to assess}} the solar irradiation at surface. It is modified for its use with GOES satellite images in order to estimate the solar irradiation over French Guiana. Modifications include a change in the calibration formula, in the calculation of the cloud albedo, and in the values of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor.</b> These modifications allow the improvement of the performances of the Heliosat-II model in Intertropical zones in French Guiana. The outcomes were compared to coincident measurements of hourly irradiation performed by ground stations. The results show that the use of the maximum apparent albedo as the cloud albedo (ρcmax), along with a fixed value of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> produces the best results; the bias was less than 23. 61 Wh/m 2 (5 % of the mean value of the measurements) overall, and the RMSE was less than 109. 39 W/m 2 (24 %) overall when using hourly values. In the case of daily means, the RMSE drops to less than 10. 08 W/m 2 (10 %) overall, whereas the overall bias remains unchanged, as expected. The model performs better in clear skies than in cloudy skies. The results suggest that the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> used in the Heliosat-II method does not reproduce well the attenuation of the solar radiation in French Guiana. The results were compared to those obtained from Heliosat II method and Meteosat images (HelioClim- 3 database) and we found a better accuracy for GOES satellite data, which exhibits smaller viewing angle.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a clear-sky model, {{which has been}} developed {{in the framework of}} the new digital European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA). This ESRA model is described and analysed with the main objective of being used to estimate solar radiation at ground level from satellite images with the Heliosat method. Therefore it is compared to clear-sky models that have already been used in the Heliosat method. The diffuse clear-sky irradiation estimated by this ESRA model and by other models has been also checked against ground measurements, for different ranges of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> and solar elevation. The results show that the ESRA model is the best one with respect to robustness and accuracy. The r. m. s. error in the estimation of the hourly diffuse irradiation ranges from 11 Wh. m- 2 to 35 Wh. m- 2 for diffuse irradiation up to 250 Wh. m- 2. The good results obtained with such a model are {{due to the fact that}} it takes into account the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> and the elevation of the site, two factors that influence the incoming solar radiation.

40|$|International audienceThe Heliosat- 2 method, {{which employs}} {{satellite}} images to assess solar irradiance at ground level, {{is one of}} the most accurate among the available operational methods. Its input variables have uncertainties which impact on the final result. The General Law of Uncertainty Propagation is employed to analyze the impact of these uncertainties on a single pixel with Meteosat- 7 inputs in various stages, beginning with the sensitivity coefficients and the changes induced in the clear-sky index (KC) by each independent variable. Once these coefficients are known, the partial combined standard uncertainty (CSU) is calculated for KC from each independent variable and albedo. Finally, the total CSU of KC is calculated. All of the results are in agreement and show that the most influential variables in the uncertainty of estimation of cloudy skies are, in this order, the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> (54 % of KC value), terrain elevation (33 %), the calibration coefficient of the satellite sensor (13 %) and the ground albedo (5 %). What causes the initial uncertainty in the ground albedo is its variation over time and the difficulty in assessing it from a reflectance time-series for mixed clear and cloudy skies. The Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> is the most influential variable on the width of the uncertainty interval, not only because of its own uncertainty (17 % in this study), but because it is also used in numerous intermediate calculations. For clear skies, the partial CSUs are considerably lower, except for ground albedo (5 % also) ...|$|R

Firstly, the solar energy resource assessment {{is based on the}} measurements of solar beam normal irradiance and solar global horizontal irradiance in Turin during the whole 2010 with available data from end of January until end of December except two thirds of August when the Politecnico di Torino was closed since the campaign was carried on inside the department of Energy. Measured data have been compared with clear-sky models and the atmospheric <b>turbidity</b> <b>factors</b> have been calculated and compared with that in 1975 - 6 to evaluate the air-quality variation during the last three decades. Secondly, a series of sensitivity analysis on solar cooling system with various configurations has been undertaken through simulation software Polysun.

Images from geostationary meteorological satellite are currently expoited to produce estimates of the {{solar radiation}} at surface. The Heliosat- 2 method {{is one of the}} most used methods and has been exploited by MINES ParisTech to process Meteosat images since 1985. This method calls upon the clear-sky model proposed in the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA) The only input to this model that describes the atmospheric optical properties is the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor.</b> This factor summarizes in one quantity the effects of the aerosols and water vapour. Values of the Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> are available on a climatotological basis. As a consequence, the clear-sky irradiations proposed by the ESRA+Linke model do not vary from daya to day as they should do. We have investigated the possibility of exploiting advanced data sets on aerosol properties together with a recent model for clear-sky to correct existing databases containing solar surface irradiation computed by the ESRA+Linke model. These aerosol data sets originate from the MACC project as well as the McClear clear-sky model. A series of ground measurements was asembled in order to serve as a reference in the comparison of the original and corrected satellite-derived irradiations. Comparison was performed for 15 -min, 1 -h and daily irradiation. For all summarizations, and almost all stations, the performances of the corrected irradiations are better than those obtained with the ESRA+Linke model. Correlation is larger and large irradiations are better reproduced.

This occurred {{in the cases of}} simple sugars and saccharose contents of the Polish apple juices (e. g., up to 56. 9 mg l – 1 of saccharose vs. a maximum value of 30 mg l – 1), and for some mineral compounds in the French apple juices (e. g., sodium values up to 10 mg l – 1). Large variations were found in case of important healthconferring components. Water-soluble pectin contents varied from 205 mg l – 1 for ‘Chanteline’, to 1, 289 mg l – 1 for ‘Gold Milenium’; while, in the case of phenolic compounds, the range was from 85. 7 mg l – 1 for ‘Novamac’, to 524. 8 mg l – 1 for ‘Melfree’. Two major problems in modern societies are cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer. An increased consumption of fruits and vegetables may hel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The Linke <b>turbidity</b> <b>factor</b> is an {{important}} parameter in solar radiation studies. Longterm monthly average values, TLm, are sufficient for most applications. Estimates of TLm may be obtained {{by way of a}} linear regression established for several European sites between the sum of the Angström regression coefficients on a monthly basis (am + bm) and the measured TLm. During the European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA) project, values of am and bm have been obtained for 710 sites in Europe and countries surrounding the Mediterranean sea, from the analysis of measurements made during the period 19811990. Using the abovementioned formula, these values are turned into climatological values of TL for each month of the year. This data set of TL is unique in the world and {{attention has been paid to}} the means of disseminating the resulting information. A World Wide Web site "Helioserve " has been established, which offers an access to the database through a standard HTML interface. The customers of the Helioserve site are professionals, in research or industry. The database outputs are used as inputs into their own models for atmospheric optics. The site Helioserve comprises also a numerical simulation aspect, which provides to the customer, estimates of the clear sky radiation by running the clearsky model of the ESRA. The TL values requested by the model can be supplied by either the database using an internal query, or the customer himself, or can be set to default values. 1...|$|R
