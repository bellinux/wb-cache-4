500|$|The romance {{contains}} some 46 chansons, {{which can be}} separated into two groups, according to Hollier and Bloch. The first group contains sixteen [...] "aristocratic" [...] chansons courtoises {{on the topic of}} courtly love, attributed to specific trouvères or troubadours (including Gace Brulé, Le Chastelain de Couci, Vidame de Chartres, Jaufre Rudel, and Bernart de Ventadorn). A second group consists of thirty mostly anonymous songs of a more popular nature, such as three chansons de <b>toile</b> and three other ballads, two pastourelles, and twenty chansons à danser (dance songs). Incorporated also is a laisse of the chanson de geste Gerbert de Metz. Different scholars have slightly different counts; where Holier and Block count three ballads and three chanson de toiles, Maureen Barry McCann Boulton counts six chansons de toile; in her detailed investigation of the chansons she claims the poem contains forty-six chansons in eight different genres.|$|E

2500|$|The word toilet {{comes from}} the French <b>toile</b> meaning cloth, and toilette ("little cloth") first came to mean the morning routine of washing, tidying hair, and shaving and making up as appropriate, from the cloth often spread on the dressing-table where this was done. This meaning spread into English as [...] "toilet" [...] in the 17th century; only later did [...] "toilet" [...] start to compete with [...] "lavatory" [...] as a euphemism. [...] The Oxford English Dictionary records [...] "toilet" [...] in English first, from 1540, as a term for a cloth used to wrap clothes in, then from 1662 (by John Evelyn) for a gold toilet service, and before 1700 {{for a range of}} related {{meanings}} (a towel, the cloth on a dressing-table, the act of using a dressing-table, and so on), but not for a lavatory, which did not come into use until the 19th century.|$|E

[...] Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n [...] Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, [...] And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: [...] Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd, [...] Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field [...] 410 [...] Michael and his Angels prevalent [...] Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round, [...] Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part [...] Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, [...] Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, [...] His Potentates to Councel call'd by night; [...] And in the midst thus undismai'd began. [...] O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes [...] Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, [...] Found worthy not of Libertie alone, [...] 420 [...] Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, [...] Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, [...] Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight, [...] (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) [...] What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send [...] Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd [...] Sufficient to subdue us to his will, [...] But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, [...] Of future we may deem him, though till now [...] Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm'd, [...] 430 [...] Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, [...] Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, [...] Since now we find this our Empyreal forme [...] Incapable of mortal injurie [...] Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, [...] Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. [...] Of evil then so small as easie think [...] The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, [...] Weapons more violent, when next we meet, [...] May serve to better us, and worse our foes, [...] 440 [...] Or equal what between us made the odds, [...] In Nature none: if other hidden cause [...] Left them Superiour, while we can preserve [...] Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, [...] Due search and consultation will disclose. [...] He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood [...] Nisroc, of Principalities the prime; [...] As one he stood escap't from cruel fight, [...] Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn, [...] And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake. [...] 450 [...] Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free [...] Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard [...] For Gods, and too unequal work we find [...] Against unequal armes to fight in paine, [...] Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil [...] Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes [...] Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain [...] Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands [...] Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well [...] Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, [...] 460 [...] But live content, which is the calmest life: [...] But pain is perfet miserie, the worst [...] Of evils, and excessive, overturnes [...] All patience. He who therefore can invent [...] With what more forcible we may offend [...] Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme [...] Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves [...] No less then for deliverance what we owe. [...] Whereto with look compos'd Satan repli'd. [...] Not uninvented that, which thou aright [...] 470 [...] Beleivst so main to our success, I bring; [...] Which of us who beholds the bright surface [...] Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, [...] This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd [...] With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold, [...] Whose Eye so superficially surveyes [...] These things, as not to mind from whence they grow [...] Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, [...] Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht [...] With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth [...] 480 [...] So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. [...] These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep [...] Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame, [...] Which into hallow Engins long and round [...] Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire [...] Dilated and infuriate shall send forth [...] From far with thundring noise among our foes [...] Such implements of mischief as shall dash [...] To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands [...] Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd [...] 490 [...] The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. [...] Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, [...] Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive; [...] Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind [...] Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. [...] He ended, and his words thir drooping chere [...] Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. [...] Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee [...] To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd [...] Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought [...] 500 [...] Impossible: yet haply of thy Race [...] In future dayes, if Malice should abound, [...] Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd [...] With dev'lish machination might devise [...] Like instrument to plague the Sons of men [...] For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. [...] Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, [...] None arguing stood, innumerable hands [...] Were ready, in a moment up they turnd [...] Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath [...] 510 [...] Th' originals of Nature in thir crude [...] Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame [...] They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art, [...] Concocted and adusted they reduc'd [...] To blackest grain, and into store conveyd: [...] Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth [...] Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, [...] Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls [...] Of missive ruin; part incentive reed [...] Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. [...] 520 [...] So all ere day spring, under conscious Night [...] Secret they finish'd, and in order set, [...] With silent circumspection unespi'd. [...] Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd [...] Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms [...] The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood [...] Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, [...] Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills [...] Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, [...] Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, [...] 530 [...] Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, [...] In motion or in alt: him soon they met [...] Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow [...] But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail [...] Zephiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, [...] Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd. [...] Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, [...] Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit [...] This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud [...] He comes, and settl'd in his face I see [...] 540 [...] Sad resolution and secure: let each [...] His Adamantine coat gird well, and each [...] Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, [...] Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, [...] If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, [...] But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. [...] So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon [...] In order, quit of all impediment; [...] Instant without disturb they took Allarm, [...] And onward move Embattelld; when behold [...] 550 [...] Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe [...] Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube [...] Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd [...] On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, [...] To hide the fraud. At interview both stood [...] A while, but suddenly at head appeerd [...] Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. [...] Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; [...] That all may see who hate us, how we seek [...] Peace and composure, and with open brest [...] 560 [...] Stand readie to receive them, if they like [...] Our overture, and turn not back perverse; [...] But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, [...] Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge [...] Freely our part: yee who appointed stand [...] Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch [...] What we propound, and loud that all may hear. [...] So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce [...] Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front [...] Divided, and to either Flank retir'd. [...] 570 [...] Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, [...] A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid [...] On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd [...] Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr [...] With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) [...] Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes [...] With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, [...] Portending hollow truce; at each behind [...] A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed [...] Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, [...] 580 [...] Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, [...] Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds [...] Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd [...] With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, [...] But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, [...] From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar [...] Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, [...] And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule [...] Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail [...] Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host [...] 590 [...] Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, [...] That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, [...] Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell [...] By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; [...] The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might [...] Have easily as Spirits evaded swift [...] By quick contraction or remove; but now [...] Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; [...] Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. [...] What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse [...] 600 [...] Repeated, and indecent overthrow [...] Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, [...] And to thir foes a laughter; for in view [...] Stood rankt of Seraphim another row [...] In posture to displode thir second tire [...] Of Thunder: back defeated to return [...] They worse abhorr'd. Satan beheld thir plight, [...] And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. [...] O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? [...] Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, [...] 610 [...] To entertain them fair with open Front [...] And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms [...] Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, [...] Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, [...] As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd [...] Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps [...] For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose [...] If our proposals once again were heard [...] We should compel them to a quick result. [...] To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood. [...] 620 [...] Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, [...] Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, [...] Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, [...] And stumbl'd many, who receives them right, [...] Had need from head to foot well understand; [...] Not understood, this gift they have besides, [...] They shew us when our foes walk not upright. [...] So they among themselves in pleasant veine [...] Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond [...] All doubt of Victorie, eternal might [...] 630 [...] To match with thir inventions they presum'd [...] So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, [...] And all his Host derided, while they stood [...] A while in trouble; but they stood not long, [...] Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms [...] Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. [...] Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power [...] Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) [...] Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills [...] (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n [...] 640 [...] Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) [...] Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, [...] From thir foundations loosning to and fro [...] They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, [...] Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops [...] Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, [...] Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, [...] When coming towards them so dread they saw [...] The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, [...] Till on those cursed Engins triple-row [...] 650 [...] They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence [...] Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, [...] Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads [...] Main Promontories flung, which in the Air [...] Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, [...] Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd [...] Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain [...] Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, [...] Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind [...] Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, [...] 660 [...] Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. [...] The rest in imitation to like Armes [...] Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; [...] So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills [...] Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, [...] That under ground they fought in dismal shade; [...] Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game [...] To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt [...] Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n [...] Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, [...] 670 [...] Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits [...] Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, [...] Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen [...] This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: [...] That his great purpose he might so fulfill, [...] To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd [...] Upon his enemies, and to declare [...] All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son [...] Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. [...] Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, [...] 680 [...] Son in whose face invisible is beheld [...] Visibly, what by Deitie I am, [...] And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, [...] Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, [...] Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, [...] Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame [...] These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, [...] As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; [...] For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, [...] Equal in their Creation they were form'd, [...] 690 [...] Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought [...] Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; [...] Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last [...] Endless, and no solution will be found: [...] Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, [...] And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, [...] With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes [...] Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. [...] Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; [...] For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr [...] 700 [...] Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine [...] Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou [...] Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace [...] Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know [...] In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, [...] And this perverse Commotion governd thus, [...] To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir [...] Of all things, to be Heir and to be King [...] By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. [...] Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, [...] 710 [...] Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles [...] That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, [...] My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms [...] Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; [...] Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out [...] From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: [...] There let them learn, as likes them, to despise [...] God and Messiah his anointed King. [...] He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct [...] Shon full, he all his Father full exprest [...] 720 [...] Ineffably into his face receiv'd, [...] And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. [...] O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, [...] First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst [...] To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, [...] As is most just; this I my Glorie account, [...] My exaltation, and my whole delight, [...] That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will [...] Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. [...] Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, [...] 730 [...] And gladlier shall resign, when in the end [...] Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee [...] For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: [...] But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on [...] Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, [...] Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, [...] Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, [...] To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down [...] To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm, [...] That from thy just obedience could revolt, [...] 740 [...] Whom to obey is happiness entire. [...] Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure [...] Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount [...] Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, [...] Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. [...] So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose [...] From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, [...] And the third sacred Morn began to shine [...] Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound [...] The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, [...] 750 [...] Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, [...] It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd [...] By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each [...] Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all [...] And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels [...] Of Beril, and careering Fires between; [...] Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, [...] Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure [...] Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. [...] Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd [...] 760 [...] Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, [...] Ascended, at his right hand Victorie [...] Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow [...] And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, [...] And from about him fierce Effusion rowld [...] Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; [...] Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, [...] He onward came, farr off his coming shon, [...] And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) [...] Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: [...] 770 [...] Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime [...] On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. [...] Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own [...] First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, [...] When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd [...] Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: [...] Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc'd [...] His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, [...] Under thir Head imbodied all in one. [...] Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; [...] 780 [...] At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd [...] Each to his place, they heard his voice and went [...] Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, [...] And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. [...] This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd, [...] And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers [...] Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. [...] In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? [...] But to convince the proud what Signs availe, [...] Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? [...] 790 [...] They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, [...] Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight [...] Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, [...] Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud [...] Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile [...] Against God and Messiah, or to fall [...] In universal ruin last, and now [...] To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, [...] Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God [...] To all his Host on either hand thus spake. [...] 800 [...] Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand [...] Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; [...] Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God [...] Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, [...] And as ye have receivd, so have ye don [...] Invincibly; but of this cursed crew [...] The punishment to other hand belongs, [...] Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; [...] Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd [...] Nor multitude, stand onely and behold [...] 810 [...] Gods indignation on these Godless pourd [...] By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd, [...] Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, [...] Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream [...] Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, [...] Hath honourd me according to his will. [...] Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; [...] That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee [...] In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, [...] Or I alone against them, since by strength [...] 820 [...] They measure all, of other excellence [...] Not emulous, nor care who them excells; [...] Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. [...] So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd [...] His count'nance too severe to be beheld [...] And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. [...] At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings [...] With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes [...] Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound [...] Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. [...] 830 [...] Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, [...] Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles [...] The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, [...] All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon [...] Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand [...] Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent [...] Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd [...] Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, [...] All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; [...] O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode [...] 840 [...] Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, [...] That wish'd the Mountains now might be again [...] Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. [...] Nor less on either side tempestuous fell [...] His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, [...] Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels, [...] Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, [...] One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye [...] Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire [...] Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, [...] 850 [...] And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, [...] Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. [...] Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd [...] His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant [...] Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: [...] The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard [...] Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd [...] Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd [...] With terrors and with furies to the bounds [...] And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, [...] 860 [...] Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd [...] Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight [...] Strook them with horror backward, but far worse [...] Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw [...] Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth [...] Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. [...] Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw [...] Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled [...] Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep [...] Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. [...] 870 [...] Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, [...] And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall [...] Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout [...] Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last [...] Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, [...] Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire [...] Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. [...] Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird [...] Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. [...] Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes [...] 880 [...] Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: [...] To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood [...] Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, [...] With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, [...] Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, [...] Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, [...] Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, [...] Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode [...] Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts [...] And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd [...] 890 [...] On high; who into Glorie him receav'd, [...] Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. [...] Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth [...] At thy request, and that thou maist beware [...] By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd [...] What might have else to human Race bin hid; [...] The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n [...] Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall [...] Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld [...] With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, [...] 900 [...] Who now is plotting how he may seduce [...] Thee also from obedience, that with him [...] Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake [...] His punishment, Eternal miserie; [...] Which would be all his solace and revenge, [...] As a despite don against the most High, [...] Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. [...] But list'n not to his Temptations, warne [...] Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard [...] By terrible Example the reward [...] 910 [...] Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, [...] Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.|$|E

[...] But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n [...] To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame; [...] Nor hope to be my self less miserable [...] By what I seek, but others to make such [...] As I though thereby worse to me redound: [...] For onely in destroying I finde ease [...] To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, [...] 130 [...] Or won to what may work his utter loss, [...] For whom all this was made, all this will soon [...] Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, [...] In wo then; that destruction wide may range: [...] To mee shall be the glorie sole among [...] The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd [...] What he Almightie styl'd, six Nights and Days [...] Continu'd making, and who knows how long [...] Before had bin contriving, though perhaps [...] Not longer then since I in one Night freed [...] 140 [...] From servitude inglorious welnigh half [...] Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng [...] Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd, [...] And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd, [...] Whether such vertue spent of old now faild [...] More Angels to Create, if they at least [...] Are his Created or to spite us more, [...] Determin'd to advance into our room [...] A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow, [...] Exalted from so base original, [...] 150 [...] With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed [...] He effected; Man he made, and for him built [...] Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, [...] Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie! [...] Subjected to his service Angel wings, [...] And flaming Ministers to watch and tend [...] Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance [...] I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist [...] Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie [...] In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde [...] 160 [...] The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds [...] To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. [...] O foul descent! that I who erst contended [...] With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind [...] Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime, [...] This essence to incarnate and imbrute, [...] That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd; [...] But what will not Ambition and Revenge [...] Descend to? who aspires must down as low [...] As high he soard, obnoxious first or last [...] 170 [...] To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet, [...] Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; [...] Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd, [...] Since higher I fall short, on him who next [...] Provokes my envie, this new Favorite [...] Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, [...] Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd [...] From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. [...] So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie, [...] Like a black mist low creeping, he held on [...] 180 [...] His midnight search, where soonest he might finde [...] The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found [...] In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd, [...] His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles: [...] Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den, [...] Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe [...] Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth [...] The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense, [...] In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd [...] With act intelligential; but his sleep [...] 190 [...] Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn. [...] Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne [...] In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd [...] Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath, [...] From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise [...] To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill [...] With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair [...] And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire [...] Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake [...] The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: [...] 200 [...] Then commune how that day they best may ply [...] Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew [...] The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. [...] And Eve first to her Husband thus began. [...] Adam, well may we labour still to dress [...] This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. [...] Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands [...] Aid us, the work under our labour grows, [...] Luxurious by restraint; what we by day [...] Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, [...] 210 [...] One night or two with wanton growth derides [...] Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise [...] Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present, [...] Let us divide our labours, thou where choice [...] Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind [...] The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct [...] The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I [...] In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt [...] With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: [...] For while so near each other thus all day [...] 220 [...] Our task we choose, what wonder if no near [...] Looks intervene and smiles, or object new [...] Casual discourse draw on, which intermits [...] Our dayes work brought to little, though begun [...] Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. [...] To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd. [...] Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond [...] Compare above all living Creatures deare, [...] Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd [...] How we might best fulfill the work which here [...] 230 [...] God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass [...] Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found [...] In woman, then to studie houshold good, [...] And good workes in her Husband to promote. [...] Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd [...] Labour, as to debarr us when we need [...] Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, [...] Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse [...] Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, [...] To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, [...] 240 [...] Love not the lowest end of human life. [...] For not to irksom <b>toile,</b> but to delight [...] He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. [...] These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt [...] Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide [...] As we need walk, till younger hands ere long [...] Assist us: But if much converse perhaps [...] Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild. [...] For solitude somtimes is best societie, [...] And short retirement urges sweet returne. [...] 250 [...] But other doubt possesses me, least harm [...] Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst [...] What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe [...] Envying our happiness, and of his own [...] Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame [...] By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand [...] Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find [...] His wish and best advantage, us asunder, [...] Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each [...] To other speedie aide might lend at need; [...] 260 [...] Whether his first design be to withdraw [...] Our fealtie from God, or to disturb [...] Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss [...] Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; [...] Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side [...] That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. [...] The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, [...] Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, [...] Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. [...] To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, [...] 270 [...] As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, [...] With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. [...] Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, [...] That such an enemie we have, who seeks [...] Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, [...] And from the parting Angel over-heard [...] As in a shadie nook I stood behind, [...] Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. [...] But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt [...] To God or thee, because we have a foe [...] 280 [...] May tempt it, I expected not to hear. [...] His violence thou fearst not, being such, [...] As wee, not capable of death or paine, [...] Can either not receave, or can repell. [...] His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs [...] Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love [...] Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; [...] Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, [...] Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? [...] To whom with healing words Adam reply'd. [...] 290 [...] Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, [...] For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: [...] Not diffident of thee do I dissuade [...] Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid [...] Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. [...] For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses [...] The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd [...] Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff [...] Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne [...] And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, [...] 300 [...] Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, [...] If such affront I labour to avert [...] From thee alone, which on us both at once [...] The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, [...] Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. [...] Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; [...] Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce [...] Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. [...] I from the influence of thy looks receave [...] Access in every Vertue, in thy sight [...] 310 [...] More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were [...] Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, [...] Shame to be overcome or over-reacht [...] Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. [...] Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel [...] When I am present, and thy trial choose [...] With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. [...] So spake domestick Adam in his care [...] And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought [...] Less attributed to her Faith sincere, [...] 320 [...] Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. [...] If this be our condition, thus to dwell [...] In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, [...] Suttle or violent, we not endu'd [...] Single with like defence, wherever met, [...] How are we happie, still in fear of harm? [...] But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe [...] Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem [...] Of our integritie: his foul esteeme [...] Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns [...] 330 [...] Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard [...] By us? who rather double honour gaine [...] From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, [...] Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. [...] And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid [...] Alone, without exterior help sustaind? [...] Let us not then suspect our happie State [...] Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, [...] As not secure to single or combin'd. [...] Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, [...] 340 [...] And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. [...] To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. [...] O Woman, best are all things as the will [...] Of God ordaind them, his creating hand [...] Nothing imperfet or deficient left [...] Of all that he Created, much less Man, [...] Or ought that might his happie State secure, [...] Secure from outward force; within himself [...] The danger lies, yet lies within his power: [...] Against his will he can receave no harme. [...] 350 [...] But God left free the Will, for what obeyes [...] Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, [...] But bid her well beware, and still erect, [...] Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd [...] She dictate false, and missinforme the Will [...] To do what God expresly hath forbid. [...] Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, [...] That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. [...] Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, [...] Since Reason not impossibly may meet [...] 360 [...] Some specious object by the Foe subornd, [...] And fall into deception unaware, [...] Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. [...] Seek not temptation then, which to avoide [...] Were better, and most likelie if from mee [...] Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. [...] Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve [...] First thy obedience; th' other who can know, [...] Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? [...] But if thou think, trial unsought may finde [...] 370 [...] Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, [...] Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; [...] Go in thy native innocence, relie [...] On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, [...] For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. [...] So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve [...] Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. [...] With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd [...] Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words [...] Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, [...] 380 [...] May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, [...] The willinger I goe, nor much expect [...] A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; [...] So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. [...] Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand [...] Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light [...] Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, [...] Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self [...] In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, [...] Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, [...] 390 [...] But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, [...] Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, [...] To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, [...] Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled [...] Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, [...] Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. [...] Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd [...] Delighted, but desiring more her stay. [...] Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, [...] Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd [...] 400 [...] To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, [...] And all things in best order to invite [...] Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. [...] O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, [...] Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! [...] Thou never from that houre in Paradise [...] Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; [...] Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades [...] Waited with hellish rancor imminent [...] To intercept thy way, or send thee back [...] 410 [...] Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. [...] For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, [...] Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, [...] And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde [...] The onely two of Mankinde, but in them [...] The whole included Race, his purposd prey. [...] In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft [...] Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, [...] Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, [...] By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet [...] 420 [...] He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find [...] Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope [...] Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, [...] Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, [...] Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, [...] Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round [...] About her glowd, oft stooping to support [...] Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay [...] Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, [...] Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies [...] 430 [...] Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, [...] Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, [...] From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. [...] Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd [...] Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, [...] Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen [...] Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours [...] Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: [...] Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd [...] Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd [...] 440 [...] Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, [...] Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King [...] Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. [...] Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. [...] As one who long in populous City pent, [...] Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, [...] Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe [...] Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes [...] Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, [...] The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, [...] 450 [...] Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; [...] If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, [...] What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, [...] She most, and in her look summs all Delight. [...] Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold [...] This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve [...] Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme [...] Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, [...] Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire [...] Of gesture or lest action overawd [...] 460 [...] His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd [...] His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: [...] That space the Evil one abstracted stood [...] From his own evil, and for the time remaind [...] Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, [...] Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; [...] But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, [...] Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, [...] And tortures him now more, the more he sees [...] Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon [...] 470 [...] Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts [...] Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. [...] Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet [...] Compulsion thus transported to forget [...] What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope [...] Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste [...] Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, [...] Save what is in destroying, other joy [...] To me is lost. Then let me not let pass [...] Occasion which now smiles, behold alone [...] 480 [...] The Woman, opportune to all attempts, [...] Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, [...] Whose higher intellectual more I shun, [...] And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb [...] Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, [...] Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, [...] I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine [...] Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. [...] Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, [...] Not terrible, though terrour be in Love [...] 490 [...] And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, [...] Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, [...] The way which to her ruin now I tend. [...] So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd [...] In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve [...] Address'd his way, not with indented wave, [...] Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, [...] Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd [...] Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head [...] Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; [...] 500 [...] With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect [...] Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass [...] Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, [...] And lovely, never since of Serpent kind [...] Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd [...] Hermione and Cadmus, or the God [...] In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd [...] Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, [...] Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore [...] Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique [...] 510 [...] At first, as one who sought access, but feard [...] To interrupt, side-long he works his way. [...] As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought [...] Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind [...] Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; [...] So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine [...] Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, [...] To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound [...] Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd [...] To such disport before her through the Field, [...] 520 [...] From every Beast, more duteous at her call, [...] Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. [...] Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; [...] But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd [...] His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, [...] Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. [...] His gentle dumb expression turnd at length [...] The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad [...] Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue [...] Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, [...] 530 [...] His fraudulent temptation thus began. [...] Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps [...] Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm [...] Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, [...] Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze [...] Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard [...] Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. [...] Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, [...] Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine [...] By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore [...] 540 [...] With ravishment beheld, there best beheld [...] Where universally admir'd; but here [...] In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, [...] Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne [...] Half what in thee is fair, one man except, [...] Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen [...] A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd [...] By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. [...] So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; [...] Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, [...] 550 [...] Though at the voice much marveling; at length [...] Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. [...] What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't [...] By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? [...] The first at lest of these I thought deni'd [...] To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day [...] Created mute to all articulat sound; [...] The latter I demurre, for in thir looks [...] Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. [...] Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field [...] 560 [...] I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; [...] Redouble then this miracle, and say, [...] How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how [...] To me so friendly grown above the rest [...] Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? [...] Say, for such wonder claims attention due. [...] To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. [...] Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, [...] Easie to mee it is to tell thee all [...] What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: [...] 570 [...] I was at first as other Beasts that graze [...] The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, [...] As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd [...] Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: [...] Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd [...] A goodly Tree farr distant to behold [...] Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, [...] Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; [...] When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, [...] Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense [...] 580 [...] Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats [...] Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, [...] Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. [...] To satisfie the sharp desire I had [...] Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd [...] Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, [...] Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent [...] Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. [...] About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, [...] For high from ground the branches would require [...] 590 [...] Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree [...] All other Beasts that saw, with like desire [...] Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. [...] Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung [...] Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill [...] I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour [...] At Feed or Fountain never had I found. [...] Sated at length, ere long I might perceave [...] Strange alteration in me, to degree [...] Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech [...] 600 [...] Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. [...] Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep [...] I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind [...] Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, [...] Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; [...] But all that fair and good in thy Divine [...] Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray [...] United I beheld; no Fair to thine [...] Equivalent or second, which compel'd [...] Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come [...] 610 [...] And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd [...] Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. [...] So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve [...] Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. [...] Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt [...] The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: [...] But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? [...] For many are the Trees of God that grow [...] In Paradise, and various, yet unknown [...] To us, in such abundance lies our choice, [...] 620 [...] As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, [...] Still hanging incorruptible, till men [...] Grow up to thir provision, and more hands [...] Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. [...] To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. [...] Empress, the way is readie, and not long, [...] Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, [...] Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past [...] Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept [...] My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. [...] 630 [...] Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld [...] In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, [...] To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy [...] Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire [...] Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night [...] Condenses, and the cold invirons round, [...] Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, [...] Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, [...] Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, [...] Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way [...] 640 [...] To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, [...] There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. [...] So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud [...] Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree [...] Of prohibition, root of all our woe; [...] Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. [...] Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, [...] Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, [...] The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, [...] Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. [...] 650 [...] But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; [...] God so commanded, and left that Command [...] Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live [...] Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. [...] To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. [...] Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit [...] Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, [...] Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? [...] To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit [...] Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, [...] 660 [...] But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst [...] The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate [...] Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. [...] She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold [...] The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love [...] To Man, and indignation at his wrong, [...] New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, [...] Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act [...] Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. [...] As when of old som Orator renound [...] 670 [...] In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence [...] Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, [...] Stood in himself collected, while each part, [...] Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, [...] Somtimes in highth began, as no delay [...] Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. [...] So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown [...] The Tempter all impassiond thus began. [...] O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, [...] Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power [...] 680 [...] Within me cleere, not onely to discerne [...] Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes [...] Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. [...] Queen of this Universe, doe not believe [...] Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: [...] How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life [...] To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, [...] Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, [...] And life more perfet have attaind then Fate [...] Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. [...] 690 [...] Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast [...] Is open? or will God incense his ire [...] For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise [...] Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain [...] Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, [...] Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade [...] To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; [...] Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil [...] Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? [...] God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; [...] 700 [...] Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: [...] Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. [...] Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, [...] Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, [...] His worshippers; he knows that in the day [...] Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, [...] Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then [...] Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, [...] Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. [...] That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [...] 710 [...] Internal Man, is but proportion meet, [...] I of brute human, yee of human Gods. [...] So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off [...] Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, [...] Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring [...] And what are Gods that Man may not become [...] As they, participating God-like food? [...] The Gods are first, and that advantage use [...] On our belief, that all from them proceeds, [...] I question it, for this fair Earth I see, [...] 720 [...] Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, [...] Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd [...] Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, [...] That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains [...] Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies [...] Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? [...] What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree [...] Impart against his will if all be his? [...] Or is it envie, and can envie dwell [...] In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more [...] 730 [...] Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. [...] Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. [...] He ended, and his words replete with guile [...] Into her heart too easie entrance won: [...] Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold [...] Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound [...] Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd [...] With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; [...] Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd [...] An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell [...] 740 [...] So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, [...] Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, [...] Sollicited her longing eye; yet first [...] Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. [...] Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, [...] Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd, [...] Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay [...] Gave elocution to the mute, and taught [...] The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: [...] Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, [...] 750 [...] Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree [...] Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; [...] Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding [...] Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good [...] By thee communicated, and our want: [...] For good unknown, sure is not had, or had [...] And yet unknown, is as not had at all. [...] In plain then, what forbids he but to know, [...] Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? [...] Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death [...] 760 [...] Bind us with after-bands, what profits then [...] Our inward freedom? In the day we eate [...] Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. [...] How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, [...] And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, [...] Irrational till then. For us alone [...] Was death invented? or to us deni'd [...] This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? [...] For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first [...] Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy [...] 770 [...] The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, [...] Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. [...] What fear I then, rather what know to feare [...] Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, [...] Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? [...] Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, [...] Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, [...] Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then [...] To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? [...] So saying, her rash hand in evil hour [...] 780 [...] Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: [...] Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat [...] Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, [...] That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk [...] The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve [...] Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else [...] Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, [...] In Fruit she never tasted, whether true [...] Or fansied so, through expectation high [...] Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. [...] 790 [...] Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, [...] And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, [...] And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, [...] Thus to her self she pleasingly began. [...] O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees [...] In Paradise, of operation blest [...] To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, [...] And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end [...] Created; but henceforth my early care, [...] Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise [...] 800 [...] Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease [...] Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; [...] Till dieted by thee I grow mature [...] In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; [...] Though others envie what they cannot give; [...] For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here [...] Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, [...] Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind [...] In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, [...] And giv'st access, though secret she retire. [...] 810 [...] And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, [...] High and remote to see from thence distinct [...] Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps [...] May have diverted from continual watch [...] Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies [...] About him. But to Adam in what sort [...] Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known [...] As yet my change, and give him to partake [...] Full happiness with mee, or rather not, [...] But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power [...] 820 [...] Without Copartner? so to add what wants [...] In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, [...] And render me more equal, and perhaps [...] A thing not undesireable, somtime [...] Superior; for inferior who is free? [...] This may be well: but what if God have seen, [...] And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, [...] And Adam wedded to another Eve, [...] Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; [...] A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve, [...] 830 [...] Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: [...] So dear I love him, that with him all deaths [...] I could endure; without him live no life. [...] So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, [...] But first low Reverence don, as to the power [...] That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd [...] Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd [...] From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while [...] Waiting desirous her return, had wove [...] Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne [...] 840 [...] Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown [...] As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. [...] Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new [...] Solace in her return, so long delay'd; [...] Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, [...] Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; [...] And forth to meet her went, the way she took [...] That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree [...] Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, [...] Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand [...] 850 [...] A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, [...] New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. [...] To him she hasted, in her face excuse [...] Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, [...] Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. [...] Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? [...] Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd [...] Thy presence, agonie of love till now [...] Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more [...] Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, [...] 860 [...] The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange [...] Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: [...] This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree [...] Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown [...] Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect [...] To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; [...] And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, [...] Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, [...] Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, [...] Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth [...] 870 [...] Endu'd with human voice and human sense, [...] Reasoning to admiration, and with mee [...] Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I [...] Have also tasted, and have also found [...] Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, [...] Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, [...] And growing up to Godhead; which for thee [...] Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. [...] For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, [...] Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. [...] 880 [...] Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot [...] May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; [...] Least thou not tasting, different degree [...] Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce [...] Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. [...] Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; [...] But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. [...] On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard [...] The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, [...] Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill [...] 890 [...] Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; [...] From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve [...] Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: [...] Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length [...] First to himself he inward silence broke. [...] O fairest of Creation, last and best [...] Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd [...] Whatever can to fight or thought be found, [...] Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! [...] How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, [...] 900 [...] Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? [...] Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress [...] The strict forbiddance, how to violate [...] The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud [...] Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, [...] And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee [...] Certain my resolution is to Die; [...] How can I live without thee, how forgoe [...] Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, [...] To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? [...] 910 [...] Should God create another Eve, and I [...] Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee [...] Would never from my heart; no no, I feel [...] The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, [...] Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State [...] Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [...] So having said, as one from sad dismay [...] Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd [...] Submitting to what seemd remediless, [...] Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. [...] 920 [...] Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, [...] And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd [...] Had it bin onely coveting to Eye [...] That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, [...] Much more to taste it under banne to touch. [...] But past who can recall, or don undoe? [...] Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so [...] Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact [...] Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, [...] Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first [...] 930 [...] Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; [...] Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, [...] Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man [...] Higher degree of Life, inducement strong [...] To us, as likely tasting to attaine [...] Proportional ascent, which cannot be [...] But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. [...] Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, [...] Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy [...] Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, [...] 940 [...] Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, [...] For us created, needs with us must faile, [...] Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, [...] Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, [...] Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power [...] Creation could repeate, yet would be loath [...] Us to abolish, least the Adversary [...] Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God [...] Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first [...] He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? [...] 950 [...] Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. [...] However I with thee have fixt my Lot, [...] Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death [...] Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; [...] So forcible within my heart I feel [...] The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, [...] My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; [...] Our State cannot be severd, we are one, [...] One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. [...] So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. [...] 960 [...] O glorious trial of exceeding Love, [...] Illustrious evidence, example high! [...] Ingaging me to emulate, but short [...] Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, [...] Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, [...] And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, [...] One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff [...] This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, [...] Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread [...] Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, [...] 970 [...] To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, [...] If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, [...] Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, [...] Direct, or by occasion hath presented [...] This happie trial of thy Love, which else [...] So eminently never had bin known. [...] Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue [...] This my attempt, I would sustain alone [...] The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die [...] Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact [...] 980 [...] Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd [...] Remarkably so late of thy so true, [...] So faithful Love unequald; but I feel [...] Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life [...] Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, [...] Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before [...] Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. [...] On my experience, Adam, freely taste, [...] And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. [...] So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy [...] 990 [...] Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love [...] Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr [...] Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. [...] In recompence (for such compliance bad [...] Such recompence best merits) from the bough [...] She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit [...] With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat [...] Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, [...] But fondly overcome with Femal charm. [...] Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again [...] 1000 [...] In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, [...] Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops [...] Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin [...] Original; while Adam took no thought, [...] Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate [...] Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe [...] Him with her lov'd societie, that now [...] As with new Wine intoxicated both [...] They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel [...] Divinitie within them breeding wings [...] 1010 [...] Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit [...] Farr other operation first displaid, [...] Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve [...] Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him [...] As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: [...] Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. [...] Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, [...] And elegant, of Sapience no small part, [...] Since to each meaning savour we apply, [...] And Palate call judicious; I the praise [...] 1020 [...] Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. [...] Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd [...] From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now [...] True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be [...] In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, [...] For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. [...] But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, [...] As meet is, after such delicious Fare; [...] For never did thy Beautie since the day [...] I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd [...] 1030 [...] With all perfections, so enflame my sense [...] With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now [...] Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. [...] So said he, and forbore not glance or toy [...] Of amorous intent, well understood [...] Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. [...] Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, [...] Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd [...] He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, [...] Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, [...] 1040 [...] And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. [...] There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport [...] Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, [...] The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep [...] Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. [...] Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, [...] That with exhilerating vapour bland [...] About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers [...] Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep [...] Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams [...] 1050 [...] Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose [...] As from unrest, and each the other viewing, [...] Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds [...] How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile [...] Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, [...] Just confidence, and native righteousness, [...] And honour from about them, naked left [...] To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe [...] Uncover'd more. So rose the Danite strong [...] Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap [...] 1060 [...] Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd [...] Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare [...] Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face [...] Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, [...] Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht, [...] At length gave utterance to these words constraind. [...] O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care [...] To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught [...] To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, [...] False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes [...] 1070 [...] Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know [...] Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, [...] Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, [...] Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, [...] Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, [...] Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, [...] And in our Faces evident the signes [...] Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; [...] Even shame, the last of evils; of the first [...] Be sure then. How shall I behold the face [...] 1080 [...] Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy [...] And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes [...] Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze [...] Insufferably bright. O might I here [...] In solitude live savage, in some glad [...] Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable [...] To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, [...] And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, [...] Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs [...] Hide me, where I may never see them more. [...] 1090 [...] But let us now, as in bad plight, devise [...] What best may for the present serve to hide [...] The Parts of each from other, that seem most [...] To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, [...] Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, [...] And girded on our loyns, may cover round [...] Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, [...] There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. [...] So counsel'd hee, and both together went [...] Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose [...] 1100 [...] The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, [...] But such as at this day to Indians known [...] In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes [...] Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground [...] The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow [...] About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade [...] High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; [...] There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate [...] Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds [...] At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves [...] 1110 [...] They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, [...] And with what skill they had, together sowd, [...] To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide [...] Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike [...] To that first naked Glorie. Such of late [...] Columbus found th' American to girt [...] With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde [...] Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. [...] Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part [...] Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, [...] 1120 [...] They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares [...] Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within [...] Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, [...] Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore [...] Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once [...] And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: [...] For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will [...] Heard not her lore, both in subjection now [...] To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe [...] Usurping over sovran Reason claimd [...] 1130 [...] Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, [...] Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, [...] Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. [...] Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd [...] With me, as I besought thee, when that strange [...] Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, [...] I know not whence possessd thee; we had then [...] Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild [...] Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. [...] Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve [...] 1140 [...] The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek [...] Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. [...] To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve. [...] What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, [...] Imput'st thou that to my default, or will [...] Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows [...] But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, [...] Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, [...] Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd [...] Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; [...] 1150 [...] No ground of enmitie between us known, [...] Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. [...] Was I to have never parted from thy side? [...] As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. [...] Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head [...] Command me absolutely not to go, [...] Going into such danger as thou saidst? [...] Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, [...] Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. [...] Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, [...] 1160 [...] Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. [...] To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd. [...] Is this the Love, is the recompence [...] Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest [...] Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, [...] Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, [...] Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: [...] And am I now upbraided, as the cause [...] Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, [...] It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? [...] 1170 [...] I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold [...] The danger, and the lurking Enemie [...] That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, [...] And force upon free Will hath here no place. [...] But confidence then bore thee on, secure [...] Either to meet no danger, or to finde [...] Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps [...] I also err'd in overmuch admiring [...] What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought [...] No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue [...] 1180 [...] That errour now, which is become my crime, [...] And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall [...] Him who to worth in Women overtrusting [...] Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, [...] And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, [...] Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. [...] Thus they in mutual accusation spent [...] The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning [...] And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.|$|E
