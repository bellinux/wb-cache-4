40|$|This paper {{presents}} a crosslinguistic study into {{the acquisition of}} form-to-meaning correspondences {{in the domain of}} aspect. How may form affect the acquisition process and how may meaning do so? The results from aspectual comprehension experiments with Dutch, Italian and Polish L 1 learners reveal that both form and meaning properties affect the acquisition path and lead to developmentally different patterns across languages. <b>The</b> semantics of <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect</b> is acquired earlier than imperfective aspect. Moreover, there is a surprising discrepancy in <b>the</b> understanding of <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect.</b> Whereas Dutch and Polish children have acquired the completion entailment of their Present Perfect and <b>Perfective</b> <b>aspect</b> respectively by <b>the</b> age of 3, Italian 3 -year-olds perform at chance with their Present Perfect. These results do not support the hypothesis of Uniformity of Aspect Acquisition, which claims that certain aspectual notions (in particular, <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect)</b> are acquired around the same age independent of the language-specific encoding. Instead I put forward an acquisition theory of form-to-meaning correspondences that is sensitive both to form Morphological Salience, namely, the idea that the semantics of morphologically salient paradigms is acquired early - and to meaning - Semantic Complexity, namely, the idea that the semantics of simple aspectual operations is acquired early.

40|$|Many Northeastern Neo-Aramaic {{languages}} {{have two}} distinct strategies for marking <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect,</b> both morphosyntactically restricted in different ways. <b>The</b> canonical <b>perfective</b> strategy – <b>the</b> <b>perfective</b> verb base – typically 'bans' {{certain types of}} objects, while <b>the</b> secondary <b>perfective</b> strategy – <b>the</b> imperfective verb base bearing <b>the</b> <b>perfective</b> prefix qam- – 'requires' {{a certain type of}} object. This paper deals mainly with <b>the</b> secondary <b>perfective</b> strategy, attempting to understand and formally characterize its distribution and structure. While this phenomenon is well-known in the descriptive and historical literature (see Coghill 1999 and references therein), it has never before received theoretical treatment. I argue that qam- is a high <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect</b> marker analogous to certain so-called “superlexical” prefixes in Slavic languages, which have a perfectivizing function and select for an imperfective stem (Babko-Malaya 1999; 2003; Ramchand 2004; Romanova 2004; Tatevosov 2008; Gribanova 2013; 'i. a'.). Slavic-like stacking of high aspects is thus shown to exist in languages that lack a corresponding system of rich lexical aspect (cf. the Slavic “lexical” prefixes). <b>The</b> secondary <b>perfective</b> in Northeastern Neo-Aramaic also illuminates another cross-linguistic pattern: apparent temporal or aspectual mismatches between the clause level and the verb-stem/base level, like those found in Indo-Iranian languages (Haig 2008), need not imply that the verb bases/stems lack tense and aspect. Finally, I show that <b>the</b> secondary <b>perfective</b> furnishes a new type of argument for the syntactic nature of 'φ'-agreement...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the acquisition of}} Spanish <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect</b> in production and comprehension. It argues that, although young children use <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect</b> to talk about completed events, young children have difficulty in assessing perfective meaning from perfective morphology. This paper proposes that {{in the process of}} acquiring aspectual meaning, children use local strategies to decode aspectual meaning from form: when analyzing a completed situation, young children depend on certain learnability factors to correctly assess the entailment of completion of <b>the</b> <b>perfective,</b> namely, their ability to determine if the object of the event measures out the event as a whole or not, and their ability to read the agent’s intentions. When those factors are removed from the situation, young children had difficulty determining the entailment of completion of <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect.</b> This study also suggests that the manner in which aspectual information is conveyed in a language, may play a role on the readiness of the acquisition of the semantic morphology of the language (e. g., verb+object vs. verb+affixes).

Italian grammar does not have distinct forms to indicate specifically verbal aspect, though different verbal inflections and periphrases do render different <b>aspects,</b> in particular <b>the</b> <b>perfective</b> and imperfective <b>aspects</b> and the perfect tense-aspect combination. While the various inflected verbal forms convey a combination of tense (location in time), aspect, and mood, language-specific discussions generally refer to these inflectional forms as [...] "tempi", for this reason it is impossible to make comparisons between the tenses of English verbs and the tempi of Italian verbs as there is no correspondence at all.|$|R

40|$|The Russian future tense {{has three}} {{semantic}} components (temporal, modal, and aspectual), {{which is why}} studies on this topic tend to emphasize an asymmetry within the Russian tense system. As a matter of fact, according to some linguists, there is one sole opposition in Russian: that between {{the past and present}} tenses. In the present work, the author expounds the attempts made by linguists to resolve this asymmetry, and distinguishes between Bondarko’s semantic functional formulation (1971) and the typological and contrastive studies which are peculiar to the Western linguistic tradition. She subsequently shows how the results of a typological-contrastive approach {{and the use of the}} conceptual apparatus developed so far within studies on modality and aspect, can help explain the semantic value of the future tense markers in Russian, particularly those of <b>the</b> present-future <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect.</b> In <b>the</b> part devoted to the analysis of a corpus of examples drawn from the Russian grammatical tradition, the future tense markers are considered as an amalgam and it is pointed out how their potential values are activated in precise communicative co-texts and contexts.

5000|$|As the Germanic {{languages}} {{developed from}} PIE, they dramatically altered the Indo-European verbal system. PIE verbs had no tense, but could occur in three distinct [...] "aspects": the present, aorist and perfect aspect. The present implied some attention to such details and was thus used for ongoing actions ("is eating", imperfective aspect). The aorist originally denoted events without {{any attention to}} the specifics or ongoing nature of <b>the</b> event ("ate", <b>perfective</b> <b>aspect).</b> <b>The</b> perfect was a stative verb, and referred not to the event itself, but to the state that resulted from the event ("has eaten" [...] or [...] "is/has been eaten"). In Germanic, the aorist eventually disappeared and merged with the present, while the perfect took on a past tense meaning and became a general past tense. The strong Germanic present thus descends from the PIE present, while the past descends from the PIE perfect. The inflexions of PIE verbs also changed considerably.|$|R
5000|$|In Slavic languages, a given verb is, in itself, either {{perfective}} or imperfective.

(This may be considered a form of lexical <b>aspect.)</b> <b>Perfective</b> verbs are commonly formed from imperfective ones by the addition of a prefix, or else the imperfective verb is formed from <b>the</b> <b>perfective</b> one by modification of the stem or ending. Suppletion also plays a small role. Perfective verbs cannot generally be used with the meaning of a present tense - their present-tense forms in fact have future reference.
