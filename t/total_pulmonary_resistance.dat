The primary objective was to compare the resolution of pulmonary embolism as judged by the change in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> over the initial 2 h. Further objectives were to evaluate the changes in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> over the next 10 h and the degree of angiographic resolution at 12 to 18 h. At 2 h, <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> decreased by 18 ± 22 % in the urokinase group and by 36 ± 17 % in the alteplase group (p = 0. 0009). Continuous monitoring of pulmonary artery mean pressure, cardiac index and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> revealed that these variables improved faster in the alteplase group, with consistently significant intergroup differences from 30 min up to 3 to 4 h. After 12 h, the decrease in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> was 53 ± 19 % in the urokinase group compared with 48 ± 17 % in the alteplase group and the reduction in the angiographic severity score was 30 ± 25 % compared with 24 ± 18 %, respectively, with no significant intergroup differences.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} low flow oxygen and isosorbide dinitrate on rest and exercise biventricular ejection fractions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to relate these ejection fraction responses to changes in pressure and flow. Nine patients with stable, moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who had no prior history of heart failure performed supine exercise with simultaneous hemodynamic and radionuclide ventriculographic monitoring. Eight patients performed a second exercise during low flow oxygen breathing and five performed a third exercise after ingesting 10 mg oral isosorbide. Oxygen led to a decrease in exercise pulmonary artery pressure in all subjects and a decline in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> in five of the seven in whom it was measured. Right ventricular ejection fraction increased 0. 05 or more only in subjects who had a decrease in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance.</b> Isosorbide led to an increase in rest and exercise right and left ventricular ejection fractions with simultaneous decreases in pulmonary artery pressure, <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance,</b> blood pressure and arterial oxygen tension. These results suggest that in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but without a history of right heart failure, the right ventricular systolic functional response to low flow oxygen and isosorbide at rest and exercise is, in part, determined by changes in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance.</b> The chronic relation between right ventricular ejection fraction and pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The exercise-induced {{changes in}} the equine {{breathing}} pattern were studied by analyzing tidal breathing flow-volume loops recorded in ten ponies both at rest and during a standardized exercise. Airflow, tidal volume, esophageal pressure and mask pressure were simultaneously recorded before, during and after a treadmill exercise. From the collected data, respiratory frequency and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> were calculated, tidal breathing flow-volume loops were retraced using a computerized method and loop indices were measured for each period of the experimental protocol. For each pony, results of three consecutive daily measurements were averaged. The exercise loop indices were compared with the corresponding resting values using a one-way analysis of variance. The significantly changed indices were correlated with respiratory frequency and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance.</b> Several types of respiratory patterns were observed at rest as well as during exercise, although each pony was relatively constant in its own pattern of breathing. Most resting inspiratory and expiratory airflow curves {{were found to be}} biphasic. When ponies started running, the airflow developed an increasingly rectangular pattern. During strenuous exercise, both inspiratory and expiratory airflow curves showed a substantial increase of the volume acceleration and tended to a plateau. The loop indices relating the expiratory to the inspiratory airflow were significantly increased compared with their rest values. Correlations of these indices with respiratory frequency and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> were weak. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The acute haemodynamic {{effects of}} oral {{pirbuterol}} (a beta-agonist) were contrasted {{with those of}} sodium nitroprusside, a vasodilator, in six patients with hypoxic chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Sodium nitroprusside (1 - 5 mg/kg intravenously) reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> significantly (p less than 0. 01) without change in cardiac output or right ventricular ejection fraction, measured by radionuclide ventriculography. Oral pirbuterol (22. 5 mg) produced a greater reduction in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> than sodium nitroprusside, {{largely as a result}} of increasing cardiac output. Right ventricular ejection fraction also increased significantly after pirbuterol (p less than 0. 01). Pirbuterol in a lower dosage (15 mg by mouth) in six further patients with hypoxic chronic bronchitis and emphysema produced similar changes in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> and right ventricular ejection fraction. Nine of the patients who were studied acutely thereafter received pirbuterol 15 mg thrice daily for six weeks, which produced a significant fall in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure and a rise in right ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0. 01), without a significant fall in arterial oxygen tension. Pirbuterol acts as a vasodilator on the pulmonary circulation in these patients and may in addition improve right ventricular performance by an inotropic action...|$|R
40|$|Our {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} evaluate hemodynamic effects of intravenous administration of Reproterol in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD).

40|$|The haemodynamic {{responses}} to a bolus intravenous injection of 400 mg cimetidine were studied in eight subjects with normal lung function and sixteen with chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), under continuous systemic and pulmonary arterial monitoring. In all subjects there were significant immediate but transient (less than 10 min) drops in the systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures (both systolic and diastolic), the systemic vascular resistance and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance.</b> The percentage drops were significantly more marked in the COAD group in the following: systemic arterial pressures (systolic and diastolic), systemic vascular resistance and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance.</b> The cardiac output showed no {{significant change in the}} group with normal lung function but rose significantly in the COAD group. None of the subjects had any symptoms associated with the heamodynamic changes.

Acetylcholine, calcitonin gene related peptide and substance P {{had no effect on}} <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure, <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> or cardiac output, although calcitonin gene-related peptide significantly decreased systemic arterial systolic pressure from 132 ± 34 to 113 ± 33 mm Hg.

40|$|<b>Total</b> respiratory, <b>pulmonary,</b> {{and chest}} wall flow {{resistances}} {{were determined by}} means of forced pressure and flow oscillations (3 - 9 cps) superimposed upon spontaneous breathing {{in a group of}} patients with varying degrees of obstructive lung disease. Increased <b>total</b> respiratory and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistances</b> were found, whereas the chest wall resistance was normal or subnormal. The <b>total</b> respiratory and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistances</b> decreased with increasing frequencies. Static compliance of the lung was measured during interrupted slow expiration, and dynamic compliance was measured during quiet and rapid spontaneous breathing.

The practical application of the oscillatory technique to the measurement of flow resistance in patients with lung disease is discussed. Measurements of total respiratory resistance by the forced oscillatory technique at frequencies less than 5 cps appear to be as useful for assessing abnormalities in airway resistance as either the plethysmographic or esophageal pressure techniques...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the changes in}} cardiovascular and splanchnic hemodynamic, diuresis and urinary and hepatic veins osmolarity induced by hypotonic water load in five normal subjects and in five patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Pulmonary wedge pressure increased significantly only in CHF patients while cardiac index, <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistances</b> and peripheral vascular resistances remained unchanged in both groups. Hepatic blood flow increased significantly in control group while in CHF showed a significant reduction 15 and 30 minutes after water load. Hepatic veins osmolarity decreased significantly in control group only at the 45 th minute. Diuresis was significantly higher in normals which eliminated water load with a lower urinary osmolarity. The authors conclude that: water loading is particularly interesting in so much it resembles the physiological conditions of the absorption of the alimentary hypotonic bolus; the failing heart responds to the water load on a depressed function curve; the hepatic blood flow is reduced in CHF patients and is probably responsible for some humoral abnormalities found in these subjects; CHF patients eliminate a water load slower than a normal subject and with a higher osmolarity...|$|R
40|$|Effects of IV and aerosol {{administration}} of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) on ventilation, pulmonary mechanics values, pulmonary arterial pressure, {{and heart rate}} were investigated in healthy unsedated Friesian calves. Minute volume increased significantly, mainly because {{of an increase in}} respiratory rate. Except for <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> after bolus injection, continuous {{administration of}} 5 -HT given by either route caused significant alterations of lung dynamic compliance and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance,</b> the former decreasing to one-fifth of its baseline value and the latter increasing twofold. Pulmonary arterial pressure increased significantly, whatever the speed or route of administration. Administration of a bolus did not affect heart rate, whereas continuous IV administration of 5 -HT as well by perfusion or by aerosol resulted in sustained tachycardia. It was concluded that 5 -HT induces reversible bronchoconstriction and pulmonary vasoconstriction in healthy unsedated calves, 5 -HT-induced functional alterations depend on the speed of administration, and excess of 5 -HT production or depression in uptake by the lungs during bovine respiratory tract diseases could contribute to pulmonary dysfunction.

40|$|This study {{examined}} right ventricular function during exercise {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} to answer the following questions: 1) Is there a significant correlation between oxygen consumption at maximal exercise and exercise right ventricular ejection fraction? 2) Does the right ventricular ejection fraction response to exercise correlate with exercise changes in pulmonary artery pressure, <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> or pulmonary vascular resistance? 3) Which combinations of cardiac, ventilatory and blood gas variables are the best predictors of oxygen consumption at maximal exercise? Twenty-six patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease performed symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise with simultaneous hemodynamic and radionuclide ventriculographic measurements. The oxygen consumption at maximal exercise correlated with the exercise right ventricular ejection fraction (n = 21, r = 0. 66; p < 0. 005), exercise stroke volume (r = 0. 68; p < 0. 001), exercise cardiac output (r = 0. 77; p < 0. 00005) and exercise ventilation (r = 0. 85; p < 0. 00001). The change in right ventricular ejection fraction from rest to exercise correlated inversely with the change from rest to exercise in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> (r = − 0. 51; p < 0. 05) but not with the change in mean pulmonary pressure (r = − 0. 37) or in pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0. 09). Multivariate analysis showed that the variables giving the highest combined correlation with oxygen consumption were ventilation and right ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0. 95, adjusted r 2 = 0. 88). These results suggest that 1) exercise oxygen consumption of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is related to right ventricular systolic function, 2) exercise right ventricular dysfunction is related, in part, to abnormal exercise <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance,</b> and 3) exercise limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occurs {{as a result of the}} dynamic interaction between disordered right heart function and ventilation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether inhaled NO (iNO) can reduce pulmonary vascular resistance in adults with {{congenital heart disease}} and obstructive pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger syndrome. DESIGN: 23 patients received graded doses of iNO. Pulmonary and systemic haemodynamic variables and circulating cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations were measured at baseline and after 20 and 80 ppm iNO. Patients were considered responders when <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> was reduced by at least 20 %, and rebound {{was defined as a}} greater than 10 % increase in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> upon withdrawal from iNO. RESULTS: In response to 20 ppm iNO, <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> decreased in four patients (18 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 2 % to 34 %), while in response to 80 ppm iNO it decreased in six patients (29 %, 95 % CI 10 % to 38 %). Systemic blood pressure did not change. Withdrawal resulted in rebound in three patients (16 %, 95 % CI 0 % to 32 %) after cessation of 20 ppm iNO, and in six patients (35 %, 95 % CI 12 % to 58 %) after cessation of 80 ppm iNO. Patients with predominant right to left shunting did not respond. In all patients cGMP increased from (mean (SD)) 28 (13) micromol/l at baseline to 55 (30) and 78 (44) micromol/l after 20 and 80 ppm iNO (p < 0. 05 v baseline). CONCLUSIONS: NO inhalation is safe and is associated with a dose dependent increase in circulating cGMP concentrations. Pulmonary vasodilatation in response to iNO was observed in 29 % of patients and was influenced by baseline pulmonary haemodynamics. Responsiveness to acute iNO may identify patients with advanced obstructive pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome who could benefit from sustained vasodilator treatment. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} revival of {{interest}} in exercise testing of the pulmonary circulation for the diagnosis of pulmonary vascular disease, but there still is uncertainty about body position and the most relevant measurements. Doppler echocardiography pulmonary hemodynamic measurements were performed at progressively increased workloads in 26 healthy adult volunteers in supine, semirecumbent, and upright positions that were randomly assigned at 24 -h intervals. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was estimated from the maximum tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity. Cardiac output was calculated from the left ventricular outflow velocity-Time integral. Pulmonary vascular distensibility-index, the percent change of vessel diameter per millimeter mercury of mPAP, was calculated from multipoint mPAP-cardiac output plots. Body position did not affect maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max), maximum respiratory exchange ratio, ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide, or slope of mPAP-cardiac output relationships, which was on average of 1. 5 ± 0. 4 mmHg - 1 min- 1. Maximum mPAP, cardiac output, and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> were, respectively, 34 ± 4 mmHg, 18 ± 3 l/min, and 1. 9 ± 0. 3 Wood units.

Five COPD horses were submitted to a standardized submaximal treadmill exercise test while they were in clinical remission or in acute crisis.

O 2 consumption, CO 2 production, expired minute ventilation, tidal volume, alveolar ventilation, cardiac output, <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance,</b> and mechanical work of breathing were calculated. The results showed that, when submaximally exercised, COPD horses in crisis were significantly more hypoxemic and hypercapnic and that their <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> and mechanical work of breathing were significantly higher and their expired minute ventilation significantly lower than when they were in remission.

40|$|Abstract Background Cardiac output (CO) is an {{important}} determinant of the hemodynamic state in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). We tested the hypothesis that CO can be estimated from the right ventricular (RV) pressure waveform in CHF patients using a pulse contour cardiac output algorithm that considers constant but patient specific RV outflow tract characteristic impedance. Method In 12 patients with CHF, breath-by-breath Fick CO and RV pressure waveforms were recorded utilizing an implantable hemodynamic monitor during a bicycle exercise protocol. These data were analyzed retrospectively to assess changes in characteristic impedance of the RV outflow tract during exercise. Four patients that were implanted with an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implementing the algorithm were studied prospectively. During a two staged sub-maximal bicycle exercise test conducted at 4 and 16 weeks of implant, COs measured by direct Fick technique and estimated by the ICD were recorded and compared. Results At rest the <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>resistance</b> and the characteristic impedance were 675 ± 345 and 48 ± 18 dyn. s. cm - 5, respectively. During sub-maximal exercise, the <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>resistance</b> decreased (Δ 91 ± 159 dyn. s. cm - 5, p - 5, NS). The algorithm derived cardiac output estimates correlated with Fick CO (7. 6 ± 2. 5 L/min, R 2 = 0. 92) with a limit of agreement of 1. 7 L/min and tracked changes in Fick CO (R 2 = 0. 73). Conclusions The analysis of right ventricular pressure waveforms continuously recorded by an implantable hemodynamic monitor provides an estimate of CO and may prove useful in guiding treatment in patients with CHF. </p...|$|R
50|$|Hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction (HPV), {{also known}} as the Euler-Liljestrand mechanism, is a physiological phenomenon in which small pulmonary arteries constrict in the presence of alveolar hypoxia (low oxygen levels). By redirecting blood flow from poorly-ventilated lung regions to well-ventilated lung regions, HPV is thought to be the primary mechanism underlying ventilation/perfusion matching. The process might initially seem counterintuitive, as low oxygen levels might theoretically stimulate increased blood flow to the lungs to increase gas exchange. However, the purpose of HPV is to distribute bloodflow regionally to increase the overall efficiency of gas exchange between air and blood. While the maintenance of ventilation/perfusion ratio during regional obstruction of airflow is beneficial, HPV can be detrimental during global alveolar hypoxia which occurs with exposure to high altitude, where HPV causes a significant increase in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance,</b> and <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressure, potentially leading to pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edema. Several factors inhibit HPV including increased cardiac output, hypocapnia, hypothermia, acidosis/alkalosis, increased <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance,</b> inhaled anesthetics, calcium channel blockers, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), high-frequency ventilation (HFV), isoproterenol, nitric oxide, and vasodilators.|$|R

Seven {{children with}} pulmonary hypertension were exercised during cardiac catheterisation after operative correction of ventricular septal defect (6) and truncus arteriosus (1). Except {{for the presence}} of moderate pulmonary hypertension, resting haemodynamics in these seven children were similar to those of normal children of equal age, but during exercise the postoperative patients showed a rise rather than a fall (+ 2 % vs - 18 %) in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance.</b> Two of the seven children had a substantial increase in <b>pulmonary</b> arteriolar <b>resistance</b> during exercise (from 509 to 715 dyne s cm- 5 in one patient and from 606 to 828 dyne s cm- 5 in the other). These two patients did not differ from normal children in respect of arterial or mixed venous oxygen saturations or of pH with exercise, nor was left atrial pressure related to the rise in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance.</b> These two patients, however, had only a small rise in cardiac output during exercise (6. 8 % and 43. 1 %) in spite of a substantial increase in oxygen consumption (121 % and 373 %). One of the patients with exercise-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction had an 82 % increase in resting <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> over a five year period subsequent to her first exercise study. Analysis of these data, and those previously reported, suggests that exercise induced pulmonary vasoconstriction may occur in 10 to 25 % of patients who survive correction of certain congenital cardiac defects.

40|$|SUMMARY To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} prostacyclin (prostaglandin 12) on pulmonary vascular tone in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), we performed right-heart catheterization on seven patients with PPH and made hemodynamic measurements before and after infusing incremental doses of prostacyclin. In maximal doses of 2 - 12 ng/kg/min (mean 5. 7 ± 3. 1 ng/kg/min), prostacyclin reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure from 62 ± 15 to 55 ± 16 mm Hg (p < 0. 05) and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> from 17. 1 8. 7 to 9. 7 + 5. 9 units (p < 0. 005), and increased cardiac output from 4. 22 ± 1. 64 to 6. 57 ± 2. 04 1 /min (p < 0. 01). Heart rate increased from 83 ± 13 to 94 ± 11 beats/min (p = 0. 1) and mean systemic arterial pressure decreased from 90 ± 12 to 77 ± 4 mm Hg (p = 0. 055). Three patients who received a continuous infusion of prostacyclin for 24 - 48 hours had sustained reductions in <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> during the infusion period. These data demonstrate that prostacyclin can increase cardiac output and reduce pulmo-nary arterial pressure and resistance in PPH. PRIMARY pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is charac-terized by extreme elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance, which ultimately result in right ventricu-lar failure and death. The cause of this disease i...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to determine the systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic effects of amrinone in infants and children with a cardiac left to right shunt {{to determine if there}} is a beneficial effect on the pathophysiology of this condition. Background. Amrinone is a bipyridine derivative with inotropic and vasodilator effects that have not been systematically evaluated in the pediatric patient with increased pulmonary blood flow. Methods. Nineteen patients (aged 2 months to 8. 3 years) with one or more left to right shunts were evaluated during cardiac catheterization with direct hemodynamic measurements made before and 10 min (peak effect) after administration of a bolus injection of amrinone, 3 mg/kg body weight. The Fick method was used to calculate pulmonary and systemic blood flow, and resistances were then calculated. Results. In group A, five patients with normal pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, amrinone significantly reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure by 19 %, mean left atrial pressure by 39 % and systemic vascular resistance by 17 %. In group B, seven patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mm Hg) and normal pulmonary vascular resistance (<b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> ≤ 3 Wood U-m 2), amrinone significantly reduced the pulmonary artery pressure by 27 %, systolic aortic pressure by 5 %, mean aortic pressure by 12 %, pulmonary arteriolar resistance by 36 % and total pulmonary vascular resistance by 26 %. In group C, seven patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mm Hg) and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (<b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> > 3 Wood U·m 2), amrinone significantly reduced the pulmonary arteriolar resistance by 49 %, <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> by 47 % and pulmonary arteriolar/systemic vascular resistance ratio by 45 % and increased the heart rate by 15 %. Conclusions. In children with a cardiac left to right shunt, amrinone 1) appears to have selective vasodilator effects depending on the pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, 2) has a beneficial hemodynamic effect in children with normal pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, and 3) may have a role in the treatment of patients with pulmonary artery hypertension without causing systemic hypotension...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—A portosystemic stent shunt may impair cardiac {{function}} and haemodynamics.  AIMS—To investigate {{the effects of}} a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) on cardiac {{function and}} pulmonary and systemic circulation in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.  PATIENTS/METHODS— 17 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and recent variceal bleeding were evaluated by echocardiography and catheterisation of the splanchnic and pulmonary circulation before and after TIPS. The period of catheter measurement was extended to nine hours in nine of the patients. The portal vein was investigated by Doppler ultrasound before and nine hours after TIPS.  RESULTS—Baseline echocardiography showed the left atrial diameter to be slightly increased and the left ventricular volume to be in the upper normal range. Nine hours after TIPS, the left atrial diameter and left ventricular end diastolic volume were increased (by 6 % (p< 0. 01) and 7 % (p< 0. 01) respectively); end systolic volume had not changed significantly. Invasive measurements showed a sharp increase in right atrial pressure (by 101 %; p< 0. 01), mean pulmonary artery pressure (by 92 %; p< 0. 01), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (by 111 %; p< 0. 01), and cardiac output (8. 1 (1. 6) to 11. 9 (2. 4) l/min; p< 0. 01). Systemic vascular resistance decreased (824 (242) to 600 (265) dyn·s·cm− 5 p< 0. 01), and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> increased (140 (58. 5) to 188 (69. 5) dyn·s·cm− 5; p< 0. 05). <b>Total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> (12 %; NS), cardiac output (1. 4 l/min; p< 0. 05), and portal vein blood flow (1. 4 l/min; p< 0. 05) remained elevated for nine hours after TIPS in the subgroup. Portoatrial pressure gradient (43 %; p< 0. 05), portohepatic vascular resistance (72 %; p< 0. 05), and systemic vascular resistance (27 %; p< 0. 01) were consistently reduced.  CONCLUSIONS—The increase in the left atrial diameter, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resistance</b> observed after the TIPS procedure reflected diastolic dysfunction of the hyperdynamic left ventricle in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The haemodynamic effects of the portosystemic stent shunt itself on the splanchnic circulation seem to be mainly responsible for the further decrease in systemic vascular resistance. TIPS may unmask a coexisting preclinical cardiomyopathy in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess whether}} long term {{treatment}} with epoprostenol might restore primary non-responsiveness to nitric oxide (NO) {{in patients with}} primary pulmonary hypertension.  METHODS—Seven patients with primary pulmonary hypertension receiving intravenous epoprostenol continuously because of failure of NO to influence pulmonary haemodynamics during initial testing were followed {{over a period of}} 13 - 29 months. Afterwards, acute vascular reactivity towards NO was tested again during right heart catheterisation.  RESULTS—Administration of NO after continuous epoprostenol treatment for a mean period of 18  months improved arterial oxygen saturation (p <  0. 01) and cardiac index (p <  0. 05), and decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure (p <  0. 01) and <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> (p <  0. 01) in patients previously unresponsive to NO.  CONCLUSIONS—Long term treatment with epoprostenol reverts initial refractoriness to NO in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Thus the addition of NO to epoprostenol treatment might cause further improvement {{in the course of the}} disease.    Keywords: primary pulmonary hypertension; epoprostenol; vascular reactivit...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{vascular}} {{input impedance}} {{was measured in}} adults with artial septal defect (ASD) to examine their pulmonary vessel lesions.

The pattern of pulmonary vascular input impedance did not differ between the ASD group and the normal control group. 2. An increase in pulmonary artery blood folw volume (a major sign of ASD) resulted in a decrease in Z 0 (the average of the pulsatile fraction of the pulmonary vascular input impedance), leading to suppressed elevation in the pulmonary artery pressure. 3. These features of pulmonary vascular input impedance remained unchanged when age advanced. Therefore, if Z 0 is higher than its expected from the pulmonary blood flow volume, some accompanying lesions other than ASD may be responsible for such a change...|$|R
40|$|Objective—To {{examine the}} {{pathophysiological}} significance of adrenomedullin in the pulmonary circulation by investigating {{the relation between}} plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin and central haemodynamics in patients with mitral stenosis.  Methods—Plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin in blood samples obtained from the femoral vein, pulmonary artery, left atrium, and aorta were measured by a newly developed specific radioimmunoassay in 23  consecutive patients with mitral stenosis (16  females and seven males, aged 53  (10) years (mean (SD)) who were undergoing percutaneous mitral commissurotomy.  Results—Patients with mitral stenosis had higher concentrations of adrenomedullin than age matched normal controls (3. 9  (0. 3) v 2. 5 (0. 3)  pmol/l, p <  0. 001). There was a reduction in adrenomedullin concentrations between the pulmonary artery and the left atrium (3. 8  (0. 2) v 3. 2  (0. 4)  pmol/l, p <  0. 001). The venous concentrations of adrenomedullin correlated with mean pulmonary artery pressure (r =  0. 65, p <  0. 001), <b>total</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> (r =  0. 83, p <  0. 0001), and <b>pulmonary</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> (r =  0. 65, p <  0. 001). Plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin did not change immediately after percutaneous mitral commissurotomy; however, they decreased significantly one week later.  Conclusions—Plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin are increased in patients with mitral stenosis. This may help to attenuate the increased <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>resistance</b> in secondary <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension due to mitral stenosis.    Keywords: adrenomedullin;  pulmonary hypertension;  mitral stenosis;  pulmonary circulatio...|$|R
