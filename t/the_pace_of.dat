5000|$|Ge Hong's (c. 320 CE) Daoist classic Baopuzi {{contains}} {{some of the}} earliest and most detailed descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paces</b> <b>of</b> Yu, in which [...] "each pace comprises three steps, and the movement thus appears like the waddle of a three-legged creature" [...] (Andersen 2008:237). <b>The</b> three <b>paces</b> <b>of</b> Yubu were associated with the performer's movement through the three levels of the cosmos, the Santai 三台 [...] "Three Steps; stars within Ursa Major" [...] (ι UMa through 61 UMa) in Chinese astronomy, and the Three Steps of Vishnu across earth, air, and heaven in the Rigveda.The fact that already in the early Han dynasty, the steps seem to have been connected with the three pairs of stars that are situated under the Northern Dipper and referred to as the Three Steps (santai 三台), or the Celestial Staircase (tianjie 天階), would seem to support this. It would appear, in other words, that even in this early period <b>the</b> <b>Paces</b> <b>of</b> Yu constituted a close parallel to the three Strides Viṣṇu in early Vedic mythology, which are thought to have taken the god through the three levels of the cosmos (thereby establishing the universe), and which indeed, just like <b>the</b> <b>Paces</b> <b>of</b> Yu in Taoist ritual, are known to have been imitated by Vedic priests as they approached the altar—and in the same form as <b>the</b> <b>Paces</b> <b>of</b> Yu, that is, dragging one foot after the other.
