Although he called AJ the [...] "family rebel", {{he said that the}} character is [...] "doing what he can to help out with the money problems [...] when <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> <b>tough,</b> AJ will step in to help his loved ones—and while he will probably never take the conventional route, he'll always get something sorted out in the end." [...] He gets a job, and then helps to lift the family's spirits by organising a fireworks display, on which Sharma said, [...] "AJ is just trying to help out his family in his own, dysfunctional way." [...] In November 2012, Zainab makes a promise never to interfere in people's lives, so AJ decides to use the opportunity to test her. Sharma explained: [...] "He is ready to test her promise to the limits! AJ knows exactly how to push all of Zainab's buttons, and now he's going {{to take full advantage of}} the fact that she won't let herself be the control freak she normally likes to be!" [...] Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror said AJ is [...] "thoroughly enjoying" [...] testing Zainab's new policy.|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> <b>tough,</b> and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E

Farmer and the club’s committee had an increasingly strained relationship, and Farmer quit in 1975. He returned to the WANFL, coaching East Perth from 1976 to 1977 with some success, and he coached the first Western Australian state of origin team in 1977. Farmer was sacked as coach of East Perth in 1977 due to conflict, and replaced by Barry Cable in 1978. Farmer said, “When <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> <b>tough</b> a club should stick together and fight to beat it.

40|$|Imagine {{surviving}} in {{an environment}} that is neither truly marine nor truly terrestrial. That area just beyond the low-water mark of neap tides along the seashore is an example of just such an environment. The organisms living here have to cope with the combined extremes of both land and sea environments: salt spray, immersion in salt water, emersion in air, drenching by heavy rainfall, heating by the sun, freezing winter temperatures, unstable substrates (such as sand, gravel or boulders), and exposure to strong winds. Just how do they cope? Animals generally find it easier coping in this harsh environment because among other ways, they can simply get up and move when <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> too <b>tough.</b> Plants (both terrestrial and marine) on the other hand, have to either tolerate, or succumb to it. The following is an account of some of the astonishing ways in which both plants and animals from a typical southwestern Cape shore have evolved to adapt and cope in the harsh environment of the intertidal zone.

And that, our guys had practiced that play a million times, and...did I dream that it would get to like the fifth - you know - thing that he had to look at? No. I thought that maybe Ben Hartsock would be open; I was wrong. I thought the backs might get open for a checkdown; I was wrong. Chris Gamble ran the wrong route...he was even...Craig Krenzelwas looking over for him - Chris was like over on the Purdue bench. And so, Craig had one choice. I'm sure he was telling you what I was thinking, you know I'm sure he was thinking four-letter words about 'I can't believe they called this play {{that was going to be}} so covered'. But he had one last thing he had to look at, and as you guys all know, that the number one attribute of a good quarterback is that they make great decisions. And no one made decisions better in my 38 years of coaching quarterbacks than Craig Krenzel, and he made the right decision and threw it up there. What I was thinking was, 'I hope he didn't overthrow it'. Jim Tressel, ten years later, when asked about the play ...|$|R
