500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Gates said: [...] "I agree {{with people like}} Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for {{creation}} myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled {{in some of the}} realm– not all– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [...] I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Bruckheimer {{said the}} {{decision}} to film in 3D was made due to its being [...] "immersive filmmaking; I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> you part of the actual filming because you're part of the screen." [...] Bruckheimer described it as the first major [...] "exterior movie" [...] to be shot in 3D, as Avatar was mostly done in sound stages. At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format. [...] "You are on an adventure and with the 3D experience you are inside that adventure." [...] While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post-production, {{the decision was made}} to shoot digitally with 3D cameras. Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion. The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for Avatar, which were made more compact for extra mobility. This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.|$|E
500|$|Astrophysicist Adam Frank {{served as}} a {{scientific}} consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood. Frank advised on [...] "the human experience of space and time", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or [...] "had this enlarged perspective." [...] He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate [...] "amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities—people are used to that in their lives. So I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense to them, and it's exciting to them". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a [...] "great thing ... speaking as a scientist", saying that [...] "they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them." ...|$|E

500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the {{character}} would reach a [...] "total mental breakdown", which would {{take her to the}} edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is [...] "physical, professional and emotional". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly {{for the rest of her}} life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharon’s past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision because I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the most sense considering her history." [...] The actress in addition was pleased that she didn't have to continue justifying Sharon's questionable actions.|$|E
500|$|Monday 10 May {{saw another}} day of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but at a meeting with his MPs, Nick Clegg was urged to give assurances over offers which were being made by David Cameron's team. They also wished him to {{continue}} negotiations with Labour. During the day it emerged that senior Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives had held discussions about forming a coalition, but {{that one of the}} barriers to this was the continued presence of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister. At 5.00pm that afternoon Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September. In a statement he said that he intended to [...] "sk the Labour Party to set in train the processes needed for its own leadership election." [...] The statement went on to say, [...] "I would hope that it would be completed in time for the new leader to be in post {{by the time of the}} Labour Party conference. I will play no part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate." [...] He also urged any prospective candidates for the position to wait until coalition negotiations were complete before announcing their candidacy. Following this announcement, formal talks began between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but many in the Party felt that a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition was an unrealistic prospect since it would still fall short of the 326 seats needed to form a majority government, with 315 seats to the Conservatives' 306. Labour MP Graham Stringer said, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense in the arithmetic–the numbers don't add up." [...] However, in his account of Labour's negotiations with the Liberal Democrats, Andrew Adonis – who participated in the talks – writes that the general consensus among members of Gordon Brown's cabinet was that talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would reach an impasse. [...] " [...] process would turn to our favour once the Tories and Lib Dems had rehearsed the extent of their differences".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Richard Lindzen, {{asked whether}} it was {{necessary}} to try to reduce [...] emissions, said that responses needed to be prioritised. [...] "You can't just say, 'No matter what the cost, and no matter how little the benefit, we'll do this'. If we truly believe in warming, then we've already decided we're going to adjust...The reason we adjust to things far better than Bangladesh is that we're richer. Wouldn't you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense to make sure we're as robust and wealthy as possible? And that the poor of the world are also as robust and wealthy as possible?" ...|$|E

"I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will <b>make</b> much {{difference}} because {{the situation has}} deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that very drastic measures have to be taken to confront the militias and restore law and order", said Adnan Pachachi. [...] "Of course, he has some supporters in Iraq—some of them are armed and they may commit acts of violence and so on—but I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will <b>make</b> {{much difference}}, frankly." ...|$|R

2500|$|At a later {{point in}} the season, Lisa Todorovich of Zap2it chastised Naomi for being [...] "all about herself" [...] while failing to support Liam during a series of troubles. While {{acknowledging}} Naomi's faults, which eventually lead to a break-up with Liam, Krista Navin of MassLive.com stated that [...] "it is totally consistent with her character that she would {{want to try to}} be there for Liam, but just be too into her own drama to really be able to be. Also, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense that someone like Liam would think he would want to be with someone like Naomi, and then be pretty disillusioned by the reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Lim of The New York Times {{stressed}} that [...] "there {{is virtually no}} music on the soundtrack of this tense, methodical thriller. Long passages are entirely wordless. In {{some of the most}} gripping sequences what you hear mostly is a suffocating silence." [...] Skip Lievsay, the film's sound editor called this approach [...] "quite a remarkable experiment," [...] and added that [...] "suspense thrillers in Hollywood are traditionally done almost entirely with music. The idea here was to remove the safety net that lets the audience feel like they know what's going to happen. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the movie much more suspenseful. You're not guided by the score and so you lose that comfort zone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hansis and Silbermann cited their offscreen {{friendship}} as {{the reason}} for their ease when portraying intimate scenes between Luke and Noah. [...] "It makes them easier. Jake is a good friend. I know he's got my back and {{is not going to make}} me look like an ass onscreen. I hope I return the favor," [...] said Hansis. [...] "I think we work well together and I couldn't have asked for a cooler person to play opposite. Jake is just very down to earth and funny and open to different ideas. It makes every scene very comfortable." [...] Silbermann added, [...] "I think we had become friends before the first kiss... If anything, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> it more comfortable." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Royal Coachman {{was first}} made by John Haily a {{professional}} fly dresser living in New York City. In writing of other matters, he enclosed this fly {{for us to}} see, saying [...] "A gentleman wanted me to tie up some Coachman {{for him to take}} to the north woods and to make them extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out. I have also added a tail of the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> a very handsome fly." [...] A few evenings later, a circle of us were together [...] "disputing the fly in question", one of the party claiming that numbers were [...] "quite as suitable to designate the flies as so many nonsensical names". The others did not agree with him, but he said: [...] "What can you do? Here is a fly intended to be a Coachman; {{but it is not the}} true Coachman; it is quite unlike it and what can you call it?" [...] Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was present said: [...] "Oh that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman it is so finely dressed!" [...] And this name in time came to be known and used by all who are familiar with the fly.|$|E
