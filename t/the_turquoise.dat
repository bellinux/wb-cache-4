5|$|Found in grasslands {{and open}} {{woodlands}} dominated by Eucalyptus and Callitris trees, <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot feeds mainly on grasses and seeds and occasionally flowers, fruit and scale insects. It nests in hollows of gum trees. Much of its habitat has been altered and potential nesting sites lost. Predominantly sedentary, <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot can be locally nomadic. Populations {{appear to be}} recovering from a crash in the early 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot has been kept in captivity since the 19th century, and several colour variants exist.|$|E
5|$|M. s. musgravei was {{described}} in 1922 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews as a separate species from the Lake Eyre Basin in central Australia. It is found in mulga and mallee country across much of South Australia and the southern Northern Territory. It has lighter blue or turquoise upperparts than the splendid fairywren, {{as well as a}} black rump. This is largely synonymous with what was known as M. callainus or <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> fairywren which had been collected by ornithologist Samuel White and named by John Gould in 1867. The original collection bearing the name callainus was deemed a hybrid between what is now called musgravei and melanotus, and hence musgravei was resurrected as the name for <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> fairywren.|$|E
5|$|The English {{common name}} of <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot has varied between chestnut-shouldered parakeet, chestnut-shouldered grass-parakeet, chestnut-shouldered grass-parrot, chestnut-winged grass-parakeet, chestnut-winged grass-parrot, and turquoisine grass parrot, this last name {{commonly}} used in aviculture. The name red-shouldered parakeet was incorrectly applied to this species, as it was an alternative name for the paradise parrot.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot is {{considered}} sedentary {{and does not}} migrate, though its movements are not well known. Birds are present in some areas all year, though in northern Victoria they are thought to move into more open areas outside the breeding season. Some populations may be locally nomadic, following availability of water.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{named for}} Ridgway include the buff-collared nightjar, Caprimulgus ridgwayi (once known as Ridgway's whip-poor-will); <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> cotinga, Cotinga ridgwayi; the Caribbean {{subspecies}} of the osprey, Pandion haliaetus ridgwayi; a Big Island subspecies of the elepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis ridgwayi; Ridgway's hawk, Buteo ridgwayi; {{and many other}} species and subspecies. The monotypic genus Ridgwayia is named for him; it consists of Aztec thrush, R. pinicola.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} antigenic similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot {{and members of the}} genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease. Like other members of the genus, <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot is highly sensitive to avian paramyxovirus infection. It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot {{was once}} common across the Sydney region, and {{particularly}} abundant between the localities of Parramatta and Penrith. It dramatically declined in numbers between 1875 and 1895, although rare sightings in western Sydney and the Blue Mountains {{were recorded in}} the mid-twentieth century. <b>The</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot was trapped for the aviary trade and used as pie-filling. Almost all of its preferred habitat, the Cumberland Plain, across western Sydney, had disappeared with development. Over half the woodland in New South Wales, and 80% across Australia has been cleared, and the remaining habitat is fragmented. A key issue is removal of mature eucalypts with resulting loss of hollows available for nesting. The species is thus listed as a Vulnerable species under Schedule 2 of the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 because of habitat destruction (TSC Act). Fire-burning regimes may be resulting in the regeneration favouring shrubs rather than grasses, which are the preferred food source for the species. Feral cats and foxes are a threat, particularly to nesting birds and young.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise {{was very}} {{important}} to the people of Chaco. Around 200,000 pieces of turquoise have been excavated from the ruins at Chaco Canyon, and workshops for local manufacture of turquoise beads have been found. <b>The</b> <b>turquoise</b> was used locally for grave goods, burials and ceremonial offerings. Over 15,000 turquoise beads and pendants accompanied two burials at Pueblo Bonito.|$|E

5|$|The splendid fairywren {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the arid and semi-arid zones of Australia. Habitat is typically dry and shrubby; mulga and mallee in drier {{parts of the country}} and forested areas in the southwest. The western subspecies splendens and eastern black-backed fairywren (subspecies melanotus) are largely sedentary, although <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> fairywren (subspecies musgravei) is thought to be partially nomadic. Unlike the eastern superb fairywren, the splendid fairywren has not adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas. Forestry plantations of pine (Pinus spp.) and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.|$|E
5|$|Around 90% of <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot {{population}} {{resides in}} New South Wales. The species is not listed as threatened on the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, though a status of near threatened was proposed by Stephen Garnett and Gabriel Crowley in their 2000 work The Action Plan for Australian Birds {{on account of}} the significant reduction in distribution. Its population and range have varied wildly; widely distributed across eastern Australia from Mackay to Melbourne up to the 1880s, it vanished from much of its range {{to the extent that it}} was presumed extinct in 1915. It was not recorded from Queensland between 1923 and 1950, and Victoria between the mid-1880s and 1949. However, numbers in New South Wales began increasing in the 1930s and the species had repopulated East Gippsland by the 1960s. Tentatively estimated at 20,000 breeding birds in 2000, the population is thought to be still rising.|$|E
5|$|Grass and shrub seeds {{form the}} bulk of the diet, and leaves, flowers, fruit and scale insects are also eaten. <b>The</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot has been {{recorded}} feeding on seeds of various plant species; more commonly consumed items include the fruit of common fringe-myrtle (Calytrix tetragona), seeds and fruit of erect guinea-flower (Hibbertia riparia), daphne heath (Brachyloma daphnoides), seeds of common raspwort (Gonocarpus tetragynus), Geranium species, black-anther flax-lily (Dianella revoluta) and grass species such as the introduced big quaking grass (Briza maxima) and little quaking grass (B. minor) and members of the genus Danthonia, members of the pea genus Dillwynia, and small-leaved beard-heath (Leucopogon microphyllus). Seed of the introduced common chickweed (Stellaria media) and capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) are also consumed. Nectar of Grevillea alpina, and spores from moss have been recorded as food items.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} {{infertile}} eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E
5|$|Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori {{defined the}} new genus Neophema in 1891, placing <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot within it {{and giving it}} its current {{scientific}} name. There is little geographical variation, with some minor local differences {{in the amount of}} orange on the belly. In 1915, Gregory Mathews described a subspecies dombrainii from Victoria on the basis of more prominent red on the scapulars; however, this distinction was not confirmed on review with New South Wales specimens, and hence no subspecies are recognised. One of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema, it is most closely related to the scarlet-chested parrot. The two are an allopatric species pair, and are the only two species in the genus to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism—where the male and female are different in appearance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot is a {{predominantly}} ground-based seed eater, foraging in clearings in open woodland, forest margins, and near trees in more open {{areas such as}} pastures. It occasionally feeds along road verges and rarely ventures onto lawns. Birds forage in pairs or small troops of up to thirty or even fifty individuals. Observations at Chiltern in Victoria indicated seasonal variation in flock size, with turquoise parrots foraging in groups of 5–30 in winter and 6–8 in spring and summer. Foraging takes place from {{early in the morning}} till late afternoon, with a break between midday and mid-afternoon. Birds prefer to feed in shaded areas, where they are better camouflaged in the grass.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot {{is found}} {{in the foothills of the}} Great Dividing Range and {{surrounding}} areas. The northern limit of its range is 26° south in southeastern Queensland, around Cooloola, Blackbutt and Chinchilla, extending westwards to the vicinity of St George. Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the Suttor River and Mackay. In New South Wales, it {{is found in}} a broad band across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by Moree, Quambone, Hillston, Narrandera and Deniliquin. There have been unconfirmed sightings in the far west of the state. In Victoria it {{is found in the}} vicinity of Wangaratta as well as East Gippsland and around Mallacoota. Sightings in South Australia are likely to have been the scarlet-chested parrot, the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise parrots roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of <b>the</b> <b>turquoise</b> parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.|$|E
