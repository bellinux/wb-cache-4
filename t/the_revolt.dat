5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> and raids were {{occurring}} in Campania, {{which was a}} vacation region {{of the rich and}} influential in Rome, and the location of many estates, <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> quickly {{came to the attention of}} Roman authorities.

5|$|During {{the early}} phases of <b>the</b> <b>revolt,</b> many land (timar) holders {{were killed or}} expelled. As it spread, the nobles, whose {{holdings}} had been annexed by the Ottomans returned to join <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> and attempts to form alliances with the Holy Roman Empire were initiated. While the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> were successful in defeating successive Ottoman campaigns, they failed to capture many important towns of the sanjak of Albania. Protracted sieges like that of Gjirokastër, capital of the sanjak, gave the Ottoman army time to assemble large forces {{from other parts of}} the empire and to subdue the main revolt by the end of 1436. Ottoman forces conducted a number of massacres in the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>revolt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{became a}} popular {{literary}} subject. The poet John Gower, who had {{close ties to}} officials involved in the suppression of <b>the</b> <b>revolt,</b> amended his famous poem Vox Clamantis after <b>the</b> <b>revolt,</b> inserting a section condemning the rebels and likening them to wild animals. Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in Aldgate {{and may have been}} in London during <b>the</b> <b>revolt,</b> used the rebel killing of Flemings as a metaphor for wider disorder in The Nun's Priest's Tale part of The Canterbury Tales, parodying Gower's poem. Chaucer otherwise made no reference to <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> in his work, possibly because as he was a client of the King it would have been politically unwise to discuss it. William Langland, the author of the poem Piers Plowman, which had been widely used by the rebels, made various changes to its text after <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> in order to distance himself from their cause.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} al-Birwa's {{inhabitants}} {{participated in the}} 1936–1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine. A commander of <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> for the Nazareth-Tiberias region, Sheikh Yihya Hawash, was from al-Birwa. He was arrested by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment. The British also executed eight residents of al-Birwa {{who had participated in}} <b>the</b> <b>revolt.</b> Other rebel commanders and participants in <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> from al-Birwa included Asad Atallah, Mahmoud al-Joudi, Saleh Mahmoud Me'ari-Abu Sa'ud, Abd al-Hamid Daher Me'ari, Muhammad al-Hajj Ali, Yusef Taha, Fadil Eid, Yousif Mai and Abbas al-Shattawi. A number of women from al-Birwa participated in <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> by transporting arms, water and food to rebels positioned among the hills in the vicinity. Elderly refugees from al-Birwa interviewed in 2003–2004 recalled that during <b>the</b> <b>revolt,</b> local rebels set off a mine that hit a British military jeep on a road adjacent to al-Birwa in August 1937, prompting the British to launch punitive measures against the village. In particular, the British authorities gathered men from al-Birwa and forced them to cut cactus plants near Acre and then placed the men on top of the cactuses.|$|E
5|$|After William's {{death in}} 1164, Hugh passed into royal service, while also serving as seneschal {{to the new}} Earl of Surrey, Hamelin, the illegitimate {{half-brother}} of King Henry II. On the Cartae Baronum in 1166 he held one knight's fee in the barony of Giffard. In 1167 Hugh paid a fine that is recorded in the pipe rolls for the custody of his nephew's lands at Tickhill. In 1170, he {{was present at the}} coronation of Henry the Young King in June at Westminster Abbey, when Henry II had his heir crowned as a king during the elder Henry's lifetime. During <b>the</b> <b>Revolt</b> of 1173–74 by King Henry's sons, Hugh was a partisan of the king. <b>The</b> <b>revolt</b> was brought about by the desire of Henry's three oldest sons to gain some power during Henry's reign, and by mid 1174 <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> had been defeated by the king. During <b>the</b> <b>Revolt,</b> Hugh fought at the Battle of Fornham near Fornham St Martin in Suffolk, a victory for royalist forces, but otherwise took little part in the revolt's suppression.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} a surge in {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of <b>the</b> <b>revolt.</b> By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. Réville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of <b>the</b> <b>revolt,</b> using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E

5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. <b>The</b> <b>revolt</b> had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> many {{attempts}} were made to form an anti-Ottoman coalition including the Holy Roman Empire. Pope Eugene IV requested troops to be sent to assist <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> and tried to gather funds. In 1435, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg sent Fruzhin, a Bulgarian nobleman, and in early 1436 Daud, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, to negotiate the possibility of a coalition with the rebels. However, by mid-1436 a large force under Turahan Bey had been assembled. Despite the military victories the rebel leaders acted autonomously without a central leadership, the lack of which contributed greatly to their final defeat. Turahan's forces eventually subdued <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> and marched through Albania, committing widespread massacres of civilians.|$|E
5|$|Four {{centuries of}} {{stagnation}} during Ottoman rule {{came to an}} end during World War I by the 1916 Arab Revolt; driven by long-term Arab resentment towards the Ottoman authorities, and growing Arab nationalism. <b>The</b> <b>revolt</b> was launched by Sharif Hussein of Mecca, a member of the Hashemite clan of Hejaz who claim descent from Muhammad. Locally, <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> garnered the support of the Transjordanian Bedouin tribes, Circassians and Christians. The Allies of World WarI, including Britain and France, offered support.|$|E

5|$|Hananu's {{subordinate}} {{officers and}} rank-and-file fighters were all Sunni Muslims, but were ethnically heterogeneous.

Despite the eventual organization of <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions, most political decisions and military operations were local initiatives. As such, al-Sa'dun referred to <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> in the plural as thawrat al-Shimal (Northern revolts) rather than the singular thawra, and referred to the leadership of <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> as the plural quwwad al-thawra rather than qiyadat al-thawra, which refers to a central command.|$|E

5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{has been}} widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from {{contemporary}} chroniclers to assemble {{an account of the}} uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> have shifted over the years. It was once seen as a defining moment in English history, but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. <b>The</b> <b>revolt</b> heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. <b>The</b> <b>revolt</b> {{has been widely}} used in socialist literature, including by the author William Morris, and remains a potent political symbol for the political left, informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The next {{rebellion}} against royal power in Transylvania {{broke out in}} 1467.

5|$|The vast {{majority}} {{of those involved in}} <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> of 1381 were not represented in Parliament and were excluded from its decision-making.

Clergy also formed part of the revolt; as well as the more prominent leaders, such as John Ball or John Wrawe, nearly 20 are mentioned in the records of <b>the</b> <b>revolt</b> in the south-east.

5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S.

Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute the Palestinian people. <b>The</b> <b>revolt</b> represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship {{between the government and the}} governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
