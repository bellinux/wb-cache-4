40|$|Abstract. The {{strength}} of a welded truss type fuselage of a light aircraft – named SAFAT 01 – is considered in this paper. The aircraft is a monoplane with high strut-braced wings configuration with flaps. The fuselage is of welded <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> fabric-covered <b>construction.</b> According to its production contract; the aircraft is fully produced and assembled in Sudan whereas the documentation is limited to technical side only with no information available about design procedures and calculations. This {{makes it difficult to}} further modify or upgrade the aircraft. The fuselage geometry has been modeled using a CAD program. The main dimensions have been obtained using 2 -D drawings and the missing dimensions and data due to lack of documents were extracted experimentally from a built aircraft. Aerodynamic loads were determined using computational fluid dynamic program for the horizontal tail. Static structural analysis was conducted by finite element method (FEM) using fastened connection property between the tubes. The results were observed in three main parts; rear part which supports the vertical and horizontal stabilizers and the rear landing gear; the mid part which provides cantilever reaction for the wing and supports front landing gear, and the front part on which the engine is mounted. The Von Mises stresses, displacements and principal stresses were observed in the three parts and found acceptable except for a small region near the attachment between wing and fuselage. However, further experimental validation is needed. Presently, experimental and dynamic analyses are being conducted and the results will be published later...|$|R
40|$|EN) Audio Topography: The {{interaction}} of sound, space and medium Esther Venrooij Supervisor: Mark Delaere Co-supervisor: Sven Sterken In this PhD, I {{have tried to}} elucidate my position as an artist working with sound, among other materials. This first {{led me to the}} history of sound art and the construction of a sound work. What is sound? What is music? What is the difference between music and sound? In the twentieth century, these questions were further complicated by scientific and technological advances in sampling, processing, the synthesis of sounds and their precise distribution in space. Artists began to explore the architectural, spatial and physical qualities of sound, creating works which consisted predominantly or exclusively of sound. A new artistic discipline – sound art – arose, with a lesser focus on the organisation of time and a greater focus on the physical and spatial phenomenon of sound. Sound art interacts with the architectural environment {{in the sense that the}} topology of a building acts as a visual and aural cue for sound artists. To further answer the question of what form sound art may take, I established four categories of sound works that deal differently with the relationship between sound and architecture. Building on this theoretical framework, I have looked into the fields that define a sound work: ‘sound’ and ‘space’, but also ‘medium’. John Cage made me realise that new technologies change our perception of nature. Therefore, in a sound piece, sound and space always interact with the specificities of a medium. In his four-part lecture Where are we going? And what are we doing?, John Cage reflects on the different ways of looking and listening, asking the question: ‘is man in control of nature or is he, as part of it, going along with it?’. In the introduction of this performance-lecture, Cage pointed out that scientific advances not only changed the tools of the artist, but also gave them new understandings of how nature works. For me, the analysis of sound means describing and cataloguing its associated phenomena and occurrences without giving an explanation, resulting in an ‘audio topography’. In my work it has been my intention to not only study and map auditory environments, but to create sound works that were composed of audio topographies – multi-dimensional sound works, in which sounds are distributed in space via multiple sources. And by studying the visual and acoustical characteristics of spaces, to create virtual sound environments which address our sensory system. Grounded in the phenomenological conceptions of sound and space, the main question of this research project is: ‘How to (re) construct space with sound?’ This question is divided into three sets of sub-questions. 1. (Re) constructing through creation Can a series of loudspeakers distributing sounds in a space together create a ‘sound space’? And is it possible to reconstruct or ‘translate’ a space by capturing space and the environmental sounds of a place? Is it possible to reconstruct a space only by means of acoustic interventions, without the use of loudspeakers or sound sources? Is it possible to create a space that ‘produces’ a particular sound? Can a space capture, filter or even modulate its environmental sounds? 2. (Re) constructing through perception Are sounds equal to their sources? Are they only in our head, or somewhere between ourselves and the source? How will I use this knowledge of auditory perception in creating new sound works? And in what way will these questions be part of my artistic practice? 3. (Re) constructing through recording. Would it be possible to preserve the spatiality of sound in a recording? Is it possible to translate a sound image to another medium, for example a drawing, text, or audio file? How can this artistic research be communicated in an interdisciplinary artistic and research community? Method This PhD project is based on experimental, technologically-orientated artistic research, with a broad survey of the history of acoustics, sound art and musicological literature supplemented with conversations with sound artists. The research was divided into separate parts: art-historical research, sound experiments, sound works and expert meetings. The creation of the sound works was a merging of theory and practice, following a similar pattern of creation: - Reading the space - Designing for the space - Creating the sound - Setting up the installation An overview of the sound installations and works created as part of research Transfiguration of Steel Three transducers, wooden panels and beams in collaboration with Hans Demeulenaere Ateliers Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany (21 November 2009 – 21 January 2010) I created the audiovisual installation Transfiguration of Steel during a three-month residency at Ateliers Frankfurt between November 2009 and January 2010. The work was created in collaboration with Hans Demeulenaere and was inspired by the IG Farben Building (or Poelzig Building) at Goethe University Frankfurt. I became fascinated by the immense reverberation in the cafeteria, formerly IG Farben’s exhibition hall. Field recordings made in the cafeteria of the IG Farben Building are mixed with electronic tones and noises generated by computer, which result in a sound work with inner complexity and constantly changing patterns. The title refers to the <b>tubular</b> <b>steel</b> <b>construction</b> technique first pioneered in this building. Shifting Grounds Ground floor: a subwoofer, eight bass shakers, wooden panels and construction. First floor: eight transducers, wooden panels and beams. Second floor: one tweeter from loudspeaker and wooden beams. in collaboration with Hans Demeulenaere Broeltoren, Kortrijk, Belgium (May 2010) Shifting Grounds was another collaboration with Hans Demeulenaere. On three floors of the building, specific architectural and acoustic elements were reinterpreted, reconstructed and transposed to a spatial audio-visual installation. The wooden construction designed by Demeulenaere was based on the shape of the arched wooden ceiling. The sound of the installation was based on a recording by a gamelan orchestra. A specific sound image was created on each floor, starting from the recording and using the acoustics and shape of the space. For example, on the top floor a tweeter from a loudspeaker was placed in the centre of the space, projecting only the highest frequencies of the recording towards the ceiling. The conical shape of the roof was used to distribute the sound evenly in space. And a Heavy Blue Silence Fell Klunk Eight transducers mounted on an elevator shaft. Intervention at The Anarchy of Silence – John Cage and Experimental Art. Eight transducers were placed on the glass panels of the elevator shaft. The sounds were based on Solo for Voice 22 and Solo for Voice 79 by John Cage. Schunck, Heerlen, the Netherlands (November 2010) I presented this sonic intervention for the exhibition The Anarchy of Silence – John Cage and Experimental Art at the Schunck art centre in Heerlen. Eight transducers were placed on the glass panels of the elevator shaft. Breathing and throat sounds – taken from Solo for Voice 22 and Solo for Voice 79 by John Cage – filled the staircase of the art centre. Not Here … You Can Look Any Place Eight transducers placed on wooden panels and beams in collaboration with Hans Demeulenaere Lokaal 01, Antwerp, Belgium (November 2011) The sound and shape of this audiovisual installation, made in collaboration with Hans Demeulenaere, emerged from a conceptual process. The residency gave us an opportunity to go a little deeper into our process of working. Over the course of three weeks, we analysed the architectural and acoustic qualities of the residency space, then transposing and reconstructing these to fit the exhibition space. A Shadow of a Wall Eight transducers mounted on an elevated floor, four bipolar loudspeakers in collaboration with Ema Bonifacic. Intro / In Situ,Maastricht, the Netherlands (December - January 2011) Budatoren, Festival of Flanders, Kortrijk, Belgium (May 2011) 58 Miera Iel, Riga, Latvia (October - November 2011) Bunkier Sztuki, Krakow, Poland (November - December 2011) In collaboration with architect Ema Bonifacic, I designed a sonic-architectural intervention for four different buildings in Europe. My intention was to create an installation with panels that resonated sounds, intervening in the space without being specifically about the space. In this work, I was looking for a relationship between the composed sound, wooden construction, room and environmental sounds. Time Three Point Five Two transducers, three loudspeakers, a bass guitar and amplifier, two PZM microphones and a tone generator with a prime number tuning system in collaboration with Kato Hideki Diapason Gallery, New York, USA (April - May 2011) After a short residency in Diapason Gallery in New York, I presented an ‘active installation’ in collaboration with Kato Hideki. The term ‘active installation coined by Hideki, describes a spatial installation which remains in place, but allows interventions by the artists in which linear and nonlinear time structures can be explored. Refrakt Four loudspeakers, two transducers, three bass shakers and alucobond (mirror) panels in collaboration with Olivier Goethals Concertgebouw Brugge, Belgium (since September 2011) In 2011, Concertgebouw Brugge invited me to create an audiovisual installation in the stairwell of the Lantaarn tower as part of the project The Sound Factory. In collaboration with architect Olivier Goethals, an associate of the firm De Vylder, I wanted to establish a new ‘reading’ of the continuous flow of stairs and landings. By listening to the space, its aftersounds, reverberation and echo, we became aware of the spatial contrasts and different auditory qualities. By using mirrors, loudspeakers, transducers and bass shakers, we wanted to create a new auditory experience of the space. After Image Three bipolar speakers, one transducer integrated in a wooden construction in collaboration with Hans Demeulenaere for solo exhibition And a lot of reflection… Annie Gentils Gallery, Antwerp, Belgium (1 February - 9 March 2013) In this collaboration with Hans Demeulenaere, I created a group of sound sculptures. These sculptures follow in the tradition of the ‘expanded concept of sculpture’, where sound is not only directed towards our senses, but also to its spatial ‘response’. Sounds are treated as objects, placed in relation to each other and the space. Each loudspeaker (bipolar and transducer) has its own specific character, which I create using recordings of ‘noise’: air conditioning, elevator, rustling leaves and electronic noise. Of Course Static and Moving Are Possible Table, drawings, desk light, two transducers, two bipolar speakers and two amplifiers in STEIM Amsterdam, the Netherlands (May 2013) in Kunstliefde Utrecht, the Netherlands (August-September 2013) for The Big Draw in SMAK, Ghent, Belgium (4 October 2013) For this work I used the sounds of satellites, a recording made in a forest in Morocco, a guqin player and electronically generated sounds. The drawings are an exploration of sound and the space in question. Of Course Static and Moving Are Possible is a site-specific adaptation of a composition, originally created for the GRM Acousmonium as part of a research project in collaboration with Onderzoeksfonds Sint-Lucas Gent and Concertgebouw Brugge. Shift Coordinate Points 4 horn speakers, 4 Mayer loudspeakers, a wall drawing and spotlight Installation for the exhibition Power Tracks, part of Electron Festival at the Centre d'Art Contemporain in Geneva. (21 March - 20 April 2014) Static. Seven short electric pulses. Then – out of thin air – a woman's voice commences speaking: ‘Eins, zwo, fünf [...] . eins, zwo, fünf … drei, vier, fünf [...] . ’. The incessant stream of numbers is sporadically interrupted by a metallic melody. After 45 minutes, the transmission ends as abruptly as it started and dissolves into the short-wave static. To whom belong these voices, tirelessly reciting these seemingly random series of numbers and words? And for whose ears are these cryptic messages intended? The messages are irreversibly encrypted, their contents unintelligible to anyone but the corresponding receiver. Radio amateurs and fanatics who have been monitoring the phenomenon for many years are convinced that the stations are operated by intelligence and secret services worldwide, as a means of dispatching coordinates and assignments to their operatives abroad. In 1997, British maverick label Irdial-Discs released a selection of numbers stations recordings under the title The Conet Project. The collection plays like a ‘best-of’ compilation of 30 years’ worth of secret radio and contains fragments of American, German, Swedish and Russian transmissions. I was given permission to work with the material and created a highly personal interpretation of the medium’s secret history. The project resulted in an electronic composition, which was released on vinyl at the British label Entr'acte. I was invited by curator Vincent de Roguin and Jérôme Massard to create a reinterpretation of the electronic composition for the exhibition Power Tracks Vol. 1. Using manipulated sound and collage techniques and fascinated by the physical and spatial qualities of sound, I tried to distil an abstract poetry of sounds and extract some meaning out of these hermetic transmissions. status: publishe...|$|E
