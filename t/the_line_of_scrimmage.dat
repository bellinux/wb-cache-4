5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired {{at the end of a}} quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E
5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> but had hoped that the officials would miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Hoosiers' {{defense had}} some success {{stopping}} Tech behind <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> accumulating seven tackles for loss {{during the course of}} the game. Indiana cornerback Mose Richardson had nine tackles and one interception, leading the Hoosiers in tackles, and teammate Chris Dyer came in second for IU with seven.|$|E
5000|$|Offenses and {{defenses}} {{continued to}} adapt to the increases in forward passing favored by the rules. Below is diagrammed a 3-4-4 (or simply [...] "3-4") defensive formation and an offensive formation it might line up against across <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> as popular beginning in later portions of the 20th century: ...|$|R
50|$|Unsuccessful {{field goals}} are {{returned}} to <b>the</b> previous <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> Previously they were placed at <b>the</b> 20-yard <b>line.</b>|$|R
25|$|Allowing the {{receiving}} team {{the option to}} enforce encroachment penalties on punts/kickoffs either {{from the end of}} the return or from <b>the</b> previous <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> requiring a re-kick.|$|R
5|$|The umpire is {{positioned}} in the defensive backfield, {{except in the}} NFL, where he {{is positioned}} lateral to the referee {{on the opposite side}} of the formation. He watches play along <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.|$|E
5|$|The head {{linesman}} {{is positioned}} {{on one end}} of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> He watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on his side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide receivers line up {{on or near}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the power}} I formation, {{instead of the}} wingback shown above, there is another deep back in the {{traditional}} halfback position. That position in the power I is probably called [...] "halfback" [...] {{more than any other}} name. In the triple I, where all the backs are in one <b>line</b> perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> one could hope for the backs to be called quarter-, half-, full-, and tailback in order of depth, but various names are probably used.|$|R
50|$|After {{a fourth}} down {{incomplete}} pass goes in {{or through the}} end zone, the other team will take possession at <b>the</b> previous <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> Previously, it resulted in a touchback.|$|R

5|$|There are two {{categories}} of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> and free kicks. The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts {{the first and third}} quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, and the safety kick, which follows a safety.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Chris Turner hit Darrius Heyward-Bey {{for a short}} bubble screen pass behind <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> and Heyward-Bey ran it 63yards for the score. During the next series, the Terrapins were held three-and-out, but the punt was fumbled and {{recovered}} by Maryland on the Hokies 11-yard line. However, the Terrapins were again forced {{to settle for a}} field goal, which made it a one-possession lead for VT at 20–13with 2:29left in the third quarter. In the final quarter, the Hokies managed another field goal and held onto the lead for a final result of 23–13.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Jones {{developed}} into a star flanker, a position he helped invent. He was both a running threat and a receiver – his tall stature was well-suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns' two main ends, Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Jones often went in motion behind <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> before the snap {{at a time when}} few players did so, causing confusion and mismatches on defense. He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949, when the Browns won another AAFC championship.|$|E
5000|$|A forward pass {{goes out}} of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an {{incomplete}} pass. The ball is returned to <b>the</b> original <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> for <b>the</b> next down.|$|R
50|$|After {{a typical}} play, the box man {{increments}} the displayed number and realigns that pole to <b>the</b> new <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> again as {{directed by the}} linesman. After a play that results in a first down, all three members move and reset their signals to mark {{a new series of}} downs.|$|R
50|$|Adding 10 {{yards to}} an illegal punt that {{goes out of}} bounds. If a punt goes out of bounds in the air (i.e. without bouncing) between <b>the</b> 20-yard <b>lines,</b> <b>the</b> {{receiving}} team will {{have the option of}} taking the ball where it went out of bounds plus 10 yards or have the kicking team re-kick 10 yards further back from <b>the</b> original <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{first play}} of the {{possession}} resulted in a five-yard penalty against Tech. The second play resulted in the initial first down of the game as Brown completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Adams. After the first down, Williams picked up two yards on a running play, but Texas lost that short gain when Brown fumbled the ball during the next play. Brown lost seven yards, but recovered the ball. On third down, Brown attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped short of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> Texas' punt was fair caught at the 29-yard line, and Virginia Tech began its second possession.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 21-yard line. The first play of the half was a pass from Zow to Alexander, who gained eight yards. On second down, Alexander picked up the first down with a run to the 34-yard line. Zow completed a pass to Milons at the 38-yard line, then had a pass knocked down at <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> by the Virginia Tech defense. Zow's third-down pass was knocked down, and the Tide punted. The kick {{was returned}} to the Tech 24-yard line, and the Hokies began their first drive of the second half.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
50|$|Washington punter Will Mahan muffed a snap on fourth {{down deep}} in the Huskies' zone on their first {{possession}} of the second half. He recovered the muff, {{took a few steps}} and kicked a ball that rolled 12 yards behind <b>the</b> original <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> Mahan was flagged for an illegal kick, and the Huskies were penalized half the distance to <b>the</b> goal <b>line</b> - 9 yards.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of a series of downs, the {{linesman}} stands so that the heel of one foot marks <b>the</b> initial <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> <b>The</b> box man places his indicator to mark this position and sets the box to display [...] "1". The operator of the rear rod marks the same position, while the other rod man moves ten yards toward <b>the</b> defense's goal <b>line</b> to mark <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to gain.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{fans and}} {{commentators}} refer colloquially {{to the entire}} neutral zone as the [...] "line of scrimmage," [...] although this is technically not correct. Others use the general term to refer specifically to <b>the</b> defensive <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> since it is <b>the</b> <b>line</b> relevant to <b>the</b> measurement of progress toward the goal. Referees, when explaining a penalty, will refer to [...] "the previous spot" [...] instead of the [...] "line of scrimmage" [...] {{in order to avoid}} confusion.|$|R
5|$|On the Hokies' second {{offensive}} possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{took the}} field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two first downs and Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into Boston College territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble for yet another short run, however, he was tackled behind <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> and fumbled the ball. The loose ball was scooped up by Boston College defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51yards for a touchdown. The touchdown and subsequent extra point were the first points {{of the game and}} gave Boston College a 70 lead with 4minutes remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the National Football League (NFL), it is {{possible}} to record a sack for zero yards. The QB must pass <b>the</b> statistical <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> to avoid <b>the</b> sack. A sack is also credited when a defender causes the quarterback to fumble the ball at or behind <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> scrimmage; this is also known as a strip sack. If a passer is sacked in his own end zone, the result is a safety and the defending team is awarded two points, unless the football is fumbled and either recovered in the end zone by the defense for a touchdown or recovered by either team outside the end zone.|$|R
50|$|When {{the play}} ends, {{the ball is}} set for the next play. For the first three {{instances}} above, the ball is set {{at the point of}} its maximum forward progress. That means that if a runner is driven back in the process of a tackle OR is ruled down by lack of forward progress, the ball is placed as close to his opponent's goal line as he had gotten before being driven back. If he runs backwards of his own volition, the ball is marked where he goes down. In the case of an incomplete pass, the ball is placed at <b>the</b> previous <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b>|$|R
5|$|Georgia {{began its}} first {{possession}} with a 25-yard kickoff return, {{but failed to}} earn a first down {{in the face of}} a tough Hokie defensive effort. Georgia punter Gordon Ely-Kelso kicked a 56-yard punt following the Virginia Tech defensive stop. A breakdown in special teams coverage by Georgia allowed Virginia Tech kick returner Eddie Royal to break free, returning the kick 56yards back to <b>the</b> original <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> As a result of the excellent field position provided by the return, Virginia Tech was able to drive the remaining 30yards to the end zone. Branden Ore earned his second touchdown of the game, making the score 14–3 with 6:13 remaining on the clock.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E
5|$|In American football, passing, {{along with}} running (also {{referred}} to as rushing), {{is one of the}} two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. Passes are typically attempted by the quarterback, but any offensive player can attempt a pass provided they are behind <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> To qualify as a passing play, the ball must have initially moved forward after leaving the hands of the passer; if the ball initially moved laterally or backwards, the play would instead be considered a running play. A player who catches a forward pass is a receiver, and the number of receiving yards each player has recorded in each season is a recorded stat in football games. In addition to the overall National Football League (NFL) receiving champion, league record books recognize statistics from the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the NFL in 1970, Although league record books do not recognize stats from the All-America Football Conference, another league that merged with the NFL, these statistics are recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the thirty}} years from 1880 onwards, rule changes were {{incrementally}} {{introduced into the}} game, including the adoption of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> scoring that began to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., {{one of the best}} all around Canadian athletes {{at the turn of the}} century. One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League. Alongside the professionalism dispute, there was serious disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment. Amongst other critical innovations, the Burnside rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the ten yards in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.|$|E
5000|$|Walter Chauncey Camp (April 7, 1859 - March 14, 1925) was an American {{football}} player, coach, {{and sports}} writer {{known as the}} [...] "Father of American Football". Among {{a long list of}} inventions, he created <b>the</b> sport's <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> and <b>the</b> system of downs. [...] With John Heisman, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Pop Warner, Fielding H. Yost, and George Halas, Camp {{was one of the most}} accomplished persons in the early history of American football. He attended Yale College, where he played and coached college football. Camp's Yale teams of 1888, 1891, and 1892 have been recognized as national champions. Camp was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951.|$|R
50|$|If an {{eligible}} receiver on {{the passing}} team legally catches the ball, the pass is completed and the receiver may attempt {{to advance the}} ball. If an opposing player legally catches the ball (all defensive players are eligible receivers) it is an interception. That player's team immediately gains possession of the ball and he may attempt to advance the ball toward his opponent's goal. If no player is able to legally catch the ball it is an incomplete pass and the ball becomes dead the moment it touches the ground. It will then be returned to <b>the</b> original <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> for <b>the</b> next down. If any player interferes with an eligible receiver's ability to catch the ball it is pass interference which draws a penalty of varying degree (largely depending upon the particular league's rules).|$|R
25|$|Infractions of {{the rules}} are punished with penalties, {{typically}} a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as offside (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations {{of the rules}} (such as face-masking) are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from <b>the</b> original <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> from where <b>the</b> violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or from where the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result {{in a loss of}} down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect <b>the</b> yard <b>line</b> which <b>the</b> offence must reach to gain a first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.|$|R
