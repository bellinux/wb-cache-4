At this point, the band had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> whether to stay on at university, or quit their courses and move to London to turn professional. Pearne was not keen to abandon his studies, so decided to leave the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case.

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|After {{the subject}} of {{business}} was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue {{easier for him to}} manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> until after this was over.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{took place}} between the leader of Cardiff Council, Russell Goodway, and the Secretary of State for Wales, Ron Davies, Member of Parliament (MP). The two {{disagreed}} on the valuation of the site, Davies offered what {{was believed to be}} the market price of GB£3.5M, Goodway demanded £14M for the relocation of Council staff. In October 1997, both the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council agreed to the District Valuer providing an independent assessment of the market value of Cardiff City Hall and the cost of staff relocating to an equivalent standard of accommodation. The District Valuer advised that the open market value of Cardiff City Hall was £3.5M. There was not enough information available for the District Valuer <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> A bid of £2.5M was made by the Welsh Office on 14 November 1997, which was rejected on 21 November 1997. A final offer of £3.5M was made on 24 November and this too was rejected by Cardiff County Council. Davies later announced his decision not {{to go ahead with the}} Cardiff City Hall site for the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|He {{returns to}} the {{observation}} room and finds the letter he'd written to Amanda, in which he'd used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches {{the end of his}} path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision,</b> Brent angrily shifts the switch and a bed of needles swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand and jamming the trap as it activates, and he pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek.|$|E
5|$|Klaipėda (German: Memel), an {{important}} seaport in East Prussia, was detached from Germany by Article 28 of the Treaty of Versailles and was {{governed by the}} Allies according to Article 99. France assumed administration of the region while Lithuania continued to lobby for its control, claiming that it should belong to Lithuania as it had a significant Lithuanian population (see Lithuania Minor) and was that country's only access to the Baltic Sea. Poland also laid claim to the territory. As the Allies were hesitant <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> {{and it seemed that}} the region would remain a free state much like the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania took the initiative and organized the Klaipėda Revolt in January 1923. Soviet Russia and Germany supported the action. The region, as an autonomous territory with its own parliament (Klaipėda Parliament), was attached to Lithuania. The region covered about 2,400km² and had a population of approximately 140,000.|$|E

5|$|The F-111 program {{experienced}} {{significant problems}} {{during the late}} 1960s. As a result of delays {{to the development of}} the RF-111 reconnaissance variant of the F-111, of which Australia had ordered four, the RAAF considered purchasing eight RF-4C or RF-4E reconnaissance aircraft and two tankers in early 1968. The Air Force and government eventually concluded that it was too early <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on this matter, and no action was taken. The RAAF accepted all 24 F-111Cs at a ceremony held at Fort Worth, Texas, on 4September 1968. At this time the F-111 program was in crisis owing to technical problems with the design of the aircraft's wing assembly, and all F-111s were grounded after an American F-111 crashed on 23September. Subsequent testing revealed further problems with F-111 components not meeting their intended lifespan, and the Australian aircraft were placed in storage at Fort Worth until these flaws could be rectified. The RAAF subsequently evaluated the F-4E PhantomII, Blackburn Buccaneer, LTV A-7 Corsair II and Grumman A-6 Intruder as possible replacements for the F-111. Only the F-4E was considered to come close to meeting the RAAF's requirements, though its relatively short range and lack of terrain-following radar and electronic countermeasures were considered problematic.|$|E
5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E
