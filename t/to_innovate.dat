5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Knuckles' Chaotix, both {{contemporary and}} in retrospect, has been mixed. Critics found the partner mechanic and tethering physics to be cumbersome, although many journalists appreciated Sega's attempt <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> the series. The level design was also cited as poor by multiple publications. The game {{has been considered}} the last classic game of the Sonic series and a declining point. Some characters and concepts introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix were later featured in other Sonic games and media. Despite interest from fans, the game itself has not been re-released except {{for a brief period}} through GameTap in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} Grand Theft Auto IVs release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The {{development}} team drew influence {{from many of}} their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3, and designed the game around three lead protagonists <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed {{by a team of}} producers who collaborated over several years.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of Spec Ops: The Line {{were mostly}} positive, with many critics praising the narrative, themes, and the provocative take on {{violence}} in video games, but {{noted that it}} failed <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> or present a strong multiplayer component. Many critics consider the game to be underrated, or overlooked. Previews of the game, {{as well as the}} game itself, were banned in the United Arab Emirates for the depiction of Dubai in a state of destruction.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations. This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated {{by the lack of}} adequate communications systems between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E
5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E

5|$|In 1963 Hydro-Québec {{purchased}} {{the shares of}} nearly all remaining privately owned electrical utilities then operating in Québec and undertook construction of the Manicouagan-Outardes hydroelectric complex. To transmit the complex's annual production of about 30 billion kWh over a distance of nearly 700km, Hydro-Québec had <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> Led by Jean-Jacques Archambault, it became the first utility {{in the world to}} transmit electricity at 735 kV, rather than 300–400kV which was the world standard at that time. In 1962, Hydro-Québec proceeded with the construction of the first 735kV power line in the world. The line, stretching from the Manic-Outardes dam to the Levis substation, was brought into service on 29 November 1965.|$|E
5|$|The batik {{industry}} of Java flourished {{from the late}} 1800s to early 1900s, but declined during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. With increasing preference of western clothing, the batik industry further declined following the Indonesian independence. Batik has somewhat revived {{at the turn of}} the 21st century, through the efforts of Indonesian fashion designers <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> batik by incorporating new colours, fabrics, and patterns. Batik has become a fashion item for many Indonesians, and may be seen on shirts, dresses, or scarves for casual wear; it is a preferred replacement for jacket-and-tie at certain receptions. Traditional batik sarongs are still used in many occasions.|$|E
5|$|By {{succeeding}} her husband, Ranavalona {{became the}} first female sovereign of the Kingdom of Imerina {{since its founding in}} 1540. Her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the traditional culture of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> in circumvention of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of kinship, the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the Vazimba, described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of Andriamanelo (1540–1575), founder of the Kingdom of Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen Rafohy (1530–1540).|$|E

Collett followed the same philosophy in his carriage design, improving or adapting as opposed <b>to</b> <b>innovating.</b>|$|R
5|$|Spottiswoode tried <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> in {{the action}} scenes. Since the {{director}} felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the steering wheel on the back seat. The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville {{sound was}} a popular kind of country music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did the most <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> the Nashville sound by abandoning the rougher elements of country, while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, the Nashville sound was perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} key {{catalysts}} beyond Radama's affinity for Creole architecture that inspired Gros <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> so far beyond traditional construction norms: the recent {{construction of a}} two-storey house with a balcony in the neighbourhood of Andohalo by a British missionary (the first balcony in highland Madagascar), and the 1823 arrival of Princess Rasalimo to the Rova, necessitating the redesign of Bevato as her residence. Rasalimo, whose marriage to Radama secured the peace between the Merina Kingdom and that of her Sakalava people on the west coast, was made Radama's principal wife and reportedly demanded an exceptional palace for her home. This request led Radama to employ a Creole architect named Jean Julien to design the unprecedented two-storey house. Although historic sources are divided on whether Tranovola, Bevato or Marivolanitra was the first two-storey house at the Rova, the innovations embodied in these buildings and particularly in Tranovola underscore the rising influence of foreign architectural norms in Imerina. Tranovola is widely represented by historians as the first true example of the hybridisation of Merina architectural norms and those of Europe, and its design served {{as a model for}} the larger Manjakamiadana palace some years later. The innovative features of this building and the Manjakamiadana it inspired—particularly the verandas supported by exterior columns—became the new norm in highlands architecture, especially upon the adoption of brick as the principal building material.|$|E
