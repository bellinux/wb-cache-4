5|$|In {{some species}} of RNA virus, the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> a process called reassortment.|$|E

The first outbreak occurred in October 2005 among exotic birds imported from Taiwan and South America at a privately owned quarantine facility in Essex, England. The second instance involved a dead whooper swan found to have <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> Cellardyke, Scotland in April 2006.

5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has {{had a profound effect}} on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>In</b> 1999, the World Health Organization approved the use of the TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the pathogenicity of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), {{it is important}} to clarify where, when and how <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> replicates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body of infected individuals. To identify <b>the</b> major <b>virus</b> replication site at the end stage of SHIV infection, we investigated the systemic tissues of SHIV-infected monkeys that developed AIDS-like disease. We quantified proviral DNA, and compared the mutation patterns of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> various systemic tissues and in peripheral blood through phylogenetic analysis of the full genome sequence. We found that the amounts of proviral DNA detected in internal tissues were higher than those in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In the sequence and phylogenetic tree analyses, the mutation patterns of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> each tissue were generally different. However, the mutation pattern of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jejunum and mesenteric lymph node were most similar to that of plasma viral RNA among the tissues examined in all three monkeys. In two of the three monkeys, which were euthanised earlier, <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jejunum and mesenteric lymph node occupied the root position of the phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, in these tissues, more than 50 % of SHIV-expressing cells were identified as macrophages based on co-expression of CD 68. These results suggest that macrophages of the small intestine and/or mesenteric lymph node are <b>the</b> major <b>virus</b> production site at the end stage of SHIV infection of macaques...|$|R
5|$|The {{tobacco mosaic}} virus {{was the first}} to be {{crystallised}} and its structure could therefore be elucidated in detail. The first X-ray diffraction pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. On the basis of her pictures, Rosalind Franklin discovered the full structure of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> 1955. In the same year, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified tobacco mosaic virus RNA and its protein coat can assemble by themselves to form functional viruses, suggesting that this simple mechanism was probably the means through which viruses were created within their host cells.|$|E
5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>In</b> the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have also}} {{detected}} both EEHV1A and EEHV1B as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic Asian zoo elephant herdmates of calves that previously had disease. and similarly for EEHV5. Thus, similar to saliva for most {{human and animal}} herpesviruses, the trunk secretions may {{be a source of}} transmission for EEHVs. Because of concerns about the origins of EEHV1 and evidence of cross-species transmission for EEHV3, long-term contact between Asian and African elephants has been discouraged, along with avoiding new contacts between young captive-born Asian elephants and wild-born Asian elephants, as the latter may be carriers of the disease. An analysis of a number of North American cases, which ruled out the direct transmission of the virus between any of the affected facilities studied, strongly supported the idea of a significant Asian carrier population. This is supported by {{the fact that some of}} the deceased calves had no possible contact with any African elephants. Artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor, notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times (even at the same facility) they nearly all had distinct strains of the virus, yet when two calves died or became infected at the same time at the same facility the pairs have always had identical virus strains. A program of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing began in 2005, aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies to <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns.|$|E

5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>In</b> testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|Tulips {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>In</b> the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy tulips {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed unenforceable.|$|E
5|$|WHO first {{recommended}} {{destruction of}} <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> 1986 and later set {{the date of}} destruction to be 30 December 1993. This was postponed to 30 June 1999. Due to resistance from the U.S. and Russia, in 2002 the World Health Assembly agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes. Destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research; the stocks are not needed {{to respond to a}} smallpox outbreak. Some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tests; however, a 2010 review by a team of public health experts appointed by WHO concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the U.S. and Russia continuing to retain virus stocks. The latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community, particularly among veterans of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Program.|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} of 3 low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) (H 4 N 6, H 5 N 1, and H 6 N 8) and one human influenza virus (H 1 N 1) {{as well as}} Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and enteric cytopathogenic bovine orphan (ECBO) <b>virus</b> was investigated <b>in</b> lake sediment, duck feces, and duck meat at 30, 20, 10, and 0 °C using a germ carrier technique. Virus-loaded germ carriers were incubated in each substrate, and residual infectivity of <b>the</b> eluted <b>virus</b> was quantified on cell culture after regular intervals for a maximum of 24 weeks. Data were analyzed by a linear regression model to calculate T 90 values (time required for 90 % loss of virus infectivity) and estimated {{persistence of}} <b>the</b> <b>viruses.</b> <b>In</b> general, <b>the</b> persistence of all of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> was highest <b>in</b> lake sediment, followed by feces, and was the lowest in duck meat at all temperatures. For <b>the</b> avian influenza <b>virus</b> subtypes, T 90 values in sediment ranged from 5 to 11, 13 to 18, 43 to 54, and 66 to 394 days at 30, 20, 10, and 0 °C, respectively, which were 2 to 5 {{times higher than the}} T 90 values of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> feces and meat. Although <b>the</b> individual <b>viruses</b> vary <b>in</b> tenacity, <b>the</b> survival time of influenza viruses was shorter than that of NDV and ECBO <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> all substrates. <b>The</b> {{results of this study suggest}} that lake sediment may act as a long-term source of influenza <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aquatic habitat, while <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> may remain infectious for extended periods of time in duck feces and meat at low temperatures, allowing persistence of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment over winter...|$|R

25|$|Idiotype Cross-Reaction – Idiotypes are {{antigenic}} epitopes {{found in}} the antigen-binding portion (Fab) of the immunoglobulin molecule.

25|$|The {{specific}} {{diagnosis of}} EVD {{is confirmed by}} isolating the virus, detecting its RNA or proteins, or detecting antibodies against <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> a person's blood. Isolating the virus by cell culture, detecting the viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detecting proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are methods best used {{in the early stages}} of the disease and also for detecting <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> human remains. Detecting antibodies against the virus is most reliable in the later stages of the disease and in those who recover. IgM antibodies are detectable two days after symptom onset and IgG antibodies can be detected 6 to 18 days after symptom onset. During an outbreak, isolation of the virus via cell culture methods is often not feasible. In field or mobile hospitals, the most common and sensitive diagnostic methods are real-time PCR and ELISA. In 2014, with new mobile testing facilities deployed in parts of Liberia, test results were obtained 3–5 hours after sample submission. In 2015 a rapid antigen test which gives results in 15 minutes was approved for use by WHO. It is able to confirm Ebola in 92% of those affected and rule it out in 85% of those not affected.|$|E
