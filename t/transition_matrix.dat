5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, {{the number of}} copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the <b>transition</b> <b>matrix</b> is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E

In this paper, MDPs are considered under the reformulated definitions of independent or correlated <b>transition</b> <b>matrices.</b> Preciously existing results have focused on addressing optimality criteria and robust ADP algorithms for MDPs with independent <b>transition</b> <b>matrices.</b> Robust value iteration and robust policy iteration are such algorithms that lead to stationary deterministic optimal policies. Major contributions of this paper are two folds. It first provides sufficient conditions and algorithms to determine a stationary deterministic optimal policy for all independent <b>transition</b> <b>matrices</b> and some correlated <b>transition</b> <b>matrices.</b> As a consequence, the robust policy iteration algorithm is simplified. It then proposes a new, squared total value function to address the existence of a stationary deterministic optimal policy for all possible <b>transition</b> <b>matrices,</b> independent or correlated. A new robust policy iteration under total value function is developed, which degenerates to the previous robust policy iteration. The paper also reveals that the optimality criterion and the robust policy iteration under total value function can be used to solve MDPs with uncertain cost functions and weighted squared total value functions...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree of}} mixing is a {{fundamental}} property of a dynamical system. General multi-dimensional shifts cannot be systematically determined. This work introduces constructive and systematic methods for verifying the degree of mixing, from topological mixing to strong specification (or strong irreducibility) for two-dimensional shifts of finite type. First, <b>transition</b> <b>matrices</b> on infinite strips of width n are introduced for all n≥ 2. To determine the primitivity of the <b>transition</b> <b>matrices,</b> connecting operators are introduced to reduce the order of high-order <b>transition</b> <b>matrices</b> to yield lower-order <b>transition</b> <b>matrices.</b> Two sufficient conditions for primitivity are provided; they are invariant diagonal cycles and primitive commutative cycles of connecting operators. After primitivity is established, the corner-extendability and crisscross-extendability are used to demonstrate topological mixing. In addition, the hole-filling condition yields the strong specification. All mentioned conditions can be verified to apply in {{a finite number of}} steps...|$|R

The building blocks are historical <b>transition</b> <b>matrixes</b> {{and a set}} of latent credit cycle variables. The model’s central feature is for <b>transition</b> <b>matrixes</b> to be time-varying, and driven by rating-specific latent variables which encompass such economic factors as the business cycle. The paper weaves together the credit risk modeling and the valuation procedures via linking the observed and risk-neutral <b>transition</b> <b>matrixes</b> by the estimated risk premiums, and allows credit derivatives to be priced thereof. The main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, the paper proposes a model for bond rating transitions that incorporates well documented empirical properties of <b>transition</b> <b>matrixes</b> such as their dependence on business / credit cycles. The model also allows for inter-rating variations in credit quality changes. Second, unlike many studies which focus solely on empirical modeling of rating transitions or default rates, this paper shows how the empirical model can be implemented for actual valuations.
