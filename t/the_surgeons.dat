5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a touch. Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. <b>The</b> <b>surgeons</b> and barbers had been a single {{profession}} since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E
5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But since they were treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. <b>The</b> <b>surgeons</b> operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E

5|$|Pneumothorax was {{described}} in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a student of René Laennec, who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819. While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis (then the most common cause), the concept of spontaneous pneumothorax {{in the absence of}} tuberculosis (primary pneumothorax) was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932. In 1941, <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural abrasion for the treatment of pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> {{working on}} the body are {{observed}} by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves. The president {{has been identified as}} John Freke, president of the Royal College of Surgeons at the time. Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept {{for the arrival of}} the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>surgeon</b> {{may choose}} {{which type of}} {{incision}} and implant to use for the patient’s knee. During <b>the</b> surgery, <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> may align <b>the</b> instruments to {{determine the amount of}} bone to remove. <b>The</b> <b>surgeon</b> removes bone from the shin bone (tibia) and thigh bone (femur). <b>The</b> <b>surgeon</b> may decide to check if they removed the proper amount of bone during the surgery. In order {{to make sure that the}} proper size implant is used, a surgeon may choose to use a temporary trial. After making sure the proper size implant is selected, <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> will put <b>the</b> implant on the ends of the bone and secure it with pegs. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> will close <b>the</b> wound with sutures.|$|R

5000|$|CT-Based: {{utilizes}} CT imaging {{to construct}} a 3-D* model of the patient's anatomy to guide <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> either: through a step-by-step walk through of the procedure; or providing real-time feedback of the operation to <b>the</b> <b>surgeon.</b> Both methods allow <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> to easier visualize anatomical landmarks, thus increasing both precision and accuracy of prosthetic implants.|$|R
5|$|Early on 15 July, the 1st Parachute Brigade heard {{tank fire}} {{to the south of}} their position. Brigadier Lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate, which located the tanks and {{infantry}} of XIII Corps that had halted just south of them the previous night. The 1st Parachute Brigade and 50th (Northumbrian) Division now moved forward together. The main dressing station, which had continued to operate after being captured, was liberated by the 2nd Parachute Battalion. In an attempt to recapture Primosole Bridge the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, supported by the 44th Royal Tank Regiment, carried out a number of assaults. At one stage they managed to cross the bridge, but three Sherman tanks accompanying them were knocked out by the German 88s, and with no armoured support the infantry were forced to withdraw. However, an error in communication caused the Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion to withdraw to the north bank of the river, and this allowed the Durhams to establish a position {{at the southern end of}} the bridge. At the main dressing station <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> had operated on another 14 wounded by the time ambulances arrived from XIII Corps at 17:00 to evacuate the wounded. At 18:00 the Main Dressing Station was closed and the men moved to Johnny I. During the time the main dressing station had been active, <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> had completed 31 operations, and the medics had treated 109 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} at the hospital with Bailey and Zola, Grey is informed by <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> that they tried everything to save her husband's life. Grey points out {{that they should have}} ordered a head CT, much to Blake's dismay. She reviews all of her options with the doctor in-charge of Shepherd's case, before signing the papers to authorize the removal of his life support. Blake tearfully apologizes to a forbearing Grey, who then returns to his hospital room to say a final goodbye to Shepherd. This is accompanied by a montage of the happy moments from their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{returned}} to the United States in March 1949. Truman offered him the post of Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs but General Smith declined the appointment, preferring to return to military duty. He was appointed as {{the commander of the}} First Army at Fort Jay, New York, his first command since 1918. Throughout the war, Smith had been troubled by a recurring stomach ulcer. The problem became severe in 1949. He was no longer able eat a normal diet, and he was suffering from malnutrition. Smith was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Hospital, where <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> decided to remove most of his stomach. This did cure his ulcer, but Smith remained malnourished and thin.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General of <b>the</b> United States is the {{operational}} {{head of the}} U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC) and thus the leading spokesperson on matters of public health {{in the federal government}} of the United States. <b>The</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General's office and staff are known as the Office of <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General (OSG).|$|R
50|$|The story {{opens up}} {{with the death of}} Elena Ortiz at the hands of <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon,</b> and Thomas Moore is sent to investigate. The murder is tied to another murder by <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon,</b> Diana Sterling, a year previous. Rizzoli and Moore note that both had no contact or {{connection}} whatsoever, and are perplexed by these two murders. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> begins targeting his third victim, Nina Peyton, and Cordell continues to save lives, starting with Herman Gwadowski. <b>The</b> <b>Surgeon</b> is also starting to get closer and closer to Cordell, who is creating a romantic and sexual connection with Thomas Moore. In the end, Jane manages to save Cordell from <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon,</b> and Moore marries Cordell.|$|R
5000|$|Soon afterwards, Jeroen was {{defeated}} and {{stripped of his}} powers, which were then given to <b>The</b> <b>Surgeon,</b> a modern-day French alchemist <b>The</b> <b>Surgeon</b> turned Jeroen into a doll and carried him in his pockets, using him to scrub out stains from the Surgeon's underpants. <b>The</b> <b>Surgeon</b> brought corporate contractors into the Garden of Ancestral Memory, who murdered the entities living there and later supervised {{the creation of a}} corporate religion called [...] "Religimon". <b>The</b> <b>Surgeon</b> was later killed by Midnighter and Jeroen instantly recovered his powers.|$|R
5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> of the {{hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{formally}} leased for prisoner housing in 1803 after fifteen French fishermen, three surgeons, and 188 seamen {{were brought to}} Halifax as prisoners during the Napoleonic Wars. Though many of these prisoners were later sent to England or Bermuda, one of <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> (Antoine Noel) was hired {{to care for the}} prisoners, while at least sixteen other prisoners were able to escape. Melville was purchased for £1000 in 1804 (£68,634 as of 2010) by Robert Murray, appointed by the British Admiralty as prison agent; he was replaced shortly thereafter by John MacKellar. At the time, the facility had a maximum capacity of 200 prisoners. The makeshift prison was noted for discipline problems.|$|E
5|$|McKnight {{remained}} at North Castle until John Morgan, the Director General, ordered him and Samuel Adams, Jr. (the son of Samuel Adams of Massachusetts) {{to set up}} a new hospital near Peekskill, New York, for more than 300 sick soldiers of General William Heath's division. Unable to find an acceptable site for a hospital, the two surgeons took over accommodations in Fishkill, New York, twenty miles north of Peekskill. Washington, however, sent convalescents to Peekskill because Morgan told him the hospital was there. Morgan was dismissed as Director General soon thereafter, in January 1777, due to rancor with Washington over supplies and a rampant smallpox epidemic then raging its way through the army. Morgan's management style rankled <b>the</b> <b>surgeons,</b> including McKnight, as Morgan was wrestling with Shippen, McKnight's mentor, over control of the hospitals in New Jersey. Isaac Foster took over temporary supervision of the hospitals {{on the east side of}} the Hudson River after Morgan's dismissal at Washington's request.|$|E
40|$|Laparoscopic surgery has {{considerable}} {{advantages for}} the patient over conventional surgery; for <b>the</b> <b>surgeon,</b> however, it has mostly disadvantages. One of the main problems is that the coupling between action and perception is hampered, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> has no direct control over the laparoscope since it is held and directed by an assistant. In two experiments we explored how action-perception coupling can be restored. In the first experiment we explored the possibility of restoring action-perception coupling by providing <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> with direct control over his visual information. The applicability of two principles were explored: viewpoint movement parallax, where <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> controls <b>the</b> change in the point of observation (the laparoscope) directly with his head movement; and shadow movement parallax, where <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> controls <b>the</b> change in the point of illumination directly with his head movements. In a second experiment we investigated whether {{the performance of a}} surgeon is influenced by motions of the laparoscope that are not generated by <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> himself, but by the assistant directing the laparoscope. We concluded that restoring the action-perception coupling (i. e. providing <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> with direct control over the laparoscope's motions) improves the surgeon's ability to perform explorative, as well as manipulative, tasks. We also concluded that, as disturbances of laparoscope movements hamper <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> during manipulation, <b>the</b> laparoscope should be supported by a mechanical support...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General is {{also the}} {{ultimate}} award authority for several public health awards and decorations, the highest of which that can be directly awarded is <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General's Medallion (<b>the</b> highest award bestowed by board action is the Public Health Service Distinguished Service Medal). <b>The</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General also has many informal duties, such as educating the American public about health issues and advocating healthy lifestyle choices.|$|R
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. <b>The</b> <b>surgeons</b> tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been given expansive and recurring appearances in the progressive story line. Sara Ramirez appeared in a nine episode arc in the season, portraying orthopedic surgical resident Callie Torres, introduced and developed as a love interest for the character of George O'Malley. Steven W. Bailey is introduced in the recurring role of Joe, the Bartender, often being portrayed as a confidant of <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> of Seattle Grace Hospital. Chris O'Donnell portrayed Veterinary physician Finn Dandridge, who became a love interest for Meredith Grey. Renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, continues her recurring role from the first season, being portrayed by Kate Burton. Brooke Smith portrayed Erica Hahn, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Seattle Presbyterian Hospital, who is revealed {{to have been a}} rival of Preston Burke ever since they attended medical school together. Jeffrey Dean Morgan appears in six episodes throughout the season, portraying patient Denny Duquette, who begins a relationship with Izzie Stevens, but ultimately dies following an unsuccessful heart transplant surgery. Loretta Devine acted as Adele Webber, Richard's wife, who is revealed to have been aware of her husband's affair since its inception. Other guest stars include Sarah Utterback in the role of nurse Olivia Harper, love interest of both George O'Malley and Alex Karev, Kali Rocha portraying fifth-year resident Sydney Heron, who replaces Miranda Bailey temporarily when she takes a maternity leave, Jeff Perry portraying Meredith Grey's father, Thatcher Grey, Mare Winningham in the role of Susan Grey, Tsai Chin in the role of Helen Yang Rubenstein, Cristina's mother, Mandy Siegfried portraying Molly Grey Thompson, Meredith's half-sister and Tessa Thompson portraying Camille Travis, Richard Webber's niece, Christina Ricci portraying paramedic Hannah Davies, and Kyle Chandler in the role of Dylan Young, head of the bomb squad. Eric Dane, who would be promoted to a series regular in the third season, appeared in the eighteenth episode, portraying attending physician, otolaryngologist and plastic surgeon Mark Sloan, Addison Montgomery's former lover, whose affair with her is presented as the reason behind the estrangement of her husband, Derek Shepherd.|$|E
50|$|Inspired {{during his}} {{research}} for his thesis, Billings {{recognized the need}} for an index and a catalog of medical periodicals and books. In Billings’ late career, he developed <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General's Library, which later became the core of the National Library of Medicine. From 1865 to 1873, Billings expanded <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General's Library from 600 volumes to over 50 000 volumes. During his time as Director of the Library of <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General's Library, 1865-1895, he was responsible for the creation of both the Index Medicus (33 d.C.) and the Index Catalogue of <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General's Office (S IV a.C.).|$|R
50|$|In {{computer-assisted}} surgery, {{the actual}} intervention {{is defined as}} surgical navigation. Using the surgical navigation system <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> uses special instruments, which are tracked by the navigation system. The position of a tracked instrument {{in relation to the}} patient's anatomy is shown on images of the patient, as <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> moves <b>the</b> instrument. <b>The</b> <b>surgeon</b> thus uses <b>the</b> system to 'navigate' the location of an instrument. The feedback the system provides of the instrument location is particularly useful in situations where <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> cannot actually see the tip of the instrument, such as in minimally invasive surgeries.|$|R
50|$|Remote {{surgery or}} {{telesurgery}} is performance of surgical procedures where <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> is not physically {{in the same}} location as the patient, using a robotic teleoperator system controlled by <b>the</b> <b>surgeon.</b> <b>The</b> remote operator may give tactile feedback to the user. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics and high-speed data connections. A critical limiting factor is the speed, latency and reliability of the communication system between <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> and <b>the</b> patient, though trans-Atlantic surgeries have been demonstrated.|$|R
5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept {{on his hands and knees}} to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.|$|E

50|$|Planning of {{the neck}} design on the Unique stem is {{computerized}} with digital templates, and <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> can access all data regarding his patients on the Internet.
