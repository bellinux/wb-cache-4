2500|$|A {{few days}} later, on 27 July, Rosario was east of The Lizard when she sighted {{and started to}} chase a French {{privateer}} ship. By 4p.m. Rosario was within gunshot of her quarry when Rosario had <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>astern</b> having lost her fore top-mast because {{of the amount of}} sail that she was carrying. Fortunately [...] had joined Rosario at noon and by 8 o'clock she came alongside the quarry, which struck her colours. The privateer was Atalante, six days out of Bordeaux, with a crew of 120 men under the command of Arnaud Martin. She was pierced for 22 guns but only had fourteen 6-pounders mounted, having thrown eight overboard during the chase. Captain Hammond of Plantagenet described Atalante as an [...] "exceedingly handsome Vessel", and as sailing remarkably fast, having [...] "run us nearly Ninety Miles in the Nine Hours." [...] later shared in the prize money for Atalante.|$|E
2500|$|The Western Frigate Squadron engaged a French {{squadron}} off the Île de Batz on 23 April 1794. The squadron had sighted four strange sail which, upon closure, {{were identified}} as three French frigates and a corvette. The French squadron included the new French Frigate Pomone which, at 44 guns, was the most powerful ship in action that day. Flora and Arethusa {{were the first to}} close with Pomone and Babet, the corvette of 20 guns. The opening shots were fired just before 6 a.m. For about forty-five minutes, the four ships manoeuvred against one another without any severe damage being done. [...] Then Flora lost her mainmast and was forced <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>astern.</b> With Flora out of action, Pellew ordered Arethusa to close with the corvette. Arethusa’s carronades quickly destroyed her resistance. Leaving Babet to be finished by Melampus, Arethusa then engaged Pomone, coming to within pistol range at 8.30 a.m. and raking her repeatedly. Within twenty-five minutes one of the finest new French frigates was a ruin, her main and mizzen masts shot away and a fire burning on her aft deck. Just after 9 a.m., Pomone struck her colors.|$|E
60|$|Teddy and Neal, {{bewildered by}} the flames which {{actually}} burned their flesh {{as they stood}} by the rail while the sailors let go the falls, had only thought of reaching the craft in which their property was stowed, and Jake followed; but as the little tenders were allowed <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>astern</b> beyond reach of the intense heat the boys discovered that Mr. Emery was not with them.|$|E
6000|$|The Flash drew quietly {{abreast of}} the barque, and was {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> it <b>astern</b> when a white figure started up on the poop of the Arab vessel, and a voice called out-- ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this while}} our boat was still towing alongside; and I was about <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> it <b>astern,</b> when Jarl, ever cautious, {{declared}} it safer where it was; since, {{if there were}} people on board, they would most likely be down in the cabin, from the dead-lights of which, mischief might be done to the Chamois.|$|R
60|$|Even I {{thought to}} myself, {{what would have}} become of us had we {{stretched}} a leetle further in! The captain, however, seemed satisfied that he could carry the ship out, and, as this was all we wanted, no one was disposed to be very critical. A word was said about the launch, which the mate had ordered <b>to</b> be <b>dropped</b> <b>astern,</b> out of the way, and the explanation seemed to mystify the captain. In the meanwhile, the pork was boiling furiously in the coppers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Meantime, at {{the first}} tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>astern</b> from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, {{downward}} jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|At all events, {{our boat}} {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>astern</b> unobserved, until the ship itself became very faintly visible to us. I arose {{as soon as}} we were fifty feet from the rudder, and I assumed the direction of affairs as soon as on my feet. There were a mast and a lugg-sail in the boat, and we stepped the former and set the last, as soon as far enough from the Speedy to be certain we could not be seen. Putting the helm up, sufficiently to bring the wind on the quarter, I then stood directly out to sea. All this was accomplished in less than five minutes, by means of what the French call a sudden inspiration! ...|$|E
60|$|Paul, {{aided by}} John Effingham, now {{loosened}} the chains altogether from the bitts, and suffered the ship <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>astern.</b> As {{this was done}} silently and stealthily, it occupied several minutes; but the wind being by this time fresh, the huge mass yielded to its power with certainty; and when the bridge had floated round in a direct line from the reef, or dead to leeward, there was a space of water between its end and the ship {{of more than a}} hundred feet. The Arabs had rushed on it in readiness to board; but they set up a yell of disappointment as soon as the truth was discovered. A tumult followed; several fell from the wet and slippery spars; but, after a short time wasted in confusion and clamour, the directions of their chiefs were obeyed, and they set to work with energy to break up their bridge, in order to convert its materials into a raft.|$|E
6000|$|... "At two {{this morning}} we left Cagliari; at five cast anchor here. I got [...] up and began {{preparing}} for the final trial; and shortly afterwards [...] every one else of note on board went ashore to make experiments on the [...] state of the cable, leaving me {{with the prospect of}} beginning to lift [...] at 12 o'clock. I was not ready by that time; but the experiments were [...] not concluded, and moreover the cable was found to be imbedded some [...] four or five feet in sand, so that the boat could not bring off the [...] end. At three, Messrs. Liddell, etc., came on board in good spirits, [...] having found two wires good, or in such a state as permitted messages [...] to be transmitted freely. The boat now went to grapple for the cable [...] some way from shore, while the Elba towed a small lateen craft which [...] was to take back the consul to Cagliari some distance on its way. On [...] our return we found the boat had been unsuccessful; she was allowed <b>to</b> [...] <b>drop</b> <b>astern,</b> while we grappled for the cable in the Elba [without [...] more success].

60|$|While he was {{speaking}} he led the man by the arm {{to the side of}} the schooner, and constrained him to get into the boat. As he uttered the last word he cut the rope that held it, and let it <b>drop</b> <b>astern.</b>|$|R

6000|$|A visit {{on board}} ship, {{such as that}} at which we now assisted, makes a chief part and by far the chief {{diversion}} {{of the life of}} Tembinok'. He is not only the sole ruler, he is the sole merchant of his triple kingdom, Apemama, Aranuka, and Kuria, well-planted islands. The taro goes to the chiefs, who divide as they please among their immediate adherents; but certain fish, turtles--which abound in Kuria,--and the whole produce of the coco-palm, belong exclusively to Tembinok'. [...] "A' cobra[9] berong me," [...] observed his majesty with, a wave of his hand; and he counts and sells it by the houseful. [...] "You got copra, king?" [...] I have heard a trader ask. [...] "I got two, three outches,"[10] his majesty replied: [...] "I think three." [...] Hence the commercial importance of Apemama, the trade of three islands being centred there in a single hand; hence it is that so many whites have tried in vain to gain or to preserve a footing; hence ships are adorned, cooks have special orders, and captains array themselves in smiles, to greet the king. If he be pleased with his welcome and the fare he may pass days on board, and every day, and sometimes every hour, will be of profit to the ship. He oscillates between the cabin, where he is entertained with strange meats, and the trade-room, where he enjoys the pleasures of shopping on a scale to match his person. A few obsequious attendants squat by the house door, awaiting his least signal. In the boat, which has been suffered <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>astern,</b> one or two of his wives lie covered from the sun under mats, tossed by the short sea of the lagoon, and enduring agonies of heat and tedium. This severity is now and then relaxed and the wives allowed on board. Three or four were thus favoured on the day of our arrival: substantial ladies airily attired in ridis. Each had a share of copra, her peculium, to dispose of for herself. The display in the trade-room--hats, ribbons, dresses, scents, tins of salmon--the pride of the eye and the lust of the flesh--tempted them in vain. They had but the one idea--tobacco, the island currency, tantamount to minted gold; returned to shore with it, burthened but rejoicing; and late into the night, on the royal terrace, were to be seen counting the sticks by lamplight in the open air.|$|E

60|$|Still we {{increased}} our lead, {{and when}} the boat had <b>dropped</b> <b>astern</b> several miles we hove to and waited.

60|$|Again {{and again}} to such gamesome talk, the {{dexterous}} dart is repeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash.

60|$|Obedient to orders, Leo {{pulled the}} {{regulator}} or check-string until the kite's position was altered {{so as to}} present less resistance to the wind, and <b>dropped</b> <b>astern</b> of the Faith, which was the name given by Benjy to his father's boat, the other two being named respectively the Hope and the Charity.|$|R
60|$|After {{receiving}} {{your kind}} note I resolved {{to make another}} trial. But the hot weather {{and a few other}} drawbacks did not mend the matter, for I have <b>dropped</b> <b>astern</b> this month instead of going ahead. So I have seen Forster, and shown him my chains, and am reduced to taking exercise in them, like Baron Trenck.|$|R
60|$|Steaming {{steadily}} onward {{were the}} huge vessels, <b>dropping</b> <b>astern</b> and beyond range the transports {{as they passed}} opposite Cavite Point, until, having gained such a distance above the city as permitted of an evolution, the fleet swung swiftly around until it held a course parallel with the westernmost shore, and distant from it mayhap six thousand yards.|$|R
60|$|When {{the boat}} was loaded the painter was cast off and she <b>dropped</b> <b>astern.</b> The oars were shipped, and they made for the steamer. From the low deck of the smack they could be seen, now pictured against the sky on a wave's crest, and then lost to view {{altogether}} {{for a few seconds}} in the watery valley beyond.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the other vessels {{had not been}} idle, and a storm of missiles was poured upon the Bonito. The fate which befell their comrades, however, showed them how formidable was the vessel they had regarded as an easy prey, and when the first assailants of the Bonito <b>dropped</b> <b>astern,</b> none of the others cared to take their places.|$|R
60|$|Thereafter {{followed}} a spell of racing, the Spaniard ever lessening {{the distance between}} them, and the land <b>dropping</b> <b>astern</b> until it {{was no more than}} a hazy line above the shimmering sea. Suddenly from the Spaniard appeared a little cloud of white smoke, and the boom of a gun followed, and after it came a splash a cable's length ahead of the Swallow's bows.|$|R
60|$|The combat was {{of short}} duration. Many {{of those on}} whom the boiling pitch had fallen jumped {{overboard}} in their agony, while others did the same to escape the Greek fire, which they in vain endeavoured to extinguish. The fire quickly spread to the woodwork, and in five minutes after {{the beginning of the}} fight, the two craft <b>dropped</b> <b>astern</b> from the Bonito, with the flames already rising fiercely from them.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} they were nearly becalmed; then, as the land <b>dropped</b> <b>astern</b> and the shades of night deepened, the wind fell altogether, and, when the stars came out, a {{profound}} calm prevailed over the gently undulating sea. The exuberant spirits of our three friends were subdued by the sweet influences around, and, as the hour for rest drew near, the conversation, which at first became fitful, <b>dropped</b> at last <b>to</b> silence.|$|R
60|$|Marston {{signed to}} the steersman, the sails filled, and the canoe <b>dropped</b> <b>astern.</b> Columbine {{gathered}} speed and listed down, throwing spray about while the water foamed below her lee rail. Small white waves {{rolled down the}} glittering track ahead and Marston's mood got lighter. After all, {{it was a relief}} to put to sea; the salt wind was tonic and blew morbid thoughts away. It was bracing to grapple with breaking waves and savage squalls.|$|R
50|$|Convoy UGS-7A sailed on {{the morning}} of 14 April 1943, and the special Task Group joined up off New York and {{continued}} in company until 08:00 on 21 April, when the Group left the convoy and <b>dropped</b> <b>astern</b> 25 nautical miles (45 km), proceeding as straggler-with-escorts, although the escorts remained far enough astern so {{that they would not be}} visible to an enemy submarine sighting Big Horn. The cruise was uneventful during the next two weeks.|$|R
60|$|Ugi had <b>dropped</b> <b>astern,</b> and the ARLA was sliding along {{through a}} summer sea toward the wooded ranges of Malaita. The {{helmsman}} who so attracted Bertie's eyes sported a ten penny nail, stuck skewerwise through his nose. About his neck was {{a string of}} pants buttons. Thrust through holes in his ears were a can opener, the broken handle of a toothbrush, a clay pipe, the brass wheel of an alarm clock, and several Winchester rifle cartridges.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} a rattle of blocks as the ladder was hoisted in, and the deck quivered as the engines began to throb. Jake heard the screw slowly {{flounder}} round and the wash beneath the poop as the steamer moved out to sea, but there was nobody except their colored crews on board the boats that <b>dropped</b> <b>astern.</b> Kenwardine had had his chance and lost it. He had been too bold and now must confront his enemies.|$|R
60|$|Captain Martin now {{ascended to}} the poop. In {{a short time}} the boat joined that which had <b>dropped</b> <b>astern,</b> which was lying {{helpless}} in the water, no attempt having been made to man the oars, {{as most of the}} unwounded men were scalded more or less severely. Their report was evidently not encouraging, and the third boat made no attempt to pursue. Some of her oarsmen were shifted to the other boat, and together they turned and made back for Amsterdam.|$|R
5000|$|... == Attack by German Aircraft Defeated == When {{the smoke}} of battle cleared, the Allied force had emerged unscathed from the German gauntlet. Walter S. Brown, which had taken six enemy {{aircraft}} under fire during the seven-minute engagement, <b>dropped</b> <b>astern</b> at 2153 — in company with the , British tug Hengist, and French coastal escort Cimieterre — to search for possible casualties. After a prolonged and thorough search in which they found nothing, the ships returned to the convoy {{for the remainder of}} the voyage.|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{and his men}} having thus smartly transacted {{their chief}} business, leaped on deck, made fast their painter, let the boat <b>drop</b> <b>astern,</b> and were soon smoking and {{drinking}} amicably with {{the crew of the}} Lively Poll. Not long afterwards they were quarrelling. Then Dick Martin, who was apt to become pugnacious over his liquor, asserted stoutly that something or other [...] "was." [...] Joe Stubley swore that it [...] "was not," [...] whereupon Dick Martin planted his fist on Joe Stubley's nose and laid its growly owner flat on the deck.|$|R
