25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly <b>trade</b> <b>creditors</b> may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how competition among suppliers affects {{their willingness to}} provide trade credit financing. Trade credit extended by a supplier to a cash constrained retailer allows the latter to increase cash purchases from its other suppliers, leading to a free rider problem. A supplier that represents a smaller share of the retailer's purchases internalizes a smaller part of the benefit from increased spending by the retailer and, as a result, extends less trade credit relative to its sales. In consequence, retailers with dispersed suppliers obtain less trade credit than those whose suppliers are more concentrated. The free rider problem is especially detrimental to a <b>trade</b> <b>creditor</b> when the free-riding suppliers are its product market competitors, leading to a negative relation between product substitutability among suppliers to a given retailer and trade credit that the former provide to the latter. We test the model using both simulated and real data. The estimated relations {{are consistent with the}} model's predictions and are statistically and economically significant...|$|R
2500|$|Floating {{charges have}} been criticised as a [...] "raw deal" [...] for {{unsecured}} creditors. In Salomon v. Salomon & Co. [...] AC 22 Lord Macnaghten observed that the injustice of the case (as he saw it) was not caused {{by the introduction of}} the concept of limited liability, but by the excessive security created by the floating charge. [...] In Re London Pressed Hinge Co Ltd [...] 1 Ch 576 Buckley J observed that great mischief arose from {{the very nature of the}} floating charge as few of general unsecured <b>trade</b> <b>creditors</b> of the company would even be aware of its existence.|$|E
2500|$|A second main {{equivalent}} to a security interest is a [...] "Quistclose trust" [...] named after the case Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd. Here a company named Rolls Razor Ltd had promised to pay a dividend to its shareholders, but had financial difficulty. Already in debt to its bank, Barclays, for £484,000 it agreed to take a loan from Quistclose Investments Ltd for £209,719. This money was deposited in a separate Barclays account, {{for the purpose of}} being paid out to shareholders. Unfortunately, Rolls Razor Ltd entered insolvency before the payment was made. Barclays claimed it had a right to set off the Quistclose money against the debts that were due to it, while Quistclose contended the money belonged entirely to it, and could not be used for the satisfaction of other creditors. The House of Lords unanimously held that a trust had been created in favour of Quistclose, and if the purpose of the payment (i.e. to pay the shareholders) failed, then the money would revert to Quistclose's ownership. While Quistclose trust cases are rare, and their theoretical basis has remained controversial (particularly because the trust is for a purpose and so sits uncomfortably with the rule against perpetuities), trusts have also been acknowledged to exist when a company keeps payments by consumers in a separate fund. In Re Kayford Ltd a mail order business, fearing bankruptcy and not wanting pre-payments by its customers to be taken by other creditors, acted on its solicitors' advice and placed their money in a separate bank account. Megarry J held this effectively ensured other creditors would not have access to this cash. Since the Insolvency Act 1986 reforms, it is probable that section 239, which prohibits transactions that desire to give a preference to one creditor over others, would be argued to avoid such an arrangement (if ever a company does in fact seek to prefer its customers in this way). The position, then, would be that while banks and <b>trade</b> <b>creditors</b> may easily protect themselves, consumers, employees and others in a weaker bargaining position have few legal resources to do the same.|$|E

50|$|The auditor {{said the}} company’s {{continuation}} {{depended on the}} bank’s continued facilities. Banco Exterior SA took a secured debenture on 18 October 1983 on all property and assets, present and future, including good will, book debts and uncalled capital (but fixed assets were only £5000). They also took a personal guarantee from David for £30K. The draft accounts for 1984-6 were produced by auditors six months late in January 1987. They showed a £55K loss and £29K loss, with liabilities over assets reaching £175K. Auditors warned of insolvent trading, if the bank did not give more credit. The bank did oblige in March, but less than before. The overdraft decreased, but debt to its most important Cypriot shipper increased to £175K. The company was put in creditors’ voluntary liquidation on 2 October 1987, with debts of £317,694, half owed to one Cypriot shipping firm, as a <b>trade</b> <b>creditor</b> that brought them fruit. In 1988 the liquidator asked David and Murphy why there was trading while insolvent. David replied that they knew liquidation was inevitable in February with the accounts, and trading was continued because there was perishable fruit in cold store. The liquidator sought them to contribute £107,946 each, plus costs the court saw fit. The liquidator argued that the right measure to contribute was the reduction in net assets caused by the wrongful trading.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>creditors</b> to impose <b>trade</b> {{sanctions}} {{has been one}} of the workhorse arguments to explain why governments repay foreign creditors. Although sovereign defaults are associated with declines in the defaulting country trade, the absence of explicit trade sanctions following defaults in recent decades is troublesome. One way in which the trade sanctions argument is reconciled with this evidence is to argue that creditor countries are punishing defaulting countries through sub rosa actions that disrupt their trade. Is this the case? Are trade sanctions (understood in a broad sense) causing the declines in trade? Using a gravity model framework we devise an empirical strategy to evaluate this issue. It is based on the idea that if trade sanctions are causing the declines, bilateral <b>trade</b> with <b>creditor</b> countries should fall more than trade with other countries. We find that sovereign defaults are associated with a decline in overall trade for the defaulting country. However, in the aftermath of defaults, there seems to be no evidence of a larger decline in bilateral <b>trade</b> with <b>creditor</b> countries affected by the default. This would imply that the declines are not due to punishments imposed by these creditor countries. The analysis does not yield evidence of broader punishment strategies including a league of major creditors (not just those affected by the default) either. These results would contradict the predictions of the trade sanctions theory of sovereign borrowing...|$|R

40|$|Using an {{augmented}} {{gravity model}} {{of trade and}} a new database of nearly 9, 000 bilateral trade pairs, this paper examines how sovereigns were punished for defaulting on external debt during the classical gold standard period. We do not find that, in general, <b>trade</b> between <b>creditor</b> and debtor countries fell in response to a default - evidence that would be consistent with the presence of trade sanctions. During the period 1870 - 1914, a statistically significant decline in trade, as a result of default, was observed only when gunboat diplomacy was used by creditor countries. Indeed, the use of "supersanctions" during the gold standard era - instances where external military pressure or political control was imposed on defaulting nations - proved to be an effective means for punishing debtors and reducing ex ante default probabilities. Conditional on default, the probability that a country would be "supersanctioned" was greater than 30 percent...|$|R

40|$|For {{creditor}} {{countries on}} the periphery of the dollar standard such as China with current account surpluses, foreign mercantile pressure to appreciate their currencies and become more flexible is misplaced. Just the expectation of variable exchange appreciation seriously disrupts the natural tendency for wage growth to balance productivity growth and thus worsens the (incipient) deflation that China now faces. It could create a zero-interest liquidity trap in financial markets that leaves the central bank helpless to combat future deflation arising out of actual currency appreciation, as with the earlier experience of Japan.

Almost twenty percent of Americans had remained loyal to the Britain, {{and as many as}} 80,000 of these Loyalists left the United States during and after the war. Economically mid-Atlantic states recovered particularly quickly and began manufacturing and processing goods, while New England and the South experienced more uneven recoveries. Trade with Britain resumed, and the volume of British imports after the war matched the volume from before the war, though exports fell precipitously. Adams, serving as the ambassador to Britain, called for a retaliatory tariff in order to force the British to negotiate a commercial treaty, particularly regarding access to Caribbean markets. However, Congress lacked the power to regulate foreign commerce or compel the states to follow a unified trade policy, and Britain proved unwilling to negotiate. While trade with the British did not fully recover, the U.S. expanded trade with France, China, the Netherlands, Portugal, and other European countries. Despite these good economic conditions, many traders complained of the high duties imposed by each state, which served to restrain interstate <b>trade.</b> Many <b>creditors</b> also suffered from the failure of domestic governments to repay debts incurred during the war. Though the 1780s saw moderate economic growth, many experienced economic anxiety, and Congress received much of the blame for failing to foster a stronger economy.|$|R
