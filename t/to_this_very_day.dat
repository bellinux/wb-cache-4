5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is used <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day</b> to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E

25|$|In West Germany (FRG), most {{existing}} autobahns were repaired {{soon after}} the war. During the 1950s, the West German government restarted the construction program. It invested in new sections and in improvements to older ones. Finishing the incomplete sections took longer, with some stretches opened to traffic by the 1980s. Some sections cut by the Iron Curtain in 1945 were only completed after German reunification in 1990. Others were never completed, as more advantageous routes were found.

25|$|In 1846, Birkenhead Park Cricket Club {{was formed}} on Park Drive, {{based in the}} park itself. At the time, {{it was a very}} {{exclusive}} club in which all the members were Old Boys of the top public schools. Because there were so few clubs in the area, the members arranged matches between themselves, such as married vs. singles. From the start, the ground was enclosed by railings and initially had a tent used as the pavilion. This was later followed by a wooden structure which was then replaced by the present club house that still stands <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

In 1970, he purchased the Seattle Pilots in bankruptcy court and renamed them the Milwaukee Brewers after the minor league team {{of the same name}} he had watched in his youth, which existed until the arrival of the Braves in Milwaukee in 1953. The Brewers went to the 1982 World Series (but were defeated in seven games by the St. Louis Cardinals, an event that Selig laments <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day),</b> and won seven Organization of the Year awards during his tenure.

25|$|Exactly {{how and why}} did Merezhkovsky {{found himself}} on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova) was blaming her own {{secretary}} Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man {{to come to the}} studio {{in the early days of}} the Nazi invasion into the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled Bolshevism and Humanity is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for the anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what he was saying all through the 1920s and 1930s:Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon.

25|$|In May–June 1993, when, as {{a result}} of a crisis in the government, the country was on the verge of a civil war and faced the peril of losing independence, the people of Azerbaijan demanded to bring Heydar Aliyev to power, and the then leaders of Azerbaijan were obliged to officially invite Heydar Aliyev to Baku. On 24 June 1993, amidst the {{advancement}} of insurgent forces under Huseynov's control towards Baku, Elchibey fled from the city to his native village of Keleki in Nakhchivan. Earlier, on 15 June 1993, Aliyev had been elected Chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, and after Elchibey's flight he also assumed temporary presidential powers. In August 1993, Elchibey was stripped of his presidency by the nationwide referendum, and in October 1993, Aliyev was elected President of Azerbaijan. In May 1994, Aliyev entered into a ceasefire agreement that still remains in force <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day.</b> However, the conflict remained unresolved, with Armenian control over Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E
25|$|He was {{set free}} {{at the end}} of 1925, but Germany had become {{dangerous}} for him, and he obtained work at a shipyard in the Netherlands. He immediately took contact with Canne-Meyer, whom he had not known personally, {{in order to be able}} to integrate himself into the situation in the Netherlands. Departing from this contact, ex—members of the KPN and/or the KAPN regrouped slowly, and in 1927 formed the GIC which published a review, Press Material of the International Communists (PIC), as well as an edition in German. It closely followed the evolution of the KAPD in Germany and oriented itself more towards the Theses of the Berlin KAPD, in opposition to the group around Gorter. Over four years, the GIC studied and discussed the study which Appel had made in prison, and the book Foundations of Communist Production and Distribution was published in 1930 by the Berlin AAU, a book which has been discussed and criticised by revolutionaries throughout the world <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

25|$|For the 1996 season, Oklahoma hired former player John Blake as head coach. Blake was the {{favorite}} to succeed Schnellenberger and {{was backed by}} Barry Switzer, Steve Owens, and former Oklahoma president George Lynn Cross. However, many were skeptical of Oklahoma's choice for the new coach. His coaching experience was very limited, especially compared to his predecessor. In his seven-year coaching career (four years at OU, three years with the Dallas Cowboys and one year at Tulsa), {{he had never been}} more than a position coach. The skeptics were proven right. In Blake's first season, he went 3–8. It was the worst record, percentage wise, Oklahoma had experienced since 1895 and is tied for the most losses in one year (along with Blake's 1997 squad) <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day.</b> In his three years at Oklahoma, Blake went 3–8, 4–8, and 5–6 for a final record of 12–22. It was the first time since 1922–1924 that Oklahoma had three consecutive losing seasons. Blake's largest contribution to the team was his recruiting. He set the stage by recruiting several players that would help lead the program's resurgence, including J.T. Thatcher, Josh Norman, Roy Williams and Rocky Calmus. Many of them got a chance to play fairly quickly, since Blake's teams were often out of games early. Blake was fired after the 1998 season.|$|E

500|$|Despite its notorious reputation, {{there were}} a few cases of honest and hardworking karung guni men who made good, and became millionaires. One was Poon Buck Seng who started his {{business}} with only a capital of S$50 by picking up junk, or paying small amounts for things people were throwing away in the 1980s. He would then take his goods to sell at the Sungei Road Thieves' Market. Within seven years, he had saved enough money to rent a shop space nearby, and expanded his business to sell bigger used items like computers, refrigerators, videotape recorders and television sets, in addition to old clothes, shoes and records. In 1993, he registered his second-hand goods trading business and began to focus his business in exporting used computer parts, as there were not many people doing that back then, and his business thrived. He made a few thousand dollars every month and five years later, Poon had saved enough money to buy a [...] freehold property worth S$730,000 and was offered S$1.4 million for the unit in a collective sale later. His export business lasted only 10 years. By 2002, Poon's business was declining as too many people had jumped onto the bandwagon.
