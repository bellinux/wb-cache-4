50|$|The {{concepts}} of reform mathematics which the NCTM introduced in 1989 favors an alternative approach. It proposes {{a deeper understanding}} of the underlying theory instead of memorization of specific methods will allow students to develop individual methods which solve the same problems. Students' alternative algorithms are often just as correct, efficient, and generalizable as the standard algorithms, and maintain emphasis on the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>involved,</b> especially as relates to place values (something that is usually lost in the memorization of standard algorithms). The development of sophisticated calculators has made manual calculation less important (see the note on square roots, above) and cursory teaching of traditional methods has created failure among many students. Greater achievement among all types of students is among the primary goals of mathematics education put forth by NCTM. Some researchers such as Constance Kamii have suggested that elementary arithmetic, as traditionally taught, is not appropriate in elementary school. Many first editions of textbooks written to the original 1989 standard such as TERC deliberately discouraged teaching of any particular method, instead devoting class and homework time to the solving of nontrivial problems, which stimulate students to develop their own methods of calculation, rooted in number sense and place value. This emphasis by no means excludes the learning of number facts; indeed, a major goal of early mathematical education is procedural fluency.|$|E
5000|$|The neoclassical {{economist}} Christopher Bliss comments:"...what {{one might}} call the existential aspect of capital theory has not attracted much interest in the past 25 years. A small bandof ‘true believers’ has kept up the assault on capital theory orthodoxy until today, and from their company comes {{at least one of}} my co-editerssic. I shall call that loosely connected school the Anglo-Italian theorists. Nosimple name is ideal, but the one I have chosen indicates at least that the influences of PieroSraffa and Joan Robinson, in particular, are of central importance. Even in that case, there is aflavour of necrophilia in the air. If one asks the question: what new idea has come out ofAnglo-Italian thinking in the past 20 years?, one creates an embarrassing social situation. Thisis because {{it is not clear that}} anything new has come out of the old, bitter debates.Meanwhile mainstream theorizing has taken different directions. Interest has shifted from general equilibrium style (high-dimension) models to simple, mainly one-good models. Ramsey-style dynamic-optimization models have largely displaced the fixed-saving coefficient approach. The many consumers that Stiglitz implanted into neoclassical growth modelling did not flourish there. Instead the representative agent is usually now the model's driver. Finally, the exogenous technical progress of Harrod, and most writers on growth from whatever school in the 1960s and later, has been joined by numerous models which make technical progress endogenous in one of the several possible ways......Can the old concerns about capital be taken out, dusted down and addressed to contemporary models? If that could be done, one would hope that its contribution could be more constructive than the mutually assured destruction approach that marred some of the 1960s debates. It is evident that richer models yield richer possibilities. They do not do that in proportion when optimization drives model solutions. However, we know that many-agent models can have multiple equilibria when all agents optimize. There may be fruitful paths forward in that direction.Old contributions should best be left buried when they involve using capital as a stick to beat marginal theory. All optima imply marginal conditions in some form. These conditions are part of an overall solution.
