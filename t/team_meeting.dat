In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a <b>team</b> <b>meeting</b> the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} people with {{multiple}} chronic conditions increases as a result of ageing. To deal with the complex health-care needs of these patients, it is important that health-care professionals collaborate in interprofessional teams. To deliver patient-centred care, it is often recommended to include the patient {{as a member of the}} team. Objective: To gain more insight into how health-care professionals and patients, who are used to participate in interprofessional <b>team</b> <b>meetings,</b> experience and organize patient participation in the <b>team</b> <b>meetings.</b> Methods: A qualitative study including observations of meetings (n= 8), followed by semi-structured interviews with participating health-care professionals (n= 8), patients and/or relatives (n= 11). Professionals and patients were asked about their experiences of patient participation immediately after the <b>team</b> <b>meetings.</b> Results from both observations and interviews were analysed using content analysis. Results: The findings show a variety of influencing factors related to patient participation that can be divided into five categories: (i) structure and task distribution, (ii) group composition, (iii) relationship between professionals and patients or relatives, (iv) patients’ characteristics and (v) the purpose of the meeting. Conclusion: Patient participation during <b>team</b> <b>meetings</b> was appreciated by professionals and patients. A tailored approach to patient involvement during <b>team</b> <b>meetings</b> is preferable. When considering the presence of patients in <b>team</b> <b>meetings,</b> it is recommended to pay attention to patients’ willingness and ability to participate, and the necessary information shared before the meeting.
