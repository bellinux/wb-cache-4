25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle <b>the</b> <b>stressor</b> by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on responsiveness.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} to what extent southwest Georgia principals perceive they are stressed, identify principal <b>stressors</b> and how <b>the</b> <b>stressors</b> impact <b>the</b> principals’ work.

Therefore; it is important to understand what causes principal stress as well as how <b>the</b> <b>stressors</b> impact principal work. Principals are expected to maintain building safety, student safety, student achievement, retention of quality teachers, as well as act as instructional leaders.

The major findings of the study indicated 67 % of the southwest Georgia principals perceived they experienced medium to high levels of stress.

The impact of <b>the</b> <b>stressors</b> were identified as accountability measures such as teacher evaluations were ineffective and timely, discipline and paperwork prevents principals from being instructional leaders, central office policies and procedures impact principals’ time in their buildings, and workload and time constraints cause principals to work late or take work home thus impacting family time...|$|R

Method and Material: The single group pre-experiment model with pre-test – post-test was used. The participants were selected from a group of 100 patients who were undergoing treatment in 2011, at the Hemodialysis Units of two state hospitals in North Cyprus. The sampling composed of 90 patients who met the screening criteria and fully consented {{to take part in the}} study conducted between January 2011 and June 2011.

Results: It was observed that as <b>the</b> <b>stressors</b> increased in hemodialysis patients, the self-care strength and adjustment to illness decreased. Additionally, it was also found that as the self-care strength increased the adjustments to illness also increased. Furthermore, it was determined that <b>the</b> <b>stressors</b> of female patients were higher compared to male patients.
