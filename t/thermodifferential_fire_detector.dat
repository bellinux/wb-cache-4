40|$|Rack type {{warehouses}} {{are different}} from general buildings in the kinds, amount, and arrangement of stored goods, so the fire risk of rack type warehouses is different from those buildings. The fire pattern of rack type warehouses is different in combustion characteristic and storing condition of stored goods. The initial fire burning rate is different in the surface condition of materials, but the running time of fire is closely related {{with the kinds of}} stored materials and stored conditions. The stored goods of the warehouse are consisted of diverse combustibles, combustible liquid, and so on.

During this procedure, the lamp intensity is measured by a photodetector contained within the unit, and the microprocessor adjusts the lamp current to insure that its intensity remains within a preset range of values.

40|$|AbstractMost {{but not all}} fires emit smoke {{aerosols}} at {{some point}} during the combustion process. Therefore most conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> are based on the detection of smoke by light scattering. As every fire is emitting specific gases it is reasonable to upgrade photoelectric <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> or even replace them for specific environments with gas sensor based technologies. In this paper we present some gas detection technologies which have the potential to be able to amend or replace existing systems for use especially in residential <b>fire</b> <b>detectors.</b> But here some restrictions apply when using gas sensors. Among others these are low cost, low power and long term requirements. We identified advantages but also some challenges of gas detection technologies by testing colorimetric gas sensors, gas sensitive field effect transistors and metal oxide sensors. As most technologies are not completely selective to the target gas and as there is not “the” fire with one specific mixture of combustion gases it is helpful to combine different sensing elements in sensor arrays where algorithms using pattern recognition methods like PLSDA, PCA etc. can be used to increase the prediction reliability and the false alarm robustness. Here we focused on typical combustion gases like CO, CO 2, NO, NO 2, NH 3 and H 2...|$|R

Perhaps {{the most essential}} characteristic for these fire detection and suppression systems is high reliability; in other words, <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> should alarm only on actual fires and not be falsely activated by extraneous sources. Existing types of <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> have been greatly improved in the past decade; however, fundamental limitations of their method of operation leaves open a significant possibility of false alarms and restricts their usefulness.

Hardware prototypes of the Machine Vision (MV) Fire Detection System have undergone live fire tests and demonstrated extremely high accuracy in discriminating actual fires from false alarm sources. In fact, this technology promises to virtually eliminate false activations. This detector could be used to monitor fueling facilities, launch towers, clean rooms, and other high-value and high-risk areas.
