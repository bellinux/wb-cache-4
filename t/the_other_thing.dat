That was <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> we {{wanted to do was to}} make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view.

Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E

[...] "The federal government pays for security, which is the highest cost of the Olympics ... <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> they pay for is infrastructure ... There's no city tax money whatsoever ... We are very strong in that position ... in the regard to having that be sponsored by the private sector and others."

500|$|... "Three of a Kind" [...] {{functions}} as a sequel of sorts to the fifth season episode [...] "Unusual Suspects", concluding a minor story-arc featuring The Lone Gunmen and Susanne Modeski, the woman who {{led to the creation}} of the trio. At the time of filming for [...] "Three of a Kind", David Duchovny, who portrays Fox Mulder, was unavailable for filming because he was preparing his directing debut, [...] "The Unnatural". Only David Duchovny's voice appears in the episode, during a scene when The Lone Gunmen electronically synthesize it in order to convince Scully to travel to Las Vegas. In order to compensate for this loss, co-executive producers Vince Gilligan and John Shiban decided to write an episode based around The Lone Gunmen. The two wanted to bring back several characters and unresolved plot lines, mostly notably the disappearance of Susanne Modeski. Gilligan explained, [...] "I'd been thinking a lot about what happened to Susanne Modeski—what happened to her after she drove off with X in that mysterious car at the end of 'Unusual Suspects'". Gilligan and Shiban soon formulated a plot that revolved around the Lone Gunmen in Las Vegas. [...] "Las Vegas just seemed a really good place to put these guys. First of all, because the idea of them running through a casino is instantly hilarious. But <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> [...] is that Las Vegas is in some ways the most watched city in the world". Furthermore, Michael McKean, who portrayed Morris Fletcher in the two-part episode [...] "Dreamland", makes a brief cameo as one of the men flirting with Scully.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1999 New York Times story, [...] "C.E.O.

2500|$|Rutten's {{main reason}} {{of success in}} Pancrase was his well-rounded {{fighting}} style, excelling both in striking and grappling. His stand-up offensive, learned from the Dutch school of muay thai, was aggressive yet deceptively technical. According to Frank Shamrock, it often intimidated other fighters. He would say, [...] "His kickboxing was devastating. It was something everybody feared. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> he had was {{a basic understanding of}} real fighting... Bas had that street fighter mentality." [...] One of his favored tactics was unbalancing his opponents with push kicks against the ring ropes before overwhelming them with palm strikes and body punches, nullifying their ability to counterattack or defend. Also, Rutten never developed an effective takedown defense, but he was apt in landing strikes while being taken down, having knocked out opponents before they could complete the technique. The most famous aspect of his striking, however, was his scientific skill to target the opponent's liver, using punches, knees and kicks to damage it and incapacitate his adversary.|$|E

At the opportunity to recover important artifacts, Dr. Jones transforms into [...] "Indiana," [...] a [...] "non-superhero superhero" [...] image he has concocted for himself. Producer Frank Marshall said, [...] "Indy [...] a fallible character. He makes mistakes and gets hurt. ... That's <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> people like: He's a real character, not a character with superpowers." [...] Spielberg said there [...] "was the willingness to allow our leading man to get hurt and to express his pain and to get his mad out and to take pratfalls and sometimes be the butt of his own jokes. I mean, Indiana Jones is not a perfect hero, and his imperfections, I think, make the audience feel that, with a little more exercise and a little more courage, they could be just like him." [...] According to Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode, Indiana created his heroic figure so as to escape the dullness of teaching at a school. Both of Indiana's personas reject one another in philosophy, creating a duality. Harrison Ford said the fun of playing the character was because Indiana is both a romantic and a cynic, while scholars have analyzed Indiana as having traits of a lone wolf; a man on a quest; a noble treasure hunter; a hardboiled detective; a human superhero; and an American patriot.|$|E

If he were influenced by the Beatles, there'd be more fuzz tone and a few sitars on our records, but there never have been, really."

[...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway.
