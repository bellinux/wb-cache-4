40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis concerns proceedings {{dealing with}} regressive compensations in health insurance, that {{is guided by}} law No. 187 / 2006 Coll. about health insurance. The regressive compensation as such takes place when a certain person causes, by his or hers unlawful action, as found by court or other authority, a reason for amount of compensation to another person and is obliged to reimburse the health insurance institution by a prescribed amount. Most often this {{is a result of}} traffic accidents, less frequently as a result of physical attacks or fights. The amount that is prescribed as a reimbursement is determined by the actual compensation paid. Together with proceedings about being ordered to pay this regressive compensation, there are other preceedings also concerning regressive compensations, such as pardoning of this regressive payment in which it has been decide for the benefit of concerned person only for reasons defined by law, such as immediate danger of his malnourishment. Also, the proceedings may start about the person being allowed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> <b>instalments.</b> This may permit the person to pay a certain amounts at certain conditions as prescribed by the decision. The law also permits cancellation of this insatllment payments option, when the agreed upon conditions are not met. This is a relatively new system that is relatively welcomed by the organs of health insurance, mainly because of the recovery of a certain amount that had been previously wrongly paid. This work is divided into five chapters, dealing with individual components concerning regressive compensation and their relevant proceedings. The first chapter of this work is focused on general information cocerning health insurance. It is divided at several subchapters, dealing with law status, basic principles, subjects of health insurance, group of insured persons, institutional security and a very important subchapter, which is important just for determination of regressive compensations, such as the amount of health insurance and tied to it, the health status determined by an involved physician or medical adjudicating comission. The second chapter deals with proceedings about regressive compensations in health insurance, description of its various stages, such as the commencement, pausing and stopping of the procedure, including the issuance of the decisision and eventual appelation. Included is also a basic information about the pinciples and subjects of these proceedings. Tied to this are the relevant rules and processes that are part of lawful relationships in health insurance, being governed by law No. 500 / 2005 Coll. about administrative rule, unless set by later rules No. 187 / 2006 Coll. about health insurance, otherwise. The result of these proceedings is the issuance of the decision, including the entitlement and the amount. The third chapter analyses various types of regressive compensations, such as the pardoning of the regressive compensation, allowing to pay by installments and cancellation of this option. The fourth chapter gives the statistical survey about the development of regressive compensations since their establishment on Jannuary 1, 2009, when the determination § 126 was created. Statistical tables show numerical data about the number of issued decisions and the amounts of compensations in each individual year. The fifth and final chapter contains the closing comments on the topic and suggests possible improvements of practical usage. The aim of this thesis is the analysis and the clearest possible description and definition of the valid law modification, focused on regressive compensations in health insurance, so that it, together with the literature cited, could serve as a source of information, or improve the orientation of eventual direct or indirect participants of these proceedings...|$|E
25|$|Most councillors contemplating delaying {{setting a}} rate {{considered}} that the crucial point would {{come at the}} point in the year when the first rate payments would have become due; if the council had not set a rate at that point, it would be unable to recover the interest on the payments due to have been made to it. The General Rate Act 1967 section 50 and schedule 10 gave ratepayers the right <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> ten <b>instalments</b> which were to be paid at monthly intervals during the year. With a financial year ending on 31 March, the latest date to start the payment was 1 July; the council had to give ten days' notice of a payment being due, so the latest date for setting a rate without incurring irrecoverable debts was 20 June.|$|R

Blaney was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, becoming the first government minister from Donegal, however, he moved to the position of Minister for Local Government at the end of 1957 following the death of Seán Moylan. Blaney proved to be an innovative minister and his first task as minister was to prepare the groundwork for the referendum to scrap the proportional representation electoral system and replace it with the first-past-the-post voting system. The referendum failed to be passed, however, Blaney was retained in the post when Lemass succeeded de Valera as Taoiseach in 1959. In 1963 he introduced the Planning Act to rationalise planning throughout the local authorities in the state. This act also created the agency, An Forás Forbatha, to bring planning experts together. His department underwent a very large programme to provide piped water to rural homes. In 1965 Blaney introduced the Road Traffic Act which required that motorists take a driving test in roadworthy cars. During his tenure it became possible <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> rates <b>by</b> <b>instalment</b> and he also introduced legislation which entitled non-nationals to vote in local elections.|$|R

After reviewing more than 100 studies, {{we set up}} a data set that has 332 valuations from 38 distinct studies. Based on the data set, we estimate a linear valuation model, which can then be used to predict the mean willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> households living in a given region for water quality improvement at a given site. For instance, the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> a typical household living in the state of Iowa for a water quality increase from 40 to 50 (out of 100) at a one-square-mile aquatic site, like Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s Spirit Lake, is predicted to be 137. 52. The valuation model developed in this paper is particularly convenient when we want to evaluate the benefit of a project that aims at improving water quality, but a primary study is too costly or time consuming...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} less {{attention}} has been paid to the equity and public goods aspects of willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for water. The pricing of water services are an important element of urban infrastructure. The absence of good water services can cause serious public health implications as well as substandard living conditions for the affected families. Presently for most of the infrastructure development projects of water supply, studies on willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> consumers are carried out. However most of these are not successfully completed and implemented. Being a developing country it is therefore important to find out the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for public utilities in order to optimize the resource inputs without causing too much economic hardships. This research attempts to develop a questionnaire for WTP study, to develop equations to estimate the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for water in the Trincomalee district.

The questionnaire was developed after and extensive review of previous literatures available on this subject.

Since willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>by</b> consumers is an important part of the economic feasibility of projects in water supply, this study has made recommendations such that NWS&DBcan plan and carryout WTP study accurately and easily...|$|R
