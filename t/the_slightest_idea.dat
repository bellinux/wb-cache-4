500|$|Several writers {{felt that}} the novel left much to be desired {{following}} Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: [...] "One finishes Great Gatsby {{with a feeling of}} regret, not for the fate {{of the people in the}} book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald." [...] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, [...] "Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw." [...] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book [...] "a minor performance... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical." [...] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style [...] "painfully forced", noting that the editors of the paper were [...] "quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day." [...] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: [...] "All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> what the book was about." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the trial}} progressed, {{it became clear}} that {{convictions}} were unlikely. The New York Times reported that [...] "Evidence in the trial is extremely perplexing and suggests wholesale perjury on both sides. What the result ought to be nobody has <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>idea,</b> but it is taken for granted that a French jury will not punish French citizens, and that Italy will be supplied with a large and valuable grievance." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1977 {{historical}} {{analysis of}} women in sports, New York Times columnist William C. Rhoden wrote, [...] "Althea Gibson and Wilma Rudolph are, without question, the most significant athletic forces among black women in sports history. While Rudolph's accomplishments brought more visibility to women as athletes ... Althea's accomplishments were more revolutionary because of the psychosocial impact on black America. [...] Even to those blacks who hadn't <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> of where or what Wimbledon was, her victory, like Jackie Robinson's in baseball and Jack Johnson's in boxing, proved again that blacks, when given an opportunity, could compete at any level in American society." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1926 Briggs was {{appointed}} assistant director {{for research and}} testing by National Bureau of Standards Director George Kimball Burgess. On Burgess's death in 1932, Briggs was nominated by US President Herbert C. Hoover to Burgess {{as director of the}} National Bureau of Standards. However, none of Hoover's nominations were acted on by the US Congress before he left office. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as president in 1933 he was pressed to name [...] "a good Democrat" [...] as director of the National Bureau of Standards. Roosevelt, not wishing to make a patronage appointment, replied, [...] "I haven't <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> whether Briggs is a Republican or a Democrat; all I know is that he is the best qualified man for the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earlier, Cockburn {{had been}} moved to present rebuttals to the JFK {{assassination}} conspiracy theories by the Oliver Stone film JFK {{when it came out}} in 1991. He wrote in 1993 that [...] "In all the assassinology I've read or seen, Oswald is always unpersuasive. In JFK Oliver Stone hadn't <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> how to portray him, which pointed up the weakness of his artistic insight and the preposterous premises on which it was based." [...] He interpreted the assassination as an attempt by Lee Harvey Oswald, whom he deemed a leftist, to [...] "take the pressure off Fidel Castro", and to that end it was successful {{at the level of the}} propaganda of the deed, Cockburn claims, because President Johnson later [...] "suspended the CIA assassination bids" [...] against Castro. He reiterated this view at a conference in 2010.|$|E

5000|$|The Independent {{gave the}} album a {{negative}} review, stating that [...] "too {{many of these}} tracks are <b>slight</b> <b>ideas</b> and punning phrasework over-egged into grotesque wedding-cakes by Dudley's billowing strings, leaving Fry stranded in the position summarised in [...] "Brighter Than The Sun": [...] "I'm a man out of time/Looking for a mountain to climb"." ...|$|R
2500|$|Davis {{was born}} to a {{sharecropping}} couple, the former Sarah Elizabeth Works (1877–1965) and Samuel Jones Davis (1873–1945), in the now-ghost town of Beech Springs southeast of Quitman in Jackson Parish in north Louisiana. The family was so poor that young Jimmie {{did not have a}} bed in which to sleep until he was nine years old. Davis was not sure of his date of birth; according to the New York Times, [...] "Various newspaper and magazine articles over the last 70 years said he was born in 1899, 1901, 1902 or 1903. He told The New York Times several years ago that his sharecropper parents could never recall just when he was born – he was, after all, one of 11 children – and that he had not had <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> when it really was." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Davis was not sure exactly how old he was, noting only that he was born {{around the turn of the}} last century." [...] The birth date listed on his Country Music Hall of Fame plaque is September 11, 1902. However, the 1900 US Census attests to his being born in September 1899.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1901, some {{explanation}} for Diver's stuttering end to his cricket career emerged in newspaper {{reports of a}} court case in Walsall in which the North Worcestershire Brewery Company petitioned the police court {{to be allowed to}} transfer the licence of the Priory Hotel, Walsall, from Diver to his wife, Alice, on account of the fact that Diver had disappeared. Mrs Diver is reported to have told the court that her husband left on 12 November and that [...] "she had not <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>idea</b> that he was going away". A hotel guest had told her that Diver had been seen at Queenstown taking a ship for New York, but she had not heard from him since his disappearance. The licence was duly transferred temporarily to Mrs Diver, who was reported to have had [...] "considerable experience in the trade"; the police insisted that Diver {{should not be allowed to}} hold the licence if he reappeared, and Mrs Diver said that she [...] "would not allow her husband to live at or take part in the management of the house if he came back". A report in February 1902 noted that the transfer of the licence had been made permanent and that Diver's whereabouts were [...] "still unknown".|$|E

6000|$|Lord Fawn {{had some}} <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> of {{waiting to see}} the cousin go; but as Greystock had a similar idea, and as he was the {{stronger}} of the two, of course Lord Fawn went. He perhaps remembered that the Hansom cab was at the door,--costing sixpence every fifteen minutes,--and that he wished to show himself in the House of Lords before the peers rose.

The executives felt that viewers were not supposed to be [...] "confused" [...] after watching and must have at least a <b>slight</b> <b>idea</b> of what was going on.
