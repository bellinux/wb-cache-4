5|$|In 2014, MacFarlane executive-produced a two-season, 20-episode {{series called}} Blunt Talk for Starz. The series {{followed}} an English newscaster who moves to Los Angeles with his alcoholic manservant and <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> of several failed marriages {{to host a}} sanctimonious talk show.|$|E
5|$|Once {{south of}} the river, Asad, believing himself to be safe from pursuit, ordered his men to set up camp and sent orders to Ibrahim to halt <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> train and {{likewise}} set up camp. The Turgesh khaghan, after consulting the local rulers, followed {{the advice of the}} ruler of al-Ishtikhan and led his army to cross the river en masse. Faced with a full-scale charge of the Turgesh and their allies' cavalry, the Arabs withdrew to their camp. The Turgesh attacked the camp but were turned back after a fight in which, according to al-Tabari, the Arabs' servants put on pack-saddle cloths as armour and used the tent-poles to strike at the riders' faces.During the night the Turgesh departed, and rode south to overtake the Arab baggage train. Ibrahim ibn Asim had dug a trench around his encampment and his troops managed to beat off the first attacks by the khaghans Sogdian allies. Then the khagan, after climbing a hill and scouting out the dispositions of <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> escort, dispatched a portion of his men to attack the camp from behind, focusing on the allied Iranian troops from Saghaniyan, {{while the rest of the}} army attacked the Muslims from the front. The Turgesh attack almost annihilated the defenders: the greater part of the troops of Saghaniyan, along with their king, the Saghan Khudah, fell, and the Turgesh seized most of <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> train. Only the timely arrival of Asad with the main Arab army saved the remnant of <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> train escort from destruction. According to the account of al-Tabari, the Turgesh launched another unsuccessful attack on Asad's camp the following day, 1 October 737, and then departed.|$|E

5000|$|Provision {{of a new}} <b>Baggage</b> Handling System: <b>The</b> new {{high-speed}} system, which links Terminal 2 {{with the}} new passenger concourse, aims to transport <b>the</b> first <b>baggage</b> to <b>the</b> luggage belt upon 20 minutes of passengers’ arrival and <b>the</b> last <b>baggage</b> within 40 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Fallback tags are pre-printed or demand-printed tags for {{use only}} by <b>the</b> airport's <b>baggage</b> {{handling}} system. These tags are used {{when there is}} a problem in communication between the carrier's departure control system and <b>the</b> airport's <b>baggage</b> handling system (as defined in IATA Recommended Practice 1740b).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>baggage</b> camel {{should be}} robust and heavy. Studies have {{recommended}} the camel should have either a small {{or a large}} head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy. The dromedary can be trained to carry baggage {{from the age of}} five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six. The hawia is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan. The methods of training <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> camels are similar to those for riding camels.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} army, Anitha employs {{a group of}} porters headed by Muthu, to {{transport}} <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> during the journey. The crew embark on their voyage leading them to an island, Min-gua, near Vietnam. The island borders 3 countries: Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. They face seven traps set by the Cholas: sea creatures, cannibals, warriors, snakes, hunger, quicksand and a village. Many porters and army men are killed by these traps.|$|E
5|$|On campaign, {{following}} {{the assembly of}} the various squadrons at fortified bases (aplēkta) along the coast, the fleet consisted of the main body, composed of the oared warships, and <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> train (touldon) of sailing vessels and oared transports, which would be sent away {{in the event of}} battle. The battle fleet was divided into squadrons, and orders were transmitted from ship to ship through signal flags (kamelaukia) and lanterns.|$|E

Mr. Holiday said yes. So she put the valise and the carpet bag into her basket, and walked away with them to the inn.|$|R
5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards from the top of <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} wreck, {{when the rain}} had subsided, Captain Holland sent members of the Rifle Corps and the York and Lancaster Regiment to {{retrieve}} some baggage from the ship, which was stuck on the rocks and had not sunk. The operation was called off at 10:00, when First Lieutenant St. John decided that the wreck was too dangerous. <b>The</b> <b>baggage</b> that had been recovered was taken to shore.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Jacksonville International Airport, Florida, several hours before the accident, although the departure from Jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over New York {{and the removal of}} <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> of a passenger who decided not to board the jet. The instrument approach landing was uneventful and the jet was not significantly delayed while in the air waiting to land, however congestion on the taxiways at LaGuardia delayed the arrival of the aircraft at the gate.|$|E

5|$|A$330million {{expansion}} programme for Terminal 2 {{was announced}} in 2007 and was completed in 2012. The objectives of this project include new lounges and retail facilities, a new satellite terminal, increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new satellite terminal features floor-to-ceiling windows offers views of the North-South runway. The new concourse includes three double-decker aerobridges which are gates 16, 18 and 20, each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. <b>The</b> <b>baggage</b> handling capacity will be increased, and two new baggage carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic. Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011 but was opened in 2012.|$|E

5|$|By this time, {{many of the}} 1970s repairs were {{beginning}} to wear down, and the city put aside its plans for the maritime museum. The New London Railroad Company, fronted by historian Barbara Timken and local businessman Todd O'Donnell, bought the station from the city as the New London Railroad Company in 2002. The pair organized a second full restoration of the station, including a new slate roof, restored brickwork, and restoration of the waiting room to its original configuration. The mezzanine level and basement atrium created in the 1976 renovation were removed. Additionally, mechanical systems were upgraded and various accessibility concerns addressed. <b>The</b> <b>baggage</b> room was restored for Greyhound use. Amtrak and Greyhound rent space from the company for offices and passenger waiting areas.|$|E

5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{arrived at}} the airport after the plane landed. The {{aircraft}} was moved to a remote area so authorities could re-screen the plane, the passengers, and <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> on board. A bomb-defusing robot was first used to board the plane, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) interviewed all passengers. Another passenger from the flight was placed in handcuffs after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{the station}} owners {{sent a letter}} of concern to the state, seeking that the Environmental Impact Report for the museum and {{footbridge}} consider a breadth of possible impacts, particularly from the footbridge. The museum itself received a Finding Of No Significant Impact in March 2014. The Environmental Impact Evaluation for the footbridge, released in July 2014, analyzed seven alternatives for the footbridge location. Alternative 5a, located east of <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> building and including a section to the garage, was the preferred alternative. The state committed $20 million towards {{the cost of the}} potential footbridge.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Battle of Zürich, the French regained {{control of}} the city, {{along with the rest}} of Switzerland. Notably, Masséna out-generaled Korsakov; {{surrounded}} him, tricked him, and then took more than half his army as a prisoner. Massena also captured <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> train and most of Korsakov cannons, and inflicted over 8,000 casualties. Most of the fighting took place on both banks of the river Limmat, up to the gates of Zürich, and in part within the city itself. Zürich had declared itself neutral, and was spared general destruction. General Oudinot commanded the French forces on the right bank and general Joseph Mortier, those on the left.|$|E

5|$|Marceau splits {{her time}} between seeing to {{the duties of}} the train (such as helping to fix the heat in the engine), {{interviewing}} passengers about the murder, and examining the train and surrounding area for clues. She travels to several additional locations that Poirot does not travel to in the book, such as the engine, <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> car, and an old shack outside of the snowed in train. Additionally, a sabotaged ham radio is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew and ask him to research the passengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building's interior initially {{had dark}} wood panels and {{was decorated with}} flowers, oriental rugs on the terrazzo floor, and tables and chairs in the Mission style. In 1959, when the library moved in, local architect and village resident William Anders Sharman planned the building's $2,000 renovation; he later became {{the first president of}} the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society. The station's circular ticket office was replaced by the librarian's desk, bookshelves replaced station furniture, and <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> room became the children's section. Former library president Theodore R. Malsin dedicated the children's room in memory of his son Donald. From 1959 until 2009, the building housed a main reading room and children's room; a vestibule and second-story balcony were added in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Unique to this {{adaptation}} of the story, Marceau finds additional clues such as a crate full of living accommodations in the security vault of <b>the</b> <b>baggage</b> compartment {{and a picture of}} Michel's family, despite the fact that Poirot's nephew radios that the man has none. After explaining the second solution, Poirot reveals that Michel is not who he appears, but is in fact Robert Perkinson, Cassetti's criminal partner. Perkinson confirms this to the shock of the other passengers and reveals that Cassetti kept Daisy Armstrong at his house, but Cassetti gunned down Perkinson's daughter, Teresa, whom he mistook for Daisy.|$|E
