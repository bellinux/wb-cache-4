Distribution of managers functions {{is based on the}} concept of authors Harold Koontz and Heinz Weihrich relating to planning, organizing, human resources, leadership and control. The practical part focuses on monitoring managers of middle management and their time planning individual functions and activities. Observations were made with the project manager and manager of purchasing and logistics. In the form were recorded the same and different activities within each managers functions. The result was that the project manager spent the most time on planning on the contrary the manager of purchasing and logistics focuses the most on organizing. Primary data were obtained based on the survey to subordinates and individual interviews with managers. The questionnaires and the interviews were compiled from questions relating to the managers functions and company KARSIT <b>Holding,</b> <b>s.</b> r. <b>o.</b> An important finding in the company is a lack of motivation for the employees and so is that the company doesnt use information system.

40|$|The {{neuronal}} {{mechanisms of}} parametric working memory – the short-term storage of graded stimuli to guide behavior – {{are not fully}} elucidated. We have designed a working memory task where rats compare two sequential vibrations, S 1 and S 2, delivered to their whiskers (Fassihi et al, 2014). Vibrations {{are a series of}} velocities sampled from a zero-mean normal distribution. Rats must judge which stimulus had greater velocity standard deviation, σ (e. g. σ 1 > σ 2 turn left, σ 1 < σ 2 turn right). A critical operation in this task is <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>S</b> 1 information in working memory for subsequent comparison. In an earlier work we uncovered this cognitive capacity in rats (Fassihi et al, 2014), an ability previously ascribed only to primates. Where in the brain is such a memory kept and {{what is the nature of}} its representation? To address these questions, we performed simultaneous multi-electrode recordings from barrel cortex – the entryway of whisker sensory information into neocortex – and prelimbic area of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) which is involved in higher order cognitive functioning in rodents.

40|$|The ERD 2 gene, which encodes {{the yeast}} HDEL (His-Asp-Glu-Leu) receptor, is {{essential}} for growth (Semenza, J. C., K. G. Hardwick, N. Dean, and H. R. B. Pelham. 1990. Cell. 61 : 1349 - 1357; Lewis, M. J., D. J. Sweet, and H. R. B. Pelham. 1990. Cell. 61 : 1359 - 1363). SED 5, when present in multiple copies, enables cells {{to grow in the}} absence of Erd 2 p. Sequence analysis of SED 5 reveals no significant homology with ERD 2 or other known genes. We have raised antibodies to Sed 5 p which specifically recognize a 39 -kD integral membrane protein. A stretch of hydrophobic residues at the COOH terminus is predicted <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>Sed</b> 5 p on the cytoplasmic face of intracellular membranes. Cells that are depleted of Sed 5 p are unable to transport carboxypeptidase Y to the Golgi complex, and stop growing after a dramatic accumulation of ER membranes and vesicles. We conclude that the SED 5 gene {{is essential for}} growth and that Sed 5 p is required for ER to Golgi transport. When Sed 5 p is overexpressed the efficiency of ER to Golgi transport is reduced, vesicles accumulate, and cellular morphology is perturbed. Immunofluorescence studies reveal that the bulk of Sed 5 p is not found on ER membranes but on punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm, the number of which increases upon SED 5 overexpression. We suggest that Sed 5 p has an essential role in vesicular transport between ER and Golgi compartments and that it may itself cycle between these organelles...|$|R

Prior sanctions {{played a crucial role}} in the international anti-proliferation architecture, but unilateral and non-comprehensive multilateral embargoes failed to achieve their desired deterrent effect. Now, with the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRA), the Obama Administration expands extraterritorial sanctions <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> U. <b>S.</b> parent corporations liable for the sanctionable activity of their foreign subsidiaries. While the ITRA marks a turning point in the sanctions game between the United States and Iran, the Act is unlikely to deter Iranian leaders from their nuclear program.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} Construction Grammar {{account of how}} the meaning of complex constructions, specifically, analytic causatives, emerges from an aggregation of simpler constructions, which individually have fairly abstract semantics, but which in combination encode very specific event types. The constructions investigated are make <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> V, have <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> V, have <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving, get <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, force <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, set <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> (to) Ving, drive <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, move <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, lead <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, bring self to V, send <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving, give <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to understand, and leave <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving. Three causation event types are posited {{that are relevant to}} an analysis of analytic causative constructions: the MANIPULATE type, where an animate causer intentionally acts on a causee in a way that influences the causee such that he or she performs some activity; the TRIGGER type, where an event occurs which influences a causee such that, given the nature of the causee, the causee will inevitably undergo some process; and the PROMPT type, where an event occurs and a causee perceives this event and decides to react by performing some activity. Any given analytic causative encodes a more specific version of {{one or more of these}} event types. The two simple constructions that contribute most to a given analytic causative are causation verbs (make, have, get, etc.) and sentential complements (the bare infinitive, the to-infinitive, the present participle, etc.). Which event type(s) can be encoded by a given analytic causative does not depend on the causation verb or the sentential complement alone. Instead, particular combinations of the two yield meanings that are either compatible or incompatible with a given event type. Also discussed in the dissertation are the passivization of matrix or embedded clauses in analytic causatives, the relationship between causation verbs and their lexical sources, and the relationship between analytic causatives and transitive constructions with change-of-state or motion verbs...|$|R
