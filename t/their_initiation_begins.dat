[...] Membership was open to any interested person and anyone attending an initiation were required to become members of the organization. <b>Initiations</b> typically <b>began</b> with a parade containing current members and new initiates, who were frequently [...] "captured" [...] and taken to <b>their</b> <b>initiations</b> in a cage which {{was included in the}} parade.|$|R

50|$|Girls are {{available}} for marriage as soon as <b>their</b> <b>initiation</b> is complete. The betrothal ceremony of girls before <b>their</b> <b>initiation</b> {{is the same as}} the actual wedding ceremony. Men may marry at any age. A marriage is arranged through a number of visits of the groom's father to the family of the girl he chooses. A dowry of cattle is promised. The itself ceremony may take up to three hours.|$|R

50|$|Serer {{religion}} and culture forbids the circumcision of girls (FGM). Serer girls receive <b>their</b> <b>initiation</b> by tattooing of the gum. There {{is also the}} Bok ceremony for young married women. This is a fertility rite.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of Ndut {{initiation}} rites. The first concerns the circumcision for Serer boys whilst the second concerns the initiation of Serer girls. Serer religion and culture forbids the circumcision of Serer girls (Female genital mutilation). Only Serer boys are circumcised. Serer girls receive <b>their</b> <b>initiation</b> through njam or ndom (the tattooing of the gums). Preparation for the initiation starts early in childhood. In many cases, boys are circumcised when they reach 13 years old. However {{it is not uncommon}} for some to be circumcised when they are 19 to 26 years old. Likewise, Serer girls receive <b>their</b> <b>initiation</b> when they are 11 to 18 years.|$|R
40|$|The ritual {{model of}} {{arranging}} a church follows {{the pattern of}} Christian <b>initiation.</b> <b>Initiation</b> <b>begins</b> with the font and leads to the table, and thereafter the journey passes by the font to recall baptism and rests in the hall for the liturgy of the word before culminating once again in communion.

50|$|The {{platelet}} activation pathway is triggered when stresses reach a level above 6 to 8 Pa (60-80 dyn/cm²). The steps {{involved with this}} are less clearly understood, but <b>initiation</b> <b>begins</b> with the binding of vWF from the plasma to GPIb on the platelet. This {{is followed by a}} large influx of Ca2+ ions, which activates the platelets. GPIIb-IIIa facilitates platelet-platelet adhesion during amplification. The propagation step is still under study.|$|R
50|$|Clagiraba {{is named}} from Clagiraba Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Coomera River. The name Clagiraba is derived from the indigenous name 'Kalagareebah' meaning young or single men's ground.

50|$|An Executive {{committee}} and a Publications committee were appointed, and members {{were invited to}} pay <b>their</b> <b>initiation</b> fees before leaving for home.

2500|$|In {{the tissue}} factor {{exposure}} path, <b>initiation</b> <b>begins</b> when cells are ruptured and expose tissue factor (TF). [...] Plasma Factor (f) VII binds to TF and sets off {{a chain reaction}} which activates fXa and fVa which bind to each other to produce thrombin which in turn activates platelets and fVIII. The platelets activate by binding to the damaged tissue in the initiation phase, and fibrin stabilizes the clot during the propagation phase.|$|R

50|$|This {{particular}} anticline is {{the most}} notable subsurface feature within the basin. Deformation events such as erosion of the uplifted crustal blocks, initiation of various faults, {{and the development of}} the submarine channel led to the anticline's formation. Fold <b>initiation</b> <b>began</b> in the late-Miocene to early Pliocene period of deformation. There are many other anticlines within the basin and isopach data suggests that the formation of these folds occurred mostly during the Pliocene.|$|R

40|$|Pathogen-associated {{molecular}} patterns (PAMPs) {{are known}} to be fundamental in instigating immune responses but their role in influencing these responses beyond <b>their</b> <b>initiation</b> is less well understood. Here, using the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is deficient in strong PAMPs, we demonstrate a requirement for the continuous expression of PAMPs for optimal anti-pathogen immunity. Although co-inoculating with, temporarily anchoring of and transgenic expression of exogenous PAMPs all result in enhanced early adaptive immune responses, only the continuous expression of bacterial PAMPs on transgenic T. cruzi sustains these responses, resulting in enhanced pathogen clearance. These findings demonstrate that PAMPs function to potentiate adaptive immune responses well beyond <b>their</b> <b>initiation</b> and may determine the efficiency of control of pathogens capable of long-term persistence...|$|R
