25|$|Lower transconductance: The <b>transconductance</b> of the MOSFET decides its {{gain and}} is {{proportional}} to hole or electron mobility (depending on device type), at least for low drain voltages. As MOSFET size is reduced, the fields in the channel increase and the dopant impurity levels increase. Both changes reduce the carrier mobility, and hence the <b>transconductance.</b> As channel lengths are reduced without proportional reduction in drain voltage, raising the electric field in the channel, the result is velocity saturation of the carriers, limiting the current and the <b>transconductance.</b>|$|E

Notation: r = base resistance of transistor, rO = output resistance, and gm = <b>transconductance.</b> The negative sign for h21 reflects the convention that I1, I2 are positive when directed into the two-port. A non-zero value for h12 means the output voltage affects the input voltage, that is, this amplifier is bilateral. If h12 = 0, the amplifier is unilateral.|$|E
25|$|Feedback is used {{to better}} match signal sources to their loads. For example, a direct {{connection}} of a voltage source to a resistive load may result in signal loss due to voltage division, but interjecting a negative feedback amplifier can increase the apparent load seen by the source, and reduce the apparent driver impedance seen by the load, avoiding signal attenuation by voltage division. This advantage is not restricted to voltage amplifiers, but analogous improvements in matching can be arranged for current amplifiers, <b>transconductance</b> amplifiers and transresistance amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|The MOSFET's {{advantages}} in digital circuits do not translate into supremacy in all analog circuits. The {{two types of}} circuit draw upon different features of transistor behavior. Digital circuits switch, spending {{most of their time}} either fully on or fully off. The transition {{from one to the other}} is only of concern with regards to speed and charge required. Analog circuits depend on operation in the transition region where small changes to Vgs can modulate the output (drain) current. The MOSFET and bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is preferred for accurate matching (of adjacent devices in integrated circuits), higher <b>transconductance</b> and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies.|$|E

40|$|Modulation-Doped Field Effect Transistors (MODFETs) {{have gained}} much {{attention}} {{in recent years}} because of their ultrahigh speed and inherently low device noise. In this thesis, a novel pseudomorphic MODFET structure has been proposed and realized with a very thin buffer layer and a p-i-n dipole layer. This dipole layers is used to shield the Fermi level pinning effect {{from the surface of}} GaAs substrate and minimize the thickness of GaAs buffer layer. For transistors with a gate length of 1. 8 μm and drain-to-source spacing of 5 μm, but different gate widths, the measured maximum <b>transconductances</b> (gm) are about 300 mS/mm, and the corresponding drain currents are about 220 mA/mm. These measured maximum <b>transconductances</b> (gm) are unusually high for devices with similar scale.

40|$|High-electron-mobility {{transistors}} (HEMTs) {{have been}} demonstrated on both AlN/sapphire templates and sapphire substrates, and the dc characteristics of the fabricated devices were examined at room temperature. Better dc characteristics with high extrinsic <b>transconductances</b> and drain current densities were observed in the HEMTs grown on AlN/sapphire templates {{when compared with the}} HEMTs on sapphire substrates. Extrinsic <b>transconductances</b> of 214 and 137 mS/mm for Wg/Lg = 15 / 2 μm HEMTs on AlN/sapphire templates and HEMTs on sapphire substrates were achieved, respectively. The enhancement of dc characteristics with small variations in threshold voltage (? 130 mV) is due to the reduction of dislocation density (1. 5 × 108 cm- 2). The decrease of dark spot density has been confirmed in the GaN grown on AlN/sapphire templates using cathodoluminescence measurements. The advantage of using AlN/sapphire templates is that low dislocation density GaN layers at a high temperature can be grown without using low-temperature-grown GaN buffer layers...|$|R

2500|$|In {{analog circuit}} design, the current-control view is {{sometimes}} used {{because it is}} approximately linear.

Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the emitter–base voltage is approximately constant, and that collector current is beta times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, Ebers–Moll) model is required. The voltage-control model requires an exponential function {{to be taken into}} account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a <b>transconductance,</b> as in the Ebers–Moll model, design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, in which the exponential I–V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose <b>transconductance</b> is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit design is performed using SPICE or a comparable analog circuit simulator, so model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer.|$|E
