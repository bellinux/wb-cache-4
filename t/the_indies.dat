5|$|Having {{resigned}} the Bishopric of Chiapas, Las Casas {{spent the}} rest of his life working closely with the imperial court in matters relating to <b>the</b> <b>Indies.</b> In 1551 he rented a cell at the College of San Gregorio, where he lived with his assistant and friend Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada. He continued working as a kind of procurator for the natives of <b>the</b> <b>Indies,</b> many of whom directed petitions to him to speak to the Emperor on their behalf. Sometimes indigenous nobility even related their cases to him in Spain, for example, the Nahua noble Francisco Tenamaztle from Nochistlán. His influence at court was so great that some even considered that he had the final word in choosing the members of the Council of <b>the</b> <b>Indies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Producers in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> {{would often}} handle {{multiple}} roles, such as director and cinematographer. When these positions were filled separately, the producer retained creative control. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that works produced {{during this time}} were emphatically commercial, {{not paying attention to}} nationalistic or aesthetic values. However, the film scholars Thomas Barker and Charlotte Setijadi-Dunn suggest that the Chinese-produced films from <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> offered the possibility of a heterogeneous national identity.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} required its own church building, {{and already}} owned land {{which could be}} used: in 1828 the Catholics had purchased a former hospital and the surrounding land in Gedangan, near the , and established an orphanage there. However, there were insufficient clergy for further development. Mgr. Joseph Lijnen (1815–82), who had become the congregation's pastor in 1858, left <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> for Heythuysen, Netherlands. There, he convinced several Franciscan nuns {{to join him in}} <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> and develop the congregation through education and ministry. Upon returning to <b>the</b> <b>Indies,</b> designs were made for a church building across from the orphanage and convent established for the nuns.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 112 fictional films {{are known to}} have been {{produced}} in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) between 1926 and the colony's dissolution in 1949. The earliest motion pictures, imported from abroad, were shown in late 1900, and by the early 1920s imported serials and fictional films were being shown, often with localised names. Dutch companies were also producing documentary films about <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> to be shown in the Netherlands. The first reports of fictional film production in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> date from 1923, although the work in question was not completed. The first locally produced film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng, was directed by L. Heuveldorp and released on 31 December 1926.|$|E
5|$|By 1938 PahWongso {{had married}} {{and opened a}} school for poor children, {{particularly}} those of mixed Chinese descent, in Gang Patikee; it was funded by donations. He was {{also a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> branch of the Red Cross, and recognized for his humanitarian work. He organised night fairs in various cities in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> (including in Yogyakarta, Semarang, and Surabaya), holding auctions and selling drinks and snacks in order to raise money to send aid to China, then fighting against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> film industry, Union {{released}} its first film, Kedok Ketawa, in July 1940. This {{was followed by a}} series of films penned by Saeroen which were increasingly oriented towards the Indies' growing intelligentsia and attempted to distance themselves from the theatrical conventions which were common in the contemporary film industry. This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism. Following the Japanese occupation of <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> in March 1942, Union was dissolved, though its films continued to be screened into the mid 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Film {{production}} in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> declined after the Japanese occupation began in early 1942; the overlords forced {{all but one}} studio to close. In their place, the Japanese opened their own studio in <b>the</b> <b>Indies,</b> Nippon Eigasha, to produce propaganda for the war effort. Kartolo acted in the studio's only feature film, Berdjoang (Hope of the South), without Roekiah in 1943. After a hiatus of several years, Roekiah also acted for the studio, taking {{a role in the}} short Japanese propaganda film Ke Seberang (To the Other Side) in 1944. However, much of her time was spent touring Java with a theatrical company, entertaining Japanese troops.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rear}} of the main {{entrance}} hall is a series of six dioramas illustrating communications and the press throughout Indonesian history. The first diorama shows various forms of communication and news-sharing in pre-colonial Indonesia. The second diorama shows the press in the colonial period, including the first newspaper in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> under the Dutch East India Company, Memories der Nouvelles (1615); the first printed newspaper in <b>the</b> <b>Indies,</b> the Bataviasche Nouvelles (1744), and the first Javanese newspaper in <b>the</b> <b>Indies,</b> Bromartani (1855). The third diorama depicts the press during the Japanese occupation, whereas the fourth depicts the press during the National Revolution– including the formation of the PWI. The fifth diorama shows the state of the press during the New Order under President Suharto, a time of great press censorship. The final diorama depicts the press after the beginning of Reformasi in 1998, in which greater freedom of the press has been granted.|$|E
5|$|Meessen and {{his wife}} {{departed}} for <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> in 1864, first arriving in Batavia, where Meessen established a photo studio in early 1867. He {{was one of the}} few photographers active in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> in the 1860s; contemporaries included Isidore van Kinsbergen, Adolph Schaefer, and the commercial firm of Woodbury and Page (operated by Walter B. Woodbury and James Page). Meessen hoped to eventually take images of the Indies' various lands and people. From May to August he was in Sumatra, first in Padang and later in the Minang Highlands. There he offered various photographic services, including double and family portraits. When he returned to Batavia in September, he opened another studio, offering portraits and selling prints of landscapes.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, {{production}} restarted on the Indy-named sleds (stopped in 2004 with <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> 500) with <b>the</b> {{release of}} <b>the</b> 2013 <b>Indy</b> 600 and Indy 600 SP.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of its production timeline, <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> came with 16MB of RAM as standard. IRIX 5.1, the first operating system for <b>the</b> <b>Indy,</b> does not {{take full advantage of}} the hardware due to inadequate memory management. SGI realized this and soon increased the base specification to 32 MB, at considerable cost. Subsequent IRIX releases make huge improvements in memory usage. The latest release of IRIX available for <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> workstations is 6.5.22.|$|R
5|$|The {{directors}} {{active in}} <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> came from various backgrounds. Some, like The Teng Chun, Fred Young, and the Wongs, had {{been interested in}} film since their youth. Others, such as Njoo Cheong Seng and Andjar, had a background in theatre. Still others, including Albert Balink and Ismail, were journalists by trade. They were all men; {{the first woman to}} direct a film in the Indonesian archipelago, Ratna Asmara, made her debut after <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> were dissolved. Between them, the 29men directed some 103films, at times working collaboratively; it was not unusual for them to take more than one role in production. However, they generally had less creative control than the producer.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Ouw Peh Tjoa allowed The Teng Chun to import new {{equipment}} for his studio (renamed Java Industrial Film), {{which he used}} in his future productions. The film was followed in 1936 by a sequel, Anaknja Siloeman Oeler Poeti (Child of the White Snake). The Teng Chun continued releasing films based on Chinese legends until 1937, a year after Albert Balink's Pareh changed domestic perceptions of profitable film storylines. The's later films adapted stories closer to the native populace of <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> and focussing on events that could happen in day-to-day life. Through 1940 and 1941 Java Industrial Films was the most productive studio in <b>the</b> <b>Indies,</b> until it was shut down during the Japanese occupation which began in March 1942.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} sound film {{released}} by Tan's, but far from the first in <b>the</b> <b>Indies.</b> The earliest sound films released in <b>the</b> <b>Indies,</b> Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man, were both shown in 1929. The following year, a domestic part-talkie, G. Krugers' Karnadi Anemer Bangkong, was also released, becoming the first domestic sound film. Two other directors had followed with full-talkies in 1931: The Teng Chun with Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang and the Wong brothers with Indonesia Malaise. In order {{to ensure the quality}} of the sound, Tan's hired Krugers and his single-system camera to do the cinematography and sound direction for this black-and-white film.|$|E

Additionally, there is an {{optional}} module called CosmoCompress, which offers on-the-fly JPEG video compression and decompression and uses up another GIO32 slot.|$|R
5|$|After Sorga Ka Toedjoe, Tan's Film {{produced}} a further four films, {{a much lower}} number than its competitors such as The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film and its subsidiaries. Three of these productions starred Roekiah and Djoemala in the leading roles, and featured Kartolo. Landouw, according to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue), did not make another film. Tan's was ultimately shut down in 1942, following the Japanese occupation of <b>the</b> <b>Indies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Balink {{began work}} on the film in 1934, working with the Wong brothers, who served as cinematographers. They {{gathered}} a budget of 75,000 gulden– several times the budget of other local productions– and brought Franken from the Netherlands to assist in production. The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in <b>the</b> <b>Indies.</b> The film was a commercial and critical success with European audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite this success, Pareh bankrupted its producers.|$|E
5|$|Before its studio's second production, Oriental began renting {{the studios}} of Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat (ANIF) in Molenvliet, Batavia, for 1,500 gulden a month. This rent also {{included}} access to the studio's equipment and cameraman J.J.W. Steffans, as well as facilities such as air conditioning and telephones in each office, and lighting equipment for night-time shots. A large adjacent plot of land was also included. By renting the ANIF complex, Oriental became {{the largest and most}} modern studio in <b>the</b> <b>Indies.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Indy</b> Lights {{schedule}} {{closely followed}} {{that of the}} CART series, with the noteworthy exception of Indianapolis. The series typically had a gap of up to a month while the primary CART teams raced at <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> 500. <b>The</b> races were usually held {{the morning of the}} CART series races, as an undercard, support event. In early years, <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> Lights series skipped superspeedway races such as Michigan, but eventually found its way to race there.|$|R

5|$|Effendi did not direct another film until 1951, with Djiwa Pemuda, and {{the first}} {{subsequent}} native film director, Andjar Asmara, only began his career in 1940, with Kartinah. Tan's shut down production soon after Njai Dasima release, although it was eventually reestablished in 1938. After releasing several commercial successes, particularly Fatima (1938), it was permanently shut down in 1942, with the Japanese occupation of <b>the</b> <b>Indies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Generally films {{produced}} in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> dealt with traditional stories or were adapted from existing works. The early films were silent, with Karnadi Anemer Bangkong (Karnadi the Frog Contractor; 1930) generally considered the first talkie; later films {{would be in}} Dutch, Malay, or an indigenous language. All were black-and-white.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 PahWongso {{expanded}} his school in Blandongan {{to include an}} employment office.

He continued speaking out against the working conditions in <b>the</b> <b>Indies,</b> giving a lecture to a 1,000-strong audience at the Queens Theatre in Batavia in October 1939. He remained highly popular with the ethnic Chinese.|$|E
