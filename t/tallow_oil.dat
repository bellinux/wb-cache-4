6000|$|It {{seems the}} carpenter, who was {{preparing}} to grave {{the outside of the}} ship, as well as to pay the seams, where he caulked to stop the leaks, had gotten two kettles just let down in the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, <b>tallow,</b> <b>oil,</b> and such stuffs as the shipwrights use; the carpenter's man had a great iron ladle with which he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff, & as two of the enemies entered the boat where the fellow stood, he saluted them with a full ladle of the hot boiling liquor; which, the poor creatures being half naked, made them roar out, and jump into the sea. Well done, Jack, says the carpenter, give them the other dose: and so stepping forward himself, takes a mop, and dipping it into the pitch-pot, he and his man so plentifully flung it among them, as that none escaped being scalded; upon which they all made the best of their way, crying and howling in such a frightful manner, that, in all my adventures, I never heard the like. And, indeed, never was I better pleased with any conquest than I was with this, there being so little bloodshed, and having an aversion to killing such savage wretches, (more than was necessary) as knowing they came on errands, which their laws and customs made them think were just and equitable. By this time, all things being in order, and the ship swimming, they found their mistake, so they did not venture a second attack. Thus ended our merry fight; and, having got rice, bread, roots, and sixteen good hogs on board the day before we set sail, not daring to go into the bay of Tonquin, but steering N.E. toward the isle of Formosa, or as tho' we would go to the Manillas, or Phillippine islands, for fear of meeting with any European ships; when we anchored at the isle of Formosa, the inhabitants not only courteously supplied us with provisions and fresh water, but dealt very fairly and honestly with us in their bargains and agreements. From this place we steered north, keeping still off the coast of China, till we were beyond all its ports where European ships usually come; and, at length, being come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved to put into the first trading port we should come at; and standing for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who offered his service; we very gladly accepted him, and sent the boat back again. And now, having the man on board, I talked to him of going to Nanquin, the most northward part of the coast of China. What will you do there? said he, smiling. I told him that we would sell our cargo, and purchase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, tea, &c. and so return the same way back. O, said he, you had better put in at Macao, where you may buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin, and sell your opium at a greater advance. [...] "But' said I 'we are gentlemen as well as merchants, and design to see the great city of Pekin, and the magnificent court of the monarch of China," [...] Why then, said he, you should go to Ningpo, where is a navigable river that goes through the heart of that vast empire, two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea, which crosses all the rivers, passes considerable hills, by the help of the sluices and gates, and goes even up to the city of Pekin. You may go to Nanquin if you please, and travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch ship just before bound that way. At the name of a Dutch or English ship, I was struck with confusion; they being as great a terror to me in this vessel, as an Algerine man of war is to them in the Mediterranean. The old man finding me troubled, Sir, said he, I hope the Dutch are not now at war with your nation. [...] "No," [...] said I, [...] "but God knows what liberty they may take when {{out of the reach of}} the law." [...] Why, says he what occasion is there for peaceable merchants to fear? For believe me, they never meddle with any but PIRATES.|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} fuel for diesel engines consisting of the alkyl monoesters from vegetable oils or animal fats. Beef tallow is the non-edible raw material with low cost production and the availability is huge in the cattle production. The objective {{of the study was}} to utilize waste animal fat (beef) for biodiesel production using solid oxide catalyst. The solid oxide catalyst derived from the industrial waste eggshells. The waste materials calcined with temperature 900 oC and time 2 hours, transformed calcium species in the shells into active CaO catalysts. The oil contained high free fatty acid (FFA) content of 1. 86 %. The FFA content of the oil was reduced by acid-catalyzed esterification. The product from this stage was subjected to transesterification to produce biodiesel. Transesterification process produces methyl ester and glycerol. The produced methyl ester on the upper layer was separated from the glycerol and then washed. Effect of various process variables such as amount of catalyst and temperature were investigated. The biodiesel properties like methyl ester content, density, viscosity, and flash point was evaluated and was found to compare well with Indonesian Standard (SNI). Under the best condition, the maximum yield of 82. 43 % beef tallow methyl ester was obtained by using 9 : 1 molar ratio of methanol to beef <b>tallow</b> <b>oil</b> at 55 oC, for a reaction time 1. 5 hours in the presence 3 wt% of CaO catalyst. The results of this work showed that the use of beef tallow is very suitable as low cost feedstock for biodiesel production...|$|E
40|$|The {{attendance}} of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) in Greek and European energy balance is considerable strengthened {{in the last}} decade. In our days, biodiesel production is worldwide based on vegetable oils like soy bean oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. However, biodiesel production is a fairly expensive process with its feedstock comprising the major cost. For this reason the investigation for new low cost competitive feedstock is important. Waste tallow utilization has also the advantage that does not compete with the food supply chain and has a higher sustainability rating due to waste recycling. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the utilization of animal fats from Greek slaughter residues and meat processing units as a potential low cost alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. The main objective of this research was to assess the base catalyzed processes to produce biodiesel using waste tallow. The <b>tallow</b> <b>oil</b> was purified in order to reduce the free fatty acids (FFAs) and water content. The dehydration was carried out under vacuum, while acid esterification process with sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) as catalyst was applied for the reduction of FFAs content. The transesterification reactions for FAME production were carried out at 65 °C with anhydrous methanol in various methanol-to-oil molar ratios (from 6 : 1 to 15 : 1), using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as catalyst in concentrations from 0. 5 %, up to 3 % w/w. Optimum reaction conditions were examined and the quality and properties of the biodiesel product were evaluated through determination of the parameters according to EN 14214 European Standard...|$|E

These factorial experiment (3 * 3) involved 3 kinds of canola, soybean and <b>tallow</b> <b>oils</b> and 3 levels of 0, 3, and 5 percentage tomato pomace was done in a completely randomized design. The daily heat stress schedule was done from 29 - 42 days for 5 h (32 - 34 oc). Two blood samples from each replicate were gathered at 28 and 42 d. The kind of oils and levels of TP did not affect body weight, feed intake, FCR, production index, energy efficiency ratio, protein efficiency ratio and immune response. The canola oil reduced the relative weight of liver and abdominal fat pre heat stressed birds. The relative weight of spleen, and burs and bone parameters involved diaphysis diameter and external bone layer thickness were improved when heat stressed birds fed canola oil or TP diets. The canola and TP diets decreased abdominal fat in heat stressed birds. Therefore experimental diets did not affect performance and immune system. The inclusion of canola oil and TP diets improved spleen, burs, bone parameters and abdominal fat...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of adding sources of saturated fat to diets with sorghum-based dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). For Exp. 1, 112 barrows (initially 140 lb) were used in a 69 -d growth assay with 7 pigs per pen and 4 pens per treatment. Treatments were a corn-soybean meal-based control and diets having 40 % sorghum-based DDGS (U. S. En-ergy Partners, Russell, KS) without and with 5 % added <b>tallow</b> or palm <b>oil.</b> Feed and water were consumed on an ad libitum basis until pigs were slaughtered (average BW 283 lb) to allow collection of carcass data and jowl samples. Fatty acid composition of jowl samples was used to calculate iodine value (IV) as an indicator of carcass fat firmness. Overall (d 0 to 69), the corn-soybean control supported greater ADG and ADFI (P 0. 9) compared with the DDGS treatments. Adding 5 % beef <b>tallow</b> and palm <b>oil</b> to diets with DDGS improved overall F/G (P 0. 14). Changes in IV indicated softer fat in pigs fed DDGS (P 0. 14) compared with DDGS treatments. Adding fat sources to diets with DDGS tended to improve (P < 0. 06) overall F/G, and coconut oil improved F/G compared with stearic acid (P < 0. 001). Pigs fed the control diet had greater (P < 0. 05) HCW than pigs fed the DDGS treatments. Pigs fed the control diet had lower IV and greater firmness score than pigs fed diets with added DDGS (P < 0. 02). Adding fat sources to diets with DDGS improved these estimates of carcass firmness and tip to tip distance for suspended bellies (P < 0. 001); coconut oil had a much greater effect than stearic acid (P < 0. 001). In conclusion, adding beef <b>tallow,</b> palm <b>oil,</b> and coconut oil to diets with 40 % DDGS improved efficiency of gain in finishing pigs.
