5|$|In February 2009, Manchester City Council {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> would be dismantled {{and placed in}} storage. Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly, the core and legs of <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> were cut apart during removal. The core was sold for scrap in July 2012, while the 180 spikes remain in storage.|$|E
5|$|The figure {{depicted}} by the statue {{is that of}} a nearly-naked Aboriginal man, and the name of <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> refers to a Pacific Northwest coast tribe.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> {{has been}} used as a {{backdrop}} in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> was under cover for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was a metaphor for the movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the beginning and end of the movie. <b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> was {{commissioned}} by the Ladies' Soldiers' Memorial Association of Pawtucket, Rhode Island to honor those {{who served in the}} American Civil War. The funding for <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> came as the result of an 11-year fundraising campaign that was provided for by donations and entertainment events. The cost of the monument was stated to be $13,000 by The New York Times, but report stated it to be $12,000. William Granville Hastings was chosen as the sculptor to execute the construction of the monument after winning a competition. <b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> was cast by the Gorham Manufacturing Company.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> was {{commissioned}} in 2003; construction overran {{and the official}} unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> suffered {{the first of three}} visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling £1.7 million.|$|E

5000|$|The campaign’s {{corporate}} design, {{as well as}} {{the design}} of <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> was developed and realized by the Berlin design agency Scholz & Friends Identify. The agency has since received multiple awards for this campaign (such as the renowned German EVA Award in 2006). <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> were placed on central squares (Bebelplatz and Gendarmenmarkt among others) in Berlin’s city center. Many politicians, members of the initiative or representatives of the companies involved held speeches at the small opening ceremonies accompanying the unveiling of <b>the</b> <b>sculptures.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>sculpture</b> to be unveiled was [...] "Der moderne Fußballschuh" [...] (The Modern Football Boot), at Spreebogenpark on March 10, 2006. <b>The</b> final <b>sculpture</b> [...] "Relativitätstheorie" [...] (The Theory of Relativity) was unveiled and handed over on May 19, 2006 to the Berlin park Lustgarten. In autumn of 2006, <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> were removed again.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sculptured</b> Rocks Natural {{area is a}} 272 acre {{natural area}} in Groton, New Hampshire.

They are located on the Cockermouth River, which is the longest tributary of Newfound Lake. <b>The</b> <b>Sculptured</b> Rocks Road, which runs along this same river, shares its namesake with the park.|$|R
5|$|While {{fundraising}} {{to preserve}} the work was underway, the city of Santa Monica filed an application in May 2012 to nominate <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> for landmark status.

Chain Reaction is the first work of public art named a landmark {{by the city of}} Santa Monica.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of <b>the</b> <b>sculpture.</b> The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged <b>the</b> <b>sculpture,</b> but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E
5|$|Allow Me, {{also known}} as Umbrella Man, is an iconic 1983 bronze {{sculpture}} by John Seward Johnson II, located in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, United States. <b>The</b> <b>sculpture,</b> one of seven Allow Me casts, was donated anonymously to the City of Portland in 1984 for display in the Square. It depicts a life-sized man dressed in a business suit, hailing a cab and holding an umbrella. Constructed from bronze, aluminum and stainless steel, <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> stands six feet, ten inches tall and weighs 460 pounds. <b>The</b> <b>sculpture</b> {{is one of many}} works of art generated by the city's Percent for Art program, and is considered part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> {{remained}} in Veterans Park for 10 years while Fowler attempted {{to raise funds}} to buy a larger piece of land for <b>the</b> <b>sculptures.</b> In mid-1980's, Don Cunningham, a new administrative assistant for Liberty Hill Independent School District, wished to purchase a piece of granite from one of <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> for a sign for the new high school. After negotiations, the school district accepted all of <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> {{as part of a}} landscape for the high school. On May 5, 1987, after a massive moving effort, <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> were dedicated on the grounds of Liberty Hill High School (now Liberty Hill Middle School). It became the only recorded site of an International Sculpture Park on school grounds. Several sculptures were added after the symposium and dedication, including one by Jim Thomas and several by Mel Fowler, bringing the total to 27 pieces in the park.|$|R
25|$|Further north, {{around the}} High Park Forest School, are several {{examples}} of outdoor <b>sculpture</b> in <b>the</b> former <b>sculpture</b> garden. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> were commissioned and placed {{around the area}} for a 1967 international symposium. Several of <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> are placed within the forested area. Since <b>the</b> symposium, several <b>sculptures</b> were relocated to other Toronto locations. One was relocated to Corktown Common and another to Iceboat Terrace, west of Spadina Avenue.|$|R

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from <b>the</b> <b>sculpture,</b> and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> {{project has}} been {{specially}} made for the location. The group establishes relationships {{at a number of}} different levels with water and transport, and with the industrial surroundings of Lage Weide industrial estate. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> contrast with <b>the</b> purely functional surroundings and add a human dimension to the immense and expansive area. Kuijer used forms based on our own body as a mould. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> contain references to water, for example, a moulded rowing boat, surfboard and a garden pond.|$|R
5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike {{had to be}} cut off by firefighters after it was {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment {{put in place to}} prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the American Bar Association {{presented}} {{a statue of}} Blackstone to the English Bar Association, however, at the time, <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> was too tall {{to be placed in}} the Royal Courts of Justice in London. <b>The</b> <b>sculpture,</b> designed by Paul Wayland Bartlett was eventually cast in Europe and presented back to the US for display. Congress approved the placement of <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> in Washington, D.C. on 15 March 1943, and appropriated $10,000 for the installation. The bronze statue is a nine-foot (2.7 m) standing portrait of Blackstone wearing judicial robes and a long curly wig, holding a copy of Commentaries. It is placed on a tall granite base and stands on Constitution Avenue & 3rd Street NW. The town of Blackstone, Virginia is named after him.|$|E
5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures that keep <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> standing. The first structural pieces, two type {{304 stainless steel}} rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting <b>the</b> <b>sculpture</b> move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E

50|$|Not all {{researchers}} {{agree with}} the traditional identification. Already in 1840 Józef Ignacy Kraszewski proposed that <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> depict royal saints but <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> have no symbols or attributes of sainthood. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> are too detailed and personalized to depict abstract royals or saints. Matušakaitė suggested that one of <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> depicts Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (1392-1430), and not Władysław of Varna or Władysław Vasa. Mindaugas Paknys noted that two sculptures wear imperial crowns (other researchers considered them grand ducal caps as they are visually very similar) and suggested that they depict Camimir's grandfather Albert II of Germany, elected but not crowned King of the Romans, and Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who raised orphaned Casimir's mother. According to Paknys, <b>the</b> other six <b>sculptures</b> depict Casimir's immediate family: grandfather Władysław Jagiełło, father Casimir, and brothers Vladislaus, John Albert, Alexander, and Sigismund.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> on <b>the</b> west front are {{partially}} {{based on}} Maschius' drawings, on guesswork and on pure fantasy.

It is unknown how many rows of sculptures there originally were - only the bottom row survived the fires and decay of the late Middle Ages; <b>the</b> five remaining <b>sculptures</b> are in poor condition. These sculptures are now in the museum in Erkebispegården i Trondheim (Archbishop's Palace in Trondheim). Work on <b>the</b> <b>sculptures</b> started in 1929. <b>The</b> <b>sculptures</b> depict both biblical and historical characters.|$|R
