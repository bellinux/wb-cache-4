And she gave me a little notebook in which I started to write things down and I still have." ...|$|E
2500|$|When heavy {{equipment}} operator, Julia Uberuaga, {{first went to}} Antarctica in the late 70s, early 80s, she recalled that [...] "the men stared at her, or leered at her, or otherwise let her know she was unwelcome on the job." [...] Rita Matthews, who went to Antarctica {{during the same period}} as Uberuaga said that the [...] "men were all over the place. There were some that would never stop going after you." [...] In 1983, Marilyn Woody described living at McMurdo station and said, [...] "It makes your head spin, all this attention from all these men." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You realize you can put a bag over your head and they'll still fall in love with you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gray {{revealed}} {{the most memorable}} thing anyone has said about her work {{in an interview at}} The Eternal Night, a book review site in Britain. Says Gray, [...] "Well, a few years ago, I submitted a story to an editor who wrote back and said it was the sickest thing she ever read, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "sick in the best sense of the word". I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had seen a lot of bizarre stuff in her career, I took her comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical. I went on to sell it elsewhere (twice!), and it received a Stoker recommendation, so I guess others thought it [...] "sick" [...] as well." ...|$|E

5000|$|Later, in 2001, Cary sent {{a writing}} sample to Victoria Holmes at Working Partners.

2500|$|Lyrically, the band's {{style has}} been {{described}} as coming from [...] "the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre." [...] Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On [...] "My Baby's Taking Me Home" [...] off Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, [...] "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: [...] "Your call is very important to us. [...] Please hold" [...] which is then sung with some additional words: [...] "At first she said your call is very important to us, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> please, please hold." [...] The only other lyrics in the song are [...] "Red light", [...] "Green light", [...] "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" [...] and [...] "Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.|$|E

[...] "I {{will tell you}} who your father is and how to go to him," [...] she said, and she gestured to the first twin {{to sit on a}} chair of obsidian and to the second twin to sit on a chair of turquoise. [...] She gave them food. [...] <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Your father is , the Sun. [...] His dwelling is far to the east. [...] The way is long and dangerous. [...] Many monsters live between here and there. [...] And your father may try to harm you." [...] "Tell us how to go there," [...] said the twins. [...] "You must cross four dangerous places," [...] said Spider Woman. You must pass the rocks that crush all travelers. [...] You must cross the reeds that cut travelers to pieces. [...] You must cross between the cane cactuses that cut travelers to shreds. [...] Then you must pass the boiling sands that burn travelers to fine ashes. Beyond those four points no ordinary creature can pass. [...] But I will give you a talisman that will help you." [...] Saying this, she handed the boys the sacred , a hoop fashioned from the life feathers of monster eagles. [...] "Treat this charm carefully and use it correctly," [...] she said.
