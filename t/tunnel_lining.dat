5|$|The {{original}} tunnel {{as built}} {{was designed by}} Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques and a Greathead shield (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of incandescent street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, and a house reputedly once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the <b>tunnel</b> <b>lining</b> was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|Driving {{the running}} tunnels started in November 1894, using the Greathead system of shield excavation, cast iron segment lining, {{compressed}} air working, and compressed air grouting behind the <b>tunnel</b> <b>lining.</b> 20 men worked in each heading.|$|E
25|$|The deepest {{station in}} the MARTA system is the Peachtree Center Station which {{is located in a}} hard-rock tunnel, 120feet (36meters) beneath {{downtown}} Atlanta, where the highest hills in Atlanta are 1100feet (300meters) above sea level. No <b>tunnel</b> <b>lining</b> was installed in this station, or the adjacent tunnels. The architects and civil engineers decided to leave these with their rugged gneiss rock walls. The highest {{station in the}} MARTA system is the King Memorial Station. It rises 90feet over an active CSX rail yard.|$|E

25|$|In 1864 Peter Barlow {{patented}} {{a method}} of tunnelling using a circular wrought iron or steel shield and filling {{the gap between the}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>lining</b> with lime or cement to prevent settling of the ground above. He published a pamphlet in 1867 suggesting a network of tunnels with cars carrying up to 12 people. In 1868 authority was obtained for a tunnel under the Thames between Great Tower Hill and Pickle Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine Lane), but there was a delay finding a contractor due to recent experiences with the Thames Tunnel until his former pupil James Henry Greathead tendered for £9,400.|$|E
25|$|Repair {{works were}} {{estimated}} at about €60 million. On 18 October, the investigation authority released the damaged section of tunnel back to Eurotunnel who then assessed the <b>tunnel</b> <b>lining</b> and replaced over one thousand bolts holding the concrete lining. The damaged concrete was then removed with {{high pressure water}} jets, damage to the reinforcing steel mesh repaired and a new concrete lining applied by a shotcreting process. This used about 4000 tonnes of new concrete and was completed in early January 2009. During the remainder of January, tunnel equipment was repaired and replaced as necessary, with the installation of overhead line equipment on 28 January. After test running, Eurotunnel reopened on 9 February 2009.|$|E
25|$|Foster Yeoman, a {{quarrying}} and asphalt company, {{opened an}} aggregates terminal {{using one of}} the refinery jetties at Grain in 1988 from which it could transport overseas the stone quarried at Glensanda near Oban. The firm had first been involved in the area during the construction of the Channel Tunnel for which it supplied stone. The terminal was part of the concrete works site of TransManche Link, the Anglo-French engineering consortium which took over the land formerly occupied by the BP refinery. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>lining</b> segments for the English side of the tunnel were manufactured here. The Grain terminal receives annually 2 million tonnes of stone by sea from Glensanda. The completion of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 led to the dissolution of TransManche Link, and the aggregates terminal continued to distribute material by rail, road or barge for use in south eastern construction projects, including the high speed one rail link, and as a major supplier of ballast for rail maintenance.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] {{layer of}} chalk marl (French: craie bleue) {{in the lower}} third of the lower chalk {{appeared}} to present the best tunnelling medium.

2500|$|In the 1950s the French {{government}} {{became concerned}} about a possible invasion by the Warsaw Pact through Germany. [...] A number of the larger ouvrages were selected to form defensive ensembles or môles around which a defense might be organized and controlled. [...] Rochonvillers was chosen in 1951 to become {{the center of the}} môle de Rochonvillers, in company with Molvange and Bréhain, and later Immerhof. Block 5 was re-equipped with 105mm and 135mm guns and 12.7mm machine guns, while the 135mm turret of Block 6 was repaired with parts from the turret from Four-à-Chaux. Repairs to waterproofing and <b>tunnel</b> <b>lining</b> were undertaken at this time. By 1956 the ouvrage was restored to its original state, apart from the renovations to Blocks 5 and 6.|$|E
2500|$|Along a 50-metre {{length of}} tunnel, the {{normally}} 0.4-metre thick <b>tunnel</b> <b>lining</b> {{was reduced to}} a mean depth of 0.17metres, with the thinnest area being 0.02metres. [...] The chalk marl showed no signs of failing or collapsing but colliery arches were installed as a precaution. Over a 240-metre long section (70metres towards Britain, 170metres towards France), damage to the concrete extended {{as far back as the}} first set of reinforcement bars. Superficial damage to the surface of the concrete segments was evident along a further 190metres of tunnel length. In the vicinity of the fire, services were destroyed, including high-voltage cables, low-voltage cables, communications, lighting systems, traction and junction boxes over a length of 800metres. Five hundred metres of track had to be replaced, as did 800metres of overhead line, 800metres of refrigeration pipe and signalling equipment over a length of 1,500metres. [...] Four escape cross-passages and five pressure relief ducts had to be refitted with new doors and dampers. The damage was in interval 3. Service through the tunnel restarted using single track working over the parallel interval 4. [...] In a phased re-opening, freight train service was restored on 29 November 1996, followed by Eurostar services on 4 December, and tourist shuttles on 10 December for cars and 6 January 1997 for coaches. Agreement had been reached on the repairs by 24 January 1997. The civil engineering work, repairing the tunnel wall, was completed by the French contractor Freyssinet in 60 days. This was followed by the replacement of the track, overhead line and signalling by Eurotunnel and, completed in less than a month, the tunnel was fully reopened on 15 May 1997.|$|E

30|$|The above {{criteria}} {{were employed in}} some tunnel close crossing construction projects (Liu et al. 2005) in Shanghai {{as well as some}} projects in Shenzhen, including a double deck tunnel and two running <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 1 under crossed by <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 2, <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 1 under crossed by <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 3, and <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 2 under crossed by <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 4. The Shanghai soft ground is composed of littoral deposits featuring with saturated, flow to soft plastic clay with high compressibility and sensitivity and low strength, long stabilizing time and big settlement after being disturbed. The existing subway tunnels often have already produced some even large settlements on account of the long-term consolidation settlements of underlying soil (Wang and Liu 2001; Ye et al. 2007). In some later projects, more strict {{criteria were}} adopted. The allowed settlement and uplift were both reduced to 5  mm and the demand for tunnel convergence was < 20  mm in projects of Shanghai, embracing <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 2 under-crossed by <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 4 (Wang et al. 2004; Hu and Huang 2006), <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 2 above-crossed by <b>tunnels</b> on <b>Line</b> 8 (Wang and Yu 2006), and others presented by Chen et al.
