6000|$|With {{best regards}} and <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> {{reminded}} me of so many pleasant days, old acquaintances, dead friends, and--what is perhaps as pathetic as any of them--dead dogs, I remain, yours truly, ...|$|E
60|$|What she {{was about}} to say {{remained}} unspoken; for Lancelot seized her hand in spite of her, with frantic <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> allowed him this one interview, and entreaties that he might see her again, if but for one moment.|$|E
40|$|Lemmel Call Barnes (The American Baptist Home Mission Society), 23 East 26 th Street, New York, New York, USA, letter, 1922 February 11, to Hamlin Garland (The Players), 16 Gramercy Park, New York, New York, USA.

5000|$|Captain Boomerang is {{mentioned}} in Injustice 2 by Cyborg and Deadshot, {{the latter of}} whom <b>thanks</b> Cyborg <b>for</b> <b>having</b> apparently killed Boomerang.|$|R
60|$|Please {{accept my}} sincere <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what you <b>have</b> done and {{are doing to}} get troops forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is enough!" [...] the Turk cried, angrily. [...] "Every minute is of importance, and I cannot {{stand here}} and see my wife allowed to sink. It only remains for me to give you my <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> come, and to call in some other surgeon {{before it is too}} late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then that, of course, {{accounts}} for my getting no answer," [...] said Holmes. [...] "Dear me, how very stupid of me, to be sure! Good-morning, miss, and many <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> relieved my mind." [...] He chuckled {{and rubbed his}} hands when we found ourselves in the street once more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well said, old gentleman!" [...] {{said the}} querist--"Here's to thee, and I wish you joy of your good principles. You owe me {{a cup of}} <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> taught you them; nay, thou shalt pledge me in thine own sack--sour ale sits ill upon a loyal stomach.--Now comes your turn, young man; what think you of the matter in hand?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{committee}} now sent, through Lord Bridport, {{a letter}} to the seamen granting still further concessions, and promising pardon to all concerned; but the sailors answered expressing their <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what <b>had</b> been granted, but reiterating their demands.|$|R
50|$|In Paris, Leslie and Lance {{say their}} goodbyes. He {{is off to}} Athens. She <b>thanks</b> him <b>for</b> <b>having</b> made Paris unforgettable and hopes someday he will meet Brad and her sister, Lorie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heeren," [...] he said, [...] "it {{seems to}} me that before you seek vengeance, which, as the Book tells us, is the Lord's, it would be well, {{especially}} for the Heer Marais, to return <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what <b>has</b> been saved to him. I mean his daughter, who might now very easily have been dead or worse." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found her}} that evening, by chance, {{in the gallery}} over the courtyard. She was pacing slowly, having fled thither to avoid that hateful throng of courtiers. Seeing me she smiled timidly, and her smile gave me what little further {{encouragement}} I needed. I approached, and very earnestly rendered her my <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> championed my cause and supported me with the express sign of her approval.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take this," [...] he said, [...] "in {{token of}} my <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> brought me this news, and remember, that if {{at any time}} {{you should have a}} boon to ask that it is within my power to grant, I swear to you upon my ducal honour that it shall be yours. Never have I {{received}} more joyful news than that the great Earl of Wessex will shortly be my guest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Wilks," [...] he said. [...] "I have to {{give you}} my heartfelt <b>thanks,</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> {{restored}} my granddaughter to me--the more so as I know, from what she has said, how great a sacrifice you must be making. John has been telling me of his conversation with you, and you have learned, from him, that I was not so wholly heartless and unnatural a father as you must have thought me; deeply as I blame myself, and shall always blame myself, in the matter." ...|$|E
60|$|Ralph was {{satisfied}} that {{such was the}} case, and he pulled the horses in, unwilling {{to arrive at a}} scene where he feared he might be obliged to listen to <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what they <b>had</b> done.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{at liberty}} to name those who were present, {{excepting}} [...] only the E---- of O----d, who has charged me to return you his [...] <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what you <b>have</b> said of his father.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the news}} came that Josephus had come to Hippos, Simon set out with Martha, John, and Mary, to see him. Josephus {{received}} them kindly, and would permit no <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what he <b>had</b> done.|$|R
6000|$|They had {{an early}} meal together, chiefly {{for the sake}} of his {{wheeling}} her to the head of his table, and [...] "seeing how she looked there," [...] and then the inexorable hour was come, and he left her, with the echo of her last words in his ear, [...] "Goodbye, Colin, stay as long as you ought. It will make the meeting all the sweeter, and you have your wife to some back to now. Give a sister's love to your brother, and <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> spared you," [...] and his last look at the door was answered with her sunshiny smile.|$|E
6000|$|Whether it {{were the}} hat or the shock, Kate was uncommonly meek and subdued as she {{followed}} Lady de la Poer out of the room; and after giving the little maid half a sovereign and many <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> so nicely repaired the damage, they {{walked back to the}} palace, and up the great stone stairs, Kate hanging down her head, thinking that everyone was wondering how Amelia Matilda Bunny came to be holding by the hand of a lady in a beautiful black lace bonnet and shawl, so quiet and simple, and yet such a lady! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} intend {{to slip into}} the ranks without any farewells, but the Earl, with politeness that almost confounded the little elderly governess, {{returned}} <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> been permitted the pleasure of her company, and Louis, between mischief and good-nature, would not submit to anything but a hearty, cousinly squeeze of the hand, nor relinquish it till he had forced her to utter articulately the message to grandmamma {{that she had been}} muttering with her head averted. At last it was spoken sharply, and her hand drawn petulantly away, and, without looking back at him, her high, stiff head vanished into the house, towering above the bright rainbow of ribbons, veils, and parasols.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dowsett and Nellie {{now joined}} them. They had quite {{recovered}} their spirits, and were delighted at the unexpected rescue {{of so many}} things precious to them, and Captain Watson was overwhelmed by their <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what he <b>had</b> done.|$|R
6000|$|... "She sees us, {{though we}} do not see her; and she <b>thanks</b> you, George, <b>for</b> <b>having</b> been good to her children," [...] her husband said.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that there}} is no mention of Allan {{volunteering}} to leave SAFC nor of Sunderland AFC giving James Allan a vote of <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> all he <b>had</b> done <b>for</b> SAFC (including remember, founding the club), nor of the founding of Sunderland Albion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly it {{was well}} done, young sir, and I owe you <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> given so shrewd a lesson to these brawlers, Maître Leroux has good reasons for being thankful to the duke for lodging your lady in his house, for he would doubtless have lost his life had you and your four men not been there. When the Duke of Burgundy returns I will take council with him {{touching}} this matter of your mistress. I know that he gave me good reasons at {{the time for the}} bringing of her hither, but in the press of matters I do not recall what they were. At any rate, as she is here as my hostage her safety must be ensured, and for the present I will give orders that a guard be placed at the house." ...|$|E
60|$|Had it {{not been}} for a very amiable modesty you could not have {{imagined}} that your letter could give me any offence. It was on many accounts highly grateful to me. I was pleased to find that I had given so much pleasure to an ingenuous and able mind, and I further considered the enjoyment which you had had from my Poems as an earnest that others might be delighted with them in the same, or a like manner. It is plain from your letter that the pleasure which I have given you has not been blind or unthinking; you have studied the poems, and prove that you have entered into the spirit of them. They have not given you a cheap or vulgar pleasure; therefore, I feel that you are entitled to my kindest <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> done some violence to your natural diffidence in the communication which you have made to me.|$|E
60|$|Mark {{deemed it}} a good symptom that he felt {{disposed}} to eat. How many days he had been altogether without nourishment he could not say, but {{they must have been}} several; nor had he received more than could be obtained from a single ship's biscuit since his attack. All this came to his mind, with a distinct recollection that he must be his own physician and nurse. For a few minutes he lay still, during which he addressed himself to God, with <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> spared his life until reason was restored. Then he bethought him, well as his feeble state would allow, of the course he ought to pursue. On a table in the cabin, and in sight of his berth, through the state-room door, was a liquor-case, containing wines, brandy, and gin. Our sick man thought all might yet go well, could he get a few spoonsfull of an excellent port wine which that case, contained, and which had been provided expressly for cases of sickness. To do this, however, it was necessary to obtain the key, to open the case, and to pour out the liquor; three things, of which he distrusted his powers to perform that which was the least difficult.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Effingham now {{expressed}} his <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> all that <b>had</b> passed, and earnestly enjoined prudence {{on the young}} men. After which Eve withdrew her head, and was seen no more. Most of the next hour was passed in prayer by those in the launch.|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} {{late in the}} {{afternoon}} when Mr. Weston returned to see how the new merchants were getting along, and both of them tried to express their <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what he <b>had</b> done <b>for</b> them; but it was a difficult matter to find words to convey all they felt.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{good enough}} to fight, I suppose," [...] said the Baron, with a smile and shrug of the shoulders, which seemed to return <b>thanks</b> to Providence <b>for</b> <b>having</b> been educated in the civil service.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, at {{the time}} that you came up General Gassion was just telling these gentlemen that {{had it not been for}} you things might have gone very differently. Had you not {{discovered}} that ambush their fire would have been fatal to us, for we fell back, as you know, farther than the copse, and a volley from a thousand muskets would have played havoc among us, and after so terrible a repulse might well have decided the day against us. For this great service, rendered by you voluntarily and without orders, I as commander-in-chief of this army, with the full and warm approval of General Gassion, appoint you to the rank of colonel, a rank which I am sure will be confirmed by the queen's minister when I report to him my reasons for the promotion. General Gassion reports that the man who accompanied you on this reconnaissance was the same who followed you in the expedition to Turin. As he is not a soldier I cannot promote him, but I will order my chamberlain to hand him a purse of a hundred pistoles. When you return to Turenne, tell him that I owe him my best <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> sent you to me, and that, thanks to the aid of his teaching, you have been the means of preventing a great disaster to our forces." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would not}} be easy for a pen as unskilful as mine, to portray the change, from the gloom of the ravine, the short but bloody assault, the shouts, the rush, and the retreat, of the outer world, {{to the scene of}} {{domestic}} security we found within the Nest, embellished, as was the last, by woman's loveliness and graces, and, in many respects, by woman's elegance. Anneke and her friend received us in a bright, cheerful, comfortable apartment, that was rendered so much the more attractive by their tears and their smiles, neither of which were spared. I could see that both had been dreadfully agitated; but joy restored their colour, and brought back the smiles to their sweet faces. The situation of the place was such, perhaps, as to render cheerfulness neither very lasting nor very lively; but the tenderest female can find her heart suddenly so lightened from its burthen of apprehensions, as to be able to seem momentarily happy, even when environed by the horrors of war. Such, in a measure, was the character of the reception we now received, together with a thousand <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> so promptly answered their letters in person. The dear creatures had the ingenuity not to seem to ascribe that prompt obedience to their own requests, which we had manifested, to any care for ourselves, but solely to a wish to oblige and protect them. The reader will understand that all explanations still remained to be made, on both sides. These soon came, however; facts pressing themselves on the attention, at such times, with a weight that is irresistible. The ice was broken by Herman Mordaunt's entering the room, and speaking to us, like one who felt that a great omission had been made.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} this blessing is to thank God for good health. It expresses <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> the ability to excrete, for without it {{existence}} would be impossible.|$|E
60|$|Again {{the steward}} {{met her at}} Carriford Road Station on her return journey. Instead of being frigid as at the former meeting at the same place, she was embarrassed by a strife of thought, and murmured brokenly her <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> what he <b>had</b> done. The same request that he might see her home was made.|$|R
5000|$|Psalm 100 (...) {{is part of}} {{the daily}} prayer service, recited as part of the Songs of thanksgiving in Pesukei Dezimra, except on Shabbat, festivals, Chol HaMoed of Pesach, and the days before Yom Kippur and Pesach. Psalm 100 is {{representative}} of the Thanksgiving offering, which <b>thanks</b> God <b>for</b> <b>having</b> been saved from dangers we face every day. A person always faces danger in his daily routine, even though he may be unaware of it.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, he {{received}} a mention of <b>thanks</b> and praise <b>for</b> <b>having</b> won two AFL Cups as the head coach of G.C. Alcobaça. He has also received an award of distinction for being graduated from the Escola Superior de Desporto de Rio Maior.|$|R
