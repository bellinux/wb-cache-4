5000|$|The cool {{reception}} {{given his}} painting was {{made all the}} more galling by the critical success at the same Salon of Delacroix and Paul Delaroche, who displayed [...] "large-scale figure pieces of less than the most elevated subjects", in the words of Marjorie Cohn. Ingres' <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been further exacerbated by the hanging of his work below a painting depicting [...] "four or five life-sized cows returning to their stable". The result was that Ingres resolved never again to exhibit at the Salon or to accept any public commissions. He applied for and received a position as director of the French Academy in Rome, and left Paris in December 1834 to begin a self-imposed exile in Italy. He did not return to France until 1841. In November 1834 The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian was installed in Autun Cathedral.|$|R

Such are, the various adjustments of length and position of the stamens to bring the pollen to the insect and from the insect to the stigma; the various motions of stamens and styles at the right time and the right direction; the physiological adjustments bringing about fertility or sterility in heterostyled plants; the traps, springs, and complex movements of various parts of orchids; and innumerable other remarkable phenomena.|$|R
40|$|We {{have lived}} {{in an era of}} crusades, {{ideologies}} and causes. We whose lives extend into a second generation look back on causes and leaders of causes which were with us but not with those of the second generation. Such is not the fate of Justice Holmes. He continues, if only a subject of controversy. Two reasons for the continuity are apparent at once. He wrote well: “Worships language and forgives... Everyone by whom it lives,” and he wrote on law and justice—universals which interest everyone and which have inspired teachers from a time extending back through Aristotle and Plato. There is another reason for a continuing interest in Justice Holmes. It is not so apparent in our era. Time may develop it clear and sharp. We are conscious of it, though, through our inability to classify Justice Holmes. Some regarded him as a liberal, others have been sure that the Justice was a radical, and still others treated the Justice as a source of social and political mischief. This <b>irritation</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> found its source in the difficulty that arises when we look for a category that fits. What later generations may see clear and sharp is an objectiveness of mind that became notable in the Northern Securities litigation, and which leaves Justice Holmes in our era as a man without a cause. I propose to develop this thought by comparisons and contrasts with men who were working during that period; then I shall refer to the quality in the Justice’s work...|$|R

40|$|What {{is known}} about the topic of this paper • Limited {{information}} as regard to this condition in Rhino’s. What this paper adds to the field of veterinary dermatology • Surgical intervention is currative in some cases. • Contributing to the sparse information on skin tumours in rhino’s. A captive 33 -year-old male white rhinoceros with seasonal dermatitis was diagnosed with a malignant squamous cell carcinoma on the right flank. Staphylo-coccus aureus was cultured from the skin lesions. No fungal or yeast was isolated. The dermatitis was treated with a combination of oral antibiotics (trimethoprim–sulphadiazine) and topically with weekly chlorhexidine washes and a mixture of a zinc oxide, balsam peru and bismuth oxide cream. Under azaperone and butorphanol anaesthesia, the skin tumour was surgically removed. The tumour was excised with wide margins and allowed to heal by secondary intention as primary wound closure was not possible. A post-mortem performed 2 years later for an unrelated condition revealed no metastases or recurrence of the skin tumour. It was presumed that chronic <b>irritation</b> or trauma <b>may</b> <b>have</b> contributed {{to the development of the}} skin tumour. This is the first detailed report of the successful treatment of a squamous cell carcinoma not associated with the horn in a rhinoceros...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{report on}} {{a case of a}} 65 -year-old man with {{pigmented}} clear-cell acanthoma located on the right thigh.

Dermoscopic features are correlated with the histology, where hemosiderin deposits present in a sheet-like arrangement in the perivascular papillary dermis and in a band-like disposition in the reticular dermis {{at the base of the}} lesion can account for the pigmented picture.
