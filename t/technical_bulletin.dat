25|$|Music therapy {{finds its}} roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued <b>Technical</b> <b>Bulletin</b> 187 in 1945, which {{described}} the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals. The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the Surgeon General of the United States. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal {{of the study was to}} understand whether “music presented according to a specific plan” influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders. Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.|$|E

500|$|Other {{factors in}} bald eagle {{population}} reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, {{as well as}} both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that {{in the state of}} Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent). Later illegal shooting was described as [...] "the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles," [...] according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species <b>Technical</b> <b>Bulletin.</b> In 1984, the National Wildlife Federation listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald eagles have also been killed by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion at nests.|$|E

2500|$|World War II saw the {{large-scale}} involvement of US psychiatrists in the selection, processing, assessment, {{and treatment of}} soldiers. This moved the focus away from mental institutions and traditional clinical perspectives. A committee headed by psychiatrist Brigadier General William C. Menninger developed a new classification scheme called Medical 203, that was issued in 1943 as a War Department <b>Technical</b> <b>Bulletin</b> {{under the auspices of}} the Office of the Surgeon General. The foreword to the DSM-I states the US Navy had itself made some minor revisions but [...] "the Army established a much more sweeping revision, abandoning the basic outline of the Standard and attempting to express present day concepts of mental disturbance. This nomenclature eventually was adopted by all Armed Forces", and [...] "assorted modifications of the Armed Forces nomenclature [...] introduced into many clinics and hospitals by psychiatrists returning from military duty." [...] The Veterans Administration also adopted a slightly modified version of Medical 203.|$|E
