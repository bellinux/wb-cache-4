40|$|To {{investigate}} the effects <b>of</b> nanoparticle content, <b>storage</b> time, and <b>storage</b> temperature on <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> asphalt binders modified by nanoparticles, hot tube storage tests, softening point tests, and dynamic-shearing rheometer (DSR) tests were adopted {{to evaluate the}} properties of two kinds of nanotitanium dioxide (TiO 2) modified asphalt binders. A statistical {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) test was employed to analyze the effects of those variations on <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nano-TiO 2 modified asphalt binders. The results indicated that the softening point, the failure temperature, the dynamic-shear viscosity, and G⁎/sinδ of the binders increased with nanoparticle content. <b>The</b> <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binders decreased with nanoparticle content. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> time on <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binders was remarkable when <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> time was more than 48 [*]h. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binders at low temperatures was better than that at high temperatures. Based on the one-way ANOVA, the size of nanoparticle had little influence on <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nano-TiO 2 modified asphalt binders in this study.

Another crematorium and columbarium complex was built at Mandai, and this commenced operations in 1982, equipped with eight small and four medium-sized cremators and a total of 64,370 niches for <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> cremated remains. Chinese voluntary associations such as Pek San Theng were allowed to build columbaria to house the remains of those exhumed from clan-owned cemeteries, and temples and churches were allowed to accommodate cremated remains.

Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which could also be used to hold funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level.

5|$|Between 1818 and 1821, the {{structure}} was repaired {{and used as}} an artillery quarter during the War of Independence. It was later used as a magazine for <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder and ammunition in 1830; two years later, it functioned as barraks and armory. By 1899, the facility serviced as headquarters, and after receiving further repairs under instructions from the president Cipriano Castro in 1901, it served as quarters for the National Army. The sickness and eventual death of president Juan Vicente Gómez in 1935 led to the abandonment of the castle by the troops. Later in 1955, and due to a local initiative, the castle achieved the status of War Museum. It was declared as a National Monument in 1965 by president Raúl Leoni.|$|E
5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. <b>The</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E

The {{onset of the}} Second World War in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the Admiralty and used as base for the British Atlantic fleet including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the May Blitz of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack. By {{the end of the}} war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's floor space was out of use because of bomb damage.|$|E

Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island.

5|$|Hatfield Moors is {{the site}} of a {{depleted}} onshore natural gas field located at a depth of 1450 feet (440 metres) below Hatfield Moor. The field was discovered in 1981 and contained about 8.5 billion cubic feet (241 million cubic metres) of gas in two formations Hatfield Moors and Hatfield West. Production of gas started in 1986, and it was operated and owned by Edinburgh Oil & Gas plc. As the field became depleted plans were made by ScottishPower in 1998 to develop the field for <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> gas. These facilities became operational in February 2000.

This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis.

The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E
