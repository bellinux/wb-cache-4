5|$|In the ride's {{narrative}} of events preceding those that occur during the ride, King Adelsten entered <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> fight a dragon called Ormaar. During the battle, the king lost his crown. Stansein, {{one of the}} king's servants, guides riders through <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> find and retrieve the crown. Throughout the ride, riders can score points by hitting objects on the screen with their light guns. At the end, the highest scores are placed in the 'Wonder Mountain's Guardian Hall of Fame'.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1980 eruption, {{the area}} was left to {{gradually}} return to its natural state. In 1987, the U.S. Forest Service reopened <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> climbing. It remained open until 2004 when renewed activity caused {{the closure of the}} area around the mountain (see Geological history section above for more details).|$|E
5|$|The Munro Schiehallion's {{isolated}} {{position and}} regular shape led Nevil Maskelyne {{to use the}} deflection caused by the mass of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> estimate {{the mass of the}} Earth in a ground-breaking experiment carried out in 1774. Following Maskelyne's survey, Schiehallion became the first mountain to be mapped using contour lines.|$|E

5|$|The cavalry {{continued}} with {{its plan to}} attack. Paxton sent the regiment's advance guard, led by Major Powell, down <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> scout the rebel camps in Sinking Creek Valley. Each man in the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry's 22-man advance guard was armed with two six-shot revolvers and a saber. The advance guard discovered that the rebels in the first camp were focused on staying warm, and many did not have their one-shot muskets loaded. Powell and his advance guard {{decided to try to}} capture the camp by themselves, and were successful in persuading a 500-man rebel camp to surrender. Rebel weapons were destroyed, and over 100 prisoners on horses were brought up <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> the remaining portion of the regiment. Union casualties in the raid were 2 horses killed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so {{that it would not be}} returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E

5|$|As {{tensions}} {{among the}} Christians of Neapolis decreased, {{tensions between the}} Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became {{the site of a}} deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.|$|E
5|$|By 9March1968, the U.S. {{facility}} {{on top of}} Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite {{the gravity of the}} situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of U.S. personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages. Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration. Inside the facility, U.S. technicians immediately grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, thereby abandoning the very equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. technicians returned to their positions.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Hàm Nghi's Muong {{bodyguard}} Truong Quang Ngoc betrayed him, {{leading to}} the emperor's capture and deportation to Algeria. Phan and Cao Thang fought on in the mountainous areas of Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa. Another 15 bases were built along <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> complement the headquarters at Vu Quang. Each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men. The operations were funded by local villagers, who were levied with a land tax in silver and rice. Local bases were supported by nearby villages and excess funds were sent to Vu Quang. Phan's men foraged and sold cinnamon bark to raise funds, while lowland peasants donated spare metals {{for the production of}} weapons.|$|E

5|$|The Transylvanian peasants {{had already}} been outraged because of the {{increase}} of existing seigneurial duties and taxes {{and the introduction of}} new taxes during {{the first decades of the}} century. The bishop also tried to collect the tithe from the petty noblemen and from Orthodox Vlachs who had settled in parcels abandoned by Catholic peasants. In the spring of 1437, Hungarian and Vlach commoners, poor townspeople from Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and petty noblemen started to assemble on the flat summit of Mount Bábolna near Alparét (Bobâlna) where they set up a fortified camp. The bishop and his brother, Roland Lépes, the deputy of the voivode (or royal governor) of Transylvania, gathered their troops to fight against the rebels. The voivode, the two counts of the Székelys and many Transylvanian noblemen also hurried to <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> assist them against the rebels.|$|E
5|$|The Wolf and Kirk go {{undercover}} {{to distract}} Boingo as Granny sneaks into his lair, but open conflict ensues. Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red {{down the mountain}} in a cable car loaded with explosives and Granny goes after her, with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit. Red manages to free herself, and escapes with Granny, while the police, who have been located by the Wolf's assistant Twitchy, are waiting {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> arrest Boingo and his henchmen. Some time later, Kirk finds success as part of a yodeling troupe, and Red, Granny, the Wolf, and Twitchy are enlisted by Nicky Flippers to join a crime solving organization called Happily Ever After Agency.|$|E
5|$|The railway opened from Bergen to Voss in 1883 as {{the narrow}} gauge Voss Line. In 1909 the route was {{continued}} over <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> Oslo {{and the whole}} route converted to standard gauge, and the Voss Line {{became part of the}} Bergen Line. The line is single track, and was electrified in 1954-64. The Bergen Line is owned and maintained by Bane NOR, and served with passenger trains by Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and freight trains by CargoNet. The Flåm Line remains as the only branch line, after the closure of the Hardanger Line. The western section from Bergen to Voss is also served by the Bergen Commuter Rail, and was shortened following the 1966 opening of the Ulriken Tunnel.|$|E

50|$|For {{many years}} it has been {{commonly}} believed that the county derived {{its name from the}} Mono tribe of Native Americans name for <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> in its former homeland. Actually the name came to be thought of, mistakenly, as the name of <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the Owens Valley when the first whites there asked the local Paiutes what the name of <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east was.|$|R
5|$|On {{the line}} {{farther to the}} south, North Korean T-34 tank fire hit E Company at midnight. First Lieutenant Charles Ellis, the company commander, {{attempted}} to rally his men but they crumbled under fire, retreating without orders. During the night everyone in E Company ran off the hill except Ellis and 11 men. Several E Company men fled through a mine field they had set up and were killed. North Korean fire pinned Ellis' men down after dawn on September 1. When {{three or four of}} the group tried to escape, North Korean machine gun fire killed them. Ellis and the remaining men stayed in their foxholes on the hill for two days, repelling several attacks in that time. Ellis was then able to withdraw south, up <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> the 3rd Battalion's position. In his withdrawal, Ellis, discovering {{a man who had been}} injured earlier in a mine explosion, entered the mine field to rescue him.|$|E
5|$|TumbleSeed {{begins in}} a quiet forest village {{disturbed}} by angry creatures creating holes in the ground. A seed is tasked to fulfill a vague prophecy by ascending the mountain, progressing through the forest, jungle, desert, and snow, to save the town. The player controls an ascending, horizontal, and slanted vine to balance a rolling seed past procedurally generated holes and enemy obstacles {{to reach the top}} of a mountain. With a controller, the player uses two analog sticks to raise and lower the two edges of the horizontal vine while managing the momentum of the seed. If the seed falls into a hole or hits an enemy, the player loses a life ("heart") and resumes from an earlier position, but the game ends once the player runs out of hearts. Some punishments are more severe: A seed that fall into a hole will resume from the last flagged checkpoint, but if the seed collides with spikes or loses all hearts, the game ends and the player returns to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>to</b> try again.|$|E
