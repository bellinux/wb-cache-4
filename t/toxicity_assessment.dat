40|$|AbstractSeawater {{desalination}} is {{an increasingly}} common means {{to meet the}} demand for freshwater. Resulting wastewater discharges can, however, impact biota of the surrounding environment. Concern exists that interactive effects specific to the outputs of each desalination plant may result in unique impacts difficult to predict by studying existing plants or assessing the effects of individual chemicals found in waste streams. Given this, we highlight an alternative approach to assess potential toxicity of desalination outfalls. Specifically, we review three recent case studies from Australia in which simulated whole effluents were used in <b>toxicity</b> <b>assessments</b> before desalination plants were constructed. This approach enabled potential toxic effects of wastewater to be considered before the plants became operational and, in one case, even facilitated consideration of potential effects of different treatment processes and suppliers. As in many whole effluent <b>toxicity</b> <b>assessments,</b> the time required for testing and restricted range of species considered were limitations. Given the benefits of this method, however, the use of simulated whole effluents is a development that could facilitate an improved capacity to forecast impacts of proposed desalination plants...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEuropean {{governments have}} banned {{the use of}} three common {{neonicotinoid}} pesticides due to insufficiently identified risks to bees. This policy decision is controversial given the absence of clear consistency between <b>toxicity</b> <b>assessments</b> of those substances in the laboratory and in the field. Although laboratory trials report deleterious effects in honeybees at trace levels, field surveys reveal no decrease {{in the performance of}} honeybee colonies in the vicinity of treated fields. Here we provide the missing link, showing that individual honeybees near thiamethoxam-treated fields do indeed disappear at a faster rate, but the impact of this is buffered by the colonies' demographic regulation response. Although we could ascertain the exposure pathway of thiamethoxam residues from treated flowers to honeybee dietary nectar, we uncovered an unexpected pervasive co-occurrence of similar concentrations of imidacloprid, another neonicotinoid normally restricted to non-entomophilous crops in the study country. Thus, its origin and transfer pathways through the succession of annual crops need be elucidated to conveniently appraise the risks of combined neonicotinoid exposures. This study reconciles the conflicting laboratory and field <b>toxicity</b> <b>assessments</b> of neonicotinoids on honeybees and further highlights the difficulty in actually detecting non-intentional effects on the field through conventional risk assessment methods...|$|R

Through this newly developed approach, the comparative hepatotoxicity assessment of two herbal medicines from the same genus, Senecio vulgaris L. and Senecio scandens Buch. -Ham, was performed.

40|$|Abstract. The high {{productivity}} of estuarine environments offers and sustains important habitats for many fish species but also attracts an ever increasing level of human activity, of both commercial and recreational nature. Consequently, estuarine sediments {{are often the}} most heavily polluted marine environments, owing to communal and industrial effluent discharge and pesticide input from agricultural runoff and antifouling agents. With the relative improvement of estuarine water quality in recent years, the focus in aquatic ecotoxicology has increasingly turned to monitoring estuarine sediments, as they may not only act as sinks but also as secondary sources of persistent pollutants. The present paper offers a concise selection of examples of biomarkers {{for a wide range}} of toxic pollutants commonly found in estuarine sediments and the fish species employed as sentinel organisms in sediment <b>toxicity</b> <b>assessments.</b> The applications, advantages and limitations of specific biomarkers as diagnostic tools are presented and discussed...|$|R
