Immune activation contributes to disease onset. However mechanisms balancing the immune response against <b>transmitted</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infection</b> through organ transplantation remain unknown. Methods &# 38; Results: Here we found, using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), that transplantation of LCMV infected hearts led to exhaustion of virus specific CD 8 + T cells, viral persistence in organs and survival of graft and recipient. Genetic depletion of Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) resulted in strong immune activation, graft dysfunction and death of mice, suggesting that IL- 10 was a major regulator of CD 8 + T cell exhaustion during SOT. In the presence of memory CD 8 + T cells, virus could be controlled. However sufficient antiviral immune response resulted in acute rejection of transplanted heart. Conclusion: We found that virus transmitted via SOT could not be controlled by naïve mice recipients due to IL- 10 mediated CD 8 + T cell exhaustion which thereby prevented immunopathology and graft failure whereas memory mice recipients were {{able to control the}} virus and induced graft failure...|$|E

40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{infection is}} {{the most common cause of}} sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infection</b> and is the main cause of cervical cancer. Identification of HPV T-cell epitopes would be instrumental not only in our understanding of the protective immune response but also in the development of vaccines and immunotherapies. In contrast to viruses which cause systemic infection, identification of HPV epitopes is technically challenging because HPV causes a localized mucosal infection and the frequency of pathogen-specific T lymphocytes in peripheral blood is expected to be low. Here we describe three new antigenic epitopes (E 7 7 - 15 [TLHEYMLDL], E 6 52 - 61 [FAFRDLCIVY], and E 7 79 - 87 [LEDLLMGTL]) of HPV 16 E 6 and E 7 proteins which have oncogenic activities. E 7 7 - 15 was identified among peptides previously shown to bind to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A 2. 1 molecule, but it was found likely to be restricted by the HLA-B 48 molecule. E 6 52 - 61 (likely to be restricted by HLA-B 57) and E 7 79 - 87 (likely to be restricted by HLA-B 60) were detected, based on the magnitude of the T-cell immune responses, in another individual. In particular, T-cell clones specific for the E 6 52 - 61 epitope were isolated effectively by magnetically selecting them based on gamma interferon secretion.

In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of purified human thymic DC to HIV- 1 infectionin vitro. HIV- 1 was not detected in cell-free supernatants collected from HIV-infected DC. However, these cultures were shown to transmit HIV- 1 infection since coculture with permissive MT 4 cells resulted in virus production. The exposure of DC in culture to HIV- 1 was shown to promote severe DC morphological changes and killing.

The papillomavirus L 1 major capsid protein, the basis of the currently marketed vaccines, self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs). Here, we describe the expression, purification and characterization of recombinant HPV 16 L 1 produced by a methylotrophic yeast. A codon-optimized HPV 16 L 1 gene was cloned into a non-integrative expression vector under the regulation of a methanol-inducible promoter and used to transform competent Pichia pastoris cells. Purification of L 1 protein from yeast extracts was performed using heparin-sepharose chromatography, followed by a disassembly/reassembly step. VLPs could be assembled from the purified L 1 protein, as demonstrated by electron microscopy. The display of conformational epitopes on the VLPs surface was confirmed by hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays and by immuno-electron microscopy.

We investigated the prevalence of serologic markers for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I/II (HTLV-I/II), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in intravenous drug users and their sexual contacts. Of 585 drug users from northern California tested for these serologic markers, 72 % were reactive for the antibody to HCV, 71 % for the antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, 12 % for HTLV-I/II antibodies, and 1 % for the HIV- 1 antibody. The prevalence of serologic markers for these four viruses correlated with the duration of intravenous drug use, the ethnic group, and the drug of choice. More than 85 % of subjects infected with either HCV or HBV were coinfected with the other virus. All persons reactive to HTLV-I/II antibodies had antibodies for either HBV or HCV. Of 81 sexual contacts tested, 17 % had evidence of HBV infection while only 6 % were reactive for HTLV-I/II antibodies and 4 % for the antibody to HCV. None of this group was infected with HIV- 1.

40|$|GBV-C/HGV in {{hemodialysis}} patients: Anti-E 2 antibodies and GBV-C/HGV-RNA in serum and {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells. Hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV), a recently identified RNA virus {{adds to the}} risk of parenteral <b>transmitted</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections</b> in hemodialysis patients. We studied the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV-RNA in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNC) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and determined antibodies against the envelope protein E 2 of GBV-C/HGV by ELISA. A total of 119 dialysis patients were studied. GBV-C/HGV-RNA was found in 16 of 119 patients (13 %) as compared with 2 % of healthy controls (P = 0. 014). Two of the 16 GBV-C/HGV-RNA+ patients were co-infected with HCV, and none was positive for HBV-DNA. In 38 % of serum GBV-C/HGV-RNA+ patients GBV-C/HGV-RNA was also detected in PMNC. In addition, GBV-C/HGV-RNA was identified in PMNC of 2 patients negative for GBV-C/HGV-RNA in serum. Twenty-four patients had anti-E 2 antibodies in serum (20 %), but were GBV-C/HGV-RNA-. In addition, two of the 16 GBV-C/HGV-RNA+ patients were concomitantly positive for anti-E 2 antibodies. Only one of the 16 GBV-C/HGV infected patients had elevated aminotransferases; this patient was co-infected with hepatitis C virus. GBV-C/HGV-RNA positivity was independent on duration of hemodialysis, but GBV-C/HGV-RNA+ patients had received more units of blood in the past. Combined data of past contact, as assessed by anti-E 2 antibodies, and present infection, documented by GBV-C/HGV-RNA, indicate a high overall exposure to GBV-C/HGV in dialysis patients...|$|R
40|$|The agmatine-containing poly(amidoamine) polymer AGMA 1 was {{recently}} shown to inhibit the infectivity of several viruses, including human papillomavirus 16 (HPV- 16), that exploit cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as attachment receptors. The {{aim of this}} work {{was to assess the}} antiviral activity of AGMA 1 and its spectrum of activity against a panel of low-risk and high-risk HPVs and to elucidate its mechanism of action. AGMA 1 was found to be a potent inhibitor of mucosal HPV types (i. e., types 16, 31, 45, and 6) in pseudovirus-based neutralization assays. The 50 % inhibitory concentration was between 0. 34 g/ml and 0. 73 g/ml, and no evidence of cytotoxicity was observed. AGMA 1 interacted with immobilized heparin and with cellular heparan sulfates, exerting its antiviral action by preventing virus attachment to the cell surface. The findings from this study indicate that AGMA 1 is a leading candidate compound for further development as an active ingredient of a topical microbicide against HPV and other sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections.</b> Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are members of the Papillo-maviridae family of double-stranded DNA nonenveloped vi-ruses (1). The 8 -kb HPV genome is enclosed in a capsid shell comprising major (L 1) and minor (L 2) structural proteins. Most of the HPVs belonging to the Alphapapillomavirus genus are sex-ually transmitted and infect the anogenital mucosa. For the great majority of immunocompetent individuals, HPV infections ar...|$|R
30|$|Mosquito-borne {{diseases}} {{create a}} significant burden every year. For example, malaria caused 438, 000 deaths in 2015, and the dengue incidence has risen 30 -fold {{in the past}} 30  years around the world (WHO 2016). The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus <b>transmits</b> many <b>viral</b> <b>infections,</b> including the yellow fever, dengue and Chikungunya (Hochedez et al. 2006), {{as well as several}} filarial nematodes such as Dirofilaria immitis (Cancrini et al. 2003). Aedes albopictus is capable of hosting the Zika virus and is considered a potential vector for Zika transmission among humans (Paupy et al. 2009; Wong et al. 2013). Because {{more than half of the}} world’s population lives in areas where this mosquito species is present, sustained mosquito control efforts are important to prevent outbreaks from these diseases (Kamareddine et al. 2013).|$|R
