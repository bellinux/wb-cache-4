5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term <b>toxicity</b> <b>studies</b> in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Japanese breeders began to {{selectively}} breed for increased egg production. By 1940, the quail egg industry was flourishing, but {{the events of}} World War II led to {{the complete loss of}} quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production. After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial Japanese quail farming industries. Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and <b>toxicity</b> <b>studies.</b> These quail are closely related to the common quail, and many young hybrid birds are released into the wild each year to replenish dwindling wild populations.|$|E

25|$|Phenylalanine {{is one of}} the {{essential}} amino acids and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life. Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from aspartame for those without phenylketonuria center largely on hypothetical changes in neurotransmitter levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters {{to each other in the}} blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns, and while high doses of aspartame consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in <b>toxicity</b> <b>studies</b> to suggest aspartame can adversely affect neuronal function. Like methanol, common foods in the typical diet, such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from aspartame consumption.|$|E

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the substance phosphorous acid, mixed 2, 4 -bis(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl and 4 -(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl triesters. The substance was evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2011 and 2, 4 -di-tert-amylphenol, an impurity and hydrolysis product was re-evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2015. In this application, the applicant requested an increase of the specific migration limit of the substance, currently established at 5 mg/kg food, to 10 mg/kg food, and provided new toxicological studies. Findings from three new in vitro mutagenicity assays on the oxidation products support the conclusion from 2011 that the substance and its oxidation products are not genotoxic. A new toxicokinetic study on the substance supports the consideration from the evaluation in 2011 that the substance does not raise concern for accumulation. The outcome of a new delayed neurotoxicity study on a structurally related substance, phosphorous acid, tris (2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) ester, which was considered not to cause neurotoxicity in hens, strengthens {{the conclusion of the}} Panel in 2011 that the substance does not represent a concern for neurotoxicity. From a new two-generation reproduction <b>toxicity</b> <b>study</b> and a prenatal developmental <b>toxicity</b> <b>study</b> on the substance, a new subchronic <b>toxicity</b> <b>study</b> on its oxidation products that completes the one submitted in 2011 on the substance itself, and a 2 -year oral <b>toxicity</b> <b>study</b> on the structurally related substance, the lowest NOAEL was 58 - 147 mg/kg bw per day (from the 2 -year oral <b>toxicity</b> <b>study).</b> Compared to the requested increase of the migration limit, this gives an acceptable margin of safety of 348.

ResultsIn acute toxicity, all treated groups’ revealed neither mortality nor any significant alteration in behavior only drowsiness, sedation and lethargy were observed in two group, i. e. 2000 and 4000  mg/kg of the tested plant extract. In sub-acute <b>toxicity</b> <b>study</b> no change in hematological, biochemical parameter and organ body weight were observed during study compared to the normal group.

Presently {{there is a growing}} preponderance of rejection of scientific papers on acute <b>toxicity</b> <b>study,</b> simply because of the belief that in the current hazard and safety as-sessment of drugs and chemicals, LD 50 values are no longer used. In view of this, literature search was carried out with a view to investigating the relevance of LD 50 in development and assessment of drugs and chemicals.

Acute <b>toxicity</b> <b>study</b> is being carried out in medicinal plants research and in the study of patent medicine.
