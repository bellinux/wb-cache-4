5|$|Star Trek: <b>The</b> <b>Animated</b> Series, {{produced}} by Filmation, ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974.

50|$|There is no {{distinction}} between masculine and feminine - instead there is a distinction between items that are animate {{and those that are}} inanimate. <b>The</b> <b>animate</b> category includes all human beings and animals, but in general not all other categories such as plants, body parts, utensils etc. are fully under <b>the</b> <b>animate</b> category. A restricted set of items that are neither human nor animal are still considered, for example rock, pipe, raspberries, pants, etc. Even across different Saulteaux dialects ‘strawberry’ fluctuates in its animacy. This {{may be related to the}} practice of a “Strawberry Dance” by certain communities. The gender of an entity is important because for many morphemes, the language uses gender-specific morphology that distinguishes <b>the</b> <b>animate</b> from <b>the</b> inanimate.|$|R
