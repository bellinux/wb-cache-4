40|$|International audienceSoftware {{engineering}} research now considers that no system is an island, {{but it is}} part of an ecosystem involving other systems, developers, and users. When a framework or a library evolves, its clients often must adapt. For example, client developers might need to adapt to functionalities, client systems might need to be adapted to a new API, and client users might need to adapt to a new user interface. The consequences of these changes are yet unclear: what proportion of the ecosystem might be expected to react, how long might it <b>take</b> for <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> diffuse in the ecosystem, do all clients react in the same way? This paper reports an exploratory study aimed at observing API evolution and its impact on a large software ecosystem, Pharo, which has about 3, 600 distinct systems, and six years of evolution. We analyze 118 API changes in the context of method replacement and suggestion, and answer research questions regarding the magnitude, duration, extension, and consistency of such changes in the ecosystem. The results of this study help to characterize the impact of API evolution in large software ecosystems and provide the basis to better understand how such impact can be alleviated...|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} the title, the strip had no {{connection}} with the Second World War! Drawn by John Stokes, {{it was in fact}} a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in Lion from 1964, under the titles Britain in Chains and The Battle for Britain, where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of Smash <b>took</b> <b>a</b> decision <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. gun barrel), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in Lion, such that Smash actually ceased publication - in April 1971 - before it had reprinted the entire run from Lion, and in the final issue created a new ending to the serial.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 CEN sent a {{questionnaire}} {{on the use}} of Guide 6 to its technical committees. The results showed that 3 out of 275 CEN committees used the Guide 6.

In 2007-2008, NEN - the Dutch standardisation organisation - and Standard Norge carried out a feasibility study within the European Mandate M/371. One of the findings was that the implementation of Guide 6 faced some difficulties. For this reason, NEN and CEN started an action to promote the use of Guide 6, and in December 2007 NEN proposed the installation of an CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG Accessibility for All. ANEC also supported the creation of such a working group. This {{led to the creation of}} the CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 Implementation Mechanism.

50|$|Model {{calibration}} {{is achieved}} by adjusting any available parameters in order to adjust how the model operates and simulates the process. For example, in traffic simulation, typical parameters include look-ahead distance, car-following sensitivity, discharge headway, and start-up lost time. These parameters influence driver behavior such as when {{and how long it}} <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> driver <b>to</b> <b>change</b> lanes, how much distance a driver leaves between his car and {{the car in front of}} it, and how quickly a driver starts to accelerate through an intersection. Adjusting these parameters has a direct effect on the amount of traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network by making the drivers more or less aggressive. These are examples of calibration parameters that can be fine-tuned to match characteristics observed in the field at the study location. Most traffic models have typical default values but they may need to be adjusted to better match the driver behavior at the specific location being studied.|$|R

[...] "We want to see this war ended, and it's going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> of administration <b>to</b> do it," [...] Martin said. At the state level, Martin questioned a $500,000 school book depository contract awarded to Wallace supporter Elton B. Stephens of Ebsco Investment Company. Martin challenged [...] "secret deals" [...] regarding the construction of highways or schools" [...] and [...] "conspiracies between the state house and the White House." [...] At her general election campaign kickoff in Birmingham, Lurleen Wallace pledged [...] "progress without compromise" [...] and [...] "accomplishment without surrender ... George will continue to speak up and stand up for Alabama." [...] She continued: [...] "Contrary to what the liberals preach, progress can be made without sacrificing the free enterprise system and ... the Constitution." [...] It was during this 1966 campaign that Wallace coined his line: [...] "There's not a dime's worth of difference" [...] between the two national parties. Wallace likened such Republicans as the then House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford, Jr., later the president from 1974 to 1977, and Chief Justice Earl Warren, who supported civil rights legislation, to [...] "vultures" [...] who presided over the destruction of the U.S. Constitution. In plugging for two-party politics, Martin claimed {{that the only way to}} unseat President Johnson was for Alabama and the South to become [...] "strongly conservative Republican states." [...] One of Martin's slogans read: [...] "Beat LBJ the Jim Martin Way." [...] Wallace's memoirs merely mention Martin as [...] "the strongest Republican candidate in many years." [...] The Wallaces had little need to campaign, as hardly anyone could out-fox Wallace in the then [...] "popular sport of LBJ-cussin'". [...] Martin did not receive all of the anti-Wallace vote by default. Some liberals coalesced behind the Independent candidate Carl Ray Robinson, a physician and lawyer from Bessemer. Robinson claimed that Wallace had so perverted the Democratic label that Martin, rather than James B. Allen, could be the Democratic lieutenant governor nominee. Robinson filed a $5 million slander suit against Martin after the Republican alleged that Wallace was subsidizing the Robinson campaign in order to split the opposition. Martin dismissed the suit as [...] "something the Democrats have cooked up" [...] and questioned how it could be slanderous to say that [...] "one Democrat supports another." [...] Former Senator Barry Goldwater and sitting Senator Strom Thurmond campaigned on behalf of Martin and Senate candidate John Grenier. Thurmond, who had carried Alabama in 1948 as the nominee of the Dixiecrats addressed an all-white GOP state convention, where he denounced the national Democratic leadership as [...] "the most dangerous people in the country" [...] and urged a [...] "return to constitutional government." [...] George Wallace was so irritated over Goldwater's appearance on Martin's behalf that he questioned why Goldwater could win only six states in his 1964 race against Johnson. [...] "Where were the Republicans when I was fighting LBJ?" [...] Wallace asked. Goldwater shunned personal criticism of Wallace but repudiated Wallace's talk of a third party in the 1968 presidential election.|$|R
