5|$|In 1934, Nakayama {{commissioned}} the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{blueprint for the}} area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard {{would come out of}} the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six school buildings would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built {{at the end of this}} boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but as Japan mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.|$|E

5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> list of targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1943, {{he headed}} up a {{committee}} of USAAF and RAF commanders <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO). Despite {{the fact that it}} altered the target system priorities outlined in AWPD-42, and changed the overall goal of the offensive from knocking Germany out of the war using airpower to one of preparing for the invasion of Europe, Hansell approved the designation of the German aircraft industry as its most important target and the destruction of the German Luftwaffe as its top priority. Hansell wrote the final draft of the CBO plan himself. Although Hansell did not personally participate in later strategic bombing operations against Germany, he had been instrumental in setting in motion the plans and policies that led to the near total destruction of German war industry.|$|E
5|$|Howe and Murray {{returned}} to England in 1778. Howe was disaffected by his experiences of command in North America, and consequently did not bestow patronage on those junior officers under his command, {{as was the}} custom. Instead a friend of Murray's father, Captain George Montagu arranged for him <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> record of his service and good conduct in the North American campaign, which was then {{passed on to the}} First Lord of the Admiralty, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 19 November 1778, and quickly received his commission on 31 December that year. He was to be second lieutenant aboard the 32-gun , under Captain Charles Holmes Everitt. It was to be a short-lived appointment as on 19 March 1779 she ran aground and was wrecked on the Breton coast while chasing a French frigate. Murray was captured and became a prisoner of war, spending the next two years in captivity and occupying himself with the study of the French language and naval regulations. He was released and exchanged {{when he came to the}} attention of the French authorities after chastising an American privateersman for wearing a British uniform.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August, the Scottish Parliament met {{to settle}} {{religious}} issues. Knox {{and five other}} ministers were called upon <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished {{the jurisdiction of the}} Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or the Kirk. They would work for several months on the Book of Discipline, the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox's wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox to care for their two sons, aged three and a half and two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{remained the}} headquarters of Cunard until the 1960s, {{when they decided to}} relocate their UK operations to Southampton on England's south coast and their global headquarters to New York. Cunard subsequently sold the building to Prudential plc in 1969. In 1965 the Cunard Building was awarded Grade II* listed building status by the English Heritage. Initially, it was listed together with the Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building under Pier Head, but in 1985 each building gained its own listing. In November 2001 the building was sold to the Merseyside Pension Fund, an organisation that provides pension services to public sector workers in Merseyside. Today, the building provides a range of office accommodation for a variety of public and private sector organisations, including Government Office North West. In November 2008 it was announced that the building managers had appointed the local architects firm Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> conservation plan to preserve the building. The plan involved collaboration with English Heritage and the Local Authority Conservation Officer and would be used to control any modification and repairs made to the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} history of Greece {{between the end}} of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479–431 BC) is not well supported by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia (πεντηκονταετία, the Fifty Years) by ancient writers, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporaneous, is Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is, used by historians <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.|$|E
40|$|Research Objective: This study {{focuses on}} ADs in the Netherlands and {{introduces}} a cross-cultural perspective by comparing {{it with other}} countries. Methods: A questionnaire {{was sent to a}} panel comprising 1621 people representative of the Dutch population. The response was 86 %. Results: 95 % of the respondents didn't have an AD, and 24 % of these were not familiar with the idea of <b>drawing</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> AD. Most of those familiar with ADs knew about the Advanced Euthanasia Directive (AED, 64 %). Both low education and the presence of a religious conviction that {{plays an important role in}} one's life increase the chance of not wanting <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> AD. Also not having experienced a request for euthanasia from someone else, and the inconceivability of asking for euthanasia yourself, increase the chance of not wanting <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> AD. Discussion: This study shows that the subjects of palliative care and end-of-life-decision-making were very much dominated by the issue of euthanasia in the Netherlands. The AED was the best known AD; and factors that can be linked to euthanasia play an important role in whether or not people choose <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> AD. This differentiates the Netherlands from other countries and, when it comes to ADs, the global differences between countries and cultures are still so large that the highest possible goals, at this moment in time, are observing and possibly learning from other cultural settings. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

5|$|WWV's 20MHz {{signal was}} used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the {{disintegration}} of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake {{a small amount of}} ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Scootie Randall {{returned}} to the Owls and earned the start, although he only played for six minutes and did not score. The game began with hot shooting by Penn State's Talor Battle, who drained three of his first four threes to put the Nittany Lions up 20–11. A 17-point first half by Juan Fernandez helped Temple Owls take a 35–33 lead at halftime. Jeff Brooks, a starting forward for the Nittany Lions, dislocated his right shoulder a minute into the half and sat {{out the rest of}} the game. In the second half, there were ten lead changes, and neither team led by more than four points. Ramone Moore's 15 foot shot with 1:10 remaining pulled the Owls ahead 62–61. In Penn State's ensuing possession, Battle took the ball to the hoop but was blocked by Rahlir Jefferson, and Temple Owls took possession. Fernandez was fouled, and his pair of free throws with 28 seconds left extended the Owl lead to 64–61. With the clock at 12.2, Battle hit a three pointer from beyond the NBA line to tie the game at 64-64. Fran Dunphy called a timeout, and Khalif Wyatt advised Dunphy <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> play for Fernandez. Fernandez was double-teamed and was forced to take an off-balance 18-footer. The ball fell through the hoop with four seconds remaining, and Temple Owls won 66–64. Fernandez and Moore finished with 23 points, a season high for Fernandez.|$|E
