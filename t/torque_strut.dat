40|$|The metal-V {{belt drive}} {{includes}} {{a large number}} of parts which interact between them to transmit power from the input to the output pulleys. A compression belt composed of a great number of struts is maintained by a tension flat belt. Power is them shared into the two belts that moves generally in opposite directions. Due to the particular geometry of the elements and to the great number of parts, a numerical approach achieves the global equilibrium of the mechanism from the elementary part equilibrium. Sliding arc on each pulley can be thus defined both for the compression and tension belts. Finally, power sharing can be calculated as differential motion between the belts, is defined. The first part of the paper will present the different steps of the quasi-static mechanical analysis and their numerical implementations. Load distributions, speed profiles and sliding angle values will be discussed. The second part of the paper will deal to a systematic use of the computer software. Speed ratio, transmitted <b>torque,</b> <b>strut</b> geometry and friction coefficients effect will be analysed with the output parameter variations. Finally, the effect pulley deformable flanges will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] A {{study is}} made of the {{influence}} of working pressure, relay torque-arm radius and other design factors on the maximum output speed and velocity constant of a single-stage hydraulic servo for guided missile use. Methods are given for determining the best relay torque-arm radius, which may be applied to valves having non-linear flow and reaction characteristics. 1. Introduction. [...] The analysis given in this paper applies to typical guided-missile control-fin servos in which a hydraulic piston valve is driven by an electro-mechanical proportional relay through a <b>torque</b> arm and <b>strut</b> linkage (Figs. 1 and 2). In the type considered, the reaction or flow force experienced by the valve is used as a hydraulic spring and thus largely determines the characteristics of the combination of relay and valve...|$|R
40|$|While most {{instruction}} aims {{to provide}} students with content knowledge accompanied by practical application, the classroom experience typically has difficulty providing students with non-trivial examples. Graduating students also express a lack of confidence in integrating knowledge gained in disparate courses regarding identifying problems and synthesizing solutions. Many programs include industry-based projects as a solution to these issues. This approach has various drawbacks, including the difficulty of implementing such a project in a sizable number of the courses, the need for a significant commitment of class time, establishing contacts and ensuring that students have sufficient access to them to develop a model. The Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Department at Wichita State University is developing an integrated set of realistic virtual reality models of a manufacturing line at Boeing Wichita. This line and the virtual models will serve as a mega-case that will be used throughout the curriculum to vertically integrate the concepts across the curriculum and provide a situated learning experience for students. This large-scale virtual reality factory module, ‘Innovation in Aircraft Manufacturing through System-Wide Virtual Reality Models and Curriculum Integration’, is funded by the National Science Foundation through the Partnerships for Innovation program. The virtual reality models being developed include a Quest discrete-event simulation model of the 767 <b>strut</b> <b>torque</b> box manufacturing line and work cell level models in IGRIP and Jack software applications. Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) 2. 0 files are generated from these models for use in case studies in various classes in the curriculum. Further details are available on the websit...|$|R
