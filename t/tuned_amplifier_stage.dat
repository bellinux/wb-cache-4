5000|$|Hazeltine's {{innovation}} was to add {{a circuit}} to each radio frequency amplifier stage which fed back {{a small amount of}} energy from the plate (output) circuit to the grid (input) circuit with opposite phase to cancel ("neutralize") the feedback which was causing the oscillation. This effectively prevented the high-pitched squeals that had plagued early radio sets. A group of more than 20 companies known as the Independent Radio Manufacturers Association licensed the circuit from Hazeltine and manufactured [...] "Neutrodyne" [...] receivers throughout the 1920s. [...] At the time, RCA held a virtual monopoly over commercial radio receiver production due to its ownership of the rights to the Armstrong regenerative and superheterodyne circuits. The Neutrodyne ended this control, allowing competition. Compared to the technically superior superheterodyne the Neutrodyne was cheaper to build. As basically a TRF receiver, it was also considered easier for non-technical owners to use than the early superhets. After manufacture each <b>tuned</b> <b>amplifier</b> <b>stage</b> had to be neutralized, adjusted to cancel feedback; after this the set would not produce the parasitic oscillations which caused the objectionable noises. By 1927 some ten million of these receivers had been sold to consumers in North America.|$|E

50|$|Staggered tuning is a {{technique}} used {{in the design of}} multi-stage <b>tuned</b> <b>amplifiers</b> whereby each <b>stage</b> is tuned to a slightly different frequency. In comparison to synchronous tuning (where each stage is tuned identically) it produces a wider bandwidth at the expense of reduced gain. It also produces a sharper transition from the passband to the stopband. Both staggered tuning and synchronous tuning circuits are easier to tune and manufacture than many other filter types.|$|R
50|$|This {{can be done}} straightforwardly for the {{complete}} filter {{in the case of}} synchronously <b>tuned</b> <b>amplifiers</b> where every <b>stage</b> has the same ω0 but for a stagger-tuned amplifier there is no simple analytical solution to the transform. Stagger-tuned designs can be approached instead by calculating the poles of a low-pass prototype of the desired form (e.g. Butterworth) and then transforming those poles to a band-pass response. The poles so calculated can then be used to define the tuned circuits of the individual stages.|$|R
