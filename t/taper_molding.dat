40|$|The use of TurboSwirl {{to obtain}} an {{improved}} steel cleanliness during filling of an ingot was numerically studied by VOF and DPM models. It was found that a radius-reduced TurboSwirl or a proper <b>tapered</b> <b>mold</b> entrance nozzle with an adequate developed region for steel flow can {{reduce the risk of}} mold flux entrapment in a mold. The ingot casting process can create highly turbulent conditions inside the mold during the initial stages of casting. Since the TurboSwirl generates much calmer filling conditions it can promote separation of large nonmetallic inclusions. The TurboSwirl also collects large inclusions (200 [*]μm) towards the axis of rotation, which should promote agglomeration. In addition, the residence time for inclusions of small sizes can be prolonged, increasing chance of agglomeration, which indirectly promotes their separation from steel. Moreover, the average turbulent dissipation rate in an ingot casting swirl setup is about 40 % higher than that in a no swirl setup. This further facilitates the agglomeration of inclusions before they enter the mold. The removal of nonmetallic inclusions is thus enhanced because of an increasing inclusion collision rate due to both Stokes collisions and turbulent collisions, while maintaining a calm flow inside the mold...|$|R
40|$|Mold slag {{friction}} and fracture may cause heat transfer variations in continuous casting, {{which leads to}} steel shell temperature and stress variations, resulting in surface cracks. Analytical transient models of liquid slag flow and solid slag stress have been coupled with a finite-difference model of heat transfer in the mold, gap and steel shell to predict transient shear stress, friction, slip and fracture of the slag layers. The models are validated by comparing with numerical models and plant measurements of mold friction. Using reported slag fracture strength and TTT diagrams, the models are applied to study the effect of casting speed and mold powder viscosity properties on slag layer behavior between the oscillating mold wall and the solidifying steel shell. The study finds that liquid slag lubrication would produce negligible stresses. Lower mold slag consumption rate leads to high solid {{friction and}} results in solid slag layer fracture and movement below a critical value. Crystalline slag tends to fracture near the meniscus and glassy slag tends to fracture near mold exit. Medium casting speed may be the safest to avoid slag fracture due to its having the lowest critical lubrication consumption rate. The high measured friction force in operating casters {{could be due to}} three sources: an intermittent moving solid slag layer, excessive <b>mold</b> <b>taper</b> or <b>mold</b> misalignment. 2 I...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} facile {{fabrication}} method for the fabrication of functional large area nanostructured polymer films using a drop casting technique. Reusable and <b>tapered</b> silicon <b>molds</b> were utilized {{in the production}} of functional polymers providing rapid fabrication of the paraboloid nanostructures at the desired structural heights without the requirement of any complex production conditions, such as high temperature or pressure. The fabricated polymer films demonstrate promising qualities in terms of antireflective, hydrophobic and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) features. We achieved up to 92 % transmission from the single-side nanostructured polymer films by implementing optimized nanostructure parameters which were determined using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method prior to production. Large-area nanostructured films were observed to enhance the Raman signal with an enhancement factor of 4. 9 × 106 compared to bare film, making them potentially suitable as free-standing SERS substrates. The utilized fabrication method with its demonstrated performances and reliable material properties, paves the way for further possibilities in biological, optical, and electronic applications. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
50|$|A notable {{technological}} {{triumph of}} the Edison Laboratories was devising a method to mass-produce pre-recorded phonograph cylinders in molds. This was done by using very slightly <b>tapered</b> cylinders and <b>molding</b> in a material that contracted as it set. To Edison's disappointment the commercial potential of this process was not realized for some years. Most of the regional Edison distributors were able to fill the small early market for recordings by mechanical duplication of a few dozen cylinders at a time. Molded cylinders did not become a significant force in the marketplace {{until the end of}} the 1890s, which was when molding was slow and was used only to create pantograph masters.|$|R
40|$|A coupled finite-element model, CON 2 D, {{has been}} {{developed}} to simulate temperature, stress, and shape development during the continuous casting of steel, both in and below the mold. The model simulates a transverse section of the strand in generalized plane strain as it moves down at the casting speed. It includes the effects of heat conduction, solidification, nonuniform superheat dissipation due to turbulent fluid flow, mutual dependence of the heat transfer and shrinkage {{on the size of}} the interfacial gap, the <b>taper</b> of the <b>mold</b> wall, and the thermal distortion of the mold. The stress model features an elastic-viscoplastic creep constitutive equation that accounts for the different responses of the liquid, semisolid, delta-ferrite, and austenite phases. Functions depending on temperature and composition are employed for properties such as thermal linear expansion. A contact algorithm is used to prevent penetration of the shell into the mold wall due to the internal liquid pressure. An efficient two-step algorithm is used to integrate these highly nonlinear equations. The model is validated with an analytical solution for both temperature and stress in a solidifying slab. It is applied to simulate continuous casting of a 120 mm billet and compares favorably with plant measurements of mold wall temperature, total heat removal, and shell thickness, including thinning of the corner. The model is ready to investigate issues in continuous casting such as <b>mold</b> <b>taper</b> optimization, minimum shell thickness to avoid breakouts, and maximum casting speed to avoid hot-tear crack formation due to submold bulging.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to compute the thermomechanical state of the shell of continuously cast steels in a round billet casting mold. The model determines the temperature distri-butions, the stresses in and {{the gap between the}} casting mold and the solidifying strand. The effect of variations in steel carbon content and <b>mold</b> <b>taper</b> on the thermal, displacement, and stress fields are examined. Comparisons with available xperimental observations verify the predictions of the model. The model demonstrates that the thermal shrinkage associated with the phase change from delta-ferrite to austenite in 0. 1 pct C steel accounts for the decreased heat transfer observed in that alloy, as well as its susceptibility to cracking.

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringIn this thesis, a novel batch {{fabrication}} {{technology for}} a mixed-scale PDMS (Polydimethylsilane) channel networks using carbon- micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) and single molding process is introduced. Nanofabrication {{has been used}} in broad research fields including single electron memories, multiple tunnel junction (MTJ) devices, micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and nanofluidic devices. Nanofluidic channel networks are crucial parts in various applications such as DNA electrophoresis, bio sensors, molecular preconcentration, ionic transport nanofluidic diodes, desalination, nanofludic transistors because of their unique phenomena including ion concentration polarization, ion rectification effect, nanocapillarity and electrical double layer overlap. However, the research on the nanofluidics has been limited {{because of the lack of}} simple and cost-effective nanofabrication technologies. Microfabrication technologies that are compatible with nanofabrication processes also needs to be developed so as to integrate microfluidic channels with nanochannels, because the microchannels guide sample fluid into and out of the nanochannels and thus mixed-scale channel networks are the basic architecture of the nanofluidic devices. However, the fabrication of mixed-scale channel networks is limited by difficult alignment processes between nanostructures and microstructures, high fabrication cost, and time consuming and complex processes. These limitations can be overcame by utilizing carbon-MEMS technology and single polymer molding process. A mixed-scale carbon structure as the mold of a Poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) channel network was fabricated using conventional UV lithography and pyrolysis. A single molding process using multi-layers of hard PDMS and soft PDMS completes the fabrication of mixed-scale PDMS channel networks including 55 -nm-high and 441 -nm-wide nanochannels. The quality of the PDMS molding process was evaluated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The surface energy of the pyrolyzed carbon mold could be modulated by controlling pyrolysis temperature resulting in high surface energy. As a result, a single carbon mold could replicate PDMS channel networks more than 40 times without anti-adhesion coating. The hermetic sealing and uniformity of the PDMS nanochannel were evaluated by filling the mixed-scale PDMS channel networks with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The properties of PDMS nanochannels were characterized by measuring I-V relationship in KCl solution. Except for the simple fabrication of the complex carbon mold, the pyrolysis process also enabled the formation of smoothly <b>tapered</b> <b>mold</b> side wall because of good adhesion between the photoresist and substrate, and volume reduction in pyrolysis. As a result, 3 -D funnels could be integrated at the entrance and exit of the nanochannel. By this novel 3 -D funnel structure, efficient entrapment of a single micro particle at the entrance of a nanochannel was enabled. It is expected that the mixed-scale PDMS channel networks with 3 D-funnels can be applied to nanoelectroporation for efficient cell transfectionope...|$|R
