Between 1959 and 1961, suburban services switched to diesel multiple units, while the last regular long-distance steam train left Paddington on 11 June 1965.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} <b>tracking</b> <b>curves</b> in dense visual clutter is challenging. Kalman {{filtering}} is inadequate {{because it is}} based on Gaussian densities which, being unimodal, cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. The Condensation algorithm uses “factored sampling”, previously applied to the interpretation of static images, in which the probability distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set. Condensation uses learned dynamical models, together with visual observations, to propagate the random set over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time. 1. <b>Tracking</b> <b>Curves</b> in Clutter The purpose of this paper 1 is to establish a stochastic framework for <b>tracking</b> <b>curves</b> in visual clutter, using a sampling algorithm. The approach is rooted in ideas from statistics, control theory and computer vision. The problem is to track outlines and features of foreground objects, modelled as curves, as they move in substantial clutter, and to do it at, or close to, vide...|$|R

5000|$|On early railroads, {{because of}} the low speeds and wide-radius curves employed, the {{surveyors}} were able to ignore any form of easement, but during the 19th century, as speeds increased, {{the need for a}} <b>track</b> <b>curve</b> with gradually increasing curvature became apparent. Rankine's 1862 [...] "Civil Engineering" [...] cites several such curves, including an 1828 or 1829 proposal based on the [...] "curve of sines" [...] by William Gravatt, and the curve of adjustment by William Froude around 1842 approximating the elastic curve. The actual equation given in Rankine is that of a cubic curve, which is a polynomial curve of degree 3. This was also known as cubic parabola at that time.|$|E

5000|$|Right after a gas station/pawn shop, US 23/42 officially enters Jackson. The {{railroad}} {{line that}} US 23 ran over when it crossed the bridge in Macon is encountered {{again at the}} intersection with Eighth Street. The road curves away from the tracks and then back near the intersections with Indian Springs Street and then Railroad Street, then curves away from them again as it approaches Georgia Route 16 and joins it in another concurrency along East Third Street heading west. At the intersection with Covington Street and College Street, the routes are also joined by SR 36 until they reach Mulberry Street at the historic Butts County Courthouse. SR 16 continues west onto West Third Street, while US 23/SR 42 makes a right turn to the north-northwest onto Brookwood Avenue. The route approaches the same railroad line it flanked north of Flovilla, and curves to the northwest along {{the west side of}} those tracks. Just south of Old Bethel Road it moves away {{from the side of the}} tracks, and curves more towards the west again before entering Jenkinsburg, where that same railroad line now runs along the north side of the road. Along the way, it passes by a Scotts mulch mill and the local post office. After Sihloh Road it turns southwest, but curves back towards the northwest again at the intersection with County Line Road and McGough Road where it obviously crosses the Butts-Henry County line. Here the road is named [...] "State Route 42" [...] and varies between two and three lanes. At some point within the county the routes enter Locust Grove. The road runs close to the southwest side of the previously mentioned railroad line across from South Singley Drive (which at one time crossed the tracks), then again across from Beulah Lane and Southridge Drive, and once again east of Grove Road, remaining along that side. The road and the railroad <b>track</b> <b>curve</b> more toward the northwest between LG Griffin and Indian Creek Roads, but on the opposite side of the tracks approaches the Locust Grove Recreational Center, and then the NRHP-listed Locust Grove Institute Academic Building, on the southwest corner of Bill Gardner Parkway. Before the intersection with South Gardner Lane and North Jackson Street the tracks move away from the road, which itself passes through an industrial zone. North of Bethlehem Road, US 23/SR 42 climbs an embankment for a bridge over the railroad line it frequently encountered, and now runs along the east side of those tracks. The road moves away from the tracks at an industrial cul-de-sac, and then passes by a self-storage warehouse that has a former jet fighter used as a sign. Further north after the intersection with King Mill Road, it gains the name Macon Street and passes by a local Whirlpool Warehouse, and later a Toys 'R' Us warehouse.|$|E

40|$|Advances {{in the use}} of {{fractional}} order calculus {{in control}} theory in- creasingly make their way into control applications such as in the process industry, electrical machines, mechatronics/robotics, albeit at a slower rate into control applications in automotive and railway systems. We present work on advances in high-speed rail vehicle tilt control design enabled by use of fractional order methods. Analytical problems in rail tilt control still exist especially on simplified tilt using non-precedent sensor information (rather than use of the more complex precedence (or preview) schemes). Challenges arise due to suspension dynamic interactions (due to strong coupling between roll and lateral dynamic modes) and the sensor measure- ment. We explore optimized PID-based non-precedent tilt control via both direct fractional-order PID design and via fractional-order based loop shap- ing that reduces effect of lags in the design model. The impact of fractional order design methods on tilt performance (<b>track</b> <b>curve</b> following vs ride quality) trade off is particularly emphasized. Simulation results illustrate superior benefit by utilizing fractional order-based tilt control design...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of Q-angle on running curve {{kinematics}} and kinetics. Each dependent variable was evaluated for statistically significant differences using a two factor mixed analysis of variance with repeated measures on the <b>track</b> <b>curve</b> variable. A significance level of P 3 ̆c 0. 05 was employed for the evaluations. Independent variables were curve radius and Q-angle. Dependent variables included peak vertical force, time of peak vertical force, average vertical force, vertical impulse, continuous relative phase, and variability of continuous relative phase. Three levels of curve radius were used: straightaway, 36. 5 m, and 18. 5 m. The conclusions of this study are that runners with high Q-angles are not at greater risk for injury than runners with low Q-angles. Furthermore, all runners, regardless of individual Q-angle measurement, may be at increased risk of injury while repetitively running curves. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Introduction: Tramway {{has become}} a serious urban noise source in densely {{populated}} areas. The disturbance from squealing noise is significant. Curve squeal is the very loud, tonal noise emitted by tram operation in tight radius curves. Studies had reported a relationship between noise levels and health effects, such as annoyance, sleep disturbance, and elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Materials and Methods: This study aimed to analyze the wheel squeal noise along the tramway line in Košice, Slovakia, review the effects on human health, and discuss its inclusion in the design method. To observe {{the influence of a}} <b>track</b> <b>curve</b> on noise emission, several measurement points were selected, and the noise emission was measured both in the curve and in the straight lines employing the same type of permanent way. Results: The results in the sections with the radius below 50 [*]m were greatly affected by the presence of a squeal noise, while the resulting noise level in the sections with the radius above 50 [*]m depended on their radius. The difference between the average values of LAeq with and without the squeal in the measurement points with the radius below 50 [*]m was 9 [*]dB. The difference between the measurements in the curve sections with the radius below 50 [*]m and those in the straight line was 2. 7 [*]dB. Conclusion: The resulting noise level in general was influenced by the car velocity and the technical shape of the permanent way. These results can be used in noise prognoses and in the health effect predictions...|$|E
