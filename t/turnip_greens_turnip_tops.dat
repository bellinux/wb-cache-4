40|$|Brassica rapa is an {{important}} species of the genus Brassica widely cultivated {{in the world as}} a vegetable and for edible and industrial oil. In Galicia (Northwestern Spain) and in the coldest regions of Portugal Brassica rapa subsp. rapa L. includes three different crops: <b>turnips,</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and <b>turnip</b> <b>tops.</b> <b>Turnips</b> are the thickened roots, <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> are the young leaves harvested in the vegetative period, while <b>turnip</b> <b>tops</b> are the floral shoots and surrounding leaves. They have been under cultivation for a large period since they were among the first vegetables to be introduced into the Western Iberian Peninsula (Gómez-Campo, 1999). A collection of B. rapa subsp. rapa from northwestern Spain is currently kept at ‘Misión Biológica de Galicia’ (CSIC, Spain). This collection was preliminary evaluated based on agronomical and morfological traits by Padilla et al. (2005). One hundred and twenty B. rapa varieties of this collection were evaluated finding that in many cases, the same landrace is sown for more than one purpose. However, the potential yield of these varieties and the stability of performance have yet not been explored. Based on this previous clasification twelve varieties were selected with the aim of determining the most promising varieties for <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and/or <b>turnip</b> <b>tops</b> fresh production to be included in future breeding programs.

40|$|Twelve Brassica rapa {{varieties}} grown, such as <b>turnip</b> <b>green</b> and <b>turnip</b> <b>top,</b> {{were evaluated}} in seven environments {{to determine the}} environmental and genotypic variables that have an influence on crop production and {{on the content of}} glucosinolates and phenolic compounds. Factorial regression analysis showed that, in general, crop production was favored by high temperatures all along the crop cycle. However, the lack of a period of intense cold could be a limiting factor. The metabolite content seems to be regulated by extreme temperatures (daily maximum and minimum temperatures) rather than by average daily temperatures. With regard to genotypic covariables, <b>turnip</b> <b>top</b> production was significantly affected by traits related to the vegetative development and time to flowering.

40|$|In Galicia (northwestern Spain), Brassica rapa subsp. rapa L. {{includes}} <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and <b>turnip</b> <b>tops</b> as main crops. Evaluation of B. rapa varieties {{with wide}} adaptability across diverse farming environments {{is important for}} selecting varieties for future breeding programs based on producers and consumers preferences. Twelve varieties of this species were evaluated in seven environments {{to determine the best}} performing varieties and to assess their nutritional characteristics. Different agronomical traits related with production, earliness, and adaptation were evaluated and most of them showed significant differences among varieties, years, and locations. To study more deeply the effect of the genotype main effect (G) plus the genotype × environment interaction (GE) on fresh production, the site regression model (SREG) was used. The G+GE interaction explained 46 and 58 % of fresh production for <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and <b>tops,</b> respectively. The GGE biplot technique facilitates a visual evaluation of superior genotypes. The varieties MBG-BRS 0550 and MBG-BRS 0082 were the best genotypes for <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> production for almost all environments whereas the most suitable varieties for <b>turnip</b> <b>tops</b> production were MBG-BRS 0472 and MBG-BRS 0143. Varieties differed significantly for crude fiber and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content and they showed higher concentration of the anions Cl−, NO 3 −, and SO 4 2 – in <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> than in <b>turnip</b> <b>tops.</b> Both plant organs showed high contents of Ca, K, Mg, and P. Therefore, B. rapa varieties evaluated proved to be a valuable source of minerals, protein, and fiber.

40|$|Productivity {{and quality}} of crops of Brassica rapa L. in {{north-western}} of Spain are highly affected by black rot, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Pammel) Dowson (Xcc). Several races of Xcc have been described in this area, being the race 6 the most frequent in B. rapa crops and races 1 and 4 the most frequent in B. oleracea crops. The control of the disease can be aided by the employment of resistant varieties. The aim of this work was to find sources of resistance to Xcc {{in a collection of}} open-pollinated varieties of B. rapa from north-western Spain. Resistance was evaluated in 191 landraces. Partial resistance to races 6, 1 and 4 and complete resistance to race 4 were identified in several landraces. Several accessions exhibited partial resistance to the three races. Sources of resistance were identified in landraces of different crops of the species (<b>turnips,</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and <b>turnip</b> <b>tops).</b> These landraces could be grown after selection for resistance or they can be donors of resistance genes in breeding programmes.

40|$|Brassica rapa rapa {{group is}} widely {{distributed}} and consumed in northwestern Spain. The consumption of Brassica vegetables has {{been related to}} human health due to their phytochemicals, such as glucosinolates and phenolic compounds that induce a variety of physiological functions including antioxidant activity, enzymes regulation and apoptosis control and the cell cycle. For first time in Brassica crops, intact glucosinolates and phenolic compounds were simultaneously identified and characterized. Twelve intact glucosinolates, belonging to the three chemical classes, and more than 30 phenolic compounds were found in B. rapa leaves and young shoots (<b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and <b>turnip</b> <b>tops)</b> by LC-UV photodiode array detection (PAD) -electrospray ionization (ESI). The main naturally occurring phenolic compounds identified were flavonoids and derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids. The majority of the flavonoids were kaempferol, quercetin and isorhamnetin glycosylated and acylated with different hydroxycinnamic acids. Quantification of the main compounds by HPLC-PAD showed significant differences for most of compounds between plant organs. Total glucosinolate content value was 26. 84 μmol g- 1 dw for <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and 29. 11 μmol g- 1 dw for turnip tops; gluconapin being the predominant glucosinolate (23. 2 μmol g- 1 dw). Phenolic compounds were higher in <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> 51. 71 μmol g- 1 dw than in <b>turnip</b> <b>tops</b> 38. 99 μmol g- 1 dw, in which flavonols were always the major compounds. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|In Galicia (northwestern Spain), Brassica rapa subsp. rapa L. {{includes}} <b>turnips,</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>greens,</b> and <b>turnip</b> <b>tops.</b> The {{objectives of}} this study are (i) to determine the genetic diversity and morphological resemblances among the B. rapa landraces of northwestern Spain in order to have information relative to the resources preserved, and (ii) to evaluate their agronomic characteristics, considering the three potential products that can be harvested. A collection of 120 landraces was evaluated for 34 morphological and agronomical traits by an augmented design at two locations. Two landraces were the most promising for turnips production (MBG-BRS 0183 and MBG-BRS 0256), two showed the best characteristics for <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> (MBG-BRS 0082 and MBG-BRS 0184), and three were the most appropriate landraces for <b>turnip</b> <b>tops</b> production (MBG-BRS 0143, MBG-BRS 0173 and MBG-BRS 0401). Landraces were classified into five clusters (A–E) using the Ward–MLM (Modified Location Model) strategy: (A) included plants with the worst agronomic potential, (B) included most of the turnip populations with rosette growth habit, (C) included turnip populations without rosette growth habit, having more vigorous plants than cluster B, (D) gathered the most vigorous local varieties, with the highest early vigor, fresh matter content per leaf, and number of secondary stems per plant, and (E) landraces characterized by their earliness, large flowering periods, high numbers of secondary stems, and large seed weights. As conclusion, landraces evaluated in this work displayed enough variability to differentiate among appropriate populations for each one of the distinct crops. Their classification, using the Ward–MLM strategy, grouped accessions with similar characteristics into homogeneous categories.

40|$|Cooking Brassica {{vegetables}} as {{a domestic}} processing method has {{a great impact on}} health-promoting bioactive compounds: glucosinolates (GLS), flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acids, and vitamin C. In Galicia (NorthWestern Spain), one of the most consumed horticultural crops is Brassica rapa, by using the leaves (<b>turnip</b> <b>greens)</b> and the young sprouting shoots (<b>turnip</b> <b>tops)</b> in different culinary preparations. In order to determine the effect of cooking, on <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and <b>turnip</b> <b>tops,</b> bioactive GLS, flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acids and vitamin C were analysed and simultaneously determined. The level of retention of each individual compound after cooking procedures was evaluated in the edible organs, and also in the cooking water, in order to compare their composition to a fresh uncooked control. Steaming, conventional boiling, and high-pressure cooking, traditional processing methods of this kind of vegetables, were the three domestic processing methods used in this work. Results showed that total GLS and phenolics were significantly affected by the cooking procedure and the loss rate varied among individual compounds. Steaming was the method that better preserved GLS and phenolic compounds. Conventional boiling and high-pressure cooking methods presented similar rate of losses of total GLS content (64 %) and total phenolic content (more than 70 %). Degradation among glucosinolate classes, aliphatic or indolic, was similar. The total flavonoids lost in <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> were 64 % and 67 % for conventional boiling and high-pressure, respectively. The main losses were caused by leaching into the cooking water. The concentration of vitamin C suffered a drastic loss in the process of sample handling and after cooking. Despite the fact that any cooking procedure affected negatively the nutritional composition of the <b>turnip</b> <b>greens</b> and <b>tops,</b> our results showed high retentions of individual compounds in steaming, and the lowest retentions were obtained in the traditional high-pressure cooking. High retention of health-promoting compounds in the cooking water should be considered for increasing the intake of properties of B. rapa. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of the present work were to assess the genetic diversity present in the B. rapa subsp. rapa collection, to establish genetic relationships among populations and to study the genetic structure of the collection. Eighty populations were analysed based on 18 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Populations showed a broad range of genetic diversity, thus offering good potential for further genetic improvement. Most of the variability was found within the population level, probably due to high rates of allogamy, to migration and/or interchange of seed among local growers. Populations showed a low level of differentiation, grouping in just one cluster, and therefore they can be considered as samples of a highly variable metapopulation {{that can be used for}} B. rapa breeding programmes.
