50|$|The {{idea of the}} {{supplement}} {{is to provide a}} dungeon master with either non-player <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> out a campaign or already generated <b>characters</b> for gamers <b>to</b> choose amongst to play in their own right.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Emergent {{narrative}} is {{an approach to}} interactive storytelling in which stories result from local interactions of autonomous characters. We describe a technique for emergent narrative that enables the <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> in the story world during the simulation when this is useful for the developing story. ...|$|R
5000|$|The role of Jellylorum {{is played}} by a soprano {{who is able to}} hit High C. Dance ability is {{secondary}} to vocal ability in many larger productions where there are more <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> in dance numbers due to the vocal ability needed for Griddlebone's part in [...] "Growltiger's Last Stand." ...|$|R
5000|$|The wife of Jeroboam {{does not}} speak {{at all in the}} biblical narrative. Robin Gallaher Branch calls her [...] "flat, vapid, and {{overwhelmingly}} sad", while Adele Berlin says that she is [...] "intentionally not portrayed as a real individual in her own right", but that her characterization should be viewed as [...] "the effective use of an anonymous <b>character</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> an important literary function".|$|R
2500|$|Also, Darius' {{death would}} leave the show without a moral figure. This, Horvath explains, led the {{creative}} staff [...] "to create wise, advisor-type <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the void in MacLeod' life left {{by the death of}} Darius." [...] Darius was the first thousands-years-old Immortal featured in the show. In this sense, Abramowitz states, [...] "Darius was a forerunner to Methos, which is why we took Methos in a totally different direction." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{subject of}} {{compensation}} to {{the heads of}} bureaus and officials holding positions of responsibility, and requiring ability and <b>character</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> properly, is one to which your attention is invited. But few of the officials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of a family, while their duties are such as to involve millions of interest. In private life services demand compensation equal to the services rendered; a wise economy would dictate the same rule in the Government service.|$|R
5000|$|The Timess Alex Hardy {{called the}} {{documentary}} series [...] "a great recruitment ad: the hotel staff seem as content as Tom Hankss toy tester in Big." [...] Rachel Cooke {{wrote in the}} New Statesman about her surprise by the hotels decision to allow the BBC to film a documentary there and called the series [...] "a little stretched" [...] because there were not enough <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> up the three episodes. BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow praised the series [...] "for not showing peoples foibles in a cruel way." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel, simple, {{unsupervised}} method for characterizing the semantic relations that hold between nouns in noun-noun compounds. The main {{idea is to}} discover predicates that make explicit the hidden relations between the nouns. This is accomplished by writing Web search engine queries that restate the noun compound as a relative clause containing a wildcard <b>character</b> <b>to</b> be <b>filled</b> in with a verb. A comparison to results from the literature suggest this is a promising approach...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> player <b>characters,</b> non-player characters (NPCs) {{are controlled}} by the gamemaster or game engine, or by people assisting the gamemaster. Non-player <b>characters</b> <b>fill</b> out {{the population of the}} fictional setting and can act as antagonists, bystanders or allies of the player characters.|$|R
500|$|Talking about {{bringing}} {{the character of}} Franklin Hall from the comics to the series, executive producer Jeffrey Bell said that the writers had looked through the comics for a <b>character</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the episode's role, and felt that Hall had an interesting history. Subsequently, changes were made to fit the comics character into the existing role for the series, and he ultimately appears in an origin story-type role rather than as the fully formed supervillain from the comics. As a hint at his potential to become the villain [...] "Graviton" [...] in the future, the series changed his original scientific interests from matter transportation {{to the study of}} [...] "gravitonium", a substance created for the episode. The episode's ending, which sees Hall fall into some gravitonium, indicates that this is how he gains his Graviton abilities in the series.|$|R

50|$|In an {{interview}} with Gamasutra, Takumi noted that when designing his games, he writes the stories before writing the characters. After the basic story is created, he creates <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> roles in the story. He adds that once he begins to write the scenarios for the game, the <b>characters</b> begin <b>to</b> take shape. When writing characters, he describes himself as writing a bit of himself into them, using this to accomplish his goal of making characters who fit the situation they are in but also feeling realistic. When designing the main <b>character,</b> Takumi desires <b>to</b> make said <b>character</b> identifiable <b>to</b> players, commenting that they can often act as the player, while the sidekick can drive the main character and by proxy the players to do something else. In particular, he likes to include sidekicks in his games to give the main <b>character</b> someone <b>to</b> talk to, explaining that in Japan, humour is often derived from dialogue. Specifically, such dialogue between the two characters is often jokes {{going back and forth}} to each other. He also attributes his interest in sidekicks to his love of mystery novels, specifically citing the character Dr. Watson, who acts as a sidekick <b>to</b> the <b>character</b> Sherlock Holmes in the series of mystery novels of the same name.|$|R
5000|$|The game's battle {{elements}} {{borrow from}} Shadow Hearts and the Star Ocean series. Up <b>to</b> three <b>characters</b> may {{move around the}} battlefield in real time. The player can only control one character {{at a time and}} can only attack after the <b>character</b> <b>fills</b> its [...] "leadership meter" [...] by remaining still. Once <b>filled,</b> the <b>character</b> can initiate an attack by performing a series of three timed button presses (known as the [...] "trinity ring"). If the attack is unsuccessful, the leadership meter empties, and the player must wait for it to refill again.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The iconicity of a Chinese character, or {{the degree}} to which it looks like the concept that it represents, has been {{suggested}} as affecting the learning and processing of the char-acter. However, previous studies have not provided good em-pirical information on the iconicity of specific <b>characters.</b> <b>To</b> <b>fill</b> this gap, 40 U. S. adults with no knowledge of Chinese were given an English word or short phrase together with two Chinese characters and were asked which character matched the meaning of the English word. The right and wrong answers had the same number of strokes, and different wrong answers were used for different participants. We examined all 213 simple-structure Chinese characters that occur in textbooks for elementary school children. The overall percentage of cor-rect responses was 53. 6 %, slightly but significantly higher than would be expected by chance. Using a false discovery rate procedure, we found that 15 of the 213 characters were guessed at a level higher than chance. The proportion of correct responses <b>to</b> each <b>character,</b> which can be taken as an indicator of its degree of iconicity, should be useful to researchers study-ing Chinese character reading and writing. The full database, showing the proportion of correct guesses and other psycholin-guistic variables for each character, can be downloaded fro...|$|R
50|$|Since the 7th installment, {{usually the}} opening {{sequences}} gives some clues of the storyline {{of the success}} mode, especially for the 9th and 10th installments while professional players are only given a very brief cameos, Success Mode <b>characters</b> <b>filled</b> the major parts in the openings.|$|R
5000|$|... "Artist and {{designer}} Simon Basher has fun {{playing in the}} world of contemporary character design. Inspired by a love of simple line work and a rich color palette, his <b>characters</b> <b>fill</b> the gap between edgy manga and the cuteness of Hello Kitty. He lives in England." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{membership}} of the liberation squad differs between the two versions of Mega Man Battle Network 5. Recruiting each member involves largely similar challenges and each <b>character</b> <b>fills</b> a certain role on the team, but the motivations and in-game abilities of each character are sometimes quite different.|$|R
5000|$|Variety {{described}} it as [...] "a self-important, egomaniacal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film" [...] and added, [...] "Roy Scheider gives a superb performance as Gideon, creating a <b>character</b> <b>filled</b> with nervous energy... The film's major flaw lies in its lack of real explanation of what, beyond ego, really motivates him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wired Magazine, in 2009, celebrated [...] "the 25th {{anniversary of}} {{the release of a}} film near and dear to many geeks who {{came of age in the}} '80s. The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension was a great, adventurous, geeky movie, with enough silly science fiction and great <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> any three lousy summer blockbusters these days... And it gave us so many great, geeky lines to quote." [...] Cosford of The Miami Herald said in his review, [...] "I suspect that Buckaroo's odd musings, {{particularly}} the one about being there no matter where you go, are about to enter the popular argot on the scale of [...] "Where's the beef?"‚Äîand his prediction has been proved right. (There is a page at CafePress for Buckaroo Banzai Quotes Gifts, for example.) Entertainment Weekly ranked Buckaroo Banzai as #43 in their Top 50 Cult Movies. The film was also ranked #21 on the magazine's [...] "The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83" [...] list. The Guardian has also cited Buckaroo Banzai as one of their [...] "1,000 films to see before you die".|$|R
50|$|Play {{involves}} two parts: face-to-face scenarios and {{the rest}} of the week's activities. The scenarios give scores for such areas as crime prevention, location, getting leads, convictions and avoiding unnecessary damage to people and buildings. In the other part of play, each <b>character</b> <b>fills</b> out a weekly planning sheet indicating when he is patrolling, resting, training or researching.|$|R
5000|$|As {{described}} above, printers commonly required <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> {{when the}} carriage {{was returned to}} the left margin. With other equipment, <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> were occasionally required in other circumstances. For example the VT05 video terminal sometimes required <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> when a [...] "scroll up" [...] operation was performed; the process of shuffling data in the shift register memory of the VT05 was slow.|$|R
5000|$|Sniffles quickly {{faded into}} obscurity in the {{animation}} arena. However, {{he would find}} {{new life in the}} Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies Comics begun in 1940 by Dell Comics (writer Chase Craig used several minor Warner Bros. <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> pages). These comics teamed Sniffles with a little girl named Mary Jane who could shrink herself to mouse size, originally by sprinkling magic sand or simply by wishing it and then, throughout most of the series, by reciting [...] "First I close my eyes real tight/Then I wish with all my might/Magic words of poof poof piffles/Make me just as small as Sniffles.". By now Sniffles had lost most of his animated film personality and was just a companion to Mary Jane as she explored something found in a garden or entered a sort of magical toyland. Mary Jane soon surpassed the mouse in popularity, and she got top billing in later issues. Artist Roger Armstrong drew the series until Al Hubbard took over in the 1950s. These adventures proved a favorite with readers, and the series continued until 1961. This series was recently resurrected for a story in issue #140 of the current Looney Tunes comic book published by DC Comics.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 Tomos {{wrote a book}} Wele'n Gwawrio. Its {{title is}} again {{the title of a}} song, this time a Christmas carol, and it can be {{translated}} as ‚ÄòBehold it dawns‚Äô. The book presents the dawn of the third millennium. The main <b>character</b> <b>filled</b> with political disappointment and looking for comfort falls back on religious contemplation. The book won the Prose Medal during the Eistedfodd in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|The {{area has}} a {{consistent}} subdivision pattern, building form and streetscape, largely because its development occurred over {{a relatively short}} period of time. A high standard of design and residential amenity was also achieved, and housing in this area has become increasingly sought after. Ashbury consists of <b>character</b> <b>filled</b> Federation and Californian bungalows which are under heritage conservation making the suburb highly sought after.|$|R

50|$|Apophasis {{can serve}} to politely avoid {{suggestion}} of ignorance {{on the part of}} an audience, as found in the narrative style of Adso of Melk in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, where the <b>character</b> <b>fills</b> in details of early fourteenth-century history for the reader by stating it is unnecessary to speak of them. Conversely, the same introduction can be made sarcastically to condescend to an audience and imply their ignorance.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of cards: Characters, Monsters, and Attacks. Each player starts the game with three Characters. A player plays monsters on their own <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> change their {{abilities}} and defenses and play attacks {{on top of their}} opponent's <b>characters</b> in order <b>to</b> damage them. When the three yellow [...] "health bars" [...] on a <b>character</b> are <b>filled</b> in red, that character is knocked out. One must [...] "KO" [...] all three opposing <b>characters</b> <b>to</b> win the game. The game's power source, [...] "Kairu", is how the cards are played in the full game.|$|R
50|$|Topham {{soon became}} {{known in the}} fashionable world of London for his {{original}} style of dress and the ease and elegance of his manners. His personal and sartorial peculiarities were copied by his friend Frederic Reynolds <b>to</b> enliven the <b>characters</b> in his comedies. Meanwhile, Tophams talent as a writer of prologues and epilogues {{introduced him to the}} leading actors of the day, and led to his first appearance as a playwright. An epilogue, spoken by Charles Lee Lewes in imitation of a Moli√®re <b>character,</b> <b>filled</b> Drury Lane for several nights. Another, on a recent tragedy, spoken by Miss Farren, was equally popular. He wrote an epilogue for the benefit of Mary Wells, and their friendship soon became intimacy. They lived together for several years, and four children resulted from the union.|$|R
25|$|Leno Prestini {{had shown}} artistic talent {{from an early}} age. By 1931 he was the company's chief modeler, {{creating}} distinctive architectural ornaments (which can still be seen on many buildings around the Pacific Northwest) and designing decorative tiles, which were marketed under the 'WACO' trade name. He had also developed a reputation as an eccentric and adventurous <b>character,</b> <b>filling</b> his free time with, among many other things, mountain climbing and exploring the bottoms of local lakes in a homemade diving suit.|$|R
60|$|He was {{a splendid}} {{specimen}} of manhood, standing a good two inches over six feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of the trained fighting man. His features were regular and clear cut, his hair black and closely cropped, while {{his eyes were}} of a steel gray, reflecting a strong and loyal <b>character,</b> <b>filled</b> with fire and initiative. His manners were perfect, and his courtliness {{was that of a}} typical southern gentleman of the highest type.|$|R
40|$|The {{novel as}} a {{literary}} form has from the beginning tended toward a preoccupation with the daily concerns {{of the middle class}} and with the crises of average men and women. So {{it is no surprise that}} contemporary novelists dramatize the confrontation with evil in a more realistic and mundane manner than, say, Greek tragedy or the epic poem would. The evils in the 20 th century, as experienced by unexceptional and often antiheroic <b>characters,</b> <b>fill</b> the pages of important contemporary American novels...|$|R

50|$|The VT05's {{dynamic storage}} was a PMOS shift register; the delays {{associated}} with manipulating {{the data in}} the shift register resulted in the VT05 requiring <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> after each line feed (as compared to contemporaneous hard copy terminals which required <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> after each carriage return).|$|R
50|$|The Latin chronicles {{of the end}} of Visigothic Hispania omit many details, such as {{identification}} of <b>characters,</b> <b>filling</b> in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.
