6000|$|... "You laugh, Michie," [...] {{he said to}} Nick, {{a little}} resentfully. [...] "I who speak to you {{say that there is}} four foot on each side of ze bateau. Too much <b>tafia,</b> a little too much excite--" [...] and he made a gesture with his hand {{expressive}} of total destruction; [...] "ze tornado, I would sooner have him--" ...|$|E
50|$|La Rochelle, Nantes, Bayonne, and Bordeaux {{were the}} major French ports to export eaux-de-vie to Canada, {{distilled}} from the wines of the corresponding regions, but also notably from Armagnac (through Bordeaux). Eaux-de-vie made using sugarcane, a plant incapable of withstanding boreal winters, was produced on and exported from {{the islands of}} Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Saint-Domingue. True inter-colonial exchange was taking place: on ships returning to the Antilles, Canadians sold flour, cod, vegetables, and lumber. As they were banned from importation into France from 1713 to 1777, these rums, <b>tafias,</b> and guildives found Canada as their primary destination market.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are all among frien's," [...] said he. [...] "Why I {{call you}} Gumbo de St. Gre? When I come first settle in Louisiane you was wild man--yes. Drink <b>tafia,</b> fight duel, spend family money. Aristocrat then. No, I not hold my tongue. You go France and Monsieur le Marquis de St. Gre he {{get you in}} gardes du corps of the King. Yes, I tell him. You tell the Citizen General how come you Jacobin now, and we see if he mek you Captain." ...|$|E
6000|$|Prince Paul at once {{gathered}} together a goodly crowd of fathers and mothers, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters, cousins and connections. A large and loud-voiced dame, [...] "Gozeli," [...] swore {{that she was}} his [...] "proper Ngwe," [...] being one of his numerous step mas, {{and she would not}} move without a head, or three leaves, of tobacco. Hotaloya was his brother; Mesdames Azízeh and Asúnye declared themselves his sisters, and so all. My little stock of goods began visibly to shrink, when I informed the greedy applicants that nothing beyond a leaf of tobacco and a demi verre of <b>tafia</b> would be given until I had seen my way to work. Presently appeared the chief huntsman appointed by Roi Denis to take charge of me, he was named Fortuna, a Spanish name corrupted to Forteune. A dash was then prepared for his majesty and for Prince Paul. I regret to say that this young nobleman ended his leave-taking by introducing a pretty woman, with very neat hands and ankles and a most mutine physiognomy, as his sister, informing me that she was also my wife pro temp. She did not seem likely to coiffer Sainte Cathérine, and here she is.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur Vigo's {{store was}} the village club. It had neither {{glass in the}} window nor an {{attractive}} display of goods; it was merely a log cabin set down on a weedy, sun-baked plot. The stuffy smell of skins and furs {{came out of the}} doorway. Within, when he was in Kaskaskia, Monsieur Vigo was wont to sit behind his rough walnut table, writing with a fine quill, or dispensing the news of the villages to the priest and other prominent citizens, or haggling with persistent blanketed braves over canoe-loads of ill-smelling pelts which they brought down from the green forests of the north. Monsieur Vigo's clothes were the color of the tobacco he gave in exchange; his eyes were not unlike the black beads he traded, but shrewd and kindly withal, set in a square saffron face that had the contradiction of a small chin. As the days wore into months, Monsieur Vigo's place very naturally became the headquarters for our army, if army it might be called. Of a morning a dozen would be sitting against the logs in the black shadow, {{and in the midst of}} them always squatted an unsavory Indian squaw. A few braves usually stood like statues at the corner, and in front of the door another group of hunting shirts. Without was the paper money of the Continental Congress, within the good <b>tafia</b> and tobacco of Monsieur Vigo. One day Monsieur Vigo's young Creole clerk stood shrugging his shoulders in the doorway. I stopped.|$|E
60|$|But {{where was}} the channel? We watched Xavier with bated breath. Not once did he take {{his eyes from the}} {{swirling}} water ahead, but gave the tiller a touch from time to time, now right, now left, and called in a monotone for the port or starboard oars. Nearer and nearer we sped, dodging the snags, until the water boiled around us, and suddenly the boat shot forward as in a mill-race, and we clutched the cabin's roof. A triumphant gleam was in Xavier's eyes, for he had hit the channel squarely. And then, like a monster out of the deep, the scaly, black back of a great northern pine was flung up beside us and sheered us across the channel until we were at {{the very edge of the}} foam-specked, spinning water. But Xavier saw it, and quick as lightning brought his helm over and laughed as he heard it crunching along our keel. And so we came swiftly around the bend and into safety once more. The next day there was the Petite Gulf, which bothered Xavier very little, and the day after that we came in sight of Natchez on her heights and guided our boat in amongst the others that lined the shore, scowled at by lounging Indians there, and eyed suspiciously by a hatchet-faced Spaniard in a tawdry uniform who represented his Majesty's customs. Here we stopped for a day and a night that Xavier and his crew might get properly drunk on <b>tafia,</b> while Nick and I walked about the town and waited until his Excellency, the commandant, had finished dinner that we might present our letters and obtain his passport. Natchez at that date was a sufficiently unkempt and evil place of dirty, ramshackle houses and gambling dens, where men of the four nations gamed and quarrelled and fought. We were glad enough to get away the following morning, Xavier somewhat saddened by the loss of thirty livres of which he had no memory, and Nick and myself relieved at having the passports in our pockets. I have mine yet among my papers.|$|E
50|$|Often both <b>tafia</b> and rum were {{produced}}. <b>Tafia</b> {{was mostly}} for local consumption, {{as it is}} easier and cheaper to make. Production of rum took more time, effort and resources, but produced a more concentrated and stable product that could be shipped to distant markets for profit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tafia</b> {{is a kind}} {{of cheap}} rum made from {{sugarcane}} juice. It is typically unaged whereas rum is typically aged in wooden barrels to reduce the level of fusel. Most of the fusel is absorbed in the first two years. Premium rums were aged {{for a longer period of}} time incidentally subjecting it to increasing ethanol evaporation.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the seventeenth century, the producers of sugar from various European colonies in the Americas started to use the by-products of sugar, molasses and scummings, as the raw material for the alcoholic beverage which in British colonies was named rum, in France's <b>tafia,</b> in Spain's aguardiente de caña and in Portugal's (Brazil) aguardente da terra, aguardente de cana and later cachaça.|$|E

Creative activities, dance, tales and concerts give the meeting its tempo. All around the <b>Tafia</b> de l'Ours refreshment area, the light celebration is brightened up with candles put under the windows as well as a release of sky lanterns in the air.|$|E
50|$|Baakun {{settlement}} {{was founded by}} Prince Oluopo in the early 11th Century. Tradition states that he migrated from Offa-Ile to establish his own settlement at a place very close to Ipetumodu. As a great hunter, Oluopo made marks in several places where he had hunted. He was fond of building huts and establishing his idols such as Ogun and Orisa Ogiyan in those places. The places he established included Pakoto, <b>Tafia,</b> Oke Oko. He had boundaries {{with the people of}} Akanle and Lasole. In their eastern side was the river known as Eri Oogi. The confluence of Eri Oogi with Isasa Elekiri and Oluponna were also in Oluopo’s territory.|$|E
50|$|As {{time went}} on, {{there was a}} {{revolution}} in Yoruba Land that affected many people adversely. During the war, Oluopo sons went to war and fought in many battles that cut across Yoruba land. After the war, Agbangudu settled in Ede, Larele settled in Apomu, Akintayo settled in Ibadan while other children lived with their father, Oluopo.After the civil war, Oluopo returned to his farmland at <b>Tafia.</b> While going from Baakun in Ipetumodu, he took some friends along and gave them lands for farm. Those he took along included Prince Olakanmi Okoro Giesi, who later became Oba Apetumodu who reigned between 1848-1866. Others were Adegbanro, Akingbile, Aroje the father of Mojalawo.|$|E
50|$|Expatriated Welshmen {{continue}} {{to contribute to}} Chicago’s culture. Chicago {{is also home to}} three vibrant Welsh societies: The Chicago <b>Tafia</b> Welsh Society, The Welsh Women’s Club of Illinois and The Cambrian Benevolent Society of Chicago, catering to every facet of Welsh culture past and present. Welsh musicians often visit Chicago to perform; most recently: The Manic Street Preachers, The Joy Formidable, Marina and the Diamonds, Duffy, The Stereophonics, Jem, Cerys Matthews, Jon Langford, Bryn Terfel, Tom Jones, People in Planes, Future of the Left, Katherine Jenkins, Super Furry Animals, Funeral for a Friend, Goldie Lookin Chain, Here Be Dragons, David Llewellyn, Julian Jones & The Brit Bus Tour, numerous Welsh male voice choirs and authors Niall Griffiths, Fflur Dafydd, Aeronwy Thomas & Janet Quin-Harkin aka Rhys Bowen.|$|E
50|$|When Modakeke was {{depopulated}} in 1909 to 1910, {{majority of}} them came to settle on Oluopo land at <b>Tafia.</b> Baakun people vehemently protested against this to the then District Officer. Two notable people in Baakun that led the protest to the D.O were Abodunrin and Akinwale (who later became the Ekefa Apetumodu between 1936 and 1963). Even after proving the ownership of the land beyond reasonable doubt to the District Officer, which included showing the DO their idols of worship that were situated on the land, Baakun people still lost the protest because the District Officer wanted to secure land at all cost for the depopulated Modakeke people. However, before the District Officer took this decision, he told the Baakun people to make the farm land their permanent abode and be under Ibadan or be ready to forfeit it. Baakun people whoever sought the advice of their Royal father, Oba Olubuse I, who advised them {{not to do so}} because he would not want his people to be absorbed to Ibadan District. He promised to give them another place for their farming and to settle. That was how Modakeke refugees were brought to the place, Baakun farmland, which is today known as Ode -Omu.|$|E
40|$|Thrombin-activable {{fibrinolysis}} inhibitor (TAFI) {{is present}} in the circulation as an inactive zymogen. Thrombin converts TAFI to a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme (<b>TAFIa)</b> by cleaving at Arg(92) in a process accelerated by the cofactor, thrombomodulin. <b>TAFIa</b> attenuates fibrinolysis. <b>TAFIa</b> can be inactivated by both proteolysis by thrombin and spontaneous temperature-dependent loss of activity. The identity of the thrombin cleavage site responsible for loss of <b>TAFIa</b> activity was suggested to be Arg(330), but site-directed mutagenesis of this residue did not prevent inactivation of <b>TAFIa</b> by thrombin, In this study we followed TAFI activation and <b>TAFIa</b> inactivation by thrombin/thrombomodulin in time and characterized the cleavage pattern of TAFI using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, Mass matching of the fragments revealed that <b>TAFIa</b> was cleaved at Ar- 302. Studies of a mutant R 302 Q-TAFI confirmed identification of this thrombin cleavage site and, furthermore, suggested that inactivation of <b>TAFIa</b> is based on its conformational instability rather than proteolytic cleavage at Arg(302) ...|$|E
