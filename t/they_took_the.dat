5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, the 1995 season started on April 25, and was shortened to 144 games instead of the normal 162.

5|$|Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He {{was unable to}} make an impact, as Bedser removed him for one, and Pollard then trapped Bradman for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett was beaten in flight by Young and was caught by Washbrook.

Each North Korean division, normally operating with 11,000 men, was at 60 to 80 percent strength, giving them nearly a two to one numerical superiority over the American forces. The morale of the two divisions was low, owing to repeated air attacks on equipment and overall exhaustion from continuous combat.

The Agency threatened to cease its funding used to cover operational costs, which would have meant significant cuts in service; however, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> funding under their strict control to prevent this from happening.|$|E

In retaliation, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> Oracle's eyes, the objects Kratos seeks. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to restore the statue and retrieve the eyes.

One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight.

5|$|After the Protestants {{were caught}} in crossfire by townspeople {{engaging}} in the battle, many decided to flee through the Battant. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> portcullis down, but could not find boats to cross the Doubs, so some soldiers chose to swim; many of them drowned, including goldsmith Guillaume Laboral from Montbéliard. Those who did not escape the battle were executed at the gallows. The executions occurred on the same day, or later in the week. In total, twenty Protestants were killed in combat, and two drowned in the Doubs. The Father of Faverney, Antoine d'Achey, and the army in Vesoul were dispatched to rescue the city, not knowing that the battle had already ended. Nonetheless, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga thanked Achey for his attempts.|$|E
5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to any degree, except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> place of privately issued tokens.

Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece also failed to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E

5|$|As Liverpool were {{competing}} in the Premier League, they entered the competition {{in the third round}} and were drawn against fellow Premier League side Southampton. Despite resting a number of first-team players, Liverpool won 3–1 courtesy of goals from Patrik Berger, El-Hadji Diouf and Milan Baroš at their home ground Anfield. Their opposition in the fourth round were Ipswich Town. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> lead in the 14th minute, in the match held at Anfield, when Tommy Miller scored. Diouf equalised in the 54th minute, but the score remained the same through full-time and extra-time to take the match to a penalty shootout. Liverpool won 5–4 to progress to the fifth round.|$|E
5|$|Benfica faced Marítimo in an away {{game at the}} {{beginning}} of November. They lost 0–3, to a hat-trick from Lagorio. Without a single road game victory, the team dropped to tenth in the league's standings. They hosted Farense in the second week of November and won 2–1. Van Hooijdonk and João Tomás scored a goal each, within a 4-minute interval just before the final whistle, to give their team the three points. On 18 November, Benfica played Vitória de Guimarães on the road. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> lead {{near the end of the}} first half, with a goal from Chano. The second half saw three additional goals, all by João Tomás. It was their first win as visitors, and they climbed to sixth place in the standings.

5|$|Darlington {{reached the}} quarter-finals of the 1968 League Cup; drawn away to Brian Clough's Derby County, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> lead, only to lose 5–4.

Three years later they won promotion by finishing third in the league under manager Cyril Knowles. Darlington spent two seasons in the Third Division; the 13th-place finish in 1986 was the highest position they achieved in the Football League since {{the introduction of the}} four-division structure in 1958, but they were relegated the following season.|$|E
