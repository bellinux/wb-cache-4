This {{is a larger}} bird with a green head, blue crown and black face, and a very large pink bill. The Fiji parrotfinch resembles the closely related royal and red-headed parrotfinches, and <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> blue-headed variant is very like the blue-faced parrotfinch, but these three species do not occur in Fiji.|$|E

50|$|Pinus torreyana {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> pine {{species in}} the world in the early 20th century, with only around 100 trees surviving.

5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements {{it was not until the}} late 1800s that the element was isolated.

5|$|Among scientists, he {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on the {{ligament}} which bears his name.

5|$|As {{frigatebirds}} rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations. As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they {{are vulnerable to}} local disasters that could wipe out <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> species or significantly impact the widespread ones.|$|E

5|$|Chaparral {{is a type}} of shrubland, {{receiving}} {{very little}} precipitation. Sclerophyllous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area, both relying on fire to reproduce. <b>The</b> <b>rare</b> Gentner's fritillary also grows in this region.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of peer-to-peer file replication comes from its piece and peer selection strategies.

Whereas it is commonly admitted that BitTorrent performs well, recent studies have proposed the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> first and choke algorithms {{in order to improve}} efficiency and fairness. In this paper, we advocate that the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> first and choke algorithms cannot be justified in the context of peer-to-peer file replication in the Internet based on real experiments.

5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} {{is very difficult}} to separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal {{is very difficult to}} prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E
