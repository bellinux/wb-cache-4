50|$|A {{lack of any}} {{dislocation}} {{found on}} the images along <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> River fault made evident the lack of movement along that fault, and though the aftershocks were occurring {{at a depth of}} 8 - 15 km, the deformation was distinct at the surface. The observed ground deformation that was detailed by the differential satellite images and Global Positioning System measurements was roughly 10 km east of (and parallel to) <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> River Fault, along a zone that passed through the USGS' epicenter, and delineated a NE trending vertical fault (a dip of 89°). The displacements were not more than 10 cm and indicated left-lateral strike-slip motion as well as a component of reverse slip, and to the west of <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> River Fault (and closer to the areas of damage) strong ground motion triggered subsidence of volcanic deposits from Mount Merapi.|$|R
30|$|The damage {{distribution}} was well {{correlated with the}} epicentre and presumed fault region. All regions nearby <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> fault suffered a high death toll and massive damage including the study area. Walter et al. (2007) and Daryono (2011) concluded that damage pattern was highly controlled by the amplification factors. The earthquake amplification phenomena occurred in Young Merapi Volcanic Deposits which is located along <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> River. This area was a densely populated area. Several sub districts that were within the amplification zone and had severe damage were Imogiri, Bambanglipuro, Jetis, Pleret, Banguntapan, Prambanan, Gantiwarno, Wedi and Bayat Sub Districts.|$|R
50|$|According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), {{the shock}} {{occurred}} 20 km south-southeast of Yogyakarta {{at a depth}} of 10 km, but other institutions provided source parameters (location and depth) that were not in agreement. No information was present on the extent of the faulting or the direction of propagation and there was no link to the eruption of Mount Merapi. The USGS suggested that the focal mechanism was most likely associated with left-lateral slip on a NE trending strike-slip fault, as that is the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> Fault, but this has not been validated. No surface breaks were documented, but the location of the greatest damage that was caused does align with <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> Fault as a possible source.|$|R

The trace of the causative fault bends at its southern termination toward <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> River fault {{as if it were a}} splay.

Due to the ambiguous nature of the available information on the source of the Yogyakarta earthquake, a separate group of Japanese and Indonesian scientists applied one of the first uses of interferometric synthetic aperture radar to determine the source fault. Several data sets (one captured in April 2006 and another post-earthquake batch from June) were collected from an instrument on board the Advanced Land Observation Satellite and were compared to each other to show potential ground deformation patterns.|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} {{geological}} faults {{formed in the}} research area, {{as a result of}} the plate movements along the subduction zone in the south part of the Java islands.

Another normal fault which has the same orientation with Opak Fault lies in the middle of the research area. This normal fault is known as Bawuran Fault. Both of them have the same movement, i.e., the west part of the fault line is moving downward while the east part of the fault line is moving upward. There are also two major strikes-slip faults that located in the research area, namely Bawuran-Cinomati (centre part) and Becucu-Tekek Fault (north part) (see Fig.  2).

30|$|The rapid field {{identification}} {{was conducted}} to determine the border between Qmi and Qa. Two approaches {{were used to determine}} both geological units. The first approach was to locate the boulder location. Qmi is dominated by fluvial process and produces very well sorted sediment. The upper layer consists of very fine sediment, while the lower layer consists of rough sediment. The boulder indicate that the particular area is influenced by the colluvium sediment which is characterized as bad sorted or mixture sediment from the hilly area nearby. The second approach is the clay content of both Qmi and Qa. Qmi tends to have less clay content being the Merapi Volcano sediment, while the Qa tends to have more clay content as it is the denudation material of the weathering process in the hilly surrounding areas. Therefore, one of the objectives of the rapid field investigation was to locate the traditional brick factory along <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> River. <b>The</b> brick makers tend to use the best soil which has less clay rather than soil which has more clay. The reason is that the brick will crack during the heating process if {{there are a lot of}} clay contents inside the soil. Therefore, the location of traditional brick makers can be used to indicate the Qmi area.|$|R

It shaked {{the region of}} Bantul, Yogyakarta, Sleman and Klaten for about 60 seconds. A week after the earthquake, i. e. 4 - 8 June 2006, a GPS survey was conducted on 48 GPS points belonging to the 2 nd order national cadastral control network located in the earthquake affected region. The 2 nd survey was conducted on 21 - 26 January 2008. The surveys were conducted using 14 dual-frequency geodetic type receivers and the Bernese 5. 0 scientific software was used for data processing. The results of GPS surveys show that horizontal components of the co-seismic deformation of earthquake are generally about 10 - 15 cm or smaller. The GPS-derived displacement vectors and depths of aftershocks suggested the existence of left-lateral fault, with strike and dip angles of about 48 o and 89 o, located at about 5 - 10 km east of Opak Fault which is usually drawn along <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> River. GPS surveys also estimate that horizontal components of the post-seismic deformation of Yogyakarta earthquake are about 0. 3 to 9. 1 cm between June 2006 and June 2008.

In 2012, the 274 stations of single microtremor recording were conducted to the main path of NS and EW of the research area. Microtremors were recorded with 3 -components by using a model of Mitutoyo-GPL- 6 A 3 P and processed by the horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratio technique which was used by BIDO software. The {{results show that the}} seismic behaviors in Yogyakarta City vary significantly: both of Ts and Td spans 0. 10 - 1. 00 sec and 0. 15 - 4. 00 sec, and the thickness of sedimentary layers ranges from a few meters to over 200 meters. Moreover, to predict the strong ground motion it was used the Empirical Green's Function technique (EGF) formulated by Irikura 1, 2, based on scaling law of fault parameters for large and small events and the ω 2 source spectra.

We tracked and identified the 2010 Merapi's PDC deposits in the most impacted catchment (South) using high-resolution optical (from GeoEye and SPOT- 5 satellites as well as low altitude photograph) imagery. We show that high-resolution imagery enables mapping with unprecedented detail {{the effects of the}} 2010 eruption in the summit area and across the most devastated catchment on Merapi. We investigated the relationships between the morphology of the river channel, and the apparent behavior of the PDCs and lahars, as deduced from over-banking processes. The 2010 pyroclastic deposits cover an area of ∼ 27 km 2 in the Gendol-Opak catchment, i. e. 35 % of the total deposit area. We analyze how unconfined PDCs with over-bank and veneer facies, as well as two types of surges have mantled widespread areas {{on both sides of the}} Gendol valley which contain the confined PDC deposits. Geometric and geomorphic characteristics that allow over bank and veneer deposits beyond the main valley are: limited cross-sectional areas under 1500 m 2 and the decreasing longitudinal rate of channel confinement. Subsequent lahars six months after the eruption have devastated several villages along the Gendol River 20 km from the summit on the ring plain. Small areas down-valley was affected by over-bank lahars once pyroclastic deposits were remobilized 3. 8 km farther than the PDC front. The over-bank and avulsed lahars can be attributed to the limited capacity (200 - 250 m 2) of river channels and meandering river (sinuosity index of 1. 25) across the lowest-angle (< 2 °) ring plain.

Almost all Old Javanese texts were written in East Java, mainly in districts situated in the basin of the river Brantas. The few exceptions are some very old texts probably written in the tenth century in Central Java in the district of Mataram, in the basin of <b>the</b> rivers <b>Opak</b> and Praga.|$|R
50|$|The monumental Hindu {{temple of}} Prambanan in the {{vicinity}} of Yogyakarta — initially built during the reign of King Pikatan (838—850), and expanded continuously through the reign of Lokapala (850—890) to Balitung (899-911) — is a fine example of ancient Medang Mataram art and architecture. The description of a grand temple compound dedicated for lord Shiva, and the public project to shift the course of the river near <b>the</b> temple (<b>Opak</b> river) to run straight along western wall of temple compound was also mentioned in Shivagrha inscription. The grand temple complex was dedicated to the Trimurti, the three highest gods in the Hindu pantheon (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu). It was the largest Hindu temple ever built in Indonesia, evidence of the immense wealth and cultural achievement of the kingdom.|$|R
30|$|Both the Nglanggran Formation (Tmn) and the Semilir Formation (Tmse) are the Tertiary {{volcanic}} deposits {{that were}} formed between late Oligocene and early Miocene, respectively (Mulyaningsih et al., 2011). Tmse consists of volcanic clastic materials with the pumice {{as the main}} material. This fragmental material has various grain size fragments starting from a very fine tuff until breccia pumice that has very coarse grains fragments (Yusliandi et al. 2013). The abundance of pumice fragments in Tmse indicates that Tmse is typically co-ignimbrite deposit. In term of volcanology sediment, the co-ignimbrite deposit can be classified as a volcanic material which was formed by close explosive eruption (Mulyaningsih et al., 2011); (Yusliandi et al. 2013); (Winarti 2015); (Bronto et al., 2009). On the contrary, Nglanggran Formation (Tmn) was formed {{as a result of}} an effusive eruption and deposited on the top of the Semilir Formation. Tmn consists of solid material of breccia, lava andesite, and basalt. This formation is wide-spread along the Baturagung Escarpment in the west part of Parangtritis and east part of Gunung Panggung. Similar to Semilir Formation, Nglanggran is lacking fossils. However, based on the foraminifera content that was found in the insertion of sandstone and claystone in the bottom-most layer, Nglanggran Formation is the middle Miocene deposits. These Miocene formations were buried by younger sedimentary rock including the Young Volcanic Deposits of Merapi Volcano (Qmi) and the Alluvium (Qa). The young volcanic deposits of Merapi Volcano consist of the Young Merapi Volcano sediment that was transported by several big rivers such as <b>Opak</b> River while <b>the</b> alluvium was formed through the denudation processes on the steep areas. The Qa and Qmi are characterized as dense soil located in the extensive flat land along <b>the</b> <b>Opak</b> River. In <b>the</b> eastern part of the research area, uplift and erosion have stripped away much of the cover rock, exposing the underlying rock, Nglanggran and Semilir Formation.|$|R
