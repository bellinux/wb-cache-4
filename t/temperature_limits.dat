40|$|Abstract—Interference {{temperature}} {{is a measure}} of how well a radio operating with a particular protocol and modulation scheme can tolerate interference in its spectrum space. We consider this tolerance metric for the IEEE 802. 11 protocol for wireless networking. In experiments with off-the-shelf devices in the laboratory, we characterize the tolerance of the protocol to interference at various frequencies and power levels. Using the results of the experiment, we compute the interference <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> that the system will tolerate. We find that the interference <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> of the devices is much lower than the upper bound predicted by theory. The interference <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> of the protocols is not proportional to the data capacity, hence factors in the physical implementation {{play an important role in}} the robustness of the channel.
