5|$|A melancholic Darryl finally assembles {{a conference}} room meeting with several {{potential}} new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process. Andy {{does not know what}} he is doing and all of the applicants walk out. Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E
5|$|After {{twenty minutes}} {{fighting}} both Victory and Temeraire, the Redoutable {{had been reduced}} to a floating wreck. Temeraire had also suffered heavily, damaged when Redoutables main mast fell onto her poop deck, and having had her own topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would {{be in charge of}} the ponies, but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy them—with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season saw Juventus start strongly, {{winning the}} 2003 Supercoppa Italiana over Milan on penalties, although Juventus were knocked {{out in the}} round of 16 in the UEFA Champions League, and finished the Serie A season in a disappointing third place. The club did manage to reach {{the final of the}} Coppa Italia, however, only to be defeated by Lazio. Lippi left Juventus {{at the end of the}} season to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian national team.|$|E
5|$|The {{next major}} {{incident}} was on 22 July, when the British administrative and military headquarters {{located in the}} King David Hotel were bombed. No members of the division were directly involved, but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called in to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> search for survivors and secure {{the part of the}} building left standing.

5|$|A three-strong EC {{delegation}} {{made three}} {{visits to the}} region in late June and early July to negotiate a political agreement which would facilitate further negotiations. The delegation consisted of the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, as the incumbent holder of the EC presidency, and Italy and the Netherlands, as the previous and future holders of that office. The delegation members were Jacques Poos (Luxembourg), Gianni de Michelis (Italy), and Hans van den Broek (Netherlands). Prior to the delegation's arrival in Belgrade, Poos told reporters that the EC would <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis. There, the delegation was met by Serbian president Slobodan Milošević who dismissed the prospect of Croatia leaving the Yugoslav federation because its population contained 600,000 Serbs.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining missions {{so that he could}} devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2006–07 season, Gannon and Stockport announced they had drawn up a five-year plan to take the club to the Championship. Results on the field followed this statement of intent, with Gannon leading County to a League record nine consecutive victories without conceding a goal. Gannon lodged a complaint with The Football Association against Bristol Rovers when a fixture was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch, as he felt not enough was done to ready the pitch, and also a complaint with regard to the referee's handling of the situation. Gannon was later incensed with the FA when the same referee was allowed to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> postponed fixture, which Rovers won 2–1. Gannon also branded approaches from Manchester City and Liverpool questionable and unprofessional after the two Premier League clubs swooped for youngsters being trained in Stockport County's development squads.|$|E

5|$|Before Romney took over, {{the event}} was $379million short of its revenue goals. Officials had made plans to scale back the Games to {{compensate}} for the fiscal crisis, and there were fears it might be moved away entirely. In addition, the image of the Games had been damaged by allegations of bribery against top officials including prior committee president and CEO Frank Joklik. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee forced Joklik and committee vice president Dave Johnson to resign. Utah power brokers, including Governor Mike Leavitt, searched for someone with a scandal-free reputation to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olympics. They chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state. The appointment faced some initial criticism from both non-Mormons and Mormons that it represented cronyism and made the Games seem too Mormon-dominated.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{difficulties}} {{in finding a}} producer willing to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debut album of a newly signed band, Don Gilmore ultimately agreed to head up the project, with Andy Wallace hired as the mixer. Recording sessions, which mostly involved re-recording the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California in early 2000 and lasted four weeks. Shinoda's rapping sections {{in most of the}} songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged. Due to the absence of Dave Farrell and Kyle Christener, {{who took part in the}} 1999 extended play, the band hired Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck as stand-in bassists; Delson also played bass throughout most of the album. The Dust Brothers provided additional beats for the track “With You”.|$|E
5|$|During {{the start}} of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, President Manuel Quezon hired Paris-trained Filipino {{architect}} Andrés Luna de San Pedro, son of painter Juan Luna, to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renovations of the Manila Hotel. It was done {{under the supervision of the}} renowned engineering firm Pedro Siochi and Company. The hotel was the residence of General Douglas MacArthur when he became the Military Advisor of the Commonwealth. Luna converted the hotel's top floor into an elegant penthouse and expanded the west wing northward – creating the air-conditioned annex - and designed some key public rooms like the Fiesta Pavilion, then the biggest function room of the hotel. The hotel was the site of festivities during the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth government in November, 1935.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{took part}} in the Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland and in 1172 was made Lord of Meath; he spent much time away from Ludlow, and HenryII confiscated the castle in his absence, probably to ensure that Hugh stayed loyal while in Ireland. Hugh died in Ireland in 1186 and the castle passed to his son, Walter, who was a minor and did not <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property until 1194. During Prince John's rebellion against Richard I in 1194, Walter joined in the attacks against the prince; Richard did not approve of this and confiscated Ludlow and Walter's other properties. Walter de Lacy offered to buy back his land for 1,000marks, but the offer was rejected until in 1198 the vast sum of 3,100marks was finally agreed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, Marcello Lippi left Juventus to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italy {{national}} team {{and was replaced by}} Fabio Capello. In his fourth season with the club, Buffon made 38 appearances in Serie A and 48 in all competitions that season as he won his third Serie A title in four years with Juventus, winning once again the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award for the fifth time in his career. Juventus were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, against eventual winners Liverpool, and in 2005, Buffon was nominated for the UEFA Team of the Year for the fourth consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, it is Casual Friday {{and most}} people dress too loosely at the office. Angela (Angela Kinsey) {{complains}} to Toby (Paul Lieberstein) about Oscar (Oscar Nunez) wearing sandals to work and having {{to look at his}} feet. Meredith (Kate Flannery) disgusts the rest of the employees by wearing a very short dress without any panties or a bra, thus exposing herself {{to the rest of the}} office as she tries to adjust it to meet Toby's requests. Toby calls a meeting with everyone regarding Casual Friday. When Dwight tries to <b>take</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meeting, Toby is finally stern with him and cancels Casual Friday, much to everyone's disappointment.|$|E
