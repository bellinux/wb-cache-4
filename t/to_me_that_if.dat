I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise and it was clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 3, Congressman George Smathers {{defeated}} liberal Senator Claude Pepper for the Democratic Senate {{nomination in}} Florida. Smathers' tactics included dubbing his opponent [...] "Red Pepper" [...] and distributing red-covered brochures, The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper, {{that included a}} photograph of Pepper with Marcantonio. Soon after Smathers' triumph in the primary, which {{in the days of}} the yellow dog South was tantamount to election, South Dakota Republican Senator Karl Mundt, who when in the House had served with Nixon on HUAC, sent him a letter telling him about Smathers' brochure. Senator Mundt wrote to Nixon, [...] "It occurs <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced..." [...] Douglas wrote of Senator Pepper's defeat, [...] "The loss of Pepper is a great tragedy, and we are sick about it." [...] She also noted, [...] "What a vicious campaign was carried on against him. No doubt the fur will begin to fly out here too", and [...] "It is revolting to think of the depths to which people will go." ...|$|E
500|$|After Gilbert's retirement, {{and even}} {{following}} his death, controversy remained {{attached to his}} name; {{there seemed to be}} a conspiracy of silence surrounding his fate. Cricket historians rarely mentioned him, despite his varied career. W. G. Grace, although including Gilbert in an appendix of leading batsmen in his 1891 book Cricket, did not include him in the text at all, despite the book's more than 400pages; in his Cricketers I Have Met, Grace described 121cricketers but did not mention his cousin. Further evidence of Gilbert's disgrace came in the pages of Wisden. Although Gilbert began as an amateur cricketer, which entitled him to have [...] "Mr." [...] before his name in the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] section, he was referred to until his death as [...] "Gilbert, W. R.", which denoted a professional. However, in his Wisden obituary he received the title [...] "Mr. W. R. Gilbert", even though the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] still listed him as a professional, and in 1935 he was once again restored to amateur status in [...] "Births and Deaths", for reasons which are unclear. The same obituary glossed over Gilbert's enforced retirement from cricket, simply observing: [...] "At the beginning of 1886 he became a professional, and the season was not far advanced before his career in first-class cricket ended abruptly. He then left England for Canada." [...] Even in 1970, the silence continued; historian Rowland Bowen wrote about the story but concluded by saying: [...] "Another indication of the recurring instinct for suppression was a suggestion <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> this story had not appeared in print before (it has not) it should not now." [...] It is not clear who made this suggestion, whether it was descendants of the Grace family, a cricket administrator or someone else. It was not until 1984 that the full story was published by historian Robert Brook. In reviewing what he considered to be the injustice of the case, and reflecting on Gilbert's success in Canada, Green wrote: [...] "No wonder that those responsible for this act of appalling cruelty went to such fatuous lengths to keep its details a secret." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Right-o," [...] said Mr. Hills, {{dropping}} {{into a chair}} by the counter and caressing his moustache. [...] "But you wouldn't speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you knew what a terrible day I've had." ...|$|R
2500|$|He was {{interrupted}} by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wanted him to address the government's argument that the ongoing nature of the fraud made the odometer readings on the title applications essential to the scheme. [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> in a single instance the mailing of the title documents doesn't suffice to make it mail fraud, the multiplication of the instances doesn't change anything," [...] Steinberg responded. [...] "The repetition of odometer tampering doesn't create a mail fraud." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he was going to}} create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dismayed to {{find that}} {{groundbreaking}} work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds {{by means of a}} similar tuning fork [...] "contraption", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: [...] "Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech." [...] He also later remarked: [...] "I thought that Helmholtz had done it... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!" ...|$|E
