5|$|The Mono–Inyo Craters form a {{volcanic}} chain in Eastern California <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> along a narrow north–south-trending fissure system {{extending from the}} north shore of Mono Lake through the western Long Valley Caldera, south of Mammoth Mountain. The chain is within the Inyo National Forest and Mono County; the nearest incorporated community is Mammoth Lakes. The craters are in Mono Basin, {{which is part of the}} Great Basin geographic area.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Treaty Room in the former Peter Parker House is a 22-seat mahogany table <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> on an 1890 Sarouk rug. A photographic portrait of Empress Dowager Cixi that was presented as a diplomatic gift to the United States by Qing Dynasty China in 1905 hangs in the room.|$|E
50|$|Sitting {{still may}} cause {{premature}} death. The risk is higher among those <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> {{still more than}} 5 hours per day. It is {{shown to be a}} risk factor on its own independent of hard exercise and BMI. The more still, the higher risk of chronic diseases. People <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> still more than 4 hours per day have a 40 percent higher risk than those <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> fewer than 4 hours per day. However, those that exercise at least 4 hours per week are as healthy as those <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> fewer than 4 hours per day.|$|R

5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} is a butterfly-shaped organ <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> {{at the front}} of the neck. It is {{composed}} of two lobes, left and right, connected by a narrow isthmus. The thyroid weighs 25 grams in adults, with each lobe being about 5cm long, 3cm wide and 2cm thick, and the isthmus about 1.25cm in height and width. The gland is usually larger in women, and increases in size in pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|In {{southeast}} Broken Arrow, the Creek Turnpike {{crosses the}} county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the north-northeast. It then meets SH-51, {{followed by the}} Muskogee Turnpike (SH-351) near that highway's western terminus. The Creek Turnpike passes through {{the third and final}} barrier toll after re-entering Tulsa. From the toll plaza, the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I-44/US-412 interchange, which straddles the Wagoner–Rogers County county line. The portion of the interchange <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks. The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I-44 merges onto the roadway.|$|E

5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E
5|$|The abbey ruin {{at the top}} of the East Cliff is the town's {{oldest and}} most {{prominent}} landmark. Other significant features include the swing bridge, which crosses the River Esk and the harbour, which is sheltered by the grade II listed East and West piers. The town's maritime heritage is commemorated by statues of Captain Cook and William Scoresby, as well as the whalebone arch <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> {{at the top of}} the West Cliff. The town also has a strong literary tradition and has featured in literary works, television and cinema, most famously in Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.|$|E
5|$|The statue <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> {{atop the}} Burnside Fountain is now {{commonly}} referred to as Turtle Boy. In the tradition of the Manneken Pis in Brussels, Turtle Boy has become an unofficial mascot for Worcester. Much of the local popularity of the statue is due to bawdy insinuations about how the boy and the turtle are portrayed. Anonymous members of the Worcester community sometimes dress the statue in festive clothes for holidays, local bands write crowd-pleasing songs about it, and the statue has even graced postcards of the city.|$|E

5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the verdict}} of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises to throw a ball game; no player <b>that</b> <b>sits</b> in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E

Instead, it became subject to vandalism and disrepair. In March 2006, after several acts of vandalism, the statue was completely removed from {{in front of}} the library.|$|E
