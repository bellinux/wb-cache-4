5|$|A Holliday {{junction}} is a branched {{nucleic acid}} structure that contains four double-stranded arms joined <b>together.</b> <b>These</b> arms may adopt {{one of several}} conformations depending on buffer salt concentrations and the sequence of nucleobases closest to the junction. The structure is named after the molecular biologist Robin Holliday, who proposed its existence in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved <b>together.</b> <b>These</b> were {{the early days of}} the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
5|$|Economically {{important}} {{sources of}} boron are the minerals colemanite, rasorite (kernite), ulexite and tincal. <b>Together</b> <b>these</b> constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western Turkey, including {{the provinces of}} Eskişehir, Kütahya and Balıkesir. Global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes, against a yearly production of about four million tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. <b>Together</b> <b>these</b> structures form the forebrain.|$|E

5|$|From 1851 to 1854 Henry Denham {{captain of}} HMS Herald, {{which was on}} a {{scientific}} expedition to the southwest Pacific (1852–1856), completed the island's first hydrographic survey. On board were three Scottish biologists, William Milne (a gardener-botanist from the Edinburgh Botanic Garden), John Macgillivray (naturalist) who collected fish and plant specimens, and Assistant Surgeon and zoologist Denis Macdonald. <b>Together</b> <b>these</b> men established much basic information on the geology, flora and fauna of the island.|$|E
5|$|In 106AD, emperor Trajan finally {{defeated}} the Dacian kingdom of Decebalus and annexed {{it as the}} Roman province of Dacia Traiana.

5|$|In any case, the {{succession}} of Nyuserre seems to have gone smoothly. A seal bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal {{is believed to have}} both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken <b>together</b> <b>these</b> seals reveal that, at the very least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. <b>Together,</b> <b>these</b> were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|It {{has some}} {{properties}} that are {{unusual for a}} metal; taken <b>together,</b> <b>these</b> are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding. Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric, and a conditional glass-former. Aluminium can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E

5|$|Some {{traits are}} governed by only a single gene, but most traits are {{influenced}} by the interactions of many genes.
