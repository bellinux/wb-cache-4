Consequently, Mayor Dennis Trudeau was determined to move forward as he applied for and received a grant to establish the Grovetown Museum, the first museum in Columbia County. Owens contacted the Fort Gordon museum curator for advice to design floor plans for exhibits. She then contacted Harlem High School <b>to</b> <b>implement</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> to build exhibit cases; she paid for all necessary supplies for nine cases. Instead of purchasing locks and handles for the cases, screws were used to hold the case doors. She then bargained with Montgomery Ward to buy unfinished cases {{and was able to}} use the local police department's community servants for putting them together. By this time a number of citizens offered support. Charles Lord, a local historian, began collecting and organizing exhibits. Others volunteered their time and effort to prepare for the grand opening in March 2000. City officials organized a Grovetown Museum Board with by-laws for operating the facility. Volunteers served as weekend tour guides originally. Later the museum was included in the city budget.|$|E

In the former case coordination is not verifiable and moral hazard arises, while {{in the latter case}} the informational asymmetry is mitigated. We find parameter regions where, absent delegation, either the firm obtains no loan or the surplus, defined as the sum of bank's and manager's utility, shrinks. We also consider bank monitoring, which yields both redistributive and surplus-reducing effects. ...|$|E
