5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it was easy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost.</b> While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E

He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an embarrassment and regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> in the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E

High waves pounded the southeast coast, heavily damaging beachfront structures, washing out much of the coastal highway, and piling deep sand drifts on nearby grounds.

In all, the storm claimed 17 lives and caused $31.6 million in damage.|$|E

25|$|If {{the route}} of the dive is {{constrained}} or can be reliably planned, cylinders for bailout of decompression gas can be dropped along the route at the points where they will be needed on the return or ascent. The cylinders are usually clipped to a distance line or shot line, to ensure that they are easy to find and unlikely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost.</b> These cylinders would typically contain a gas mixture close to optimal for the sector of the dive in which they are intended to be used. This procedure is also known as staging, and the cylinders then known as stage cylinders, but the term stage cylinder has become generic for any cylinder carried at the diver's side in addition to the bottom gas.|$|E

At the time, the cattle in Chile were not well {{identified}} and it was not uncommon for the animals <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost.</b> To help prevent the loss, Governor Hurtado proclaimed that, in Santiago, every 24th and 25 July, the commemoration of Saint Jacob - patron saint of the city -, the cattle would be gathered in the Plaza de Armas de Santiago to be branded and selected. In later years, this round-up became mandatory but, the date of the event changed to October 7, the day of Saint Mark. Though the purpose of the gathering remained the same, the riders had become extremely well trained with the constant work of transferring cattle to the various corrals.|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} met with many {{positive}} reviews. Reviewers praised the series' vibrant graphics, high-quality sound, and varied, refined RPG gameplay, with particular optimism on the Djinn-based gameplay system and Battle aspect {{despite the fact that}} the original two games were limited to the 32-bit cartridge. GamePro raved that Golden Sun was [...] "A huge, fantastic, creative, and wickedly fun RPG that doesn't seem to care that it's 'just' on a GBA," [...] while they praised that The Lost Ages eye-popping magic effects are beautiful even by console standards. IGN, meanwhile, praised the plot's intricate structure, saying that it [...] "has been so tightly integrated into every ounce of the adventure... such a rich and deep plot that it's almost easy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> if you're not paying attention." [...] 1UP praised Dark Dawn as being a huge step forward in terms of pacing and graphics compared to the previous games.|$|E
500|$|In the Herald Sun, Leigh Paatsch {{gave the}} film one star.

Sometimes even hateful". A mixed review from Philippa Hawker of the Sydney Morning Herald concluded [...] "The Australian elements seem hastily inserted and incidental: the movie could have been set in any country that had a water park and a place <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost.</b> But as a hymn to male bonding, and {{an exploration of the}} comic possibilities of what happens when a turd hits a water slide, The Inbetweeners 2 is a precisely crafted, assured piece of work".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to The Man from London generally praised its formalist aesthetic and painstakingly composed scenes, while criticizing its slow pace {{and lack of}} a compelling plot. Most argued the film fell short of Tarr's previous efforts. Varietys Derek Elley rated the film {{on a par with}} his Damnation (1988) but as inferior to Sátántangó (1994) and Werckmeister Harmonies (2000), remarking it was improbable that The Man From London would {{put an end to the}} polarization of Tarr's audiences into those who hail him as a director of [...] "visionary genius" [...] and those for whom he is a [...] "crashing bore". Martin Tsai of The New York Sun allowed that Tarr [...] "makes it easy for viewers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> in his beautifully bleak world and lose track of time" [...] but complained that in comparison with its predecessors, the film's central theme of guilt seemed insubstantial and the film itself felt [...] "slight and incomplete".|$|E
500|$|Touch Arcade {{called the}} {{graphics}} [...] "good, but not great", though reasonable given the game's age, but that some demon designs were [...] "spectacular works of art". RPGFan found {{the majority of}} the game's graphics to be [...] "functional, but not too appealing", and said that it was easy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> due to the bland textures of the walls and the floors. They did however like the graphics used in battles and story sections, which they found well-drawn and detailed. They praised the designs of the game's female characters, especially Nekomata, Lamia, and Yuriko, but felt that the designs of the male characters were bland. Touch Arcade found the music to be fantastic. RPGFan said that every piece fits into the scene where it is played, but that few were memorable. They did note [...] "Ginza" [...] as an exception, which they felt was so well-composed that it would sound good in any format.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{its huge}} {{commercial}} success, critical reception was mixed. The specialist music press were generally positive. Q magazine proclaimed, [...] "truly this... is the genuine follow-up {{to the most}} over-the-top rock album of all time." [...] Like most critics, Q referred to the excesses of Steinman's style, citing {{the length of the}} songs (Q says that [...] "Objects..." [...] running for 10 minutes and 12 seconds is [...] "not necessary"). Unlike the original, where the epic loud songs were [...] "offset by the softness of stuff like 'Two Out of Three Ain't Bad'…even the ballads are Roman orgies of sound and fury." [...] This, they say, means [...] "the album's probable theme—the crushing effect growing up has on teenage dreams—seems <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> among the thud and blunder." [...] However, overall, Q is positive, concluding with the sentiment that [...] "Ultimately, Back Into Hell may not trash its predecessor, but as a mad, crunching, stadium rock album, it's probably the best thing of its kind you'll hear this year." ...|$|E
