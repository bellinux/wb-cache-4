25|$|Currently one of {{the most}} active areas of {{knowledge}} representation research are projects associated with <b>the</b> <b>semantic</b> web. <b>The</b> <b>semantic</b> web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, <b>the</b> <b>semantic</b> web creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional text only searches. Frame languages and automatic classification play a big part in the vision for the future semantic web. The automatic classification gives developers technology to provide order on a constantly evolving network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.|$|E

Thus, TOTs are caused by the deficit in transmission of activation from <b>the</b> <b>semantic</b> memory store to the phonological memory store.|$|E

25|$|Many {{languages}} {{have both}} {{an active and}} a passive voice; this allows for greater flexibility in sentence construction, as either <b>the</b> <b>semantic</b> agent or patient may take the syntactic role of subject. The use of passive voice allows speakers to organize stretches of discourse by placing figures other than the agent in subject position. This may be done to foreground the patient, recipient, or other thematic role; {{it may also be}} useful when <b>the</b> <b>semantic</b> patient is the topic of on-going discussion. The passive voice may also be used to avoid specifying the agent of an action.|$|E

One aim of these subfields is to explain the meaning of a word in terms of their relationships with other words. In order to accomplish this aim, one approach is to analyze <b>the</b> internal <b>semantic</b> structure of a word as composed of a number of distinct and minimal components of meaning. This approach is called componential analysis, also known as semantic decomposition. Semantic decomposition allows any given lexical item to be defined based on minimal elements of meaning, which are called <b>semantic</b> features. <b>The</b> term <b>semantic</b> feature is usually used interchangeably with <b>the</b> term <b>semantic</b> component. Additionally, semantic features/semantic components are also often referred to as semantic properties.|$|R
