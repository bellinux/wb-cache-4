5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|The Council {{is made up}} of its Chairman (as of 6 November 2012 the Chief Justice of Singapore, Sundaresh Menon), up to ten {{permanent}} members who are appointed for life, and up to ten ordinary members who are appointed for a period of three years and may be re-appointed. Appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. If <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> concur with Cabinet's advice, he may veto appointments. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), and if the CPA does not concur with his view, Parliament may override his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current PCMR members.|$|E
5000|$|He asserts about Bush {{administration}} {{reports of}} weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, [...] "Powell was not duped or misled by anybody, nor did he lie about Saddam's suspected WMD stockpiles. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> lie. <b>The</b> Vice <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> lie... <b>the</b> far less dramatic truth is that we were wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> reply. He was anxiously {{watching}} the Record and scribbling {{notes on a}} paper beside him. His face was pale and his lips tightly compressed.|$|R
50|$|General S F Rodrigues, former COAS, and Admirals L Ramdas, Arun Prakash and Sureesh Mehta, former Chiefs of Naval Staff, {{wrote an}} open letter to President Pranab Mukherjee, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.

25|$|Non-partisan, no {{more than}} three Commissioners may belong to the same {{political}} party. The President also designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, the SEC's top executive. However, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> possess the power to fire the appointed Commissioners, a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC. This issue arose during the 2008 presidential election in connection with the ensuing financial crises.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of President is an honorary one. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> take a salary and is chosen from {{supporters of the}} club. Past holders of the seat have included former Prime Minister Sir John Major {{and a number of}} former players, an example of which is the 2011 President and 1960s Surrey slow left-arm bowler Roger Harman, who held the post for a single year, as has been customary in recent years. He was the 48th President.|$|E
50|$|In August 2014, President Benigno Aquino III was {{urged by}} LPGMA Partylist Representative Arnel Ty to observe DST from November 2014 to January 2015 and March to June 2015 {{to prepare for}} the power crisis in the country but <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{implement}} <b>the</b> DST.|$|R

500|$|The Presidential Palace ( [...] , also {{referred}} to by the metonym Pantovčak) in Zagreb is the official workplace of the president. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> actually live in the building, as it is used as the Office of the President of Croatia {{rather than as a}} residence. The structure covers [...] It had been used as the official residence since then-president Franjo Tuđman moved there following the October 1991 bombing of Banski dvori. In addition to the original building, there is also an [...] annex built in 1993, an ancillary structure housing office security services and a bomb shelter predating the 1990s. The building, formerly known as Villa Zagorje or Tito's Villa, was designed by architects Vjenceslav Richter and Kazimir Ostrogović and completed in 1964 for the former Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
2500|$|Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary at the time, {{spoke for}} President Obama {{on the matter}} by saying <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> support, but {{actually}} opposes, some {{of the kind of}} words and lyrics that have been written by Common and others. Even though <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> support the lyrics in question, he believed that some reports were distorting what Mr. Lynn stands for more broadly. Common gave a single line response to the entire controversy: [...] "I guess Sarah Palin and Fox News doesn't like me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{arguments}} that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> possess soft power stem from a strict interpretation of the Constitution and what are regarded as the traditional roles of the President. First, unless the Constitution states otherwise, the default position is that when exercising his functions the President has to act according to {{the advice of the}} Cabinet. In the context of the Constitution, the word advice does not carry its typical meaning of mere opinion or suggestion. The President is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have any liberty to exercise soft power. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} since the President is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of [...] "political legitimacy" [...] posited by proponents would appear to be undermined by soft power, which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.|$|E
5000|$|<b>President</b> Clinton {{discussed}} <b>the</b> economy, {{the federal}} budget, taxes {{and focused on}} the budget surplus, then at $70 billion. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> also discussed <b>the</b> future of Social Security, education, foreign relations and [...] "solving the so-called Y2K computer problem". <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> mention <b>the</b> then-occurring impeachment trial in the Senate.|$|R
50|$|The list {{became public}} {{knowledge}} on June 27, 1973, when Dean mentioned during hearings with the Senate Watergate Committee that a list existed containing those whom <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> like. Journalist Daniel Schorr, {{who happened to}} be on the list, managed to obtain a copy of it later that day.|$|R
5000|$|The {{constitution}} was amended in 1926 to allow presidential re-elections {{as long as}} <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> serve consecutive terms. [...] This amendment allowed former president Álvaro Obregón {{to run for the}} presidency in 1928, an election he won, but he was assassinated before taking office. The amendment was repealed in 1934.|$|R
2500|$|... "Guidance Patrols" [...] (gasht-e ershâd) — often {{referred}} to as [...] "religious police" [...] in Western media – enforce Islamic moral values and dress codes. Reformist politicians have criticized the unpopular patrols but the patrols ‘interminable’ according to Iranian judicial authorities who have pointed out that in the Islamic Republic <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have control over the enforcement of dress codes.|$|E
2500|$|Mohsen Sazegara, {{who was a}} {{high-ranking}} Tehran official before turning against the government, has argued that Ahmadinejad does not control the Guards outside of Iran. [...] "Not only the foreign ministry of Iran; even <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> know what the Revolutionary Guards does outside of Iran. They directly report to the leader", he said, referring to Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Although Ali Khamenei is the ultimate person {{in charge of the}} Quds Force, George Bush did not mention him. According to Richard Clarke, [...] "Quds force reports directly to the Supreme Ayatollah, through the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary guards." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} debate, held on RTÉ Radio 1's News at One, {{independent}} candidate Scallon explained she had delayed her {{entry into the}} race due to numerous family bereavements. Appearing on The Late Late Show alongside the other candidates, Scallon displayed {{a copy of the}} EU Constitution, telling her audience: [...] "This is what this election is about. I have the knowledge and experience to be able to protect our sovereignty and that's the only question I think that's really urgent at this time." [...] When asked by Ryan Tubridy if she would refuse to sign any bill threatening , she responded by saying, [...] "You bet your boots I would". In fact, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have such a veto power, being able only to refer a Bill to the Council of State for its consideration.|$|E
50|$|Example 4: If the U.S. Congress {{passes a}} bill, <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> {{signature}} of <b>the</b> bill {{is sufficient to}} make it law. Note that the case whereby <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sign <b>the</b> bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential veto, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> mean that the bill has not become law (it could still have become law through a congressional override).|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, Senator Sekibo voiced the {{strained}} {{relations between}} <b>the</b> senate and <b>president</b> Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, raising {{a point of}} order when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> formally inform <b>the</b> senate that he was proceeding on a two-week vacation, and on that basis questioning whether the senate should recognize Vice President Goodluck Jonathan as <b>the</b> acting <b>president.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the bill}} was not {{returned}} to the Majlis by <b>the</b> <b>president</b> or even if <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> ratify <b>the</b> bill within the thirty-day period, the bill is deemed to become law.

2500|$|New York Times reporters Neil Lewis and David Stout {{estimated}} subsequently that Libby's {{prison sentence}} could begin within [...] "two months", explaining that Judge Walton’s decision {{means that the}} defense lawyers will probably ask {{a federal appeals court}} to block the sentence, a long-shot move. It also sharpens interest in a question being asked by Mr. Libby’s supporters and critics alike: Will President Bush pardon Mr. Libby? ... So far, the president has expressed sympathy for Mr. Libby and his family but has not tipped his hand on the pardon issue. ... If <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> pardon him, and if an appeals court refuses to second-guess Judge Walton’s decision, Mr. Libby will probably be ordered to report to prison in six to eight weeks' time. Federal prison authorities will decide where. [...] "Unless the Court of Appeals overturns my ruling, he will have to report", Judge Walton said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, she {{was invited}} to speak at a United Nations conference on AIDS. She was asked {{whether it would be}} {{appropriate}} to promote masturbation as a means of preventing young people from engaging in riskier forms of sexual activity, and she replied, [...] "I think that it is part of human sexuality, and perhaps it should be taught." [...] This remark caused great controversy and resulted in Elders losing the support of the White House. [...] White House chief of staff Leon Panetta remarked, [...] "There have been too many areas where <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> agree with her views. This is just one too many." [...] In December 1994, Elders was forced to resign by President Clinton. This historic incident is explored further in a documentary on masturbation called , in which Elders talks about her experience being asked to resign in an on camera interview conducted by writer/director/producer Nicholas Tana and was referenced in a Newsweek article.|$|E

5000|$|Adolf Hitler took a risk when he {{sent his}} troops to the Rhineland. He told them to [...] "turn back and not to resist" [...] if they were stopped by the French Army.

50|$|In 1975, Sinclair Radionics {{launched}} the Oxford range of briefcase calculators. Sinclair also attempted {{to capture the}} top-end calculator market with the Sinclair Sovereign, available in plated gold or silver.

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> now {{put forward}} any claim for pecuniary indemnity, but {{requires}} the relinquishment of all claim of sovereignty over or {{title to the}} island of Cuba, {{as well as the}} immediate evacuation by Spain of the island, the cession to the United States and immediate evacuation of Porto Rico and other islands under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and the like cession of an island in the Ladrones.|$|E
60|$|But it is {{not only}} true that the President could {{correctly}} be called a King. It is also true that the King might correctly be called a President. We could hardly find a more exact description of him than to call him a President. What is expected in modern times of a modern constitutional monarch is emphatically that he should preside. We expect him to take the throne exactly as if he were taking the chair. The chairman does not move the motion or resolution, far less vote it; he is not supposed even to favour it. He is expected to please everybody by favouring nobody. The primary essentials of a President or Chairman are that he should be treated with ceremonial respect, that he should be popular in his personality and yet impersonal in his opinions, and that he should actually be a link between all the other persons by being different from all of them. This is exactly what is demanded of the constitutional monarch in modern times. It is exactly the opposite to the American position; in which <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> preside at all. He moves; and the thing he moves may truly be called a motion; for the national idea is perpetual motion. Technically it is called a message; and might often actually be called a menace. Thus we may truly say that the King presides and the President reigns. Some would prefer to say that the President rules; and some Senators and members of Congress would prefer to say that he rebels. But {{there is no doubt that}} he moves; he does not take the chair or even the stool, but rather the stump.|$|E

50|$|Following the Russian {{intervention}} in Syria {{in support of}} Syrian president in 2015, Bashar al-Assad al-Jubeir declared: “There is no future for Assad in Syria”.
