40|$|The {{electronic}} component V-I characteristics express {{a relationship between}} the current flowing via a chosen couple of pins, and the voltage applied on those pins. That voltage varies between two safe, for the component health limits, during the V-I characteristic recording. The applied voltage variation follows a certain function like sinus or ramp. The V-I characteristics of an individual component type can differ according to production technology, according to a particular manufacturer, or according to measurement conditions itself. Those so called natural differences can be registered by the study of statistically significant component population with known origin and history, and they can be subsumed in the comparison <b>master</b> <b>pin</b> print. That comparison <b>master</b> <b>pin</b> print is subsequently used as a criterion for discovering differences caused by improper treatment, failure or by the counterfeiting process. The article illustrates a counterfeit detector application for comparative V-I characteristics analysis aimed at a relevant knowledge base development for particular production technologies and component types...|$|R

Each division had two employees, a platelayer foreman and a platelayer, in addition to four seasonal workers during the summer.

5000|$|The {{original}} <b>Track</b> <b>Masters</b> Remix features 50 Cent. At {{the time}} of the single release, Epic Records chose Nas for the radio version. Nas re-recorded new rap verses and the track was cut down to 2:52, becoming the <b>Track</b> <b>Masters</b> Remix Radio Edit. Nas replacing 50 Cent caused controversy; and the rappers, who were previously like [...] "brothers" [...] have resented each other since. The remix's beat contains re-adaptions of the instrumental used on Luniz's 1995 song [...] "I Got 5 on It" [...] featuring Michael Marshall, a song which itself sampled Club Nouveau's 1987 song [...] "Why You Treat Me So Bad".|$|R
