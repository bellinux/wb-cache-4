5|$|The foreign {{media were}} often criticised by Ugandan exiles and defectors for {{emphasizing}} Amin's self-aggrandizing eccentricities and taste for excess while downplaying or excusing his murderous behavior.

5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game, so <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> tensions. The British were also wary of Iraqi military leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E

The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture. Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia, where most recognise that many cultural values are shared.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{specialist}} units were also raised, including three Australian tunnelling companies. Arriving on the Western Front in May 1916 they undertook mining and counter-mining operations alongside British, Canadian and New Zealand companies, initially operating around Armentieres and at Fromelles. The following year they operated in the Ypres section. In November 1916, the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company took {{over from the}} Canadians around Hill 60, subsequently playing {{a key role in}} the Battle of Messines in June 1917. During the German offensive in March 1918 the three companies served as infantry, and later supported the Allied advance being used <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> booby traps and mines. The Australian Electrical Mining and Mechanical Boring Company supplied electric power to units in the British Second Army area.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E

25|$|Researchers in the United States have {{undertaken}} field evaluations of in-vehicle devices that monitor driver behaviours and fuel consumption. Studies that tested {{the use of}} in-vehicle monitoring in emergency medical services (EMS) reported substantial improvements in driver behaviour through in-vehicle monitoring systems that gave drivers real-time feedback. The researchers reported that the technology demonstrated sustained cost savings in regards to vehicle maintenance and required minimal retraining of drivers. Another study of EMS drivers reported similar results and recommended gradual implementation of in-vehicle monitoring, with attention <b>to</b> <b>defusing</b> potential concerns regarding a punitive approach to corrective action.|$|R

This success encouraged Aronson to apply his research to other policy issues including energy conservation and {{the treatment of the}} elderly.In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, Aronson advocated for jigsaw classrooms as part of an approach <b>to</b> <b>defusing</b> the social divisions underlying school violence.|$|R
5|$|For {{much of the}} ships' careers, {{they were}} {{assigned}} to the main Italian fleet, where they were frequently occupied with conducting training exercises. These exercises frequently gamed attacks by the French fleet, such as the maneuvers conducted in 1893, which simulated a French attack on Naples. In 1895, Partenope joined a squadron that visited Great Britain, and later that year took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Euridice took part in a similar demonstration, again off Crete, in 1897; this was a reaction to the Greco-Turkish War that had broken out that year. Between 1906 and 1908, Partenope was converted into a minelayer, and Minerva underwent a similar conversion in 19091910. Two ships, Calatafimi and Euridice, were discarded in early 1907.|$|E
5|$|Francis Marrash {{was born}} in Aleppo, a city of Ottoman Syria (present-day Syria), to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their {{literary}} interests. Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century, the family was well established in Aleppo, although they had gone through troubles: a relative of Francis, Butrus Marrash, was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818. Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions, among them the priest Jibrail Marrash. Francis' father, Fathallah, tried <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> the Sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849, in which he rejected the Filioque. He had built up a large private library to give his three children Francis, Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education, particularly {{in the field of}} Arabic language and literature.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> {{public concern}} by staging the London {{opening of the}} comedy Prince Karl as a charity performance, despite Stoker's warning that critics would view it {{as an attempt to}} obtain favorable publicity for the production. Although some press reports suggested that Mansfield stopped performing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in London because of the murders, financial reasons are more likely. Despite widespread publicity due to the murders and Mansfield's disputes with Bandmann, attendance was mediocre, and the production was losing money. On December 1, Mansfield's tenancy at the Lyceum ended. He left London, taking his company on a tour of England. In December they performed Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and other plays in Liverpool and Derby, then continued to other cities and performed other plays.|$|E

Frederick I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered the hand {{to be part of}} the imperial regalia and requested that Henry return it to Germany. Matilda and Henry were equally insistent that it should remain at Reading Abbey, where it had become a popular attraction for visiting pilgrims. Frederick was bought off with an alternative set of expensive gifts from England, including a huge, luxurious tent, probably chosen by Matilda, which Frederick used for court events in Italy. She was also approached by Louis VII of France, in 1164, and helped <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> a growing diplomatic row over the handling of Crusading funds.|$|E

At a hearing, it is revealed that Rita violated her and Paul's custody agreement, making Paul's case against her even stronger. When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen, and Dexter responds by hitting him with a frying pan. Paul loses consciousness, so Dexter drives his body back to Paul's hotel and frames him for drug abuse. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.|$|E
5|$|The war to {{the south}} {{influenced}} British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000 defeated Loyalists had migrated from the new United States following independence. The 14,000 Loyalists {{who went to the}} Saint John and Saint Croix river valleys, then part of Nova Scotia, felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off New Brunswick as a separate colony in 1784. The Constitutional Act of 1791 created the provinces of Upper Canada (mainly English-speaking) and Lower Canada (mainly French-speaking) <b>to</b> <b>defuse</b> tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.|$|E
