40|$|An EPLD based {{low cost}} <b>transient</b> <b>recorder</b> of video signal {{bandwidth}} (sampling rate 25 MHz) is presented. It {{will be used}} to record and replay video signals. These video signals are handled by a video processing unit, under construction in a VHDL environment. The main advantage of this self made <b>transient</b> <b>recorder</b> is that the video signal processing device, which is under construction in a VHDL environment, uses the same analog components as the EPLD based <b>transient</b> <b>recorder.</b> Thus, the video signal passes the same signal path and components in the final device. This results in a simulation environment very close to the final system environment. 1 Introduction The speed of EPLDs available now allow applications in the area of video signal processing.

Furthermore, any uncertainty in setting a predefined trigger level could be avoided. Especially in complex flows where regions of low velocity exist, a very accurate velocity estimation is necessary {{in order to reduce the}} relative error.

40|$|A 6 -channel dichroic-based polychromator is {{presented}} as the spectrally selective unit for the U. P. C. elastic/Raman lidar. Light emission is made at 355 -nm (ultraviolet, UV), 532 -nm (visible, VIS) and 1064 -nm (near infrared, NIR) wavelengths. In reception, the polychromator is the spectral separation unit that separates the laser backscattered composite return into 3 elastic (355, 532, 1064 -nm wavelengths) and 3 Raman channels (386. 7, 607. 4 and 407. 5 -nm (water-vapor) wavelengths). The polychromator houses photo-multiplier tubes (PMT) for all the channels except for the NIR one, which is avalanche photodiode (APD) based. The optomechanical design uses 1 -inch optics and Eurorack standards. The APD-based receiver uses a XY-axis translation/elevation micro-positioning stage due to its comparatively small active area and motorised neutral density filters are used in all PMT-based channels to avoid detector saturation.

40|$|A 200 MHz 12 -bit fast <b>transient</b> <b>recorder</b> card {{has been}} used for the {{digitization}} of pulses from photomultipliers coupled to organic scintillation detectors. Two modes of operation have been developed at ENEA-Frascati: a) continuous acquisition up to a maximum duration of ∼ 1. 3 s corresponding to the full on-board memory (256 MSamples) of the card: in this mode, all scintillation events are recorded; b) non-continuous acquisition in which digitization is triggered by those scintillaton events whose amplitude is above a threshold value: the digitizing interval after each trigger can be set according to the typical decay time of the scintillation events; longer acquisition durations (> 1. 3 s) can be reached, although with dead time (needed for data storage) which depends on the incoming event rate. Several important features are provided by this novel digital approach: high count rate operation, pulse shape analysis, post-experiment data re-processing, pile-up identification and treatment. In particular, NE 213 scintillators have been successfully used with this system for measurements in mixed neutron (n) and gamma (γ) radiation fields from fusion plasmas: separation between γ and neutron events is made by means of a dedicated software comparing the pulse charge integrated in two different time intervals and simultaneous neutron and γ pulse height spectra can be recorded at total count rates in the MHz range.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{known as}} Time Delay Spectrometry (TDS), {{which has been}} used at JPL for ultrasonic tissue characterization, has promise for similar application in materials characterization as well. This technique differs from the approaches based on pulse-echo techniques which are used by other workers. Time Delay Spectrometry operates in the frequency domain directly. The transducer is excited by a rapidly swept frequency source and a tracking receiver is used to select signals arriving during a narrow time interval. In the reflection mode this time interval represents {{the range of the}} reflecting surface. In the transmission mode this time interval is adjusted to the desired acoustic delay, causing rejection of signals which follow extraneous paths. This swept frequency implementation makes coherent processing of the full analytic signal possible, which in turn allows more representative signatures to be obtained. In the reflection mode, for example, a better indication is obtained of the true strength of an interface or scatterer because the response can be made less dependent on the interference effects that so greatly alter the amplitude peaks of the conventional echo. This technique also permits an enhanced dynamic range to be obtained by applying frequency compensation directly to the transmitted signal. An added bonus is the ability to use data logging systems at rates commensurate with microprocessor operation in place of more expensive high speed <b>transient</b> <b>recorders</b> with limited memory capacity. Attenuation spectra taken on tissue specimens and on a few material samples will be presented.

The main {{subject of the}} thesis is transient based ground fault location using low frequency fault generated transients. However, the thesis also considers the conventional fault location methods and reviews the various other methods. Low frequency transient based methods, in general, are more precise and more reliable than the conventional methods based on fundamental frequency. They also avoid {{the need for further}} investment in existing systems that would be required, for example, for the implementation of travelling wave fault location, as existing <b>transient</b> <b>recorders</b> can be used. As a byproduct of the thorough investigation of conventional fault location and the presentation of its properties and limitations, a new error estimation technique is proposed. Fault generated transients are presented and tested, and their potential to aid fault location using the phase or neutral current is studied. The thesis also tries to solve some of the problems related to fault transient generation and propagation, as well as measurements and signal processing.

Modern acquisition systems such as those based on LicelTM <b>transient</b> <b>recorders</b> combine a dual acquisition mode in which the return signal is recorded simultaneously in both analog (analog-to-digital (AD) conversion) and photon-counting (PC) modes. Although both data records can be analyzed separately, their combination obtained through gluing gives {{the advantage of the}} high linearity of the AD conversion for high light-level signals (especially in the near range) and the high sensitivity of the PC mode for low light-level signals (in the far range). Recently, eruptions of volcanoes such as Eyjafjalla (Iceland) in 2010, Grímsvötn (Iceland Puyehue (Argentina) Nabro (Eritrea) and Mount Lokon (Indonesia) in 2011 have yielded emergency situations with a strong economical cost due to human evacuation and/or air traffic interruption. Volcanic aerosols are first injected in the troposphere and often reach the stratosphere where they can reside for several years. The mixed analog/photo-counting acquisition approach is particularly suitable for the detection of volcanic aerosols in both the troposphere (near/mid range) and the stratosphere (far range). In this line, a case study showing volcanic aerosols from the Nabro volcano (Eritrea, 2011) in the stratosphere and simultaneously Saharan dust in the troposphere over the multi-spectral Barcelona lidar station during the period 27 June – 1 July 2011 is presented. The benefits of the proposed gluing technique will be shown through the comparison of analog, PC, and glued backscatter-coefficient time series. Existing gluing algorithms solve the fitting coefficients by matching both analog and PC data over a predefined spatial range (or equivalently, over a predefined upper and lower counting rate) depending on which kind of photodetector (usually a photomultiplier) is being used. In this work, an enhanced data-gluing formulation is presented. The method automatically finds the spatial range where both analog and PC signals are more similar based on Euclidian distance minimization over piece-wise range intervals along the whole acquisition spatial range.
