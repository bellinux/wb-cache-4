5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E

25|$|However, these luggage racks {{were always}} underutilised. Travellers {{preferred}} {{holding on to}} their bags where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> or sitting, as opposed to placing them on the luggage racks, probably due to convenience and fear of theft. Some commuters were also complaining that these racks took up critically needed space which could be occupied by other passengers which often filled the train. Furthermore, the service to Changi Airport was cancelled and replaced by a shuttle service to and from Tanah Merah station, dismissing {{the need to provide}} these racks for non-airport bound train services. Therefore, in 2003, trains with the luggage racks had them removed, and replaced with an empty standing area, with a dual purpose of serving as a wheelchair area.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Superboy's only superpower is a telekinetic {{force field}} that {{surrounds}} {{his body and}} granted him abilities that approximated some of Superman's powers such as super strength, flight and invulnerability. The field allowed Superboy to lift heavy objects by extending the field around him and deflecting any solid object that {{came into contact with}} him. The field also allowed Superboy the ability to manipulate objects that he came into tactile contact with, bend them into any shape that he could visualize mentally, and disassemble things such as machines and other complex constructions by touch. Under Knockout's training, Superboy learned new ways to use his tactile telekinesis such as projecting telekinetic force waves to blast pieces of ground and extending his field to another person. Superboy can also manipulate solid masses such as volumes of sand or dust causing the individual particles to fly apart in an explosive manner to create particle clouds or a forceful attack. He can also perform the same with solid masses that are splintered, such as a cracked slab of concrete or fractured pane of glass. The telekinetic field also lets Superboy break free of an opponent's grip by pushing the field outward to force the opponent away and he is also able to create an air pocket around himself enabling him to breathe in outer space. In addition, he demonstrated the ability to extend his telekinetic field around other people that he touches to make them invulnerable. He also learned a trick from his older and more experienced alternate self, Black Zero, that allowed him to freeze people where they stood if he was touching the same surface that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on.|$|E

And in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{series of}} {{accidents}} during the tower's construction {{resulted in the}} deaths of six workmen and serious injury to another. Two of the men, Jonathan Richardson and Alexander Stewart, were killed when a crane hook snapped and a girder fell and hit the scaffold platform on which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing,</b> causing them to fall to the ground. A third man, John Daly, suffered serious injuries. The other four were killed in separate incidents by falling off the tower structure. A fire on the tower at [...] in 1898 resulted in the death of a fire-fighter from the New Brighton Fire Brigade. He fell [...] while walking along a beam [...] wide to try and extinguish the flames.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{wanted to}} {{experiment}} in more sophisticated sound recording and reproduction techniques for Fantasia. [...] "Music emerging from one speaker {{behind the screen}} sounds thin, tinkly and strainy. We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces... so that audiences would feel as though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> at the podium with Stokowski". For the recording of The Sorcerer's Apprentice in January 1938, engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation for using multiple audio channels which allowed any desired dynamic balance to be achieved upon playback. The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi-circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections to increase reverberation. Though as the production of Fantasia developed, the setup used for The Sorcerer's Apprentice was abandoned for different multi-channel recording arrangements.|$|E
500|$|Shaw {{was found}} by the Royal Navy helicopter, {{approximately}} 20 minutes after the alarm was raised, 150 metres downstream from where she had fallen in. Due to poor visibility {{as a result of}} heavy rain, the other members of her group had been unable to see her from where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing.</b> There were two adults in the group. A member of the helicopter crew explained: [...] "There were two people waving their jackets and pointing into the river. Initially we thought 'Why are they not in the water helping?' what looked like a child face down in the water. Seeing the fast-flowing river, and how dangerous it would have been for them, there was no alternative for them to wait for us to arrive." ...|$|E

500|$|This, however, meant {{there would}} be more riders packed into smaller trains, and led some {{passengers}} to miss trains because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> at the wrong part of the platform. In the past, there have been signs indicating where the train stops at some stations, in addition to the [...] "4" [...] and [...] "6" [...] markers next to the tracks used by train operators as stop points. Still, the overall lack of visual identifiers of train stop points on the platforms, the differing stop points during different times of day, and the location of staircases, transfer passageways and platform benches have been cited as a cause of passengers missing trains or being bunched into single cars. Beginning in 2013, additional signs were installed along G train platforms. In 2014, several improvements were implemented due to an infusion of extra funding, with G trains to be lengthened in 2019 (see below).|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with {{a player in the}} centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These [...] "centre passes" [...] alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third. The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time. It must be released before the foot <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on when they caught it touches the ground again. Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least [...] away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball. If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) also received mixed impressions. Chris Carter found the squad controls rudimentary, but found the team chatter and their assistance welcome. GamesTM pointed out flaws in enemies by criticizing overpowered bosses {{and saying that}} [...] "the {{number of things that}} can kill you instantly—even on Normal difficulty—is exasperatingly high". Reviewers like Carter and GamesTM complained of ally teammates failing to revive players, even in instances such as when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> right next to the player.|$|E

Knopfler said there was a man working there dressed in a baseball cap, work boots, and a checkered shirt delivering boxes who was standing next to him watching. As <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> there watching MTV, Knopfler remembers the man coming up with lines such as [...] "what are those, Hawaiian noises?...that ain't workin'," [...] etc. Knopfler asked for a pen to write some of these lines down and then eventually put those words to music.|$|E

2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing.</b> He walked into the living room to show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: [...] "For what I did I should be dead." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Isthmus of Tehuantepec is {{bounded by}} a {{northern}} and a southern coast, whereas the [...] "narrow neck" [...] {{described in the}} Book of Mormon {{is said to be}} surrounded by a west sea and an east sea (...) [...] Sorenson suggests that this is explained by understanding the manner in which ancient cultures label directions. He points out that the Israelites in Palestine defined their directions as though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> with their backs to the sea. The direction [...] "sea" [...] (seaward) denoted west while the direction [...] "fore" [...] (inland) denoted east. The direction south was denoted by [...] "right hand" [...] and the direction north by [...] "left hand." [...] In the case of Palestine, these directions correlated with the actual geography of the north-south coast [...] In the language used by the Maya, the word south meant [...] "on the right hand" [...] and north meant [...] "on the left" [...] One researcher suggested that ancient Maya directions were set 45 degrees different from our own. The Book of Mormon, however, leads us to ask how a colony of ancient Israelites would have coordinated directions outside Palestine. [...] It {{is important to note that}} Hebraic scholars disagree with Sorenson's generalized interpretation of Israelite coordinates. [...] Sorenson is correct in pointing out that the expression [...] "seaward" [...] in Palestine commonly means west. [...] "Sea" [...] or [...] "seaward" [...] in Hebrew can substitute for [...] "west" [...] when referring to the local Mediterranean Sea. Yehoshua (Joshua) 1:4 reads, [...] "…as far as the great sea [...] toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border." [...] However, Sorenson is incorrect in suggesting that Israelites outside of Palestine would have generally defined west standing with their backs to a sea. The Israelite coordinate system is based on the perceived movement of the heavenly quarters. [...] East is therefore defined not by facing inland from an arbitrary coast, but by standing before the general direction of the rising sun. (מִזְרָח, Shemot (Exodus) 27:13, Devarim (Deuteronomy) 3:27, Yehoshua (Joshua) 11:3, Tehillim (Psalms) 113:3) [...] Facing sunrise, [...] "before" [...] is the same as east, the [...] "right hand" [...] directs south, the [...] "left hand" [...] directs north and [...] "behind" [...] becomes west. (Yehoshua (Joshua) 12:3, Yo'el (Joel) 2:20) [...] "Place of sunset" [...] (מַעֲרָב) properly defines Israelite west outside of Palestine. (Tehillim (Psalms) 103:12, Yesha'yahu (Isaiah) 43:5) [...] There is in fact an instance in Hebrew scripture in which [...] "from the sea" [...] may be translated [...] "from the south", possibly referring to the Arabian Sea. (Tehillim (Psalms) 107:3). [...] See also Encyclopedia Judaica, MIZRAH; SUN.|$|E
