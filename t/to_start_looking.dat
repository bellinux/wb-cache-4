25|$|Jonsvatnet is {{the main}} water {{abstraction}} source for drinking water in Trondheim. As such there have since the 1960s been extensive restrictions on the lake, including bans on any motorized boats and bathing in the lake. However, there were contradictions in restrictions: domesticated cows were allowed to bathe, but not humans, and all motor boat activities were banned, although the lake acted as a water aerodrome. The city asked the club in 1999 <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for another site for a water aerodrome. The municipal council therefore withdrew the airport's concession in March 2003, effective {{at the end of}} the year. However, by August the decision had been reverted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). They gave a ten-year concession in 2005, but this was appealed by the municipality to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. During the public hearing, the Ministry of the Environment supported the municipality's stance, stating that the lake, as a recreational and nature area, should be shielded from use by seaplanes.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1995, reports {{surfaced}} that Sega would collaborate with Lockheed Martin, The 3DO Company, Matsushita, or Alliance Semiconductor {{to create a}} new graphics processing unit, which conflicting accounts said would be used for a 64-bit [...] "Saturn 2" [...] or an add-on peripheral. Development of the Dreamcast was wholly unrelated to this rumored project. In light of the Saturn's poor market performance, Irimajiri decided <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> outside of the company's internal hardware development division {{to create a new}} console. In 1997, Irimajiri enlisted the services of [...] IBM's Tatsuo Yamamoto to lead an 11-man team to work on a secret hardware project in the United States, which was referred to as [...] "Blackbelt". Accounts vary on how an internal team led by Hideki Sato also began development on Dreamcast hardware; one account specifies that Sega of Japan tasked both teams, while another suggests that Sato was bothered by Irimajiri's choice to begin development externally and chose to have his hardware team begin development. Sato and his group chose the Hitachi SH-4 processor architecture and the VideoLogic PowerVR2 graphics processor, manufactured by NEC, in the production of their mainboard. Initially known as [...] "Whitebelt", this project was later codenamed [...] "Dural", after the metallic female fighter from Sega's Virtua Fighter series.|$|E
500|$|The website Touch Arcade {{said that}} they loved the game, {{and that it was}} one of their {{favorite}} role-playing games on iOS. They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one's progress. Pocket Gamer, too, thought that things were not explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not even let players know where <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for point B. RPGFan echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. The British newspaper Metro found the game more entertaining than most role-playing games from its time. Gamezebo found the iOS version's touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while Pocket Gamer found the interface to work [...] "reasonably well" [...] while using the landscape mode, and RPGFan found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and Touch Arcade wished the game had been a [...] "universal app", so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.|$|E

500|$|Kohli was {{appointed}} the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh {{on the back}} of his fine performance in Australia. Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, [...] "Hats off to Virat Kohli for the way he played. We have <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> towards the future. The selection committee and the Board felt Kohli is future captaincy material." [...] Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119. He scored 108 in the opening match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory, while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66. In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time. His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara. Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "new Siberian metal", platinum, {{became known}} in Russia in 1819. Though {{it was first}} {{observed}} only as minor inclusions in rocks, richer deposits were discovered in the late 1824 which were mined beginning in 1825. These discoveries prompted Demidov <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for platinum around his Nizhny Tagil plants, where it was quickly found along the river beds. In late 1826, P. G. Sobolevsky (the father of powder metallurgy in Russia) invented a simple way of processing platinum that prompted the idea to use platinum in coins. The decree of 24 April 1828 noted that [...] "among the treasures of the Ural Mountains also occurs platinum, which priorly was located almost exclusively in South America. For easy sale of this precious metal, it is desirable to introduce it in coins" [...] and also described the design of new coins.|$|E
2500|$|Reed {{appeared}} on TV stating that [...] "Butch Reed is going <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> out for Butch Reed", which prompted the Junkyard Dog (JYD) {{to join him}} in the ring. After arguing back and forth, Reed attacked JYD and was soon joined in the attack by Ted Dibiase. On July 16, 1983, Butch Reed won the Mid-South North American Heavyweight Championship and proceeded to turn back JYD’s challenges in subsequent months. In October 1983, Reed’s arrogance made him agree to let the Mid-South fans pick a challenger for the North American title; he let them pick from the JYD, “Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan, newcomer Krusher Khruschev, and Magnum T.A.. The fans picked JYD but Reed dismissed the choice; he also said Duggan and Khruschev did not deserve a shot and instead gave the title shot to a very young and inexperienced T.A. As fate would have it, T.A. beat Reed to win the title, then lost it 12 days later to Nikolai Volkoff.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the club}} was first formed in 1882, the club played its matches on public land at the Park Lane end of Tottenham Marshes. As the ground was on public land, the club could not charge {{admission}} fees for spectators, and {{while the number of}} spectators grew to a few thousands within a few years, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch at Asplins Farm next to the railway line at Northumberland Park at a cost of £17 per annum, with the spectators charged 3d a game. [...] The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built on the ground for the 1894–95 season. Overcrowding at the ground however would become an issue; in 1898, during a match against Woolwich Arsenal attended by a record crowd of 15,000, the refreshment stand collapsed when fans climbed up onto its roof in the overcrowded ground, prompting the club <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for a new ground. In 1899, the club moved a short distance to a piece of land behind the White Hart pub, which would become the White Hart Lane ground.|$|E

2500|$|The Beatles {{made their}} first {{appearance}} at the club on 9 February 1961 after returning to Liverpool from Hamburg, Germany {{where they had been}} playing at the Indra and the Kaiserkeller clubs. Their stage show had been through a lot of changes with some in the audience thinking they were watching a German band as they were billed from Hamburg. From 1961 to 1963 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, with their last occurring on 3 August 1963, a month after the band recorded [...] "She Loves You" [...] and just six months before the Beatles' first trip to the U.S. [...] By this time [...] "Beatlemania" [...] was sprouting across England, and with girls demanding to see the Beatles and screaming just to get glimpse of them the group had to hide or sneak into concerts and the small club could no longer satisfy audience demand. After the Beatles' farewell gig on 3 August 1963, Bob Wooler gave their future dates to The Mastersounds, a local R & B band, led by Mal Jefferson. The Beatles had graduated from the club and had been signed to EMI's Parlophone label by producer George Martin. The amount of musical activity in Liverpool and Manchester caused record producers who had previously never ventured very far from London <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> to the north.|$|E
2500|$|George Stephanopoulos asked Obama on {{television}} in early January what kind of dog they would get, and when, {{saying that he was}} passing on a question from Obama's daughters who were sitting in the control room. Obama said, [...] "They seem to have narrowed it down to a labradoodle or a Portuguese water hound ... medium-sized dog, and so, we're now going <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> at shelters to see when one of those dogs might come up." [...] Much was made by the public and press about the family's search for a dog. On April 12, 2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy. The dog was reported to have visited the family some weeks earlier in a secret meeting to gauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as [...] "The Meeting". However, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved in at the White House on Tuesday, April 14, 2009. Immediately after he arrived, the family staged a photo op with Bo on the property's South Lawn. At the conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside the Oval Office, to which he responded: [...] "of course." [...] He also gave a nod to President Harry Truman's quote, [...] "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog." [...] The White House website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical details of Bo.|$|E
