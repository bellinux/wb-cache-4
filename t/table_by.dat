5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I <b>table</b> <b>by</b> 1918.

5|$|A strong {{start to}} the season saw Arsenal top the league <b>table</b> <b>by</b> September. Defeat against Sevilla in November ended a run of 28 matches undefeated {{and it was not}} until a month after did the team lose in the league for the first time, away at Middlesbrough. Arsenal {{extended}} their league lead to five points in February, but a career-threatening injury to Eduardo against Birmingham City coincided with the team going on a run of four draws in the Premier League. Manchester United soon overtook them in first and defeat to Chelsea in March moved Arsenal down in third place, where they remained {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles {{was joined}} by Christian Cage and Rhino in his feud with Kurt Angle, who {{was joined by}} Team 3D. Styles and Angle faced in a Lumberjack match on the June12 episode of Impact!, which Angle won. Team 3D then injured both Cage and Rhino in the narrative, with Rhino being knocked out on the June19 episode of Impact!, while on the June26 episode of Impact! Cage was slammed through a glass <b>table</b> <b>by</b> Brother Ray. Rhino {{returned}} from injury on the July3 episode of Impact!, challenging Team 3D and Angle to a Six Man Tag Team match at Victory Road, while teasing at adding Full Metal Mayhem rules to the bout. An online poll was held to determine the stipulation for the match, resulting in Full Metal Mayhem being chosen. The team of Angle and Team 3D were the victors at the event.|$|E
5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the <b>table.</b> <b>By</b> another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|Domestically, Benfica {{started the}} season with {{consecutive}} wins, rising {{to the top of}} the <b>table</b> <b>by</b> early October. After a home loss in the Clássico, the team's results became poorer, with three draws and two losses that caused the team to drop to third place by New Year. Benfica continued to slip in January, losing the Lisbon derby and twice dropping to fifth place. A home win against Sporting CP for the Portuguese Cup had an apparent positive effect on the players; their best period all season came as they regained first place and opened a six-point lead over the team in second place.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 6 January 1934, Chapman died at his home in Hendon. Arsenal were top of the <b>table</b> <b>by</b> the New Year, but their league form stuttered as a result of Chapman's {{unexpected}} death. Joe Shaw stood in as caretaker manager and continued Chapman's good work, as Arsenal won the 1933–34 First Division title. In May 1934, Arsenal appointed George Allison, beginning a successful thirteen-year spell as manager. The club retained the league title in 1934–35 and in the next season defeated Sheffield United in the 1936 FA Cup Final. Arsenal won another championship in 1937–38, their fifth in eight years, to reinforce their position as the dominant team of the 1930s. Britain's involvement in the Second World War meant the ordinary football calendar was abandoned. In {{the early part of the}} 1940s, Arsenal participated in various wartime competitions, still managed by Allison.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 2003, Arsenal {{opened up}} an eight-point lead {{at the top}} of the table, winning 2–0 against Charlton Athletic. The result was enough for Irish {{bookmaker}} Paddy Power to pay out on punters backing Arsenal to retain their lead, despite Manchester United having a game in hand. The gap was cut to two points after Arsenal suffered their first defeat in 2003, against Blackburn Rovers. By the time Arsenal played Everton on 23 March 2003, they were displaced {{at the top of}} the <b>table</b> <b>by</b> Manchester United. A goal by Vieira moved the team two points clear once more.|$|E
5|$|Peacetime {{football}} resumed in 1946–47, {{with the}} same fixture list as the abandoned 1939–40 season. York endured a midseason run of 10 defeats from 11 matches, before their form improved, and five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish in 15th place in the Third Division North. They were top of the <b>table</b> <b>by</b> mid September 1947, before a run of two wins from 13 matches saw them drop to 18th place. York finished 1947–48 in 13th place, and the club recorded a net profit of £4,914; a balance surplus of £1,843 was carried forward. In September 1948, York purchased their Bootham Crescent ground, which had been leased since 1932, for £4,075. They achieved their record average league attendance of 10,412 during 1948–49 {{at the peak of}} the post-war attendance boom. The team enjoyed a run of eight successive league wins at home spanning September 1948 to January 1949, but failed to win any of their last seven fixtures to finish 1948–49 in 14th place.|$|E

She appeared on stage to scout Test and Prince Albert. The next night on Raw, Stratus began her first {{role in the}} company, managing Test and Albert in the tag team T & A. It was during her stint managing T & A that Stratus took her first major bump in the ring, by being driven through a <b>table</b> <b>by</b> the Dudley Boyz at Backlash, after she had been taunting Bubba Ray Dudley for several weeks.

5|$|Team 3D {{fought the}} team of Christian Cage and Rhino in a New Jersey Street Fight at Hard Justice. This match was a break-off from the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle. After Team 3D, Cage, and Rhino became {{involved}} in the rivalry, Team 3D injured both Cage and Rhino in the narrative leading into Victory Road. Rhino was knocked out on the June19 episode of Impact!, while on the June26 episode of Impact! Cage was slammed through a glass <b>table</b> <b>by</b> Brother Ray. After the match at Victory Road and a Six Man Tag Team Elimination Tables match on Impact!, Team 3D cost Cage and Rhino a shot at the World Tag Team Championship on the July31 episode of Impact!. Afterwards, Cage challenged Team 3D to a New Jersey Street Fight at Hard Justice, which Team 3D accepted.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{encounter}} was a Six Sides of Steel Tables {{match between}} Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a <b>table</b> <b>by</b> the other. At {{one point during}} the contest, Hardy laid Raven on a table then ascended {{to the top of}} the cage. Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a front-flip towards Raven, who moved out of the way and caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a stack of four tables. Hardy then jumped off the top of the cage onto Raven in a seated position, forcing him through all the tables and winning the encounter.|$|E

5|$|The unbeaten run {{came to an}} end at Christmas, with {{back-to-back}} defeats in matches against West Bromwich Albion {{causing the}} club to fall to fourth place. The team commenced 1968 with a seven match unbeaten run, starting with consecutive 3–0 wins at Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United, and culminating in a 5–1 defeat of Fulham to go top of the table. The run {{came to an end}} with a defeat at Don Revie's Leeds United, which also meant City were overtaken {{at the top of the}} <b>table</b> <b>by</b> local rivals Manchester United. A visit to United's Old Trafford ground then followed. United took an early lead, but City rallied to win 3–1.|$|E
5|$|York {{appointed}} Aston Villa {{assistant manager}} John Ward in November 1991. Ward developed the team he inherited from Bird, and York were {{top of the}} <b>table</b> <b>by</b> December 1992. He left for Bristol Rovers in March 1993, and was succeeded by his assistant Alan Little. Two months later Little led York to promotion via the Third Division play-offs, with a penalty shoot-out victory over Crewe Alexandra in the final. In the 1993–94 season, York were beaten by Stockport County in the semi-final of the Second Division play-offs. York finished midtable the following season, but only avoided relegation in 1995–96 with a win {{on the final day}} of the season, although they knocked Manchester United out of the 1995–96 League Cup. In the following season's competition they eliminated Everton, but again narrowly avoided relegation that season. York's form continued to falter by the late 1990s, and Little was dismissed in March 1999 after a run of 10 matches without a win.|$|E
5|$|York started 2012–13 {{by winning}} five of 14 matches, and were ninth in the <b>table</b> <b>by</b> late October 2012. They dropped down {{the table in}} the {{following}} months, but were still in contention for a play-off place after beating Burton Albion 3–0 in the New Year. After this match, York failed to win 11 consecutive matches, and Mills was dismissed in March 2013 after a 2–0 home defeat to Bradford City. Under his replacement, former Northern Ireland manager Nigel Worthington, York avoided relegation by winning four of their last five matches. They finished their first League Two season in 17th place. York won only four of their first 23 matches of 2013–14, and were third {{from the bottom of the}} <b>table</b> <b>by</b> late December 2013. A number of influential signings in January 2014 helped York improve their form, and from early February they were unbeaten in 17 consecutive matches, conceding no goals from open play. York finished in seventh place and played Fleetwood Town in the play-off semi-final. After losing the first leg 1–0 at home, York drew 0–0 at Highbury Stadium in the second leg. Worthington resigned as manager in October 2014 after York won only one of their opening 14 matches of 2014–15. He was succeeded by former Scunthorpe United manager Russ Wilcox. York remained in the lower reaches of the table. They avoided relegation with a late-season run of four wins from five matches, finishing the season in 18th place.|$|E
