5|$|Infinity Ward {{spent a lot}} of time on WWII battlefields, {{which led}} them to scrap whole levels for parts of the game that took place in France, since they found the {{location}} a lot different <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> imagined.|$|E
5|$|Other themes include {{chance and}} coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E

5|$|As Typhoon Tingting {{approached}} the Mariana Islands, three Chinese women drowned in rough seas {{produced by the}} storm in Saipan. On June28, Tingting produced strong winds throughout the region. Sustained winds on Guam reached 82km/h (51mph) with gusts to 106km/h (66mph); a pressure of 994.6hPa (mbar) was also recorded on the island. Although located closer {{to the center of}} Tingting, Rota reported lower winds than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70km/h (44mph) with gusts of 93km/h (58mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained winds recorded were suspected to be lower <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> really were. Winds of 56km/h (35mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84km/h (52mph). Sustained winds on Saipan were recorded up to 100km/h (62mph) with gusts to 124km/h (77mph); a pressure of 984.9hPa (mbar) was also recorded. The highest winds during Typhoon Tingting throughout the Mariana Islands were measured on Pagan Island where 106km/h (66mph) sustained winds were recorded along with a gust of 212km/h (132mph).|$|E
5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was supposed to do (rather <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipal}} council voted on 17 February 2011 {{to purchase the}} stadium. The strongest proponents were the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, while three parties, the Progress Party, the Liberal Party and Red Party, voted against. The proponents argued that municipality was purchasing the venue with a much higher value <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had sold, while the opponents {{argued that it was}} not the municipality's responsibility to give financial first-aid to a professional sports club. The cost was NOK16 million, paid for by taking over debt. After taking over the stadium company, the municipality merged it with Bodø Spektrum, which runs an indoor sports complex, including Nordlandshallen. This allows the debt to be taken over by the municipality without interfering with the municipal accounts.|$|E

25|$|Arctic regions notably release {{more heat}} back into space <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> absorb, {{effectively}} cooling the Earth. This {{has been a}} concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers won the AFC Central with a 12–4 {{regular season}} record (including 8–0 at home), and {{advanced}} to their second consecutive Super Bowl and their fourth {{appearance in the}} last six seasons. Pittsburgh appeared to be even better <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were in their three previous Super Bowl victories. leading the league with 6,258 yards in total offense, an average of 391 yards per game and just 31 yards short of an NFL record. The team also led the league in scoring with 412 points.|$|E
25|$|The play is also full of {{constraint}} imagery. Hamlet describes Denmark as a prison, {{and himself}} as {{being caught in}} birdlime. He mocks the ability of man to bring about his own ends, and points out that some divine force molds men's aims into something other <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> intend. Other characters also speak of constraint, such as Polonius, who orders his daughter to lock herself from Hamlet's pursuit, and describes her as being tethered. This adds to the play's description of Hamlet's inability to act out his revenge.|$|E

25|$|Between 1991 and 1994, a {{somewhat}} controversial and odd design of jersey was employed, where the chevron that St Helens had now adopted {{in place of}} the traditional V finished three—quarters of the way down the shirt. Umbro remained the clubs kit suppliers until 1994, when Stag took over. Their jerseys were far more lightweight <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had replaced, and they chose to revert to a more conventional fashion of red V in their designs. The kit used first by the club was reverted to during their centenary year in 1995.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} {{of a new}} life means changing and adapting. Beginning freshmen enter a new phase that affects the way they eat. They are unaware of their nutrition and they only want something from what they see. High school {{is very different from}} what college is. Students transition from being in small classroom into big lecture rooms. The same goes for food, they transition from being served in cafeterias to buffet styles in college. Dining centers excite new students because this is a new experience, therefore they grab more <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.|$|E
50|$|One {{study found}} that the {{relationship}} between exposure to sexual contact in the media and increased sexual activity among adolescents is more pronounced in white youths than black youths. Black teens {{are more likely to be}} influenced by their friends' sexual experiences and their parents' expectations <b>than</b> by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see in the media.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps she {{was partly}} right; but after all, little people cannot judge {{what is right}} in matters of familiarity.

25|$|After a {{collectable}} {{has been}} purchased, its retail price no longer applies and its value {{is linked to}} {{what is called the}} secondary market. There is no secondary market for an item unless someone is willing to buy it, and an object's value is whatever the buyer is willing to pay. Depending on age, condition, supply, demand, and other factors, individuals, auctioneers, and secondary retailers may sell a collectable for either more or less <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> originally paid for it. A price guide is a resource such as a book or website that lists typical selling prices.|$|E
25|$|Test matches (matches of Test cricket) in the 19th {{century were}} {{somewhat}} different affairs <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are today. Many {{of them were}} not designated as Test matches for many years afterwards, {{and it is possible}} that some Test players never knew they had played in a Test. Before 1888 there had been 26 Test matches, all between England and Australia. England had won 13 of them, Australia 9, with 4 draws. During the 19th century England played in all the Tests, which were mostly against Australia, though a few were against what tended to be a very weak South African XI.|$|E
25|$|Interventions include {{supporting}} {{foster parents}} {{to learn to}} help the child in regulating emotions, to learn to respond effectively to the child's distress and to understand the child's signals, especially 'miscues' as the signals of such children are often confusing {{as a consequence of}} their often frightening, inconsistent and confusing past relationships. Foster carers are taught to recognize what such children actually need rather <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> may appear to signal that they need. Such children often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers. Withdrawn children may be overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate children may be considered to be managing much better than they are. Foster carers are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.|$|E
