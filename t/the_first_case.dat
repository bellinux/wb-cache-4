5|$|In 2012, {{a report}} was {{published}} stating <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of CCD, according to more stringent definitions, occurring {{outside of the}} US was in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015, it was {{discovered}} that Knut died of Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> discovered in non human animals.|$|E
5|$|In December 1923, the {{southern}} apse {{of the cathedral}} collapsed. It was restored under Toros Toramanian's supervision in what was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of restoration of an architectural monument in Soviet Armenia.|$|E
50|$|May 31: Third <b>case</b> confirmed. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>case's</b> {{mother was}} <b>the</b> {{infected}} person.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> {{of grass}} {{sickness}} {{were recorded in}} eastern Scotland in 1909.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> were {{confirmed}} on 27 April in passengers returning from Mexico.|$|R
5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} {{a family with}} a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E
5|$|During routine {{maintenance}} work at Karori Sanctuary in late 2008, a tuatara nest was uncovered, with a hatchling found the following autumn. This {{is thought to}} be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of tuatara successfully breeding in the wild on the New Zealand mainland in over 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> were {{confirmed}} on 7 May in the Saskatoon and Regina areas.|$|R
50|$|It was in {{the parish}} that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> of <b>The</b> Plague {{occurred}} in 1665.|$|R

5|$|In 1840 {{he wrote}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> report {{by a black}} doctor, which his {{associate}} John Watson read {{at a meeting of}} the New York Medical and Surgical Society. (It acknowledged Smith was qualified, but would not admit him because of racial discrimination.) Soon after, Smith published an article in the New York Journal of Medicine, the first by a black doctor in the US.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry systems {{involving}} {{only two}} species {{are known as}} bipolar. Only one bipolar arrangement is possible here: that's where the dupe is itself the model. There are two such variants on this arrangement of mimic imitating its target, in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> termed Batesian-Wallacian mimicry after Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, the model is the prey species. In the second case, the model {{is the host of}} a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 2010 President Yanukovych sacked two {{deputy prime}} ministers (Viktor Slauta and Volodymyr Sivkovich). The sackings were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> when Yanukovych used the powers granted {{to him by}} this month's {{constitutional}} court ruling when 2004 constitutional amendments were overturned.|$|E
50|$|She is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{person to}} die from the virus here since <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> emerged {{in this country in}} May.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> outside Greece were {{performed}} in 2003. In September 2003, Marguerite McDonald became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> person in North America to perform Epi-LASIK.|$|R
50|$|Deborah Asnis, 59, American {{infectious}} disease specialist, discovered <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> of West Nile virus in the United States, breast cancer.|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> {{description}} of pituitary apoplexy has {{been attributed to}} the American neurologist Pearce Bailey in 1898. This was followed in 1905 by a further report from the German physician Bleibtreu. Surgery for pituitary apoplexy was described in 1925. Before the introduction of steroid replacement, the mortality from pituitary apoplexy approximated 50%.|$|E
5|$|The pinnae have {{an effect}} on facial appearance. In Western societies, {{protruding}} ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, particularly if asymmetric. The first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> report in 1881.|$|E
5000|$|David Ho was a {{resident}} at Cedars-Sinai when he encountered some of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> {{of what was}} later labeled AIDS.|$|R
50|$|The Antonio Vilas Boas case (1957) and the Hill {{abduction}} (1961) were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> of UFO abduction to earn widespread attention.|$|R

5|$|After the war, courts-martial were convened to {{investigate}} possible war crimes {{by members of}} the division. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> dubbed the Biscari massacre, American troops from C Company, 180th Infantry Regiment, were alleged to have shot 74 Italian and two German prisoners in Acate in July 1943 following the capture of an airfield in the area. Lieutenant General George Patton, the Seventh Army commander, asked Major General Omar Bradley, commanding II Corps, to get the case dismissed to prevent bad press, but Bradley refused. A non-commissioned officer later confessed to the crimes and was found guilty, but an officer who claimed he had only been following orders was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Following the restoration, William Bruce was {{appointed}} Clerk to the Bills in 1660, and Clerk of Supply to the Lords in Council in 1665. Both were lucrative positions, involving collection of fees, from Parliament in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> and from petitioners to the Court of Session in the latter. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Moray had {{established himself as}} a courtier and scientist at Whitehall, London, and employed Bruce as a trusted messenger between Whitehall and the Duke of Lauderdale, Secretary for Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, fashion {{designer}} Dawn Simorangkir brought a libel suit against Love concerning a defamatory post Love made on her Twitter account, which was settled for $450,000. Six years later, Simorangkir filed another lawsuit against Love for further defamatory Twitter posts, and Love paid a further $350,000 in recompense. A similar suit was brought against Love by her former attorney Rhonda Holmes in 2014, who also accused Love of online defamation, seeking $8 million in damages. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of alleged Twitter-based libel in U.S. history {{to make it}} to trial. The jury, however, found in Love's favor.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> {{acetic acid}} reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one {{of the main}} components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June {{the court}} acquitted nine medics and {{downgraded}} sentences against nine others. Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did not appeal their sentences of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>case</b> involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the verdict is final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they could still be pardoned by the king.|$|E
50|$|This {{case was}} {{important}} because {{it was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> in Illinois to challenge the patriarchal system and assert the rights of women.|$|R
