5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> whites only and another section for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E
5|$|This is an {{apparently}} rare example of Western Australian swan symbolism being transferred eastward, then transformed to symbolise something else, retaining only {{an echo of}} its formerly symbolic values. None of the current AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria - now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales. It is an ironic transformation in the symbolism of a bird that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> so long thought to be non-migratory.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, {{in order}} to strike the British-controlled oil {{refineries}} at Manama in the Persian Gulf, these SM82s bombers undertook a flight of 4,200km (2,610mi), lasting 15 hours at 270km/h (170mph), <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> the time arguably a record for a bombing mission. Each aircraft carried a load of 1,500kg (3,310lb). This long-range action was successful, taking the target totally by surprise, and the SM.82s landed without problems at Zula, Eritrea. The Italian airplanes started their flight from Europe, attacked refineries in Asia and landed back in Africa (Italian Eritrea).|$|E

25|$|The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had {{ushered in}} a period known as Prohibition, during which the manufacture, distribution, and sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages was illegal. Passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 was the crowning achievement of the temperance movement, but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime rates soared under Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago's Al Capone, became rich from a profitable, often violent black market for alcohol. The federal government was incapable of stemming the tide: enforcement of the Volstead Act {{proved to be a}} nearly impossible task and corruption was rife among law enforcement agencies. In 1932, wealthy industrialist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. stated in a letter: As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had been used up until that time; and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either beholden to or simply fearful of the temperance lobby. For that reason, when Congress formally proposed the repeal of Prohibition on February 20, 1933 (with the requisite two-thirds having voted in favor in each house; 63 to 21 in the United States Senate and 289 to 121 in the United States House of Representatives), it chose the second ratification method established by Article V, that being via state conventions. The Twenty-first Amendment is the only constitutional amendment ratified by state conventions rather than by the state legislatures.|$|E

The final two episodes would have been The Blood Line up until the thirteenth episode in where the Blessing would have started to kill people in Shanghai and Buenos Aires resulting in the Blessing sites having to be blown up and destroyed.|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, Thompson sent {{a letter}} to several {{politicians}} urging them to investigate The Sims 2, alleging that the game contained nudity accessible by entering special codes. Thompson called the nudity inappropriate for a game rated [...] "T" [...] for Teen, a rating which indicates suitability for anyone 13 and older. Manufacturer Electronic Arts dismissed the allegations, with vice president Jeff Brown explaining that game characters have [...] "no anatomical detail" [...] under their clothes, effectively resembling Barbie dolls. Although the game does display blurred-out patches over body regions when characters are naked, such as when taking a shower, Brown said <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> [...] "humorous effect" [...] and denied there was anything improper about the game. Nevertheless, a command that could be entered into the in-game console in order to disable the blur effect was removed from the game in an expansion. No official reason was given for the change.|$|E
500|$|Originally, SR410 {{passed through}} {{downtown}} Puyallup and Sumner, following several surface streets (including Main Avenue in Puyallup and Traffic Avenue and Main Street in Sumner) {{across the two}} cities. In the late 1960s, construction began on a limited-access bypass of the two city centers. SR410 was moved onto the new freeway by 1972. In 1973, SR410 was shortened to its current length after SR167 was extended to Tacoma. On October11, 2009, a massive landslide buried about [...] of SR410 west of Naches in the Nile Valley. The landslide also blocked off the Naches River and caused warnings of severe flooding. A detour was set up on Nile Road <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> residential use only until October20. SR410 was permanently rerouted onto Nile Road sometime afterward, and the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) completed paving on the new segment of SR410 on November20.
