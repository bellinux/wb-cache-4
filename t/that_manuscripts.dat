5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
500|$|Henry Adams Bellows {{proposes a}} {{relationship}} between Eir and the place name Lyfjaberg, which he translates as [...] "hill of healing". Bellows notes <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> vary about the spelling of the place name, and that he, like others, has followed 19th-century scholar Sophus Bugge's choice. Bellows states that the stanza mentioning Lyfjaberg [...] "implies that Mengloth is a goddess of healing, and hence, perhaps an hypostasis of Frigg, as already intimated by her name [...] In stanza 54, Eir appears as one of Mengloth's handmaidens, and Eir, according to Snorri (Gylfaginning, 35) is herself the Norse Hygeia. Compare this stanza to stanza 32." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} reasons for these inaccuracies. Some {{are due to}} errors in the copying of manuscripts (before the age of printing) or {{mistakes}} by typesetters of later editions. Others are due to conscious attempts to [...] "correct" [...] the text, and yet others to Christian censorship (in countries under its control). In addition, Maimonides himself frequently edited the text of his own autograph copy, such <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> copied from his own book did not preserve his later corrections. Thus the received version {{may not be the}} text that Maimonides intended us to read.|$|E

60|$|The {{short stories}} were {{returned}} in similar fashion. He read {{them over and}} over, and liked them {{so much that he}} could not puzzle out the cause of their rejection, until, one day, he read in a newspaper <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> should always be typewritten. That explained it. Of course editors were so busy that they could not afford the time and strain of reading handwriting. Martin rented a typewriter and spent a day mastering the machine. Each day he typed what he composed, and he typed his earlier manuscripts as fast as they were returned him. He was surprised when the typed ones began to come back. His jaw seemed to become squarer, his chin more aggressive, and he bundled the manuscripts off to new editors.|$|E
60|$|Arrived in Oakland, {{with his}} snug pay-day in his pocket, {{he took up}} his old room at Bernard Higginbotham's and set to work. He did not even let Ruth know he was back. He would go and see her when he {{finished}} the article on the treasure-hunters. It was not so difficult to abstain from seeing her, because of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in him. Besides, the very article he was writing would bring her nearer to him. He {{did not know how}} long an article he should write, but he counted the words in a double-page article in the Sunday supplement of the San Francisco Examiner, and guided himself by that. Three days, at white heat, completed his narrative; but when he had copied it carefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read, he learned from a rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation marks. He had never thought of such things before; and he promptly set to work writing the article over, referring continually to the pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the average schoolboy in a year. When he had copied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully, he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners, and discovered the iron law <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> should never be rolled and that they should be written {{on one side of the}} paper. He had violated the law on both counts. Also, he learned from the item that first-class papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column. So, while he copied the manuscript a third time, he consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars. The product was always the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was better than seafaring. If it hadn't been for his blunders, he would have finished the article in three days. One hundred dollars in three days! It would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount. A man was a fool to go to sea when he could write, he concluded, though the money in itself meant nothing to him. Its value was in the liberty it would get him, the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer, swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and given him inspiration.|$|E

50|$|It {{is quite}} {{unlikely}} <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> {{had been brought}} to Ireland between 350 and 450, to bring about a much later literary renaissance. The small ecclesiastical schools almost everywhere preserved elementary teaching, reading and writing. Irish scholarship went far beyond that.|$|E
50|$|In the Early Middle Ages, monastery {{libraries}} developed, such as {{the important}} one at the Abbey of Montecassino in Italy.

50|$|It is {{commonly}} believed <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> {{are more often}} rejected at high impact journals. However, in a random selection of 570 journals {{there was no such}} correlation. However, specific disciplines may have weak correlations, e.g. in the physical sciences there is even a negative correlation.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} the Metamorphoses {{enduring}} popularity from its first publication (around the time of Ovids exile in 8 AD) no manuscript survives from antiquity. From the 9th and 10th centuries there are only fragments of the poem; it is only from the 11th century onwards <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts,</b> of varying value, have been passed down.|$|E
50|$|Mahayana Buddhist Pure Land sūtras {{were brought}} from the Gandhara region to China as early as 147 CE, when the Kushan bhikkhu Lokakṣema began {{translating}} the first Buddhist sūtras into Chinese. The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from Gāndhārī. It is also known <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> in the Kharoṣṭhī script existed in China during this period.|$|E
50|$|Finally, it may {{be added}} <b>that</b> <b>Manuscript</b> 820 in Oppenheimer's {{collection}} {{was supposed to be}} a Biblical commentary by the author of the Sefer ha-Niẓẓaḥon, but Dukes (Orient, Lit. xi.299) declares that it is nothing else than the Niẓẓaḥon itself.|$|R

30|$|The main {{aim of this}} short-note is {{point out}} that certain {{hypotheses}} assumed on some results in the very recent paper (Yang in J. Inequal. Appl. 2014 : 275, 2014) are unnecessary, and the results contained in <b>that</b> <b>manuscript</b> can easily be improved.|$|R
50|$|During the Middle Ages, {{interest}} in Livy declined because Western scholars were {{more focused on}} religious texts. Due {{to the length of}} the work, the literate class was already reading summaries rather than the work itself, which was tedious to copy, expensive, and required a lot of storage space. It must have been during this period, if not before, <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> began to be lost without replacement.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} layout of music resembles <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> Christ Church MSS 984-8 (The Dow Partbooks) and British Museum Add. 22597. This {{might have been}} a conscious decision on Merro's part to acknowledge the music's historic nature by maintaining the appearance of an archaic manuscript. In the cantus partbook (Drexel 4180), this archaic style can be seen on folios 1-16v, 18v-38v, 40-43, 54v-57 and 64v-68. To Monson this represents the oldest layer of the partbooks.|$|E

Sir, you are not aware of the loss which the world has sustained. Would to heaven I had arrived sooner!".|$|E
50|$|The regular use of {{molecular}} biology methods in work published in Journal of Endocrinology, {{as well as}} its molecular-focused sister journal, often resulted in a blurred line between the subject areas covered. Consequently, in 2011 it was decided by the Publications Committee of the Society for Endocrinology that the two journals would have a single joint editorial board. This came into being at the start of 2012. While papers would still be submitted to one or other of the journals, the senior editors would have the opportunity to suggest <b>that</b> <b>manuscripts</b> be transferred between publications.|$|E
