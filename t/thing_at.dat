5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

25|$|Anglo-Irish {{eccentric}} Desmond Leslie {{struck up}} a correspondence with Adamski. In the mid-1950s Leslie had created a low-budget UFO film entitled Them And The <b>Thing</b> <b>at</b> his home, Castle Leslie. The flying saucer in the film had been created by shining mirrors on to a Spanish Renaissance shield suspended from a fishing line. The film was rediscovered in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} of Annie Wheaton {{is similar to}} another Stephen King character, Carrie White—the main character from Stephen King's first published novel, Carrie. As a young girl, Carrie telekinetically dropped stones on her house, and Annie does the same <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> both {{the beginning and end}} of Rose Red. Likewise, the epilogue of Carrie contains a brief appearance of a young girl named Annie who, it appears, has the same powers as Carrie.|$|E
25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of {{it as a kind of}} thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing (because it isn't a particular <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> all).|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2012-13 school year, the {{elementary}} schools were realigned to serve grades kindergarten through 6th.

25|$|Mortdecai is a 2015 American action comedy film {{directed}} by David Koepp and written by Eric Aronson.

It stars Johnny Depp {{in the title role}} and also features Gwyneth Paltrow, Ewan McGregor, Olivia Munn, Paul Bettany and Jeff Goldblum. Released by Lionsgate on January 23, 2015, Mortdecai was a box office bomb, grossing $47 million against its $60 million budget, and received overwhelmingly negative reviews.|$|E

25|$|Palmerston {{was a great}} orator. His {{language}} was relatively unstudied and his delivery somewhat embarrassed, but he generally found words to say the right <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> {{the right time and}} to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to the capacity and the temper of his audience. An attempt was made by the Duke of Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused to do so without Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey, two notable Whigs. This can be said to be the point in 1830, when his party allegiance changed.|$|E
25|$|The game also {{features}} an infection system, which determines {{whether or not}} an NPC is infected by the Thing. Although most NPCs are scripted to transform into a <b>Thing</b> <b>at</b> specific points in the game, {{they can also be}} infected at any time prior to this. When the team comes under attack by enemies, the possibility of infection is based upon a probability system whereby any teammate who comes into direct contact with an enemy can be infected. Although infection does not alter their immediate behavior, it will result in them turning into a walker-Thing after a set period of time, at which point they will attack the team.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Vanbrugh took a {{succession}} of leading roles in the West End, beginning with The Spirit of Culture in Barrie's war play Der Tag (1914). Following this, she played Lady Falkland in The Right to Kill (1915); the title role in Caroline (1916); Mrs Lytton in The Riddle (1916); Emily Ladew in Her Husband's Wife (1916); Leonora in Barrie's Seven Women (1917); and the title role in A. A. Milne's Belinda (1918). In 1916, she appeared in her first film, The Real <b>Thing</b> <b>at</b> Last (1916); the following year she made a silent film version of The Gay Lord Quex, as Sophy Fullgarney.|$|E

25|$|After A Love Supreme was recorded, Ayler's style {{became more}} {{prominent}} in Coltrane's music. A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet {{in the first}} half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, utilization of overtones, and playing in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings The John Coltrane Quartet Plays, Living Space, Transition, New <b>Thing</b> <b>at</b> Newport, Sun Ship, and First Meditations.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have been}} using his diary to gain greater insight and {{understanding}} of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances, {{the time he got}} up in the morning, the weather, and what he ate. He talked at length about his new watch (which had an alarm, a new <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> the time) which he was very proud of, a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he felt that it was too crowded, and his cat waking him up at one in the morning. Pepys's diary is one of the only known sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper middle class man during the seventeenth century.|$|E
