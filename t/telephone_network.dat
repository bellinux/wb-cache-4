5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched <b>telephone</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a <b>telephone</b> <b>network,</b> {{the caller}} is {{connected}} to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E

5|$|Most {{parts of}} the {{fortress}} were finished during the First World War, and many minor works were started and completed {{during the course of}} the war. Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War, the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress. Finland's independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia's successor state, the Soviet Union, which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden, put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question. Only the most basic needs were satisfied during the interwar period; even apparent needsbased on the experiences from the warsuch as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.|$|E
5|$|Pressure from an {{increasing}} population {{led to the}} town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875–1880; and Sale {{was connected to the}} <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> in 1888. As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale. The town's first swimming baths were built in 1914, and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War. The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush of marriages, which highlighted a shortage of housing. The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing, and rented it to the local population at below market rates. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sale had 594council houses. The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war. additional private housing development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.|$|E

25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange is a telecommunications system {{used in the}} public switched <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> or in large enterprises.
