One hundred and thirteen college freshmen, both males and females, were tested using the Bod Pod® by first measuring <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> with the Bod Pod® technique, then by using pre-determined values based on height, weight, and age that predict <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume.</b> Results of a paired t test showed that measured <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> and predicted <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> were significantly different.

A Bland and Altman plot was used to reveal any variability about the mean for individual participants MTGV and PTGV and the averages of each. A Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated for the data in the Bland and Altman plot. The correlation was calculated as. 56, which is significant at the p ≤. 001 level.

40|$|Objective: <b>Thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> {{compression}} (TGC) has {{a negative}} effect on expiratory flow. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), TGC is high. Bronchodilators may affect <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> compression by reducing airway resistance and improve maximal expiratory flow. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of long-acting bronchodilators (formoterol 12 μg and tiotropium 18 μg) on <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> compression, forced expiratory volumes measured at the mouth and in a plethysmograph in patients with COPD. Material and Method: Bronchodilator response to formoterol and tiotropium was assessed in 40 COPD patients using maximum expiratory flow-volume curve values measured at the mouth (m) and plethysmograph (p). Volume of compression (V Comp= ΔV lung - ΔV mouth) was obtained. Results: The repeated measurements were performed at baseline, 30., 60. and 120. minutes. Formoterol and tiotropium had significant bronchodilator effects, and formoterol produced a higher increase in FEV 1 m (p< 0, 001) compared to tiotropium. <b>Thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> compression <b>volumes</b> did not change significantly after either long-acting bronchodilator administration in patients with COPD. With regard to <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> compression <b>volume</b> at 25, 50 and 75 % of VC (Vcomp 25, Vcomp 50, Vcomp 75, no relevant difference was found between the two drugs. The <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> compression <b>volumes</b> did not differ between stage II–III and stage IV COPD patients. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> compression <b>volume</b> did not change significantly after administration of long-acting bronchodilators, even if both study drugs elicited significant bronchodilation in spirometric measurements, and the disease severity did not influence the effect of the long acting bronchodilator agents on <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> compression <b>volumes...</b>|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether subject positioning would affect the measurement of raw body volume, <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume,</b> corrected body volume and the resulting percent body fat as assessed by air displacement plethysmography (ADP). METHODS: Twenty-five young adult men (20. 7 ± 1. 1 y, BMI =  22. 5 ± 1. 4 kg/m(2)) were measured using the BOD POD® system using a measured <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> sitting in a 'forward bent' position and sitting up in a straight position in random order. RESULTS: Raw body volume was 58 ± 124 ml (p< 0. 05) higher in the 'straight' position compared to the 'bent' position. The mean difference in measured <b>thoracic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> (bent-straight = - 71 ± 211 ml) was not statistically significant. Corrected body volume and percent body fat in the bent position consequently were on average 86 ± 122 ml (p< 0. 05) and 0. 5 ± 0. 7 % (p< 0. 05) lower than in the straight position respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the differences reached statistical significance, absolute differences are rather small. Subject positioning should be viewed as a factor that may contribute to between-test variability and hence contribute to (in) precision in detecting small individual changes in body composition, rather than a potential source of systematic bias. It therefore may be advisable to pay attention to standardizing subject positioning when tracking small changes in PF are of interest. The cause of the differences is shown not to be related to changes in the volume of isothermal air in the lungs. It is hypothesized and calculated that the observed direction and magnitude of these differences may arise from the surface area artifact which does not take into account that a subject in the bent position exposes more skin to the air in the device therefore potentially creating a larger underestimation of the actual body volume due to the isothermal effect of air close to the skin...|$|E

FEV 1 was simultaneously measured by spirometry and body plethysmography (FEV 1 -pl) in 47 subjects with dominant emphysema and 51 with dominant chronic bronchitis. Subjects with dominant emphysema had larger lung volumes, lower diffusion capacity, and lower FEV 1 than those with dominant chronic bronchitis. However, FEV 1 -pl, patient-centered variables (dyspnea, quality of life, exercise tolerance, exacerbation frequency), arterial blood gases, and respiratory impedance were not significantly different between groups. Using FEV 1 -pl instead of FEV 1 shifted severity distribution toward less severe classes in dominant emphysema more than chronic bronchitis. The body mass, obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise (BODE) index was significantly higher in dominant emphysema than chronic bronchitis, but this difference significantly decreased when FEV 1 -pl was substituted for FEV 1.
