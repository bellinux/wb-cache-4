5|$|Rite of Memphis-Misraïm Proceeding from Cagliostro's rite, <b>the</b> <b>Rite</b> of Misraïm (from Arabic مصر Miṣr = Egypt) {{continued}} {{as a form}} of mixed, esoteric masonry. Banned in 1817, it was reformulated as <b>the</b> <b>Rite</b> of Memphis in 1838, and in spite of fluctuating fortunes in its French home, began to spread internationally {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. During the 1880s the two rites were fused by Giuseppe Garibaldi into <b>the</b> <b>Rite</b> of Memphis-Misraïm. The modern order now boasts up to 99 degrees, not all of which actually worked.|$|E

5|$|As of 2013 {{there were}} well over 100 {{different}} recordings of <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> commercially available, {{and many more}} held in library sound archives. It {{has become one of}} the most recorded of all 20th century musical works.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of liturgy in the Catholic Church. Even putting aside <b>the</b> many Eastern <b>rites</b> in use, <b>the</b> Latin liturgical <b>rites</b> alone include <b>the</b> Ambrosian <b>Rite,</b> <b>the</b> Mozarabic <b>Rite,</b> and <b>the</b> Cistercian <b>Rite,</b> {{as well as other}} forms that have been largely {{abandoned}} in favour of adopting <b>the</b> Roman <b>Rite.</b>|$|R

5|$|Before {{the first}} {{gramophone}} disc recordings of <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> were issued in 1929, Stravinsky {{had helped to}} produce a pianola version of the work for the Aeolian Company. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French player piano company Pleyel, with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium. The Pleyel version of <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> of Spring was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Ravel {{composed}} little during 1913. He {{collaborated with}} Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky's unfinished opera Khovanshchina, {{and his own}} works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier. In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> of Spring. Stravinsky later said that Ravel {{was the only person}} who immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of <b>the</b> <b>Rite</b> would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande.|$|E
5|$|The 1929 {{score as}} revised in 1948 {{forms the basis}} of most modern {{performances}} of <b>The</b> <b>Rite.</b> Boosey and Hawkes reissued their 1948 edition in 1965, and produced a newly engraved edition (B 19441) in 1967. The firm also issued an unmodified reprint of the 1913 piano reduction in 1952 (B 17271) and a revised piano version, incorporating the 1929 revisions, in 1967.|$|E

25|$|The Duchy and {{eventually}} Principality of Benevento in southern Italy developed a unique Christian <b>rite</b> in <b>the</b> 7th and 8th centuries. <b>The</b> Beneventan <b>rite</b> is {{more closely related}} to the liturgy of <b>the</b> Ambrosian <b>rite</b> than to <b>the</b> Roman <b>rite.</b> <b>The</b> Beneventan <b>rite</b> has not survived in its complete form, although most of the principal feasts and several feasts of local significance are extant. <b>The</b> Beneventan <b>rite</b> appears to have been less complete, less systematic, and more liturgically flexible than <b>the</b> Roman <b>rite.</b>|$|R

5|$|Washington {{frequently}} accompanied {{his wife}} to church services. Third-hand reports say that he took communion, although he is usually characterized as never or rarely participating in <b>the</b> <b>rite.</b> He would regularly leave services before communion with the other non-communicants (as was the custom of the day). He ceased attending at all on communion Sundays after being admonished by a rector.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, <b>the</b> <b>rite</b> by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric. They asked for a conservative seminary to complete their studies. After directing them to the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, Lefebvre was urged to teach these seminarians personally. In 1969, he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students, moving to Écône, Switzerland in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Holding such {{conservative}} views, Saint-Saëns was out {{of sympathy}} – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty. It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky's ballet <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> of Spring in 1913. In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Dominican <b>Rite</b> is <b>the</b> unique <b>rite</b> of <b>the</b> Dominican Order of the Roman Catholic Church.

5|$|It is {{essential}} that Shraddha be performed by the sonusually the eldestor male relative of the paternal branch of the family, limited to the preceding three generations. However, on Sarvapitri amavasya or matamaha, the daughter's son can offer Shraddha for the maternal side of his family if a male heir is absent in his mother's family. Some castes only perform the shraddha for one generation. Prior to performing <b>the</b> <b>rite,</b> the male should have experienced a sacred thread ceremony. Since the ceremony is considered inauspicious due to its association with death, the royal family of Kutch, the king or heirs of the throne are prohibited from conducting Shraddha.|$|E
5|$|Sarvapitri amavasya (all ancestors' {{new moon}} day) is {{intended}} for all ancestors, irrespective of the lunar day they died. It {{is the most important}} day of the Pitru Paksha. Those who have forgotten to perform shraddha can do so on this day. A shraddha ritual performed on this day is considered as fruitful as one conducted in the holy city of Gaya, which is seen as a special place to perform <b>the</b> <b>rite,</b> and hosts a fair during the Pitru Paksha period.|$|E
5|$|Several modern {{organizations}} {{of various sizes}} claim to follow the tenets of Thelema. The two most prominent are both organizations that Crowley headed during his lifetime: the A∴A∴, an Order founded by Crowley, based on the grades of the Golden Dawn system; and Ordo Templi Orientis, an order which initially developed from <b>the</b> <b>Rite</b> of Memphis and Mizraim {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, and which includes Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica as its religious arm.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The |Gui and {Gana, Kalahari hunter-gatherers, {{practice}} certain rites ev-ery {{time one}} passes critical phases in their life, or when something unfortunate happens. Because <b>the</b> <b>rites</b> are {{a kind of}} curing, they use traditional medicine in <b>the</b> <b>rites.</b> <b>The</b> medicines are composed of plants and substances from human bodies. Comparison with <b>the</b> <b>rites</b> performed by <b>the</b> Kgalagadi, neighboring agropastoral people, reveals that, the |Gui/{Gana consider bodily substances to be more important than medical plants. The |Gui/{Gana think that all bodily substances stem from one identical power and people exchange the power through these rites...|$|R

5|$|The exact date of Stephen's {{coronation}} is unknown. According {{to later}} Hungarian tradition, he was crowned {{on the first}} day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001. Details of Stephen's coronation preserved in his Greater Legend suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or Székesfehérvár followed <b>the</b> <b>rite</b> of the coronation of the German kings. Accordingly, Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony. Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E

50|$|There are {{different}} meanings of <b>the</b> word <b>rite.</b> Apart from its {{reference to the}} liturgical patrimony of a particular church, the word has been and is still sometimes, even if rarely, officially used of the particular church itself. Thus <b>the</b> term Latin <b>rite</b> can refer either to the Latin Church or {{to one or more}} of <b>the</b> Western liturgical <b>rites,</b> which include <b>the</b> majority Roman <b>Rite</b> but also <b>the</b> Ambrosian <b>Rite,</b> <b>the</b> Mozarabic <b>Rite,</b> and others.|$|R
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages, {{the royal}} touch {{had become an}} {{integral}} part of the coronation of the French monarch at Reims Cathedral. <b>The</b> <b>rite</b> included the anointing of the king's hands, which was believed to confer on him the ability to cure. The coronation and anointing were immediately followed by a journey to Corbeny, the site of the shrine of Saint Marcouf (d. 558), patron saint of scrofulous people. After the pilgrimage was completed, the newly crowned king was deemed to possess the sacred power of touch. On his deathbed, Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) reportedly instructed his son and heir, Louis X (r. 1314–1316), about healing scrofula by touch. Philip VI (r. 1328–1350), the first Valois king, sought to demonstrate that he shared the thaumaturgic powers of his sovereign cousins and ancestors, thus proving himself as their rightful heir. He touched 35 people between 1 January and 30 June 1337; some of them had come from Brittany, Brabant and Vivarais.|$|E
5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its <b>The</b> <b>Rite</b> of Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey to the Beginning of Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 {{the local}} Morris dancer John Byfleet made {{a replica of}} the {{original}} Ooser, which he carved from a log using a penknife. This replica is on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. It is taken from the museum twice a year, on May Day and St. George's Day, when it is used by the Wessex Morris Men as part of their seasonal festivities. In 2005, a journalist from The Guardian reported on a dawn ceremony performed by the troupe on May Day atop Giant Hill near Cerne Abbas. The ceremony involved one member carrying the Dorset Ooser replica atop his head, with other Morris men dancing around him; after <b>the</b> <b>rite</b> they proceeded, still dancing, to a local pub, the Red Lion. In summer 2006, the Wessex Morris Men took the replica to Melbury Osmond for the first time, where they performed a dance in a local street.|$|E
25|$|Another way for {{the church}} to confirm its role was through the {{administration}} of <b>the</b> <b>rites.</b> Some churches have decorative schemes which support this role of the church, illustrating <b>the</b> various <b>rites</b> and sacraments. <b>The</b> Church of St John at Tideswell in Derbyshire has a particularly fine set of 20th-century bench-ends by Advent and William Hunstone, showing <b>the</b> <b>rites</b> of Baptism, Confirmation and Ordination.|$|R
