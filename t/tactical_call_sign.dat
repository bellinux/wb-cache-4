2500|$|The {{nickname}} of the 8th Armored Division, the [...] "Thundering Herd", {{was coined}} before the division went to Europe in late 1944. It was {{also known as}} the [...] "Iron Snake" [...] late in the war, after a correspondent for Newsweek likened the 8th to a [...] "great ironclad snake" [...] as it crossed the Rhine River in late March 1945. The division is also sometimes referred to as Tornado – its wartime <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Helicopter Training Squadron 28 (HT-28) is a United States Navy {{helicopter}} training squadron {{based at}} Naval Air Station Whiting Field in Milton, Florida. The squadron, {{known as the}} Hellions, {{is one of three}} Advanced Helicopter Training squadrons that produces aviators for the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. They fall under the command of Training Air Wing Five and fly both the TH-57B Sea Ranger basic helicopter trainer and the TH-57C Sea Ranger advanced helicopter trainer. The squadron's <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> is [...] "Lucky." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nice Air Base (Base Aérienne 943 Nice [...] "Capitaine Auber") of the French Air Force {{is divided}} between two sites: {{one at the}} summit of Mont Agel near Nice in the Alpes-Maritimes département, and the other at Gardanne barracks in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. The Mont Agel base uses the {{facilities}} of the former Ouvrage Mont Agel of the Alpine Line. Its mission is the surveillance of aviation movements in southeastern France, operating as Centre de Détection et de Contrôle (CDC) 05.943, <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> “Rhodia radar”. A similar facility is located at Drachenbronn Air Base in northeastern France. The Gardanne base houses administrative functions and personnel housing in a former Chasseur Alpins barracks.|$|E
50|$|The United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard use {{a mixture}} of <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and {{international}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with the letter N. For example, the carrier USS John F. Kennedy had the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> NJFK for unclassified and navigation communications with other vessels, but uses <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> that vary with its mission. In tactical situations, the Marine Corps utilizes <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> naming conventions similar to the Army's.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used}} during {{tactical}} portions of a flight, {{and they often}} indicate {{the mission of the}} flight and/or an aircraft's position in a formation.|$|R
50|$|In wartime, {{monitoring}} an adversary's communications can be {{a valuable}} form of intelligence. Consistent <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> can aid in this monitoring, so in wartime, military units often employ <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and sometimes change them at regular intervals. In peacetime, some military stations will use fixed <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in the international series.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{difference}} between a CASEVAC and a medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) is that a MEDEVAC uses a standardized and dedicated vehicle providing en route care. On the other hand, CASEVAC uses non-standardized and non-dedicated vehicles {{that may or may}} not provide en route care. CASEVACs are commonly referred to as [...] "a lift/flight of opportunity". If a Corpsman/Medic on the ground calls for a CASEVAC, the closest available unit with space could be called to assist; regardless of their medical capabilities. These could include U.S. Marine Corps aircraft such as the MV-22 Osprey, U.S. Navy SH-60 Seahawk helicopters,or CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. The guiding principles in a CASEVAC is to transport casualties that are in dire need for evacuation from the battlefield and do not have time to wait on a MEDEVAC. MEDEVAC aircraft and ground transport are mandated by the Geneva Convention to be unarmed and well marked. Firing on [...] "clearly marked and identified" [...] MEDEVAC vehicles would be considered a war crime under Article II of the Geneva Convention, in the same sense as firing on a hospital ship would be a war crime. CASEVAC transport are allowed to be armed since they are normally used for other purposes but carry no penalties for engagement by hostile forces. [...] "Dust Off" [...] was the <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> for medical evacuation missions first used in 1963 by Major Lloyd E. Spencer, Commander of the U.S. Army 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance). The name lasted the rest of the war. Typically air ambulances transport wounded soldiers categorized as [...] "urgent" [...] patients from point of injury to a medical facility within an hour of soldier(s) being wounded. Flying into an active landing zone to pick up wounded was a dangerous job. Peter Dorland and James Nanney wrote in Dust Off: Army Aeromedical Evacuation in Vietnam, [...] "... slightly more a third of the aviators became casualties in their work, and the crew chiefs and medical corpsmen who accompanied them suffered similarly. The danger of their work was further borne out by the high rate of air ambulance loss to hostile fire: 3.3 times that of all other forms of helicopter missions in the Vietnam War." ...|$|E
50|$|Military <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{assigned}} {{as unique}} identifiers to military communications. In wartime, monitoring an adversary's communications {{can be a}} valuable form of intelligence. Consistent <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> can aid in this monitoring, so in wartime, military units often employ <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and sometimes change them at regular intervals.

5000|$|The United States Army uses {{fixed station}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> which begin with W, such as WAR, used by U.S. Army Headquarters. Fixed <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> for the United States Air Force {{stations}} begin with A, such as AIR, used by USAF Headquarters. The United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard use {{a mixture of}} <b>tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and international <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with the letter N.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Army uses {{fixed station}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> which begin with W, such as WAR, used by U.S. Army Headquarters. <b>Tactical</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are often {{assigned}} to a company sized unit or higher. For example, the collective [...] "Checkmate" [...] might be {{assigned to a}}n entire company and thus [...] "Checkmate Red 6" [...] {{would be the first}} platoon leader (platoons are red for first, white for second, blue for third, black for headquarters, and often additional colors for other portions under the command), [...] "Checkmate white 6" [...] to the second platoon leader, etc. [...] "Checkmate 6" [...] is the Company Commander and [...] "Checkmate 6 Romeo" [...] is the commander's radio-telephone operator (Romeo the NATO phonetic of the letter R). Under NATO conventions, 6 is designated the commander or leader, 5 the second-in-command or executive officer, 7 the chief NCO. Also, companies often have the letter they are designated by ('A', 'B', 'C' or 'D') be the first letter of their <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> This means a 'C' Company could potentially have 'Checkmate' as its <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In most countries, the {{aircraft}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> or [...] "tail number"/"tail letters" [...] (also known as registration marks) {{are linked to}} the international radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocation table and follow a convention that aircraft radio stations (and, by extension, {{the aircraft}} itself) receive <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> consisting of five letters. For example, all British civil aircraft have a five-letter <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with the letter G. Canadian aircraft have a <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with C-F or C-G, such as C-FABC. Wing In Ground-effect vehicles (hovercraft) in Canada are eligible to receive C-Hxxx <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> and ultralight aircraft receive C-Ixxx <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> In days gone by, even American aircraft used five letter <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> such as KH-ABC, but they were replaced prior to World War II by the current American system of civilian aircraft <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> (see below).|$|R
50|$|Amateur radio <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are {{allocated}} to amateur radio operators around the world. The <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used to}} legally identify the station or operator, with some countries requiring the station <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to always be used and others allowing the operator <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> instead.|$|R
50|$|The {{radio station}} {{has had the}} WAZX <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> since 1993, when it changed from its long-time WYNX <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The WYNX <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> dates back to 1965 when the station {{switched}} to a Top 40 radio format from an MOR radio format and original <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of WSMA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in South America {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} identifying radio and TV stations. Argentina and Brazil both have broadcast <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> systems. Some stations still broadcast their <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> a few times a day, but this practice is becoming very rare. <b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> were first assigned to South American countries in 1913, and the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> blocks were expanded to include amateur radio in 1947.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{countries}} have specific conventions for classifying <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> by transmitter characteristics and location. The <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> format for {{radio and television}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> follows a number of conventions. All <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> begin with a prefix assigned by the International Telecommunications Union. For example, the United States has been assigned the following prefixes: [...] "AAA"-"ALZ", [...] "K", [...] "N", [...] "W". For a complete list, see international <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocations.|$|R
50|$|On February 4, 2016, WREJ swapped <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{with its}} sister station, {{assuming}} the WLEE <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WONA on March 15, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The station {{went on the}} air as WSFC-FM on 1964-09-01; in 1968, {{the station}} changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WSEK. On 2005-08-09, the station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WKEQ-FM, on 2005-08-18, the station changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to WKEQ, and on 2016-06-01 changed its <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to the current WJQQ.|$|R
5000|$|Some aviators use {{the same}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{throughout}} their careers; in other cases an aviator might {{have a series of}} <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> For example, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Kara Hultgreen was originally given the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Hulk" [...] because of her ability to bench-press 200 pounds. Later, after a television appearance in which she wore detectable makeup, she received the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Revlon", and a 1998 biography was entitled <b>Call</b> <b>Sign</b> Revlon.|$|R
50|$|The station's <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{used to be}} CBJ-FM until 1999. At that time, that <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{started to}} be used by its sister station CBJ as it moved from AM to the FM band; that station got the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> CBJ-FM, and the old CBJ-FM thus had to change its own <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{held the}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> CFXL-FM until June 2008, when it adopted its current <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The former CIQX-FM in Calgary {{took over the}} CFXL-FM <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> a few days later.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly one of {{the rarest}} <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> [...] "Concorde", was once used to {{identify}} British Airways' Concorde aircraft. The intent of this <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was to raise the air traffic control operators' awareness of the unique performance of the aircraft and the special attention it required. The <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was appended to British Airways' normal radio <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> e.g. [...] "Speedbird-Concorde One". Air France, the only other airline to operate the Concorde commercially, {{did not use the}} [...] "Concorde" [...] <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> at all in normal service; its Concorde flights simply used the standard Airfrans <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R
50|$|Four-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are the norm. Three-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are only}} {{permitted}} to CBC Radio stations or to commercial stations which {{already had a}} three-letter <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> before the current rules were adopted, and five-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> exclusively identify CBC transmitters (which may be either rebroadcasters or Ici Radio-Canada Télé owned-and-operated stations outside of Quebec).|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{broadcast}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are optional, but are allocated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and {{are unique}} for each broadcast station. Most European and Asian countries {{do not use}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> to identify broadcast stations, but Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan do have <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> systems. Britain has no <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in the American sense, but allow broadcast stations {{to choose their own}} trade mark <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> up to six words in length.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in India {{are unique}} {{identifiers}} for telecommunications and broadcasting in India.
