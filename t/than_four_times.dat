5|$|Following the Romanian Revolution, due to {{shortage}} of funds, many units were disbanded and much equipment was phased out. Likewise, Romanian military capability declined {{because of a}} lack of fuel as well as training. However, since the late 1990s, a number of positive changes have come about and the level of combat readiness is growing greatly; since 1996, the military budget has grown more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> - rising from 636 million dollars to 2.8 billion dollars in 2007.

One day after being warned he could face a prison sentence for drink driving, Gascoigne {{was arrested for}} possession of cocaine. He should have appeared in court on 11 November to be sentenced for the drink driving offence, but instead he went into rehab on the south coast of England. He was given an eight-week suspended sentence on 9 December 2010.|$|E

Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election. Arévalo's closest challenger was Adrián Recinos, whose campaign included a number of individuals identified with the Ubico regime. The ballots were tallied on 19 December 1944, and Arévalo won in a landslide, receiving more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>times</b> as many ballots as the other candidates combined.|$|E

Combinatory analysis method, as presented by Castle [2] or Dulucq [3] or Berstel [4] are not commonly used: they imply multiple string copies and are therefore slow. A new approach, combining combinatory analysis and DDA is presented. The DDA {{does not apply to}} each point but to a step computed by combinatory method.
