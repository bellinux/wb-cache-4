5|$|During the Jeopardy! round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>their</b> phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>their</b> physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
5|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} summer camp at Fort Clinton, MacArthur had the cadets trained to use modern weapons by regular army sergeants at Fort Dix; they then marched back to West Point with full packs. He attempted to modernize the curriculum by adding liberal arts, government and economics courses, but encountered strong resistance from the Academic Board. In Military Art classes, {{the study of the}} campaigns of the American Civil War was replaced with the study of those of World War I. In History class, more emphasis was placed on the Far East. MacArthur expanded the sports program, increasing the number of intramural sports and requiring all cadets to participate. He allowed upper class cadets to leave the reservation, and sanctioned a cadet newspaper, The Brag, forerunner of today's West Pointer. He also permitted cadets to travel <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>their</b> football team play, and gave them an allowance of $5 ($ in modern dollars) a month. Professors and alumni alike protested these radical moves. Most of MacArthur's West Point reforms were soon discarded but, in the ensuing years, his ideas became accepted and his innovations were gradually restored.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Researchers have {{extensively}} {{documented the}} cardiovascular and metabolic demands for sports participation. To date, researchers have ignored the same requirements of competitor’s parents. Hence, our {{purpose was to}} document parent cardiovascular and metabolic responses <b>to</b> <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> child compete while also paying particular attention to their thoughts {{before and after the}} competition. Achievement Goal Theory (AGT) drove interpretation of parent thoughts. Materials: Parents wore a device, made by Firstbeat Technologies, which continuously monitored heart rate. The parents wore the device the night before the competition to be acclimated to the technology and during the event until later in the day. Parents also completed two open-ended questions, one before the tournament and one after the contest. Results: Before the contest, the dad expected that his son won the event (Croatian National Championships for juniors). Conversely, the mother’s expectations centered more on her son’s enjoyment and competing to the best of his abilities. Parents had differing cardiovascular and energy requirement responses <b>to</b> <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> son compete. In addition, post-competition reflections differed as the father expressed disappointment whereas the mother expressed sadness. Conclusions: The data presented are unique and a first in the sports literature. The parents varied in the intensity of their cardiovascular responses and calories burned while <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> son compete. The father’s cardiovascular response over the course of watching was that of an aerobic workout. Whether this pattern is unique or universal are a critical research question. Last, AGT appears relevant when assessing the parent’s expectations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: (1) To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} parents concerned about medical errors during a child's hospitalization; and (2) the association between this concern and parental self-efficacy with physician interactions. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of children admitted to the general medical service. OUTCOME MEASURE: Parental concern about medical errors. METHODS: Parents were asked their agreement with the statement “When my child is in the hospital I feel that I have <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over the care that he/she is receiving {{to make sure that}} mistakes aren't made. ” We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between parents' self-efficacy with physician interactions and the need “to watch over a child's care,” adjusting for parent and child demographics, English proficiency, past hospitalization, and social desirability bias. RESULTS: Of 278 eligible parents, 130 completed surveys and 63 % reported the need <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over <b>their</b> child's care to ensure that mistakes were not made. Parents with greater self-efficacy with physician interactions were less likely to report this need (odds ratio [OR], 0. 83; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 72 - 0. 92). All parents who were “very uncomfortable” communicating with doctors in English reported the need <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over <b>their</b> child's care to prevent mistakes. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly two-thirds of surveyed parents felt the need <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over <b>their</b> child's hospital care to prevent mistakes. Parents with greater self-efficacy with physician interactions were less likely to report the need <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> over <b>their</b> child's care while parents with lower English proficiency {{were more likely to report}} this need.

25|$|The Netflix {{model has}} also {{affected}} viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows and nearly {{eight out of}} 10 Americans have used technology <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>their</b> favorite shows on their own schedule. Netflix has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes {{at a time of}} their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace. Netflix has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series, removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services. The structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes, as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs, in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.|$|E
