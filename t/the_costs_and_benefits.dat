5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

40|$|In {{distributed}} query processing, the semijoin {{is used as}} {{an effective}} operator in reducing relations referenced in the query and thus reducing {{the total amount of}} data transmission. A semijoin is associated with two quantities: <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit.</b> These two quantities of semijoins are the useful ingredients in many heuristic algorithms proposed to generate a semijoin program which is a sequence of semijoins and is executed as a query pre- processing strategy. In this paper, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit,</b> we associate a semijoin with the third quantity: reduction propagation. It measures the propagation of reduction effects of a semijoin to other semijoins. We define this propagation in the context of distributed query processing and by precisely quantifying it, we present a heuristic algorithm to generate a semijoin program. The simulation reaults show that the new algorithm provides a considerable improvement over those based only on <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit...</b>|$|R

Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{purports to}} {{introduce}} a <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> theory of politeness which sheds light upon the politeness system in Japanese. This involves the assumption that a communicative act is a rational act, executed for a communicative goal. Given so, politeness-bearing language use is strategic in nature. This implies that using a certain strategy appropriate in a given communicative situation {{is a consequence of}} rationalization. With effective utilization of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> concept, broadly defined, linguistic politeness is viewed as a negotiation between the speaker and the hearer {{on the basis of the}} speaker's assessment of cost and/or benefit. In order to achieve a characterization of negotiation, the underlying principle, referred to as "Politeness Negotiation Principles," is proposed. The primary task in this thesis is to analyze the use of sentence particles within a framework of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> theory. While <b>the</b> majority of studies of politeness phenomena in Japanese have centered around honorifics, which is widely known for its highly developed system, sentence particles have received little attention. In this regard, this study of sentence particles shows a much broader vista of politeness phenomena in Japanese than hitherto assumed. The application of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> concept goes beyond the sphere of politeness phenomena. By identifying a cost and/or a benefit involved in a context where the modality item desyoo/daroo and the anaphoric demonstratives sono and ano are employed, the uses of these elements, which reveal interesting dynamics of interaction between the speaker and the hearer, can be explained...|$|R
