5|$|Rokonok (2006) was a Hungarian {{production}} {{based on}} a 1932 novel by Zsigmond Móricz about political corruption.

50|$|Most of <b>the</b> church <b>woodwork</b> {{dates from}} <b>the</b> {{extensions}} and refurbishment in 1887. <b>The</b> chancel <b>woodwork</b> is in American walnut and was carved by Earp of Manchester. The wooden altar is elaborately carved {{as is the}} reredos. The pulpit is in carved walnut on a base of Mansfield red stone. A new case was made for the organ at {{the east end of}} the south aisle. New pitch pine pews were stained and polished to match <b>the</b> chancel <b>woodwork</b> and replaced <b>the</b> original box pews.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>woodwork</b> {{removed by}} Street was sold for a nominal sum, with a {{condition}} that {{it could only be}} used for a hall, chapel or library. Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of Forest School in Walthamstow, east London (an institution that previously had no link to the college). Panels under the communion rail were also removed from the chapel, even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value, and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante-chapel screen and the adjoining seats. Some of <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> was transferred to St Edern's Church, Bodedern, in Anglesey, which had links with the college from 1648 until the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Some of the panels may also have been re-used in the Fellows' Library (in the second quadrangle); other panelling at Bodedern came from the college, but not apparently from the chapel, and so may have been from a disused library gallery.|$|E
5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E
5|$|Before Euro 2000, Nedvěd {{was unable}} to train {{normally}} due to an ankle injury. The Czechs' first match (against the Netherlands) saw him and international teammate Jan Koller hit <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> without scoring, before the Dutch scored a controversial penalty to win 1–0. In the second match, against France, he was fouled, where the resultant Czech penalty was converted by Karel Poborský to even the score at 1–1. Despite two shots on goal, Nedvěd could not beat French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and France won the match 2–1. He played in the third group match, against Denmark; despite the Czechs' 2–0 victory, the team was eliminated from the tournament. After Euro 2000, Nedvěd took over the national team captaincy from Jiří Němec.|$|E

5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind <b>the</b> <b>woodwork.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 October, Vale {{secured the}} biggest ever win at Vale Park when they beat York City 5–0. Seven days later Vale's clean sheet streak {{came to an}} end, though they still secured a 2–1 victory over Chesterfield at Saltergate; Cyril Hatton was the scorer for Chesterfield, though it proved not enough to save his team's unbeaten home record. Albert Mullard had a penalty kick saved {{towards the end of}} the game by goalkeeper Ron Powell, the only one of two {{penalties}} the club were awarded throughout the campaign. Vale then beat Tranmere Rovers 2–0 after their defence successfully contained the threat posed by the division's then-top scorer Cyril Done. The following week they won 1–0 at Halifax Town in a game where Ken Griffiths hit <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> three times.|$|E
5|$|St Edwen's {{is built}} from local red gritstone, formed into square blocks and dressed with sandstone. The roof {{is made from}} slate with stone edging. The church, {{which is in the}} Late Decorated style, has a tower topped with a broach spire at the north-west corner of the nave, {{supported}} by buttresses. The church is entered through a porch with an arched doorway in the lowest of the three stages of the tower. Inside, <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> of the roof is exposed; some of the nave timbers might be medieval beams reused in the 1856 rebuilding. The nave and chancel are divided by an arch and by three steps leading up from the nave. The chancel and sanctuary are separated by an altar rail set on top of some wooden panels.|$|E

5|$|The three-storey {{north tower}} is reached by a 13th-century {{staircase}} in the hall, which leads onto the first floor. The first floor {{was divided into}} two separate rooms shortly after {{the construction of the}} tower, and contain various decorative tiles, probably from Laurence's house in Ludlow. The walls of the second floor are mostly half-timbered, jettying out above the stone walls beneath them; the tower has its original 13th-century fireplace, although the wooden roof is 19th-century, modeled on the 13th-century original, and the windows are 17th-century insertions. The details and the carpenters' personal marks on <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> show that the hall, solar and north tower were all constructed {{under the direction of the}} same carpenter in the late 1280s and early 1290s.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} of the match came with ten minutes left. After a period of fluent {{football}} by the Arsenal forwards which saw Smith hit <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> and Hayes, Thomas and Rocastle all had shots saved by Dibble, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after Rocastle was fouled in the box. Dibble saved Winterburn's spot-kick by turning the ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton equalised with seven minutes remaining when Caesar mis-kicked a clearance {{on the edge of}} his penalty area, enabling Luton's Wilson to head the ball into the Arsenal goal from a Mark Stein cross. With less than a minute to go, Adams fouled Mark Stein, and from the resulting free kick, Brian Stein scored his second goal of the match to put the game beyond the reach of the defending champions.|$|E
5|$|São Paulo's {{pressure}} {{resulted in}} them {{taking the lead}} in the 27th minute. A chipped pass from Aloísio to Mineiro found the midfielder in space who put the ball beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina to give the Brazilians a 1–0 lead. It was the first goal Liverpool had conceded in over 1,041 minutes of play. Immediately afterwards, Liverpool had a corner, which almost resulted in a goal. Xabi Alonso took the corner which found García, but his shot hit <b>the</b> <b>woodwork.</b> Liverpool had another chance 30 minutes into the match, but again he failed to score with a header. Gerrard had a chance to equalise five minutes later, but he put his shot wide after Harry Kewell had passed him the ball. Liverpool continued to create chances and in the 39th minute García saw his header into the far corner saved by São Paulo goalkeeper Rogério Ceni. From the resulting corner Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä shot straight at Ceni. He had another chance late in the first half, but his header was saved by Ceni.|$|E

5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. <b>The</b> <b>woodwork</b> in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
5|$|A five team group stage then followed, {{in which}} each team played the others once. Manchester City were drawn with Twente, Schalke 04, Racing de Santander and Paris Saint-Germain. City topped the group, after wins against Twente and Schalke, a draw with Paris Saint-Germain and a defeat in a dead rubber in Santander. The {{knockout}} stages then resumed, with a visit to F.C. Copenhagen in freezing conditions. City took the lead twice but could only draw 2–2. The home leg was more comfortable, and ended in a 2–1 victory. Another Danish club, Aalborg, awaited in the next round. Both matches finished 2–0 to the home side, and the tie was decided by a penalty shootout, which Manchester City won. City then faced Hamburger SV, in their first European quarter-final since 1979. The away leg was played first, and started exceptionally well for Manchester City, as Stephen Ireland scored after just 35 seconds. However, Hamburg soon equalised, and won the match 3–1. A difficult task in the home leg soon became even harder, when Hamburg scored an away goal early in the match. City scored twice, the first by Elano, who also hit <b>the</b> <b>woodwork</b> on two occasions with free-kicks. However, City could not produce the third goal that would have taken the tie into extra time.|$|E
