Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident about their ability <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} this issue. Given a dataset C of curricula, {{our goal is}} <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> two research <b>questions.</b> (Q 1) Is it possible to find inconsistencies in C based on the comparison of coauthor’s list of publication? (Q 2) Assuming the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> Q 1 is positive, how to determine the level of inconsistency in C? <b>To</b> <b>answer</b> <b>question</b> Q 1, we propose and apply similarity-based heuristics to find inconsistencies in a large dataset of Lattes CV from researchers and professors of a Brazilian university. Then, <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>question</b> Q 2, we draw a map of referential inconsistencies identified in coauthoring of journal and conference papers on this dataset. Our main contribution resides in the heuristics, together with the inconsistency map. The heuristics are generic enough {{to be applied to}} other CV datasets, and thus are not specific for the Lattes Platform.|$|R
5|$|One of Madgwick's primary {{responsibilities}} as chairman was <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>questions</b> and inquiries from the Commonwealth {{government and its}} committees. In 1968 the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts investigated the ABC's finances. In late 1971, the Estimates Committee investigated a concern about ABC employees sometimes refusing to disclose internal ABC information to government overseers. In August 1971 the Senate Standing Committees on Education, Science and the Arts conducted a general inquiry into radio and television. On every occasion, Madgwick, accompanied by ABC general manager Talbot Duckmanton, travelled to Canberra to answer each committee's questions. Under Madgwick, the ABC's annual budget grew from $50 million in 1969 to $90 million in 1973.|$|E
