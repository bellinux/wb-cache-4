5|$|Games {{tended to}} be {{characterized}} by low scores and frequent punting, with crowds between 10,000 and 20,000; these numbers dropped off {{in the last two}} games of the era. A low scoring BC–Calgary game in Everett, Washington in 1967 drew just over 6,000; <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be another CFL game in the United States until the cusp of US expansion itself in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, in a {{paper in}} Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, {{but he did not}} think that such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was {{operating}} on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto was the size of Earth and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. Were Kuiper's hypothesis correct, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be a Kuiper belt today.|$|E

As a result, GCap threatened to take Ofcom to court after being told by the Radio Authority that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be another national ensemble. The court action was dropped after Ofcom assured GCap that none of the stations on the second ensemble would compete with existing stations on the Digital One ensemble.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 2004 four protesters {{climbed onto}} the gantry over the Tamar Bridge to {{highlight}} {{the work of the}} group Fathers 4 Justice who promote the rights of fathers in child custody disputes. The protest caused rush-hour tailbacks {{on both sides of the}} bridge. Charges against the protesters were later dropped after it was felt <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be a realistic chance of conviction.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 2015, it was {{announced}} the band consisting of Osbourne, Iommi and Butler would be returning to the Download Festival on 11 June 2016. Despite earlier reports that they would enter the studio before their farewell tour, Osbourne stated that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be another Black Sabbath studio album. However, an 8-track CD entitled The End was sold at dates on the tour. Along with some live recordings, the CD includes four unused tracks from the 13 sessions.|$|E

5|$|One {{issue that}} emerged from these studies was the problem of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical. When the rivers iced over, {{it became clear that}} <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be enough food for that winter. The NWMP evacuated some prospectors without supplies to Fort Yukon in Alaska from September 30 onwards, while others made {{their way out of the}} Klondike in search of food and shelter for the winter.|$|E
5|$|Government policy {{designed}} to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression. Barack Obama, the first African American and multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act {{in an attempt to}} mitigate its negative effects and ensure <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.|$|E

5|$|In 1197, Reginald Fitz Jocelin's successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, {{with the}} {{approval}} of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey, but the monks <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> accept their new Bishop of Glastonbury and the title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219. Savaric's successor, Jocelin of Wells, again moved the bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells. There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206.|$|E
5|$|In February 1933, {{the group}} issued a {{prospectus}} that contained publication data and guaranteed that the magazine {{would have no}} fewer than sixty-four pages per issue. Other writers, including Armijn's elder brother Sanusi Pane and poet Muhammad Yamin, were called {{to serve on the}} editorial board. Worried that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be enough subscribers to support the magazine and hoping to ensure a good reception from traditional groups, the founders sent letters to leaders of ten sultanates in the archipelago asking that they subscribe to the magazine; however, only Syarif Muhammad Alkadrie, the sultan of Pontianak, agreed to subscribe.|$|E
5|$|The group {{increasingly}} {{focused on}} the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration. They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite's view, sexuality {{was one of the}} most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no reproductive organs but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E

5|$|Video game critics gave Spec Ops: The Line {{generally}} positive reviews. Praise {{focused on}} the narrative and its themes, while criticism was targeted at the online multiplayer mode and generic third person gameplay. Spec Ops: The Line was a commercial failure and did not garner the attention that distributor Take-Two Interactive had hoped for, but it was awarded and nominated for several end-of-the-year accolades particularly for its story. Yager announced that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be a sequel to the game. The game was banned in the United Arab Emirates for its depiction of Dubai {{in a state of}} destruction.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, the {{publishing}} company Robert Hale brought out Valiente's second book, An ABC of Witchcraft, {{in which she}} provided an encyclopaedic overview of various topics related to Wicca and esotericism. In 1975, Hale published Valiente's Natural Magic, a discussion of what she {{believed to be the}} magical usages and associations of the weather, stones, plants, and other elements of the natural world. In 1978 Hale then published Witchcraft for Tomorrow, in which Valiente proclaimed her belief that Wicca was ideal for the dawning Age of Aquarius and espoused James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. It also explained to the reader how they could initiate themselves into Wicca and establish their own coven. In 1978 she offered a book of poetry to Hale, although they declined to publish it, believing that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be sufficient market for such a publication. In 1982 she then submitted a book of short stories, The Witch Ball, to Hale, but again they declined to publish it.|$|E
5|$|Stoke {{slipped down}} {{the league in}} an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to take a few days off from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} {{advanced}} tolls was {{reviewed by the}} county council on 23 October 1991, where 64 voted in favor and 19 were opposed, the latter representing the Socialist Left Party, the Red Electoral Alliance and the Progress Party. In June 1992, the county council was asked to prioritize between the Hardanger Bridge and the Triangle Link, as <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be sufficient state grants to build both projects. Both would require between NOK200 and 300 million, {{and it would not}} be possible to start both projects in the period from 1994 to 1997. In the council meeting on 18 June 1992, a proposal to waiver prioritization was rejected. The council then, with 44 against 30 votes, chose to prioritize the Hardanger Bridge, which received most votes from the Labour and Centre Party. The Conservative Party was the only party for which all the votes were cast in favor of the Triangle Link. The Socialist Left Party's proposal to build neither received 11 votes.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
