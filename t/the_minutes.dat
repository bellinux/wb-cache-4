5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E

5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> of {{an extraordinary}} meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in <b>the</b> <b>minutes,</b> Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E
50|$|Cannon pinion - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center wheel shaft, projects through the face, and holds <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> hand. While <b>the</b> timepiece {{is not being}} set, this is turned by the center wheel, and drives <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> wheel. While being set it is turned by the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this is turned by <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> wheel, which is turned by the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> hand, which rotated the cannon pinion directly.|$|R
50|$|The {{indicating}} {{system is}} almost always the traditional dial with moving hour and minute hands. Many clocks have a small third hand indicating seconds on a subsidiary dial. Pendulum clocks are usually designed to be set by opening the glass face cover and manually pushing <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> hand around <b>the</b> dial to the correct time. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> hand is mounted on a slipping friction sleeve which allows it to be turned on its arbor. The hour hand is driven not from the wheel train but from <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> hand's shaft through a small set of gears, so rotating <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> hand manually also sets the hour hand.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{distribution}} of the red cells in the circulating blood is of both theoretical and practical importance. In {{spite of the fact that}} blood taken from artery, vein or finger has the same cell plasma ratio (1, 2), certain investigators (2, 3, 5) believe that the red cells are not uniformly distributed throughout the vascular bed but that the blood from the large vessels has a higher cell plasma ratio than the blood contained in <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels. Direct observation of <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> blood vessels (6) has shown that the red cells flow in the rapidly moving central portion of the stream and that there is a slow moving clear layer of plasma adjacent to the wall of the vessel. Because of the size of this peripheral layer of clear plasma in <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> blood vessels, it has been suggested that the cell plasma ratio of blood contained in <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels is lower than that of blood from the large vessels. The cell plasma ratio of the blood contained in <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels has not been determined because of the difficulty in obtaining a sample of this blood. Blood collected from a vein or from the cut ends of minute vessels is representative of the blood flowing from <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels but it is not necessarily representative of the blood contained within <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels. <b>The</b> blood contained within <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels consists not only of the central core of red cells and plasma which is flowing rapidly into the veins, but also of the slower moving peripheral layer of plasma. In this study a technique for obtaining a portion of the blood actually contained within <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels is described. To obtain this blood it is necessary (1) to obstruct the arterial inflow to the part, (2) to empty the blood out of the large vessels, and (3) to force the blood from <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels into <b>the</b> veins where it can be collected. The hemoglobin concentration and protein concentration of the venous blood and of the 317 blood contained within <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> vessels were compared...|$|R

5|$|The eastern clock face {{features}} an outer ring of large golden Roman numerals, {{on which the}} larger hand indicates the hour, {{and an inner ring}} on which the smaller hand indicates <b>the</b> <b>minutes.</b> The golden sun on the hour hand is pivot-mounted so that it always faces up. Below the clock face one sees an idealised profile of city founder Duke Berchtold V of Zähringen. While the exact decoration of the clockface has varied from renovation to renovation, the current (post-1983) layout is generally that of 1770.|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of this period is handed down to us by Tacitus, whose Annals dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born {{during the reign of}} Nero in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the Acta Senatus (<b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> of the session of the Senate) and the Acta Diurna (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder (all of which are lost).|$|E
5|$|The {{process that}} {{ultimately}} led to Accum's departure from England and return to Germany began {{a few months after}} the publication of his book on the poisoning of foodstuffs.

Finally in 1951, Cole, in an addendum to <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> of Royal Institution, proved that the presentation of the events adopted in the article in the Dictionary of National Biography, and also later in the Allgemeinen Deutschen Biographie (according to which Accum was embroiled in charges of embezzlement as librarian of the Royal Institution and escaped to Germany), did not correspond to the facts.|$|E

40|$|Assessing {{learning}} in large lecture based classes {{is one of}} the most difficult tasks in teaching. The use of <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> paper provides an easy method for gathering information about student learning. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> paper uses two brief questions to determine if students have correctly identified the most important topics from a lecture and to determine if they are left with any confusion concerning a particular topic. In addition to its use as an assessment method, <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> paper has numerous well-documented benefits such as increased student self-assessment, allowing students to synthesize and integrate information and think holistically. However, the greatest benefit is its ability to create a better learning environment by enhancing communication between faculty and students. The information gathered in <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> papers can be used not only to determine deficiencies in student knowledge but also to highlight possible weaknesses in lec-tures, which allows the instructor to refine and strengthen these points for future classes. One of the known weaknesses of <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> paper has been that students sometimes relate only trivial details and not impor-tant facts. This limitation seems to have been overcome, in this case, by introducing a third question to the paper allowing students to relate the most interesting fact that they learned from that lecture. We have used a survey to examine many of the reported, but rarely documented benefits of <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> paper. We find that students are very receptive to the use of <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> paper in pharmacy courses. They feel that it increases their understanding of difficult material and improves student-faculty communication. The survey also reveals that students would like to see <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> paper used in other pharmacy courses...|$|R
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. <b>The</b> <b>minutes</b> of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
25|$|The First Key can be {{separated}} into two Keys, taking {{the forms of}} <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> and hour hands of a clock.

50|$|The Chinese {{traditional}} shi-ke {{system may}} be an optimum design of 24-hour clock.

50|$|In recent years, a {{trend has}} {{developed}} (particularly with Association football fans) to fill <b>the</b> traditional <b>minute</b> of silence with {{a minute of}} applause which {{has long been a}} custom in Italy. Psychologically this is seen by some to celebrate the deceased person's life rather than mourn his/her death. Recent recipients of <b>the</b> <b>minute's</b> applause include deceased footballers Jock Stein, George Best, Ernie Cooksey, and Alan Ball. It is frequently alleged that the predominant reason for <b>the</b> <b>minute's</b> applause tending to replace <b>the</b> <b>minute's</b> silence is out of fear that opposition fans will not respect the silence, and spend their time booing, jeering, or otherwise attempting to disrupt it; many silences have been cut short from <b>the</b> usual <b>minute</b> to thirty seconds or less for this reason.|$|R
5|$|The meeting {{lasted from}} morning to midnight, {{including}} {{the reading of}} the proclamation, the debate and the vote. There was no secret ballot; votes were heard one at a time and recorded in <b>the</b> <b>minutes.</b> The main themes of the debate were the legitimacy of the government and the authority of the Viceroy. The principle of retroversion of the sovereignty to the people stated that, {{in the absence of the}} legitimate monarch, power returned to the people; they were entitled to form a new government. This principle was commonplace in Spanish scholasticism and rationalist philosophy, but had never been applied in case law. Its validity divided the assembly into two main groups: one group rejected it and argued that the situation should remain unchanged; this group supported Cisneros as Viceroy. The other group supported change, and considered that they should establish a junta, like the ones established in Spain to replace the Viceroy. There was also a third position, taking the middle ground. The promoters of change did not recognize the authority of the Council of Regency, and argued that the colonies in America were not consulted in its formation. The debate tangentially discussed the rivalry between criollos and peninsulars; the Viceroy supporters felt that the will of peninsulars should prevail over that of criollos.|$|E
5|$|The see, if such {{it may be}} called, {{appears to}} have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into {{existence}} {{in the years after}} Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> of a synod held at Abberley, Worcestershire, in about the year 603, though this is an unreliable source. Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Augustine of Canterbury, to persuade Celtic bishops – Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present – to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and the wealth and influence of his clas, ensured that the developing cultus of David did not prevail in northern Ceredigion, possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the clas, apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol. In some cases, as in the Life of Saint Padarn, the Lives tell how the saint gains lands which as the time of writing were claimed by the saint’s foundation as its endowment.|$|E
5|$|To {{co-ordinate}} {{planning for}} the proposed genocide, Heydrich hosted the Wannsee Conference, which brought together administrative leaders of the Nazi regime on 20 January 1942. In preparation for the conference, Eichmann drafted for Heydrich {{a list of the}} numbers of Jews in various European countries and prepared statistics on emigration. Eichmann attended the conference, oversaw the stenographer who took <b>the</b> <b>minutes,</b> and prepared the official distributed record of the meeting. In his covering letter, Heydrich specified that Eichmann would act as his liaison with the departments involved. Under Eichmann's supervision, large-scale deportations began almost immediately to extermination camps at Bełżec, Sobibor, Treblinka and elsewhere. The genocide was code-named Operation Reinhard in honour of Heydrich, who died in Prague in early June from wounds suffered in an assassination attempt. Kaltenbrunner succeeded him as head of the RSHA.|$|E
