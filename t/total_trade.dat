The <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> cost, which includes price impact and opportunity cost, is positively related to order size and stock price volatility, but negatively associated with firm size, stock price, and stock liquidity. The <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> cost has a U-shaped relation with order aggressiveness.

This paper reports on an experiment to examine whether order handling practices by traditional voice brokers and on-line brokerage firms lead to differences in the quality of trade execution. We test two hypotheses; the first is that execution quality differs among brokers and is positively related to commission rates, and the second is that <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> costs are converging as might be expected in a stable market. In the experiment, we conducted 196 trades, simultaneously purchasing or selling 100 share lots of stock using a voice-based broker, a "brand-name" online broker and a deep discount online broker in each trial. We found 36 percent of our orders received price improvement, a measure of execution quality. The differences among brokers in obtaining price improvements were (weakly) statistically significant for NYSE-listed shares only. The brokers do exhibit statistically significant differences in <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> costs; at a volume of 100 shares commission costs dominate execution quality. We discuss implications for larger lot sizes and speculate on the ability of full-service brokerage firms to maintain high commission charges. The paper concludes that electronic commerce is having a major impact on the brokerage industry, and has the potential to affect pricing in other industries with bundled products and services...|$|R
