2500|$|Autopsy results {{released}} by the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner indicated that Terence Crutcher had [...] "acute phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication" [...] {{at the time of}} the shooting. [...] The report stated that Crutcher had 96 nanograms per milliliter of PCP in his blood at the time of death.

50|$|Gacyclidine (GK-11) is a {{psychoactive drug}} which {{acts as a}} dissociative via {{functioning}} as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It {{is closely related to}} phencyclidine (PCP), and specifically, is a derivative of <b>tenocyclidine</b> (TCP).|$|E
50|$|Phenicyclidine (PCP), <b>tenocyclidine</b> (TCP), {{etoxadrol}} and its precursor, dexoxadrol have related chemical structures. These drugs all act similarly on {{the nervous}} system, acting as dissociative hallucinogens (meaning that they interfere with normal sensory signals, {{replacing them with}} hallucinations of any sensory modality) with anesthetic and analgesic properties.|$|E
50|$|Fewer than 30 {{different}} analogues of PCP {{were reported}} as being used on the street during the 1970s and 1980s, mainly in the USA. The best known of these are rolicyclidine (PCPy or 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine); eticyclidine (PCE or N-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine); and <b>tenocyclidine</b> (TCP or 1-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)piperidine). Only of {{a few of these}} compounds were widely used.|$|E

50|$|Phencyclidine {{and related}} {{drugs such as}} benocyclidine, <b>tenocyclidine,</b> ketamine, and {{dizocilpine}} (MK-801), {{have been shown to}} inhibit the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters. They appear to exert their reuptake inhibition by binding to vaguely characterized allosteric sites on each of the respective monoamine transporters. Benztropine, mazindol, and vanoxerine also bind to these sites and have similar properties. In addition to their high affinity for the main site of the monoamine transporters, several competitive transporter substrates such as cocaine and indatraline have lower affinity for these allosteric sites as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenocyclidine</b> (TCP) was {{discovered}} by a team at Parke Davis in the late 1950s. It is a dissociative anesthetic drug with psychostimulant and hallucinogenic effects. It is similar in effects to phencyclidine (PCP) but is considerably more potent. TCP has slightly different binding properties to PCP, with more affinity for the NMDA receptors, but less affinity for the sigma receptors. Because of its high affinity for the PCP site of the NMDA receptor complex, the 3H radiolabelled form of TCP is widely used in research into NMDA receptors.|$|E
