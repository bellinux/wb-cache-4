5|$|Actinium metal {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300°C.

5|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with Pepsi since 2002, and in 2004 {{appeared}} in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias. In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50million deal to endorse Pepsi. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation. Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 per cent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.|$|E
5|$|Canning is {{a process}} during which the enzymes in {{vegetables}} are deactivated and the micro-organisms present killed by heat. The sealed can excludes air from the foodstuff to prevent subsequent deterioration. The lowest necessary heat and the minimum processing time are used {{in order to prevent}} the mechanical breakdown of <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> to preserve the flavor as far as is possible. The can is then able to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period.|$|E

5|$|Advertising for the {{permanent}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped {{around a large}} digital-media push headed by its new advertising firm David. However, unlike the 2014 promotion that was almost exclusively digitally-oriented, the 2015 promotion was accompanied with a sizable television and media tie-in to the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to visitors. A series of advertisements for <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> the company's 2 for $5 sandwich promotion ran during the tournament featuring the hash tag WatchLikeaKing, along {{with a series of}} NCAA co-branded kid's meals.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{sandwich}} {{was made with}} a plain bun; however, that changed when the company switched to a sesame-seeded bun around 1970. In 1985, {{the weight of the}} Whopper was increased to , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll. This was part of a program to improve <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>and</b> featured a US$30 million (approx US$66 million in 2014) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program was to help differentiate the company and its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. The Whopper sandwich's Kaiser roll was changed back into a sesame seed bun in 1994, eliminating the last trace of {{the sandwich}}'s 1985 reconfiguration.|$|E
