5|$|The finals system {{meant that}} they would have to play their finals match in England against English Super League club Wigan. The Mariners shocked the club and the league by winning 22–18. That score line would again be {{repeated}} in the grand final qualifier against Australian club Cronulla, another match the Mariners were expected to lose. But the Mariners were able to defeat the Australian Super League runners-up to take themselves to the grand final of the competition. Against the winners of the Super League grand final, Brisbane, the Mariners were blown away by the competition favourites. In what would be their final rugby league match as a club, the Mariners were down at half-time 26–4 and the final scoreline of 36–12 prevented the Mariners <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> A$1 million prize.|$|E

25|$|But {{despite this}} income and its endowment, the {{memorial}} faced a severe financial {{crisis in the}} 1980s. A significant {{decline in the number}} of Freemasons in the United States led to strong declines in donations to the memorial's maintenance and endowment funds. The building needed significant repairs, but making them left the maintenance fund exhausted. For the first time in its history, the GWMNMA considered <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loan to pay for the repairs and the upkeep of the memorial. The financial crisis was avoided when several Grand Lodges adopted a per capita assessment on their members to keep the memorial afloat, and the GWMNMA began a series of fundraisers and the sale of gifts to generate additional income.|$|E
25|$|Frank Liardet {{settled in}} the Frankston area in 1847, after <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> 300-acre depasturing license for land that is now the Frankston {{locality}} of Karingal. During this time, Liardet built the first wooden house in the Frankston area—which would later become part of his Ballam Park estate after the formal land sales of 1854. Prior to settling in the area, Liardet had also worked on the cattle run of the first Postmaster of the Port Phillip District, Captain Benjamin Baxter, which was located over what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Langwarrin and Langwarrin South. By the time Liardet had taken out his depasturing license for the Frankston area in 1847 an unofficial fishing village was also developing around its foreshore.|$|E

25|$|In July 1894, Holmes {{was arrested}} and briefly incarcerated for the first time, on the charge of selling mortgaged goods in St. Louis, Missouri. He was {{promptly}} bailed out, but while in jail he {{struck up a conversation}} with a convicted outlaw named Marion Hedgepeth, who was serving a 25-year sentence. Holmes had concocted a plan to swindle an insurance company out of $10,000 by <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> policy on himself and then faking his death. Holmes promised Hedgepeth a $500 commission in exchange for the name of a lawyer who could be trusted. Holmes was directed to a young St. Louis attorney named Jeptha Howe. Howe was in practice with his older brother, Alphonso Howe, who had no involvement with Holmes or Pitezel or their fraudulent activities. Jeptha Howe, however, found Holmes' scheme brilliant. Nevertheless, Holmes' plan to fake his own death failed when the insurance company became suspicious and refused to pay. Holmes did not press the claim; instead, he concocted a similar plan with Pitezel.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, {{was sent}} to Singapore for jungle {{training}} {{in response to the}} threat of invasion from Indonesian President Sukarno. By March, the battalion was established along the Malaysia-Indonesia border in Borneo and conducting 10-day patrols in the jungle. On 27 April, 'B' Company's base on the hilltop village of Plamam Mapu, consisting of company headquarters, a mortar section, and one weak platoon of young soldiers, was attacked by 150 Indonesians supported by rocket launchers, mortars, rifle grenades, and machine guns from the surrounding hills. The accurate fire caused several casualties amongst the defenders. The Company Sergeant Major (CSM), John Williams, was in command of the defence. He kept moving around the base, attending to the wounded, reorganising the defenders to counter each attack, and firing illumination rounds from a 2-inch mortar. The Indonesians penetrated the wire, <b>taking</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> mortar position. CSM Williams crossed the open ground under fire to man a machine gun, which he used to engage the Indonesians inside the perimeter. Covered by the machine gun, the Paras counter-attacked and forced the Indonesians back. The Indonesians had located CSM Williams' machine gun, and in a second attack, it was subjected to heavy fire at point-blank range. Wounded and blinded in one eye, CSM Williams returned fire, defeating the second attack. He then led a fighting patrol to attack two groups of Indonesians seen approaching the base.|$|E

In the arena where his horrific injury occurred nine months earlier, Redhage scored a game-high 26 points to lead the Wildcats to a 102–69 win. After just narrowly missing out on the opening round's Player of the Week award, Redhage went on to earn Player of the Week honours for Round 2 after recording 21 points, seven rebounds and four assists in a 92–76 win over the Melbourne Tigers on 14 October 2011. Redhage concluded the season by earning Player of the Week honours for Round 25 after scoring 19 points and adding seven rebounds, two steals, one assist and one blocked shot to help the Wildcats finish the regular season with a 72–71 road win over Melbourne. With a 19–9 record, the Wildcats entered the NBL Finals as the second seed. After defeating the Gold Coast Blaze 2–1 in the semi-finals, the Wildcats moved on to the NBL Grand Final series, where they faced the New Zealand Breakers. After losing to the Breakers in Game 1 in Auckland, the Wildcats looked down and out in Game 2 in Perth also. All looked lost for Perth in Game 2, who trailed the Breakers for much of the game, but the Wildcats snatched a thrilling one-point lead with less than a minute to play and held on to defeat the Breakers 87–86. Redhage forced the NBL Grand Final to a third and deciding game with a memorable final-second block on Breakers guard C. J. Bruton.
