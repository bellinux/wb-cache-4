50|$|The {{thallium}} halides include monohalides, where thallium has {{oxidation state}} +1, trihalides where thallium generally has oxidation state +3 and some intermediate halides with mixed +1 and +3 oxidation states. These materials find use in specialized optical settings, such as focusing elements in research spectrophotometers. Compared {{to the more}} common zinc selenide-based optics, materials such as <b>thallium</b> <b>bromoiodide</b> enable transmission at longer wavelengths. In the infrared, this allows for measurements as low as 350 cm−1 (28 µm), whereas zinc selenide is opaque by 21.5 µm and ZnSe optics are generally only usable to 650 cm−1 (15 µm).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thallium</b> <b>bromoiodide</b> and {{thallium}} bromochloride {{are mixed}} salts of thallium(I) {{that are used}} in spectroscopy as an optical material for transmission, refraction and focusing of infrared radiation. The materials were first grown by R. Koops in the laboratory of Olexander Smakula at the Carl Zeiss Optical Works, Jena in 1941. The red bromoiodide was coded KRS-5 [...] and the colourless bromochloride, KRS-6 [...] and this is how they are commonly known. The KRS prefix is an abbreviation of “Kristalle aus dem Schmelz-fluss”, (crystals from the melt). The compositions of KRS-5 and KRS-6 approximate to [...] and [...] KRS-5 is the most commonly used, its properties of being relatively insoluble in water and non-hygroscopic, make it an alternative to KBr, CsI and AgCl.|$|E
