40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the <b>time</b> <b>separations</b> of events is a fundamental problem {{in the design and}} evaluation of discrete event systems. Important progresses have been made based on the event rule system model in the last decade. The existing results for event rule systems with min and max constraints can be summarized briefly as: the exact evaluation of <b>time</b> <b>separations</b> for acyclic systems is NP-complete; for cyclic systems, the structural condition of being tightly coupled is sufficient for long-term <b>time</b> <b>separations</b> of events to be bounded. In this paper, we establish a necessary and sufficient structural boundedness condition—uniformity for cyclic event rule systems with both min and max constraints. Tightly coupled systems are shown to be a special class of uniform systems. The well-known CAS algorithm for finding bounds on long-term <b>time</b> <b>separations</b> is adapted to find finite bounds for uniform systems.

50|$|If {{the height}} of the {{topography}} is already known, the topographic phase contribution can be calculated and removed. This has traditionally been done in two ways. In the two-pass method, elevation data from an externally derived DEM is used in conjunction with the orbital information to calculate the phase contribution. In the three-pass method two images acquired a short time apart are used to create an interferogram, which is assumed to have no deformation signal and therefore represent the topographic contribution.

40|$|Abstract. The {{two-point}} {{function for}} tensor metric perturbations around de Sitter spacetime including one-loop corrections from massless conformally coupled scalar fields is calculated exactly.

Moreover, in contrast to existing results for tensor perturbations, ours is manifestly invariant {{with respect to the}} subgroup of de Sitter isometries corresponding to a simultaneous time translation and rescaling of the spatial coordinates. Having selected the right initial state for the interacting theory via an appropriate i prescription is crucial for that. Finally, we show that although the two-point function is a well-defined spacetime distribution, the equal-time limit of its spatial Fourier transform is divergent. Therefore, contrary to the well-defined distribution for arbitrary <b>time</b> <b>separations,</b> the power spectrum is strictly speaking ill-defined when loop corrections are included...|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} the dynamical two-point spin correlation {{functions of the}} transverse Ising quantum chain at finite (non-zero) temperature, in the universal region near the quantum critical point. They are correlation functions of twist fields in the massive Majorana fermion quantum field theory. At finite temperature, these are known to satisfy a set of integrable partial differential equations, including the sinh-Gordon equation. We apply the classical inverse scattering method to study them, finding that the ``initial scattering data'' corresponding to the correlation functions are simply related to the one-particle finite-temperature form factors calculated recently {{by one of the}} authors. The set of linear integral equations (Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equations) associated to the inverse scattering problem then gives, in principle, the two-point functions at all space and <b>time</b> <b>separations,</b> and all temperatures.

50|$|In {{planetary}} science, a light curve {{can be used}} {{to derive}} the rotation period of a minor planet, moon, or comet nucleus. From the Earth there is often no way to resolve a small object in the Solar System, even in the most powerful of telescopes, since the apparent angular size of the object is smaller than one pixel in the detector. Thus, astronomers measure the amount of light produced by an object as a function of time (the light curve). The <b>time</b> <b>separation</b> of peaks in the light curve gives an estimate of the rotational period of the object. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightnesses (the amplitude of the light curve) can be due to the shape of the object, or to bright and dark areas on its surface. For example, an asymmetrical asteroid's light curve generally has more pronounced peaks, while a more spherical object's light curve will be flatter. This allows astronomers to infer information about the shape and spin (but not size) of asteroids.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{theory of}} relativity, the {{conceptual}} observer is at a geometric point in both {{space and time}} {{at the apex of}} the 'light cone' which observes the events laid out in time as well as space. Different observers may disagree on whether two events at different locations occurred simultaneously depending on whether the observers are in relative motion (see relativity of simultaneity). This theory depends upon the idea of time as an extended thing and has been confirmed by experiment, thus giving rise to a philosophical viewpoint known as four dimensionalism. Although the contents of an observation are time-extended, the conceptual observer, being a geometric point at the origin of the light cone, is not extended in time or space. This analysis contains a paradox in which the conceptual observer contains nothing, even though any real observer would need to be the extended contents of an observation to exist. This paradox is partially resolved in relativity theory by defining a 'frame of reference' to encompass the measuring instruments used by an observer. This reduces the <b>time</b> <b>separation</b> between instruments to a set of constant intervals.|$|E

50|$|FDOA-FDOA {{geolocation}} {{is accomplished}} by using three satellites, or by using time separated measurements on two satellites. The <b>time</b> <b>separation</b> can {{be as little as}} 5 minutes or as much as an hour or more. Again, the two FDOA lines are used to find a crossing point, or target location. FDOA-FDOA geolocation is necessary for CW signals. Geolocation on highly inclined satellites, either one of both being used in the measurement, will result in more accurate results by performing FDOA - FDOA geolocation. This is due to a large difference in relative motion, leading to a large difference in relative frequency between the two satellites. A related point is the error to FDOA-FDOA calculation contributed by ephemeris uncertainty is relatively small. Moving targets {{are not likely to be}} located using FDOA methods, unless using a highly inclined satellite. FDOA - FDOA geolocation has an interesting weakness in that for some amount of time per day, the two satellites used have very little differential frequency. This is due to the cyclical movement of the satellites. During those periods, FDOA measurements will not be ideal. In addition, the small amount of frequency difference being measured is much harder to accurately measure than the time differences.|$|E

40|$|While {{there has}} been much {{research}} on the study of global virtual teams and global software teams, {{there has been}} practically no research on the nuances of <b>time</b> <b>separation.</b> We present three converging perspectives on this topic: (a) a view from practices and tactics of global teams; (b) a theoretical view from coordination theories; and (c) a view from our prior research in which we modeled coordination costs for time-separated dyads. Practice suggests that <b>time</b> <b>separation</b> arises not only from time-zone differences but also from factors such as nonoverlapping weekend days and holidays, shifts, and different working schedules. It also suggests that teams employ various coping tactics when faced with <b>time</b> <b>separation</b> – synchronous, asynchronous, and education. Theory suggests that communication is necessary to coordinate and that effectiveness of communication is hampered, both in quality and timeliness, when teams are separated by time. Our model, based on coordination theory, suggests that coordination costs contain four main components – communication, clarification, delay, and rework – and that the various aspects of time-separated work have different effects on each of these components. Our convergent view from these three perspectives shows that distance separation is symmetric – i. e. distance (A,B) = distance (B,A) – while <b>time</b> <b>separation</b> is asymmetric, which affects the planning of team interactions; that the timing of activities matters in time-separated contexts but not in contexts with only distance separation; and that vulnerability costs (i. e. resolving misunderstandings and rework) increase with <b>time</b> <b>separation.</b> Copyright © 200...|$|E
