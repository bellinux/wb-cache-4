Once, the sage saw a hunter named Gulika stealing the golden plates of the temple of Vishnu at Sauvira. Gulika tried to kill the sage. Then Uttanka informed Gulika that the sin of murder would be <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>through</b> many births to expiate his sin. Hearing this the hunter was penitent and fell dead. Uttanka then sprinkled water from the holy Ganges on the hunter's corpse, which restored Gulika who then attained Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu. As advised by Vishnu, Uttanka went to Badari, performed tapas and attained Vaikuntha himself.|$|E

25|$|Lamptey joined Venezia in Italy {{and later}} Unión de Santa Fe in Argentina. There, {{he and his}} wife had their third child, Diego. But soon, Diego died of a rare disease. A major {{emotional}} blow was also the fact that Lamptey wanted to bury his son in Ghana, but the authorities declined. Heartbroken, Lamptey temporarily gave up football. After unsuccessful stints at Ankaragücü and União Leiria, Lamptey got himself a new German player agent who transferred him to SpVgg Greuther Fürth. However, Lamptey and his wife were unhappy there, unable <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>through</b> the culture shock in Germany. Lamptey was not entirely unsuccessful, being a reliable backup, but was found too fragile for the rough Second Bundesliga. He was also reportedly ignored by his German colleagues, and once, a colleague flat out refused to sleep in the same hotel room as him. This blatant racism shocked Lamptey, but even worse was the fact that his child Lisa also died soon after birth. Also Lamptey's second dead child was buried abroad, in Germany. The Lampteys soon left for Asia.|$|E

500|$|Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were {{captured}} {{before they reached}} Allied lines, and they later joined Bouck {{and the rest of}} the platoon in prison. The men barely survived, most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition. When Task Force Baum from Patton's 4th Armored Division attempted to liberate the camp, Captain Abe Baum was surprised at the large number of prisoners and was unable to rescue them all. Almost all of Baum's unit was captured; Bouck was recaptured and was finally released one week before the war ended. He was too weak to file a combat report, and hospitalized for several months after the war ended. He did not think his men had accomplished that much.

500|$|Rand's {{first major}} {{success as a}} writer came in 1943 with The Fountainhead, a romantic and {{philosophical}} novel that she wrote {{over a period of}} seven years. The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as [...] "second-handers"—those who attempt <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>through</b> others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest. Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.|$|E

2500|$|The letter {{includes}} no Christian {{themes and}} the author is presumed to be a pagan. Some scholars see the reference to {{the execution of the}} [...] "wise king" [...] of the Jews as an early non-Christian reference to Jesus. Criteria that support the non-Christian origin of the letter include the observation that [...] "king of the Jews" [...] was not a Christian title, and that the letter's premise that Jesus lives on based on the wisdom of his teachings is in contrast to the Christian concept that Jesus continues <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>through</b> his resurrection.|$|E

2500|$|The non-Christian {{origin of}} the letter is {{supported}} by the observation that [...] "king of the Jews" [...] was not a Christian title during the time period the letter was written. The statement in the letter that the wise king lives on because of the [...] "new law" [...] he laid down is also seen as an indication of its non-Christian origin, for it ignores the Christian belief that Jesus continues <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>through</b> his resurrection. Another viewpoint is that he could be referring to the resurrection recorded in Jesus's teachings which say he lived on, thus establishing his [...] "new law" [...] (possibly paralleling the [...] "New Covenant").|$|E
