50|$|All Trans-Oceanic {{vessels that}} enter the Great Lakes are {{required}} to manage ballast water and ballast tank residuals with ballast water to clear out and exchange for <b>tank</b> <b>flushing.</b> Management and procedures reduce the density and richness of biota effectively in ballast waters and thus {{reduce the risk of}} transporting organisms {{from other parts of the}} world to non-native areas. Although most ships do ballast water management not all are able to clear the tanks. In an emergency when residual organisms are not able to be cleaned, vessel workers use sodium chloride brine to treat the ballast tanks. Vessels arriving in the Great Lakes, and North Sea ports, were exposed to high concentrations of sodium chloride until the mortality rate of 100% is reached. Results show that an exposure of 115% of brine is extremely effective treatment resulting in a 99.9 mortality rate of living organisms in ballast tanks regardless of the type of organism. There was a median of 0%. About 0.00-5.33 of organisms are expect to survive treatment of the sodium chloride.The Ballast Water Management Convention, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on 13 February 2004, aims to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another, by establishing standards and procedures for the management and control of ships' ballast water and sediments. This will enter into force worldwide on 8 September 2017. Under the Convention, all ships in international traffic {{are required to}} manage their ballast water and sediments to a certain standard, according to a ship-specific ballast water management plan. All ships will also have to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast water management certificate. The ballast water management standards will be phased in over a period of time. As an intermediate solution, ships should exchange ballast water mid-ocean. However, eventually most ships will need to install an on-board ballast water treatment system.A number of guidelines have been developed to facilitate the implementation of the Convention.The Convention will require all ships to implement a Ballast Water and Sediments Management Plan. All ships will have to carry a Ballast Water Record Book and will be required to carry out ballast water management procedures to a given standard. Existing ships will be required to do the same, but after a phase-in period.|$|E

The <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> (provided by Keramo-Steinzeug, Belgium) consists of a tank of 1 m height, having a diameter of 1200 mm and a volume of about 450 liter, resulting in a flushing discharge inbetween approximately 28 and 18 l/s that lasts for at least 21 seconds. The results are presented in terms of generated shear stresses and flushing lengths, depending on the pipe slope and diameter. The analysis contains both maximum shear stresses that are obtained during a small time interval and minimum shear stresses that are obtained during a larger time interval.

40|$|Assessing in-sewer {{sediment}} accumulation, {{which causes}} {{problems such as}} loss of hydraulic capacity of sewers and pollution consequences when re-suspended by peak flows, is becoming more in concern and is important in urban drainage design and maintenance. An evaluation based on simulations carried out with InfoWorks CS regarding application of a <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> {{as a tool for}} eroding deposited sediments from a simple sewer network is presented. The hydrodynamic modelling is comprised of implementing InfoWorks CS (Wallingford Software, UK) to assess the eroding capability of the generated flush waves regarding sediment removal and transport, applying the model based on the shear stress estimation in the software (the KUL model developed by Bouteligier et al., 2002). The simulations were initially done for a simple network composed of one straight conduit partitioned into 5 pipes with lengths equal to 10 m. Various combinations of pipe diameter, pipe slope, sediment characteristics, and DWF in the network was considered. Regarding the dry weather sediment build-up modelling, it was important to reach an equilibrium condition before any implementation of <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> would be considered. Initially, the effect of flush waves emitted from one <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> implemented at the most upstream manhole on sediment removal was analysed. Various flushing events were assumed (i. e. 1 flush, 7 flushes with 5 min intervals, and 10 flushes with 10 min intervals). After the flushing events occurred in the network, their effects on sediment transport were assessed. Whenever the upstream <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> was found incapable of generating required criterion for sediment erosion and transport through the network, more <b>flush</b> <b>tanks</b> were proposed to be applied in downstream manholes. Next, having implemented more <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> in potentially effective locations, the results for sediment erosion and transport in the network was analysed and the positive and negative outcomes of such applications were assessed. Afterwards, in the second phase, few more pipes (as branches) were added to the initial network and the same analyses were repeated to evaluate the overall effects of added parts on sediment build-up and transport. The final aim was to evaluate whether by implementing <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> in such a simple network, erosion of the settled particles and removing them out of the system could be reached. Whether a <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> was efficient in removing and transporting sediments from a part of the sewer network was related to various parameters such as sediment characteristics and the flush interval. In fact, it was understood that the type of sediments and their characteristics (mainly the particle size and density) and other parameters with relevant effects on the overall hydraulic characteristics of the sewer network need to be carefully considered in sediment transport modelling in order to reach to suitable modelling results. In an overall perspective, the capability of such <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> to produce effective forces for removal of the settled particles in sewer pipes is well accepted. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Prevention of sewer {{sediment}} accumulation, {{which can}} cause major sewer operational problems, is imperative and has been an immense concern for sewer designers. So far, researchers have mostly attempted to investigate the conditions where sewer systems can operate under self-cleansing condition, this way neglecting the essential attention {{that has to be}} addressed to sediment deposition patterns which occur in sewer reaches under various sewer geometrical and hydraulic conditions. To account for the effects of sediment formation in sewer systems, an appropriate sediment transport modelling with the ability to determine the location and depth of sediment deposit is needed. Besides, in order to prescribe proper solutions for the removal of the deposited layers these models need to appropriately analyse the in-sewer sediment transport patterns. In this regards, a validated numerical model incorporating shock-capturing TVD-McCormack scheme, developed in the University of Catania, Italy, is utilized in this research to help determine the sediment accumulation patterns in rectangular sewer channels, and to evaluate the sediment transport capacities that can be reached by implementing flushing devices and in particular the Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> (manufactured in Germany). Initially, the simulations are carried out to obtain the sediment bed deposition along the rectangular flumes (with geometries close to sewers) in stormwater sewer conditions (specifying a particular dry-weather period). This is followed by simulating the sediment heights after erosion by successive flushes in order to inspect the eroded sediment volume from the deposited bed and the cleaned channel lengths achieved by means of the applied flushes. Moreover, the sediment entrainment and bed-load transport due to flushing is also investigated in sewer channels with uniform bed layers under stormwater and combined sewer environments. It is discovered that in channels with widths up to 500 mm and sufficient bed slope (e. g. 20 , which might be the case in quite a number of stormwater sewer networks) 20 to 50 flushes by Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> can lead to the erosion of deposited sediment layers with a length between 50 and 100 m. Besides, 50 successive flushes demonstrated sufficient capacity to completely erode up to (and possibly more than) a length of 20 m of a 4 cm thick uniform bed layer composed of medium grit particles, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 5 mm, in stormwater sewer channels with widths up to 250 mm with minimum inverted slope of 8  or higher. Under the same conditions, a bed composed of coarser particles, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 8 mm, only the upper 2. 5 cm of the 4 cm thick bed will erode. Under combined sewer conditions, 50 successive flushes will erode over a length of at least 20 m a 5 cm uniform bed layer composed of fine combined sewer sediment, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 08 mm, &# 961;s&# 8804; 1600 kg/m 3, in channels with widths up to 500 mm with inverted slope of 5  or higher. In channels of 100 m length or longer, and considering an inverted slope in the range 2  to 8 , 50 successive flushes seem to be deficient in scouring a 2. 5 cm thick sediment bed. In general terms it is discovered that Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> are able to remove over a distance of 50 m the uniform sediment layers with depths below 4 cm in combined sewers with widths smaller than 250 mm. In a subsequent investigation, the InfoWorks CS software (Innovyze Co., UK) is utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the flushes from Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> in increasing the required sediment scouring forces, particularly the bottom shear stresses, in sewer pipes. Initially, the effect of the flushes in long pipe-series is assessed so that an intuition concerning the propagation of the flushes through long distances together with the corresponding shear stress enhancements can be attained. After that, the increase in bottom shear stresses by the flushes along 20, 50, and 100 -m channels is inspected. It is detected that in combined/stormwater sewers with diameters of 250 to 500 mm and inverted slopes smaller than 8 , and considering a sediment-cleansing threshold of 3. 385 N/m 2, the effective flushing lengths are limited to 20 to 42 m (respectively in wider and narrower channels). In sanitary networks (considering a self-cleansing threshold of 2 N/m 2), the sediment-cleansing efficiency is more discernible and given an inverted slope of maximum 8  the flushing length varies between 100 m in narrow channels down to 54 m in wider channels. In brief, Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> are believed to be suitable devices for generating self-cleansing hydraulic forces up to a distance of 50 m in narrow (i. e. width up to 250 mm) combined/stormwater sewers, even exceeding 100 m in narrow sanitary sewers with moderate inverted slopes of maximum 8 . Subsequently, through a novel attempt the most appropriate position of this flushing device in sewer networks for optimum efficiency in terms of self-cleansing maintenance is investigated with the application to a case study, i. e. sewer network of Erpe-Mere in Flanders, Belgium. In the latter attempt, the sediment deposition and erosion is modelled using InfoWorks CS with the double aim to investigate the effect of the flushes on the scour of deposited sediment beds and to discover the lengths along which a specific self-cleansing criterion can be maintained by the discharged flushes. The possible negative impacts in terms of sewer surcharging or manhole flooding is also inspected. The self-cleansing shear stresses were achieved in 61 sewers or in 69. 3 % of the pipes suitable for the installation of a <b>flushing</b> <b>tank,</b> covering a total cleansing length of 5788 m, representing 74. 4 % of total length of the pipes apt to the implementation of <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks.</b> It is deduced that <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> cannot always guarantee self-cleansing prevalence in all parts of a sewer network, even after increasing the number of <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> particularly in locations prone to sedimentation. Moreover, Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> do not guarantee the removal of sediments from places susceptible for sedimentation. For these locations in order to prevent the accumulation of sediments and once deposited for theirerosion the effectiveness of a Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> has to be assessed separately, using an appropriate sediment transport modelling tool. In this accordance, it is agreed that InfoWorks CS is incapable of properly simulating the sediment bed development (deposition phase) and the change in sediment heights during flushing operations in sewer channels. In the end, through an unexampled attempt the two numerical models, i. e. InfoWorks CS being a commercial software and the Catania model as a specialized research-based numerical model, developed for different type of objectives and circumstances, are compared for identical channels with respect to the simulated hydraulic components and sediment deposition patters. Accordingly, the application of the Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> in this sewer network is evaluated with reference to the sediment deposition results achieved earlier by the Catania numerical model, so that by learning the potential spots with the highest sediment deposition likelihood the implementation of these <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> can be optimized. This would require sediment transport and hydraulic modelling schemes to be integrated. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} population, {{cities and towns}} {{all over the world}} usually results in the {{over-exploitation}} of resources and increased pollution. Water service providers (WSPs) are required to provide adequate sanitation to the community, taking into consideration technical, social, economic and environmental issues. Therefore, WSPs are faced with increasingly complex objectives and demands when making decisions related to asset investment. Sewer systems handle two types of water that require drainage: (sanitary) wastewater and stormwater. These two types of water typically convey different classes of solids into the system. The presence of these solids which include sediment in systems causes operational problems: loss of hydraulic capacity, in-pipe septicity and contribute to the pollutants in foul flushes. This leads to significant economic and environmental impact on stakeholders and the area into which storm water is discharged. This paper demonstrates a wide variety of effective strategies for addressing sewer sediment management to improve existing infrastructure and develop new systems using hydraulic modelling and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Sediment management generally relies on low technology practices that are applied by individuals, municipalities and industrial establishments. In the UK the current practices to control sediment in urban drainage catchments entail street, gully and sewer cleaning. Other techniques like (e. g. sediment traps, <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> and <b>flushing</b> gates) have been considered elsewhere as an effective method of controlling sediment deposition in the sewer provided regular cleansing and maintenance are carried out (Ashley et al, 2004). There are six options being considered for the management of sewer sediment for this study. The first two are to control the solids entering the sewer system, three options are considering managing the sediment in the sewers and the final option is to manage the sediment {{at the end of the}} pipe at the wastewater treatment plant (WTP). The study has calculated the mass flow analysis (MFA) of solids that enter the sewer system using detailed hydraulic modelling. The dynamic model provides inputs needed by other components of the study in describing the life cycle assessment of sediment management options in sewer systems using life cycle assessment via the SimaPro software. The LCA goal of the reported study is to evaluate the energy use, resource consumption, pollutant emissions and the consequent environmental impacts of alternative solids management scenarios. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{evaluation}} {{was performed}} by Pro 2 Serve {{in accordance with the}} Technical Specification for an Engineering Evaluation of the Proposed Alternative Salt Transfer Method for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (BJC 2009 b). The evaluators reviewed the Engineering Evaluation Work Plan for Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Residual Salt Removal, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (DOE 2008). The Work Plan (DOE 2008) involves installing a salt transfer probe and new drain line into the Fuel Drain <b>Tanks</b> and Fuel <b>Flush</b> <b>Tank</b> and connecting them to the new salt transfer line at the drain tank cell shield. The probe is to be inserted through the tank ball valve and the molten salt {{to the bottom of the}} tank. The tank would then be pressurized through the Reactive Gas Removal System to force the salt into the salt canisters. The Evaluation Team reviewed the work plan, interviewed site personnel, reviewed numerous documents on the Molten Salt Reactor (Sects. 7 and 8), and inspected the probes planned to be used for the transfer. Based on several concerns identified during this review, the team recommends not proceeding with the salt transfer via the proposed alternate salt transfer method. The major concerns identified during this evaluation are: (1) Structural integrity of the tanks - The main concern is with the corrosion that occurred during the fluorination phase of the uranium removal process. This may also apply to the salt transfer line for the Fuel <b>Flush</b> <b>Tank.</b> Corrosion Associated with Fluorination in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Fluoride Volatility Process (Litman 1961) shows that this problem is significant. (2) Continued generation of Fluorine - Although the generation of Fluorine will be at a lower rate than experienced before the uranium removal, it will continue to be generated. This needs to be taken into consideration regardless of what actions are taken with the salt. (3) More than one phase of material - There are likely multiple phases of material in the salt (metal or compound), either suspended through the salt matrix, layered in the bottom of the tank, or both. These phases may contribute to plugging during any planned transfer. There is not enough data to know for sure. (4) Probe heat trace - The alternate transfer method does not include heat tracing of the bottom of the probe. There is a concern that this may cool the salt and other phases of materials present enough to block the flow of salt. (5) Stress-corrosion cracking - Additionally, there is a concern regarding moisture that may have been introduced into the tanks. Due to time constraints, this concern was not validated. However, if moisture was introduced into the tanks and not removed during heating the tanks before HF and F 2 sparging, there would be an additional concern regarding the potential for stress-corrosion cracking of the tank walls...|$|R
3000|$|... using {{a variety}} of {{different}} methods, suggest that potential potable water savings from these practices could be significant. For example, Hermann and Schmida (1999) estimated that the average household could reduce potable water demand by 30 – 60 % using roof runoff harvested in a 4 – 6  m 3 <b>tank</b> for toilet <b>flushing.</b> Zhang et al. (2009) observed that harvesting all roof runoff for use in toilet flushing can reduce potable water consumption in residential buildings by about 25 %. The researchers such as De Winnaar et al. (2007) and Ziadat et al. (2012) have used GIS and remote sensing (RS) to locate sites suitable for macro-catchment RWHS schemes. James Grant et al. (2018) used an approach to quantifying rainwater harvesting potential using imagery, GIS and LiDAR data (Light Detection and Ranging—is an RS method used to examine the surface of the Earth).|$|R
