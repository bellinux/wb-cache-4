5|$|Once {{the prison}} {{came under the}} control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were {{transferred}} to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> initially held in the hospital building, and then in their own walled-off section of the prison, with cells in the kitchen and wash house buildings. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> tasked with washing and mending prisoners' clothing, which was considered hard work.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E
5|$|All {{but four}} of the women from Lidice were {{deported}} immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp (four were pregnant– they were subjected to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> then sent to the concentration camp). Some children were chosen for Germanization, and 81 were killed in gas vans at the Chełmno extermination camp. Both towns were burned and Lidice's ruins were levelled. At least 1,300 people were massacred after Heydrich's death.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence.

5|$|The {{party of}} Behar {{survivors}} {{who had been}} landed at Tanjung Priok were initially interred in prisoner of war camps in Java; the male prisoners were sent to a camp near Batavia and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> held in a female camp nearby. After {{all the members of}} the group had been interrogated, the survivors were separated and sent to other camps in Java or to work as slave labourers in Japan.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> not {{positively}} identified until a {{week after}} their bodies' discovery, by which time they had been reported missing in Ohio by husband and father, Hal Rogers. On June 8, a housekeeper at the Days Inn said that the women's room had not been disturbed, and the beds had not been slept in. The hotel manager contacted the police. Fingerprints found in the room were matched to the bodies; final confirmation of their identification came from dental records. Marine researchers at the University of South Florida estimated from currents and patterns that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> thrown from a boatand not from a bridge or dry landbetween two and five days before they were found. The Rogers car, a 1984 Oldsmobile Calais with Ohio license plates, was found at the boat dock by the Courtney Campbell Causeway.|$|E
50|$|In Finland, {{abortion}} was illegal until 1950, when the Parliament of Finland legalized abortions {{to preserve the}} physical or mental health of <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> under 16, if the fetus might <b>be</b> deformed, or <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> had <b>been</b> raped. Under pressure from the women's liberation movement and supportive editorials from most national newspapers, Finnish law was further liberalized in 1970. The 1970 law allowed abortion up to 16 weeks of pregnancy for broad socio-economic reasons, if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> younger than 17, if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> older than 40, if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> had already had four children, or if {{at least one parent}} would be unable to raise the child owing to disease or mental disturbance.|$|R

5|$|Women {{have also}} {{been the subject of}} abuse in health care research, such as the {{situation}} revealed in the Cartwright Inquiry in New Zealand (1988), in which research by two feminist journalists revealed that women with cervical abnormalities were not receiving treatment, as part of an experiment. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> not told of the abnormalities and several later died.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar. He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom he describes as highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> then told not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There is a certain degree of confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E
5|$|As the SAS {{operation}} concluded, the Chinooks ferried {{prisoners and}} bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would {{be identified and}} buried, and those prisoners identified as West Side Boys would be {{handed over to the}} Sierra Leonean Police. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys—the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified. A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault.|$|E

Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. After Khadija's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad {{is said to have}} asked for arrangements to marry both. Muhammad's marriages after the death of Khajida were contracted mostly for political or humanitarian reasons. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important families or clans whom it was necessary to honor and strengthen alliances with.|$|E
5|$|Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite In 1784, in Bordeaux, the man {{calling himself}} Count Alessandro di Cagliostro opened the first lodge of his Egyptian Rite masonry. This had the three degrees of normal French masonry (Apprentice, Companion and Master), {{but with a}} greatly different, more mystical ritual. Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he {{attempted}} to attract candidates wherever he went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, but women were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - males were admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba). On admission, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> told that they were now Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, at {{the urging}} of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{traveled}} with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the plants depicted in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers, however, classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature: German scholar Ernst Langlotz (1895–1978) thought that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> holding a type of rose; Picard recognizes the symbolism of Demeter and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy, possibly the opium poppy, the Oriental poppy, or the Iranian poppy. Careful examination of the thick 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837–1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (talus bones from goats or sheep used {{to play the game}} of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.|$|E
5|$|Members of the WSPU were {{sometimes}} heckled and derided for spoiling elections for Liberal candidates. On 18 January 1908, Pankhurst and her associate Nellie Martel {{were attacked by}} an all-male crowd of Liberal supporters who blamed the WSPU for costing them a recent by-election to the Conservative candidate. The men threw clay, rotten eggs, and stones packed in snow; <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> beaten and Pankhurst's ankle was severely bruised. Similar tensions later formed with Labour. Until party leaders made the vote for women a priority, however, the WSPU vowed to continue its militant activism. Pankhurst {{and others in the}} union saw party politics as distracting to the goal of women's suffrage and criticised other organisations for putting party loyalty ahead of women's votes.|$|E
