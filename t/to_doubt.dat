5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels to}} Utah {{to construct a}} profile on a convicted murderer (Finn) who is asking for the death sentence. Reconstructing the crime, Black begins <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> the man's guilt.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposedly}} higher {{status of}} cavalry in the 4th century is also open <b>to</b> <b>doubt.</b> This view is {{largely based on}} underestimating the importance of cavalry in the 2nd century. Cavalry always had higher status than infantry in the Principate: {{in the time of}} Domitian (r. 81–96), auxiliary cavalry was paid 20–40% more than auxiliary infantry.|$|E
5|$|A Simple Plan is a 1998 American neo-noir crime thriller film {{adapted by}} Scott B. Smith from his 1993 {{novel of the}} same name. Directed by Sam Raimi, it stars Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Set in rural Minnesota, A Simple Plan follows {{brothers}} Hank (Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Thornton), who, along with Jacob's friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), discover a crashed plane containing $4.4 million in cash. The three men {{go to great lengths}} to keep the money a secret but begin <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer {{argued that}} {{teaching}} some ideas to {{children at a}} young age could foster resistance <b>to</b> <b>doubting</b> those ideas later on.|$|R
5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he scored}} 129 {{points for the}} Warriors in 1986–87, Fleury's small stature led many teams <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> that he could play in the NHL. The Calgary Flames drafted him in the 8th round, 166th overall, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Upon {{completing}} his junior season in 1988, Fleury signed his first professional contract, worth C$415,000, and joined the Flames' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. He scored seven points in two regular season games, then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the Turner Cup championship.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies of}} morphology, the bluebuck has {{historically}} been classified as either a distinct species or as a subspecies of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1821. The Austrian zoologist Franz Friedrich Kohl pointed out the distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.|$|E

5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
5|$|In the flashbacks, Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) {{struggles with}} his ex-girlfriend Susan Lloyd (Tamara Taylor), who has asked Michael to sign away his {{paternal}} rights to their son, Walt. Though Michael initially resists, suing {{in order to}} keep his custody, he eventually relents as Susan persuades him <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> his own motivations and whether he is pursuing his own desires or Walt's best interests.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{featured}} {{arrangements of}} acoustic guitar, accompanied by piano, played by his sister, Bobbie, as well complementary arrangements of drums, harmonica and mandolin. The sparsely instrumented acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> {{the wisdom of}} releasing the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced {{and no more than}} a demo. However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications.|$|E

50|$|After the 1980 Surinamese coup d'état Dutch {{development}} {{funds were}} frozen, {{and the project}} was halted. Low bauxite market prices in the 1980s also led <b>to</b> <b>doubts</b> about the economic feasibility of the project.|$|R

5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus. It {{would have been very}} unusual for a former Domestic to be appointed to the subordinate position of a thematic strategos, and there is reason <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> the authenticity of the tale of Zaoutzes' seeing in Nikephoros a potential future emperor and offering the hand of an—otherwise unknown—daughter in marriage.|$|E
5|$|Quinn (Dianna Agron) begins <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> her {{decision}} to give her baby to Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), and re-considers her stance on raising the baby with Puck (Mark Salling) instead of Finn (Cory Monteith). She tells Terri she wants to keep the baby, but {{in an effort to}} change her mind, Terri's sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen) has Quinn babysit her three unruly sons. Quinn invites Puck to babysit with her and the two bond, however when Quinn discovers that Puck spent the evening sexting his ex-girlfriend Santana (Naya Rivera), she re-commits to having the baby adopted, believing her daughter deserves a better father.|$|E
5|$|The Thanhouser {{adaption}} notably foregoes {{the famous}} Shakespearean stage directions: Exit, pursued by a bear. and allows Antigonus a peaceful exit. Another {{difference in the}} production is that following the collapse and reported death of Hermione. In the play, the audience is aligns with Leontes' view and gives no reason <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> Hermione's death, but the Thanhouser adaptation shows the mechanism and conspiracy formed by showing Hermione's revival and departure. Instead of using the Shakespeare character of Time to frame the passage of time, the role is performed by an inter-title. The final scene is missing from the surviving print.|$|E

5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no good reason <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read {{in the context of the}} Christian belief in miracles, and it shows at the very least that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{domestic}} {{peace was}} shattered when Hogg's stepdaughter Jane Rosalind became romantically involved with Henry Hunt, {{the son of}} Leigh Hunt. Hunt had no clear employment prospects, causing Thomas and Jane <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> the wisdom of a union. Hogg was very gentle when discussing this with his stepdaughter, hoping to avoid treating her the way that Timothy Shelley had treated Percy Shelley years earlier, but Mary Shelley thought that Hogg took much too passive a stance. Thomas and Jane decided to send Jane Rosalind to France in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her, but she soon returned and married Hunt.|$|E

Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> his ability.|$|E

5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason <b>to</b> <b>doubt</b> that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E
