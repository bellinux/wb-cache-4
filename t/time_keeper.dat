5|$|Tessie Reynolds {{grew up in}} Brighton, {{the eldest}} of 11 children. Her father, R.J. Reynolds, was a 'cycle agent', who {{encouraged}} sports among his children. He {{was a member of}} National Cycling Union and Secretary of a cycling club, as well as umpire for professional races. Her mother ran a boarding house in Kemptown, which specifically catered for cyclists and which Reynolds helped at. In September 1893, when Reynolds was sixteen years old, she rode a man's bike from Brighton to London and back in a day. In fact, she took just 8 hours 30 minutes to cycle the , thereby setting a record. Her father acted as the <b>time</b> <b>keeper</b> for the ride.|$|E

50|$|Kang aids the Avengers and in {{the final}} battle kills the <b>Time</b> <b>Keepers</b> when they attempt to punish Immortus for failing. The Avengers resolve to strike against the <b>Time</b> <b>Keepers</b> even after they learn their enemies' motives, arguing that the <b>Time</b> <b>Keepers</b> only seek to {{eliminate}} those that might threaten them, {{when they do not}} even attempt to erase themselves, despite the existence of alternate timelines where they themselves became the Time Twisters. During a mass conflict where the Time-Keepers unleash the Avengers of the corrupted timelines against an army of Avengers drawn from the worlds where the heroes remained true to their original purpose, the <b>Time</b> <b>Keepers</b> attempt to 'force' Kang to become Immortus after they kill the future Immortus for his attempt to protect the Avengers. However, Kang's strength of will and the unique temporal conditions of the conflict results in a temporal backlash, culminating in Kang and Immortus being recreated as separate beings (compared to Immortus 'splitting' the original Human Torch into itself and the future Vision). When Rick is injured using the Destiny Force to destroy the Time-Keepers' equipment, Captain Marvel merges with Rick to save his life--the link with Marvel's future self resulting in Rick being unintentionally linked to Marvel's present self when he, Giant-Man and the Wasp return to their present--and all the Avengers are returned to their respective time lines with a lingering memory of the incident.|$|R

500|$|In {{what was}} billed as the [...] "biggest main event in sports entertainment," [...] the match pitted WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan {{defending}} the title against André the Giant (with Bobby Heenan). Howard Finkel introduced the guest ring announcer, Bob Uecker, who in turn introduced the guest <b>time</b> <b>keeper,</b> Entertainment Tonight host Mary Hart. The fans booed André heavily and pelted him and his manager Bobby Heenan with trash as they rode the cart to the ring. In contrast, Hogan, who walked to the ring, came out to a huge ovation. Approximately two minutes into the match, Hogan attempted to body slam André, but {{he was unable to}} lift The Giant and nearly lost the match when Andre fell on him and almost pinned him. After the match had battled back and forth, André gave Hogan an Irish whip {{to the far side of}} the ring and attempted a big boot on Hogan, but Hogan ducked it and came off the ropes to give André a clothesline to take him off his feet for the first time in the match. Hogan then [...] "Hulked up" [...] and scoop slammed the [...] Giant before hitting the ropes and executing his patented leg drop pin to get the win and retain the championship.|$|E

Midway through the match, all four men began brawling in the ring, and Muhammad Ali punched Piper in an attempt to restore order. After the match's order was restored, Orndorff and Piper had the offensive advantage. As Orndorff locked Hogan into a full nelson, Orton climbed the top rope to attempt to knock out Hogan. Instead, Orton mistakenly hit Orndorff, and Hogan pinned him to win the match. In frustration, Piper knocked out the in-ring official, Pat Patterson before he and Orton retreated backstage leaving Orndorff alone in the ring with Hogan, Mr T and Snuka.|$|E

30|$|Several biochemical, {{physiological}} and behavioral parameters exhibit periodical fluctuations.

Different <b>time</b> <b>keepers,</b> meaning rhythmic signals from the environment (e.g., the change between day light and dark, meal times), can synchronize the endogenous rhythms (e.g., interchange between sleep and awakening). This 24 -h period ‘circadian clock’ is developed to anticipate environmental changes associated with daylight cycles [1]. Serum melatonin, its urine metabolite 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT 6 s), cortisol and core body temperature rhythms are considered as circadian biomarkers, controlled by a common circadian clock located in the hypothalamic Suprachiasmatic Nuclei (SCN) [2, 3].|$|R
