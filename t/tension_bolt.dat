3000|$|FE {{modelling}} including mesh discretization, boundary conditions, loading method, {{and method}} of static FE analysis using ABAQUS standard of top- and seat-angle connections was discussed elaborately in the author’s previous literatures (Ahmed et al. 2001; Ahmed 2002). In those and other (Pirmoz et al. 2009) research articles, the stress-deformation pattern developed by FE analyses showed that plastic yielding initiated at {{the toe of}} the tension angle’s fillet, followed by yielding in the area under the <b>tension</b> <b>bolt</b> head for thinner angles (e.g., for the cases of 0.7 ex 3 / [...].- 0 pt 0.7 ex 8 ^" [...] angle thickness), and {{in the areas of}} tension bolthole for the cases of thicker angles. Thus, it is noted that as the tension angle thickness increases, the zone of plastic yielding moves toward the centreline of the bolthole of the vertical leg. Shen and Astaneh-Asl (1999) also found similar deformation history of the connections in their experimental programs and observed that plastic deformations were developed in the vertical leg of top-angle and horizontal leg of seat-angle for connections with thinner angles, whereas the plastic deformations were formed at the central line of the column bolts of top-angle’s vertical leg together with shank areas of bolts for relatively thick angles. Simultaneously, FE analysis results showed that the stresses higher than the yield point were generated in the bolt shank near the bolt head. It indicates that the nonlinear behaviour of the connection differs from some assumptions of Kishi–Chen’s power model. With this background, the place of formation of the upper plastic hinge in the top angle’s vertical leg has been revised and an additional plastic hinge is supplied in the tension bolts according to the results of tests (Shen and Astaneh-Asl 1999) and FE analyses (Ahmed et al. 2001; Ahmed 2002; Pirmoz et al. 2009) for the proposed prediction model in determining the ultimate connection moment.|$|E

Conventionally, a method similar to the flexural analysis of beam is sometimes applied on the assumption that <b>bolt</b> <b>tension</b> is proportional to the distance from neutral axis which is far from the actual stress condition. In this paper, an investigation has been carried out to find the effects of various parameters relating to flanged pipe joint connection, so that a definite guideline on determining the <b>bolt</b> <b>tension</b> can be developed.

40|$|The {{threaded}} fasteners {{are one of}} the most versatile methods for assembly of structural components. For example, in bridges large bolts are used to fix base columns and small bolts are used to support access ladders. Naturally not all bolts are critical for the operation of the structure. Fasteners loaded with small forces and present in large quantities do not receive the same treatment as the critical bolts. Typical maintenance operations such tension measurements, internal stress checking or monitoring of crack development are not practical due to cost and time constrains. Although failure of a single non-critical fastener is not a significant threat to the structure 2 ̆ 7 s stability, massive malfunction may cause structural problem such as insufficient stiffness or excessive vibrations. The health of bolted joints is defined by a single parameter: the clamping force (CF). The CF is the force that holds the elements of the joint together. If the CF is too low, separation and bolt fatigue may occur. On the other hand, excessive CF may produce damages in the structural members such as excessive distortion or breakage. The CF is generated by the superposition of the individual <b>tension</b> of the <b>bolts.</b> The <b>bolt</b> <b>tension,</b> also referred as bolt preload, is the actual force that is stretching the bolt body. Maintaining the appropriate <b>tension</b> in <b>bolts</b> ensures a proper CF and hence a good health of the joint. In this thesis, a novel methodology for estimating the <b>tension</b> in <b>bolts</b> using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) is investigated. The tension is estimated by using the reflection of SAWs created by the bolt head interference. Increments in the <b>bolt</b> <b>tension</b> raise the points of interaction between the waves and the bolt head (real area of contact), and hence the position of the reflective boundaries. The variations are estimated using the 2 ̆ 2 conventional linear synthetic array 2 ̆ 2 imaging technique. A singular transducer is actuated from predefined positions to produce an array of signals that are subsequently arranged and added to construct an acoustic image. Three sets of experiment are presented in this research for validating the proposed concept: tension estimation of a ¼ inch stainless steel bolt, a ½ inch stainless steel bolt and ¼ inch grade 8 bolt. Acoustic images of the surface of the clamped plate illustrate a clear trend in the position of the reflective boundary when torque is changed. In all cases, the torque increments increase the real area of contact and therefore the position of the reflective boundary. As expected, the real area of contact grew from the bolt head center to the perimeter, which causes an effect of apparent movement of the boundary. This research proves the potential of the ultrasonic imaging methodology to measure applied tension. The result showed that the system can be used to successfully inspect <b>tension</b> in <b>bolts</b> of ½ and ¼ inches. The methodology investigated in this thesis is the first steps towards the development of <b>bolt</b> <b>tension</b> sensor based on surface acoustic waves...|$|R
