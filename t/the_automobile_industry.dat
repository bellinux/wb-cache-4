5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industry.</b> In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E

40|$|The {{sustainability}} criterion {{in the manufacturing}} industries is imperative, especially in <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industries.</b> Currently, efforts are being made by the industries to mitigate CO 2 emission by the total vehicle weight optimization, machine utilization and resource efficiency. In lieu of this, {{it is important to}} understudy the manufacturing machines adopted in <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industries.</b> One of such machine is the hot stamping machine that is used for about 35 % of the manufacturing operations within <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industries.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> standardization and optimization of the hot stamping process could reduce the carbon footprint within <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industries.</b> This work understudied the on-delay timer functional valve of the hot stamping machine in order to determine various process parameters affecting it. The detailed physical model of the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic cylinder systems for the control is simulated and optimized for both the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic cylinder systems. Experimental and simulation model were established at the FESTO work station and FESTO FluidSIM® 5. 1 respectively to evaluate the effective velocity, accelerations, displacement, and flow rate for the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic actuator on both systems. Comparisons were made between pneumatic and electro-pneumatic cylinder systems on their characteristic curve in order to optimize the process variables. The result favours the electro-pneumatic cylinder systems in stability and in designing hot stamping machines. The result obtained could elucidate the understanding of the pressing arm of a hot stamping machine...|$|R

5|$|The Soviet {{rapid transit}} system {{was seen as}} the quickest, cleanest and {{cheapest}} way of urban transport, and eventually another point acquired greater significance; the authorities could allocate their resources from <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industry</b> to the rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of the country's diesel and petrol. Because rapid transit system usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming, the Soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide, with a further nine in construction when the Soviet Union collapsed. Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985. The country's rapid transit system was the most intensively used in the world.|$|E

5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industry.</b> There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industry</b> was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E

40|$|The {{questions}} {{in this article}} are directed at the relationship between internationalization and industrial relations. There was a shift in the constellation of actors in <b>the</b> world <b>automobile</b> <b>industry</b> in <b>the</b> 1980 s. The internationalization strategy of the Japanese companies became the dominant phenomenon. Public perception also shifted: instead of talking about the power and domination of the 'multinationals', the new topic of discussion was the management and production concept of the 'transplants'. The term 'transplant' has up to now primarly been used to refer to the internationalization of the production structures of Japanese manufacturers. This article deals with the more recent trends towards internationalization in <b>the</b> German <b>automobile</b> <b>industry</b> {{with a look at the}} same process in Japan. This reference does not only come from an interest in comparison.

Furthermore, an IT convergence index framework was developed for objectively analyzing the extent of IT convergence. Finally, the empirical analysis was carried out for <b>automobile</b> and shipbuilding <b>industries.</b> Consequently, as the product has higher relation with human life or safety such as <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industry’s</b> vehicle communication and the shipbuilding industry’s safety control, and its working activity is more complicated, {{it shows that the}} IT convergence is higher. And, as the product and process plays a bigger role in the industry and has a more fundamental function such as <b>the</b> <b>automobile</b> <b>industry’s</b> car body control and the shipbuilding industry’s propulsion power engine, it shows that the IT convergence is higher. In other words, it was analyzed that the IT convergence is proportional to the product/process’s importance in the industry.|$|R
