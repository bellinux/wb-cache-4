5|$|At 05:10, four German torpedo boats {{reached the}} Eastern Task Force and {{launched}} fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies. After attacking, the German vessels {{turned away and}} fled east into a smoke screen that had been laid by the RAF <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre. Allied losses to mines included USS Corry off Utah and USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft. In addition, many landing craft were lost.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, {{related in}} his memoirs that the Russian left was {{shifting}} position when the French Army arrived sooner than expected; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> redeployment of the Russian left. The construction of the redoubt and its purpose is still disputed by historians to this day.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Barton mainly {{played a}} {{defensive}} role, with a game based on tackling and tracking back <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> defence. As his career has progressed, {{he has begun}} to incorporate a more attacking approach to his play, which {{has resulted in a}} greater number of goals and assists, and his six goals from midfield made him Manchester City's leading scorer in the 2006–07 season, ahead of strikers Georgios Samaras, Bernardo Corradi, Émile Mpenza and Darius Vassell.|$|E

5|$|The plasma {{approximation}}: The plasma approximation applies {{when the}} plasma parameter, Λ, representing {{the number of}} charge carriers within a sphere (called the Debye sphere whose radius is the Debye screening length) surrounding a given charged particle is sufficiently high so as <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> electrostatic influence of the particle outside of the sphere.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{started the}} withdrawal, while the {{motorized}} Allied forces broke {{out from their}} bridgeheads and pursued the German units from behind. The rapid Allied advance posed a major threat for the Germans, who could not retreat fast enough. The Germans tried to establish a defense line at the Rhône <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> withdrawal of several valuable units there. The US 45th and 3rd Divisions were pressing to the north-west with uncontested speed, undermining Wiese's plan for a new defense line. Barjols and Brignoles were taken by the two American divisions on 19August, which also were about to envelop Toulon as well as Marseille from the north, cutting off the German units there.|$|E
5|$|The Ravagers and Quill's group {{join with}} the Nova Corps {{to confront the}} Dark Aster at Xandar, with Quill's group {{breaching}} the Dark Aster with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Gamora fights and defeats Nebula, who then escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster. The damaged Dark Aster crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.|$|E

5|$|The Shakespeare authorship {{question}} is the argument that someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> identity of the real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, {{all but a few}} Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and, for the most part, acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{then settled}} an {{incident}} involving {{the abuse of}} the protection afforded by icons of the princeps, in which the emperor's images were being used <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> guilty. Gaius Cestius Gallus brought a complaint into the Senate, and claimed he was being abused under this safeguard by Annia Rufilla. Drusus was soon brought in to weigh on the matter, for the Senate felt only {{a member of the}} imperial family could speak on such a delicate matter. At the request of many senators, Drusus had Rufilla arrested and imprisoned. Later, he was given credit for the condemnation of two Roman equites, Considius Aequus and Coelius Cursor, who had attacked the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of maiestas. It is unlikely that he himself was responsible, for every verdict was given by the Senate with Tiberius' authority, but this did not prevent his popularity.|$|E
5|$|Scientist David Banner has {{the idea}} to create super {{soldiers}} by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response, but General Thaddeus Ross denies him permission to use human subjects. Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After {{the birth of his}} son Bruce, he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process. Following a traumatic event, Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers. Years later, Bruce is a geneticist working with his girlfriend, Betty Ross, within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on nanomed research. The pair hopes to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low level Gamma radiation exposure to activate the nanomeds once they are introduced into a living organism. During routine maintenance of their appropriated gamma-ray spectrometer, a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> man and is exposed to a massive amount of gamma radiation.|$|E

5|$|The Muslim force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp. This was a strategic decision in order <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|The {{converted}} carrier aircraft were heavier {{versions of}} their land-based predecessors and this required {{a host of}} changes to Graf Zeppelins original design: the existing catapults needed modernization; stronger winches were necessary for the arresting gear; the flight deck, elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement. Changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well: installation of air search radar sets and antennas; upgraded radio equipment; an armored fighter director cabin mounted on the main mast (which in turn meant a heavier, sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin's added weight); extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center; a new curved funnel cap <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> fighter director cabin from smoke; replacing the single-mount 20mm AA guns with quadruple Flakvierling 38 guns (with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply) to improve overall AA defense; and additional bulges {{on either side of}} the hull to preserve the ship's stability under all this added weight.|$|E
5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty of {{challenges}} and little expansive football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. It took a while before Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly tackling the latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was {{on the receiving end of}} a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted <b>to</b> <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> ball and hold on to possession. Television replays showed Van Nistelrooy ran his studs down Cole's shins, but the striker was not punished by Riley despite the action being in full view of his assistant at the touchline.|$|E
