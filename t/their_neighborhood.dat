5|$|An {{example of}} {{territory}} was the Bridgeport community area, an ethnic Irish neighborhood {{just west of}} the Black Belt. The Irish had long patrolled <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> boundaries against all other ethnic groups, especially African Americans. One group known as the Hamburg Athletic Club, whose members included a 17-year-old Richard J. Daley, future mayor of Chicago, contributed to gang violence in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} of the station entrances are all south of 96th Street. In 2009, there was a debate over {{the placement of the}} location of the street entrances. Because 96th Street divides the neighborhoods of the Upper East Side to the south and East Harlem to the north, some residents of East Harlem stated that <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> was not served by the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E
5|$|Klein ISD creates {{attendance}} zones for neighborhoods {{within the}} boundaries of the district. All neighborhoods are zoned to a specific elementary school, intermediate school, and high school. When a new school opens, or a school becomes overcrowded, the district begins realigning and rezoning certain neighborhoods to ensure that there is balance among all schools. Students must attend the assigned schools for <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> with the exception of students who attend the International Business Academy at Klein Forest High School or the International Baccalaureate program at Klein Oak High School.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, 1991, a {{local group}} in Albany, New York, fought the government's {{plan to create}} a nuclear waste dump in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> It was staged by Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping (CARD) at the monthly meeting of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission in Albany. Here four {{children}} dressed up as Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, and presented a three-eyed fabric fish, which looked like Blinky, to the commission. In addition to that they performed a rap song, which explained {{the plot of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Born on August 9, 1982 in Lexington, Kentucky, Tyson Gay is {{the only}} son of Daisy Gay and Greg Mitchell. Athletic prowess {{was part of his}} family life; Gay's {{grandmother}} ran for Eastern Kentucky University and his mother Daisy also competed in her youth, though she was pregnant with her first child by her early teens. Gay's older sister, Tiffany, was a keen sprinter and had a successful high school career. Tiffany and Tyson Gay, encouraged by their mother, raced at every opportunity, training hard at school and on the hills in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> There was strong competition between the two, and Gay later said that his sister's quick reaction time inspired him to improve.|$|E
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the terminal was opposed by {{the residents of the}} Turtle Bay neighborhood, where it was planned to be located in, as it would have changed the character of <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Turtle Bay residents wanted the terminal moved to Grand Central. They also disliked the proposed traffic congestion the new terminal would bring. The MTA contended that its studies had shown that Third Avenue was the only feasible place to put the terminal, and there would have been too great of a concentration of rail lines at Grand Central. It concluded that having the LIRR going to Grand Central would further strain the Lexington Avenue Line. If it were on Third Avenue, passengers would have been more inclined to use the Second Avenue Subway, which was partially under construction at the time. On April 16, 1973, a Federal directive directed New York State to consider expanding and modernizing Grand Central before building the new terminal under Third Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E
50|$|A {{priority}} {{board is}} a group of elected citizen volunteers who meet on a regular basis to address neighborhood concerns and to take action {{to improve the quality of}} <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> They often act as the official citizen voice for <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> and advise the city on neighborhood concerns and problems. The priority board members take a role in planning and make recommendations to the city for development, revitalization, and the allocation of city funds.|$|R

25|$|During the Civil Rights Movement in {{the late}} 1950s and through the 1960s, Louisville was affected, as it had {{maintained}} a segregated society. Civil rights groups had undertaken a variety of actions to challenge that. In addition, black neighborhoods had declined during the economic downturn of the city. Urban renewal efforts undertaken for ostensible improvements had adversely affected the center of <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E

Crimes {{committed}} at The Retreat in the year prior to Martin's death had included eight burglaries, nine thefts, and one shooting. Twin Lakes residents said {{there were dozens of}} reports of attempted break-ins, which had created an atmosphere of fear in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initially Indecision played {{mostly in}} local clubs. Over time, {{a lot of}} the venues in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> closed down, which {{prompted}} them to take a larger step and lead to the bands integration into the New York City hardcore scene. In the early days, the band would often show up to gigs all in one car, with their equipment tied to the roof with Bungee cords.|$|E

Their first attempt was a romp entitled Henry Kissinger, Man on the Go. Cornel Wilde's The Naked Prey (1965) became their Zeimers in Zambia, which also featured Ethan as a native with a spear.|$|E
5000|$|In Israel, some ultra-Orthodox {{neighborhoods are}} barricaded on Shabbat to prevent driving. In Mea Shearim, {{residents}} {{have been known to}} throw stones at those driving through <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> on Shabbat. In Jerusalem and some other Israeli cities with large Orthodox populations, public buses do not operate during Shabbat. Part of the reason public funding of religious education is justified is that part of the population views it as [...] "sinful" [...] to drive on Shabbat, and is annoyed by those who drive through <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> on the Shabbat.|$|R

25|$|On August 8, however, Cleveland {{police arrested}} five truck drivers for {{improperly}} passing, and two for having loads which spewed earth on city streets. When Hunkin-Conkey officials protested the arrest, Mayor Celebrezze backed the police department. The arrests outraged Kinsman residents, who {{saw them as}} evidence that the construction company had violated the terms of the August 3 agreement. A group of 65 Kinsman residents blocked Kinsman Road on August 11, refusing to allow any dump trucks through <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> The residents also accused the company of continuing to send truck through <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> until 4:00 AM. Truckers complained that the agreement only forced them to stop departing the construction site at 2:00 AM, which meant that they might depart Kingsbury Run at 3:00 AM or 4:00 AM. They refused to begin their work day at 6:00 AM {{to make up for the}} lost hours. Forcing them to cut their work day by two hours would require overloading their trucks, leading to more speeding, dangerous driving, and spills.|$|E
25|$|The church built several temples {{based on}} the two {{ordinance}} room plan, but added more square footage to accommodate an additional sealing room. These temples vary in size and style, although some look similar to the original design. Often plans were modified because local residents balked {{at the idea of}} such a large temple in <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> For example, the Sacramento temple was originally designed to be a much larger structure, but because of opposition, the design was changed to model the Newport Beach temple design.|$|E
25|$|The African-American {{population}} of Willingboro increased throughout the 1960s; by 1964 there were 50 African-American families. By 1970, African Americans represented about 11% of the population. During the early 1970s, several homeowners {{said they were}} approached by local real estate agents and told that <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> was becoming increasingly African-American and home values could decline {{if they did not}} sell quickly; a practice known as blockbusting. While the Human Relations Council could not prove these claims, it made recommendations to help foster better relations between ethnic communities in the township and calm concerns.|$|E
