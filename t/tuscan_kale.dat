50|$|It was {{originally}} made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover minestrone or vegetable soup {{from the previous}} day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, silverbeet, cavolo nero (<b>Tuscan</b> <b>kale),</b> onion and olive oil.|$|E
50|$|In <b>Tuscan</b> cuisine, lacinato <b>kale</b> {{is often}} used in ribollita ("twice cooked"), a thick, hearty soup made up of {{ingredients}} cooked for a meal the day before.|$|R

40|$|Dietary R-{{sulforaphane}} is {{a highly}} potent inducer of the Keap 1 /Nrf 2 /ARE pathway. Furthermore, sulforaphane is currently being used in clinical trials to assess its effects against different tumour processes. This study reports an efficient preparation of enantiopure R-sulforaphane based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of its natural precursor glucoraphanin. As an alternative to broccoli seeds, we have exploited <b>Tuscan</b> black <b>kale</b> seeds as a suitable source for gram-scale production of glucoraphanin. The defatted seed meal contained 5. 1 % (w/w) of glucoraphanin that was first isolated through an anion exchange chromatographic process, and then purified by gel filtration. The availability of glucoraphanin (purity ≈ 95 %, weight basis) has allowed us to develop a novel simple hydrolytic process involving myrosinase (EC 3. 2. 1. 147) in a biphasic system to directly produce R-sulforaphane. In a typical experiment, 1. 09 g of enantiopure R-sulforaphane was obtained from 150 g of defatted <b>Tuscan</b> black <b>kale</b> seed meal...|$|R
5000|$|Lacinato kale (called cavolo nero, {{literally}} [...] "black cabbage", in Italian {{and often}} in English) is {{a variety of}} kale with a long tradition in Italian cuisine, especially that of Tuscany. It {{is also known as}} <b>Tuscan</b> <b>kale,</b> Tuscan cabbage, Italian kale, dinosaur kale, black kale, flat back cabbage, palm tree kale, or black Tuscan palm. Lacinato kale has been grown in Tuscany for centuries, {{and is one of the}} traditional ingredients of minestrone and ribollita.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{spectrophotometric}} determination of total polyphenols, flavonoids, glucosinolates and antioxidant activity in seeds, seedlings and leaves of <b>Tuscan</b> black <b>kale.</b> The highest content of hytochemicals {{was observed in}} 10 days sprouts and antioxidant activity was maximum in 2, 4 days seedlings. Identification and characterisation of phytochemicals were performed by mass spectrometry (MS), high resolution and tandem MS with electrospray ionisation mode. Low-molecular-weight metabolites were evidenced in seeds while metabolites at high m/z range were detected in cotyledons and leaves. MS spectra evidenced different phenolic compounds (flavonoid caffeoyl glucose, hydroxycinnamic acid sinapine) and glucosinolates (glucoerucin, glucobrassicin and glucoraphanin) in function of developmental stage; galactolipids ω 3 and ω 6 were observed in leaves. Identification of stages with the highest phytochemicals content encourages the consumption of black kale sprouts and young leaves. Our research can support food and pharmaceutical industries for production of health promoting products from black kale...|$|R
