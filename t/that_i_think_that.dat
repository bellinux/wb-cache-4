25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Bush {{administration}} Press Secretary Dana Perino stated {{just after}} the incident that “I saw the reports about the school. I don’t have any information about <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we should not jump to conclusions and we should wait {{to find out what}} the evidence says... What we do know is that Hamas often hides amongst innocents and uses innocent people, including children, as human shields." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Tony Blair {{announced}} a new judicial inquiry, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, into the killing of 14 unarmed civil rights marchers in Derry in 1972. A previous investigation, the Widgery Tribunal, into the same event had been discredited. During {{the debate in the}} House of Commons, Trimble was one of few dissenting voices. He said [...] "I am sorry to have to say to the Prime Minister <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the hope expressed by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) that this {{will be part of the}} healing process is likely to be misplaced. Opening old wounds like this is likely to do more harm than good. The basic facts of the situation are known and not open to dispute." [...] Reporting in 2010, The Saville Inquiry confirmed that all of the 14 killings and 13 woundings were unjustified.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2015, Martin {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "To win over public opinion, Labour must reflect it. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> right? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> right. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> why they're all doing this synchronised frowning at poor repellent-ebullient Jeremy Corbyn and pretending he's a weirdo." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> my generation—myself, Jamie Thomas, Andrew Reynolds—we're {{the first}} street guys to ride these real big {{obstacles}} {{on a daily}} basis. It wasn't like we do it once for a video. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we all group up skating like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what sets us apart I suppose. The willingness to f—kin' try anything every day.|$|R
60|$|ELIZABETH And then--thanks to you--Mrs. Chilvers has {{had such}} {{excellent}} training in politics. It was <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> decided us.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{absolutely}} {{deny any}} such knowledge. And more than <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you are greatly mistaken as to her character." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do think}} that," [...] she replied, looking {{steadily}} into his eyes. [...] "I think more than <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your place is in Sing Sing prison." ...|$|E
60|$|Ray {{turned to}} me. There was {{a look in}} his eyes which I readily understood. At <b>that</b> moment <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hated him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} you should talk like <b>that,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have given good proof <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am no believer in vaccination." ...|$|R
50|$|Stevie and I {{have been}} hanging {{out a little}} bit lately, and we’ve been talking about <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> {{something}} that would happen this year as well. Oddly enough, I hate to even say it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the 40th anniversary of that is next year. Jeez! <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> possible? So we’ve been talking about it. Of course, we’ve been talking about it off and on for a long time, but Stevie seems really into the idea. So yes, I would say yes.|$|R
60|$|Nor would I now place these {{disclosures}} {{before the}} public eyes were if not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in the present crisis they will prove of value to the Allied cause.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{as she is}} for you, Fred; {{but then}} boys {{are so much more}} {{precious}} than girls, and besides they love to endanger themselves so much, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is reasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes it is, indeed," [...] Ralph answered. [...] "I {{believe that}} this is {{considered}} one of the most lovely spots on the whole river. I can't say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that railway, opposite, improves it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly know. Perhaps {{they would}} hardly do <b>that.</b> However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{we ought to}} make it legal now--as soon as {{you are able to}} go out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if you like, I {{will take}} her <b>that</b> ring. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{is a very}} generous offer on my part, for I {{do not like the}} responsibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She has behaved admirably, mother," [...] he said; [...] "you must {{acknowledge}} <b>that,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she {{is entitled to}} all the kindness we can show her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Eames," [...] said Madalina raising {{herself on}} her sofa, [...] "if you can not express {{yourself}} in language more suitable to the occasion and to the scene than <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you had better--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was indeed, dear. But when I say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Harold is {{not happy}} I mean in his daily life. Has it never struck you how thoughtful, he is at times, and how absent-minded?" ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{a little}} short, petulant 'Oh!' Bella complied. 'Oh!--Sophronia then--I don't mind telling you, Sophronia, that I am {{convinced}} I have no heart, as people call it; and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{sort of thing}} is nonsense.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Perry's {{work has}} been praised by Oprah Winfrey, who joined Perry in {{promoting}} Lee Daniels' film Precious (2009). She told an interviewer, [...] "I think Perry grew up being raised by strong, black women. And {{so much of what}} he does is really in celebration of <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what Madea really is: a compilation of all those strong black women <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know and maybe you do too? And so the reason it works is because people see themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, love,' said she, 'and {{what is the}} {{business}} about? You know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>that</b> to be best which you think to be best.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. At least, <b>I</b> mean <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should care}} {{to hand over}} my {{engagement}} ring so easily. It might be misapplied, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mr Melmotte. On {{matters such}} as <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I can see my own way. I have been in fault in coming in to the Board without {{understanding}} what duties I should have to perform--.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{know all}} your {{goodness}} and sympathy. Do not think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any bond is broken, or {{that anything is}} lost. We have been fed on the hillside, {{and now there are}} twelve baskets full of fragments remaining.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} English people {{argue that in}} England {{she would have been}} hanged. Personally I doubt <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> an English jury, not having the {{judicial}} loophole of 'Non Proven,' would have been bound to acquit her. What do you think?" ...|$|E
30|$|Ade: Yeah. They {{are like}} <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they are <b>that</b> kind of people.|$|R

6000|$|Ethelberta looked {{inclined}} to exclaim most vehemently against this; {{but what she}} actually did say was, '"Ribald"--what {{do you mean by}} <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you are aware what [...] "ribald" [...] means.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{can you say}} that? I admit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it {{is better}} to be {{beautiful}} than to be good. But on the other hand no one is more ready than I am to acknowledge that {{it is better to}} be good than to be ugly." ...|$|E
60|$|Algernon. Of course I {{admit that}} the faults were all on my side. But I must say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Brother John's coldness to me is peculiarly painful.

6000|$|... "Then we must die. But as for <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> neither men nor {{young women}} die for love now-a-days. If {{we love each}} other, we must do without each other, as people {{have to learn to}} do without most {{of the things that they}} desire." ...|$|E
3000|$|... “You could {{probably}} ask about … nerves, neuropathy, whether your feet or hands or fingers are still normal or tingly, numb, anything like <b>that,</b> because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> must happen {{quite a bit}} with chemo…” (01 – 04 -M- 59) [...]...|$|R
60|$|The {{man with}} the florid face seemed very much {{surprised}} at my words, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> <b>that</b> adventures of this sort were as common as I had been led by the master to expect.|$|R
