He then used stairways <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E

An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E

A traffic light that had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E

Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
