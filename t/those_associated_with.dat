5|$|Jeffrey Henderson {{writes that}} women {{were present in the}} theatre, citing Plato's Laws and Gorgias as saying that drama was {{addressed}} to men, women and children. Henderson also mentions later stories about Athenian theatre, such as the tale that Aeschylus' Eumenides had frightened women in the audience into miscarrying. Other evidence of the presence of women at the theatre in Athens includes the absence of surviving prohibitions against their attendance and the importance of women in Athenian rituals, especially <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Dionysus.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{was quite}} {{expensive}} in 2009; {{a course of}} treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90. In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as {{would be used to}} treat tuberculosis cost about USS$60.|$|E

5|$|After {{tracking}} eastward {{across the}} Philippines, Linfa reorganized and curved northeastward toward Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency anticipated heavy precipitation and strong winds {{in the island}} nation's southwestern regions. The agency also warned residents in low-lying areas of potential flooding. The JMA indicated the heightened possibility of landslides in the Tōhoku region due to a recent earthquake in the area. Due to the forecasted impacts and track, as many as 102domestic flights were cancelled in a single day, particularly <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> southwestern Japan. In addition, five ferry services were cancelled. Upon making landfall on Shikoku, Linfa became the first tropical cyclone since 1965 to strike Japan during May, {{as well as the}} third earliest tropical cyclone to make landfall on any of Japan's four main islands since standardized records began in 1951.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, {{a number of}} those convicted for collaborating with the Nazi {{occupiers}} were freed from prison. Sympathetic to their plight, Hergé lent money to some and aided others in getting jobs at Tintin magazine, much to Leblanc's annoyance. For instance, as well as lending him money, Hergé used his connections to secure Raymond de Becker a job in Switzerland as a book shop sales inspector. He also hired <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the Walloon Legion, and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison sentence for working at Le Nouveau Journal during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{events are}} {{continually}} occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> micrometeorites, {{as might be}} encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations. Tables of impacts recorded by video cameras exist for years since 2005 {{many of which are}} associated with meteor showers. Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 {{the great}} Greek herbals had been {{translated}} and copies lodged in centres {{of learning in}} the Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient. In the medieval Islamic world, Muslim botanists and Muslim physicians made a major contribution to the knowledge of herbal medicines. <b>Those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> this period include Mesue Maior (Masawaiyh, 777–857) who, in his Opera Medicinalia, synthesised the knowledge of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Indians and Babylonians, this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980–1037). Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine was used for centuries in both East and West. During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been ignored in the West and Muslim pharmacy thrived.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers {{of faith in the}} Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as glaucoma. Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E
5|$|The lava domes, calderas, stratovolcanoes, {{subglacial}} mounds and cinder cones {{forming the}} volcanic complex were constructed in five phases, {{each of which}} began with the effusion of dark olivine basalt which formed the flat-lying shield volcanoes and concluded with the eruption of light-coloured magma. This cyclical behavior is attributed to the episodic rise of basic, mantle-derived alkali basalt both {{to the surface and}} partly into crustal reservoirs where the light-coloured magmas with very little aluminum were created by prolonged crystal fractionation. The silica-rich trachyte and comendite lavas are similar to <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the most violent eruptions on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem had}} already been solved by Pontecorvo in 1968. In 1959, a {{powerful}} accelerator (that was never built) was being designed, and he began considering experiments that could be performed with it. He contemplated a project investigating muons. Julian Schwinger had hypothesised that particles experience the weak interaction through exchanging W bosons. The W boson would not be discovered until 1983, but a problem immediately surfaced. Gerald Feinberg pointed out that this implied that some interactions {{that had never been}} observed should occur, but conceded that this was only true if the neutrinos associated with electrons were the same as <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> muons.|$|E
5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay {{was found to be}} full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Worrying {{that the}} {{rebellion}} might rapidly reignite and spread, the colonial authorities instigated arbitrary reprisals against the Nyasa population, including mass hut burnings. All weapons were confiscated and fines of 4 shillings per person were levied in the districts {{affected by the}} revolt, {{regardless of whether the}} people in question had been involved. The colonial government also begun attacking the rights of missionaries in Nyasaland and banned many independent churches, including Kitawala, from Nyasaland, and placed restrictions on other African-run churches. Public gatherings, especially <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> African-initiated religious groups, were banned until 1919. Fear of similar uprisings in other colonies, notably Northern Rhodesia, also led to similar repression of independent churches and foreign missions beyond Nyasaland.|$|E

5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{supply of}} {{imported}} printed editions of Chinese texts was insufficient {{to meet the}} demand and {{by the time of the}} Taira supremacy collections of Chinese books had become status symbols among the upper class of Japan. Books were collected and formed the nuclei of many new libraries, in particular <b>those</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Zen temples of Kyoto and Kamakura or those founded by samurai families of the Kantō region. These libraries became centers of learning and to a great extent stimulated the varied and energetic scholarly activities of the coming medieval age. The most important of these new libraries in the Kamakura period was the Kanazawa Bunko, established in 1275 by Hōjō Sanetoki. Eclectic in scope, it had a huge collection of books embracing the literary culture of all of East Asia, including a great number of Song editions of Chinese works. The collection was dispersed at the end of the 16th century and partially transferred to Edo by Tokugawa Ieyasu. Librarians of Kanazawa Bunko used an ownership seal, making it possible to trace existing copies back to that library. During the Muromachi period Uesugi Norizane revived in 1432 the Ashikaga Gakko library that came to house a bulk of mainly Confucian texts and exegetical works.|$|E
