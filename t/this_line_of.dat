While she was Senior Assistant Mistress, she began studying phonetics in the evenings part-time at the University College Phonetics Department in order to improve her teaching of French pronunciation. In 1917, Armstrong received a Diploma with Distinction in French Phonetics; she got a Diploma with Distinction in English phonetics the following year.|$|E

Veltmann responded that <b>this</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E

He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of war}} at the time did not apply to them, though <b>this</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E

Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. <b>This</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski.|$|E

5|$|Since cats were venerated {{in ancient}} Egypt, they were {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in the Middle East. A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,500 BC, though <b>this</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today. A 2017 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the Near East around 9,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, {{were hurt}} by a general {{distrust}} of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen {{had served as}} general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers {{accused him of being}} privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay was among those who vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of <b>this</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> campaigning was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered <b>this</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} attribute in {{this dog}} was a tempered aggressiveness {{that would provide}} the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell {{was said to have}} prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. <b>This</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E
5|$|By 1923, HMBB were {{producing}} 12,000units per year. During this time, HMBB was {{the first}} company to assemble bodies for Ford Motor Company of Australia until its Geelong plant was completed. From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new Woodville plant. These bodies were made to suit a number of chassis imported from manufacturers such as Chevrolet and Dodge. In 1926 General Motors (Australia) was established with assembly plants at Newstead, Queensland; Marrickville, New South Wales; City Road, Melbourne; Birkenhead, South Australia; and Cottesloe, Western Australia using bodies produced by Holden Motor Body Builders and imported complete knock down (CKD) chassis. In 1930 alone, the still independent Woodville plant built bodies for Austin, Chrysler, DeSoto, Morris, Hillman, Humber, Hupmobile and Willys-Overland as well GM cars. The last of <b>this</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> business was the assembly of Hillman Minx sedans in 1948. The Great Depression led to a substantial downturn in production by Holden, from 34,000units annually in 1930 to just 1,651units one year later. In 1931 General Motors purchased Holden Motor Body Builders and merged it with General Motors (Australia) Pty Ltd to form General Motors-Holden's Ltd (GM-H). Throughout the 1920s Holden also supplied tramcars to the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board, of which several examples have been preserved in both Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following <b>this</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} morning hours, a cold front with several {{embedded}} low pressure areas extended from east Texas northeastward into the Ohio River Valley. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that morphed into a squall line. <b>This</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> severe thunderstorms {{would be responsible for}} tornado actitvity from late on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early in the morning, the squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through Louisiana and Mississippi, then proceeded to affect North and Central Alabama and parts of Middle and East Tennessee. The line strengthened as it moved through Alabama, due in part to a high amount of low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and increasing wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. <b>This</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E
