40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of three {{computerized}} reminder systems on compliance with tetanus vaccination. DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Ottawa Civic Hospital Family Medicine Centre. PARTICIPANTS: Of 8069 patients 20 {{years of age or}} more who were not in a hospital or institution 5589 were randomly assigned, by family, to a control group, a physician reminder group, a telephone reminder group or a letter <b>reminder</b> group. <b>The</b> remaining 2480 patients {{were not included in the}} randomized portion of the study but were monitored. Results are presented for the 5242 randomized patients and the 2369 nonrandomized patients for whom there was no up-to-date record of tetanus vaccination at the start of the trial. INTERVENTIONS: For the patients in <b>the</b> physician <b>reminder</b> group <b>the</b> physician was reminded at an office visit to assess the patient's tetanus vaccination status and to recommend vaccination; those in <b>the</b> other two <b>reminder</b> groups received a telephone call or letter enquiring about their tetanus vaccination status and recommending a booster dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of patients who received tetanus toxoid during the study year or who had a claim of vaccination in the previous 10 years. MAIN RESULTS: The rate of recorded tetanus vaccination in the randomized control group was 3. 2 %. The difference between that rate and those for <b>the</b> three <b>reminder</b> groups was 19. 6 % in <b>the</b> physician <b>reminder</b> group (95 % confidence interval [CI] 17. 1 % to 22. 2 %, p less than 0. 00001), 20. 8 % in <b>the</b> telephone <b>reminder</b> group (95 % CI 18. 3 % to 23. 5 %, p less than 0. 00001) and 27. 4 % in <b>the</b> letter <b>reminder</b> group (95 % CI 24. 8 % to 30. 2 %, p less than 0. 00001)). <b>The</b> letter <b>reminders</b> were more effective than either <b>the</b> telephone <b>reminders</b> (p = 0. 00013) or <b>the</b> physician <b>reminders</b> (p less than 0. 00001) in improving compliance. The cost to the practice per additional vaccination recorded was 43 for <b>the</b> physician <b>reminders,</b> $ 5. 43 for <b>the</b> telephone <b>reminders</b> and $ 6. 05 for <b>the</b> letter <b>reminders.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Although all three <b>reminder</b> systems increased <b>the</b> rate of recorded tetanus vaccination they fell far short of achieving complete population coverage.
