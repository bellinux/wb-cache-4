500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{serving in}} the Royal Navy, Guinness had planned to become an Anglican priest. In 1954, while he was filming Father Brown in Burgundy, Guinness, who was in costume as a Catholic priest, was mistaken for a real priest by a local child. Guinness was far from fluent in French, and the child {{apparently}} did not notice that Guinness did not understand him but {{took his hand and}} chattered while the two strolled; the child then waved and trotted off. The confidence and affection the clerical attire appeared to inspire in the boy left a deep impression on the actor. When their son was ill with polio at the age of 11, Guinness began visiting a church to pray. A few years later in 1956, Guinness converted to the Roman Catholic Church. His wife, who was of paternal Sephardi Jewish descent, followed suit in 1957 while he was in Sri Lanka filming The Bridge on the River Kwai, and she informed him only after the event. Every morning, Guinness recited a verse from Psalm 143, [...] "Cause me <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> loving kindness in the morning".|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E
