2500|$|Regarding the {{unification}} of Romania and Moldova, Klaus Iohannis declared during the 2014 presidential campaign that {{the unification}} is something that only Bucharest can provide and only Chișinău can accept. [...] "If Moldovan citizens want the unification with Romania, then nobody can stop them", stated Klaus Iohannis. After election, his position mitigated, stressing that, at the moment, Romania should support Moldova to consolidate its pro-European path. President Klaus Iohannis said that a possible unification of Romania and Moldova could be discussed at the moment <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>well</b> and stable in the two countries.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I am not scared, Mr. Stephens," [...] said Sadie, turning {{towards him}} a blanched face which belied her words. [...] "We're all in God's hands, and surely He won't be cruel to us. It {{is easy to}} talk about trusting Him when <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>well,</b> but now is the real test. If He's up there behind that blue heaven--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It grows sickening; but you {{are wrong}} in one respect," [...] I {{answered}} ruefully. [...] "All the gophers in the country have collected around my grain and wells.

60|$|But it {{was about}} the dog I wished to speak more particularly. He had {{commenced}} innocently enough, trying to catch a sparrow. Nothing delights a sparrow more than being chased by a dog. A dozen times he thought he had the sparrow. Then another dog had got in his way. I don't know what they call this breed of dog, but abroad it is popular: it has no tail and looks like a pig--when <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>well</b> with it. This particular specimen, when I saw him, looked more like part of a doormat. The fox-terrier had seized it by the scruff of the neck and had rolled it over into the gutter just in front of a motor cycle. Its owner, a large lady, had darted out to save it, and had collided with the motor cyclist. The large lady had been thrown some half a dozen yards against an Italian boy carrying a tray load of plaster images.|$|E

60|$|It {{has been}} told in the last chapter how Lady de Courcy gave a great party in London in the latter days of April, and it may {{therefore}} <b>be</b> thought that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>well</b> with the de Courcys; but I fear the inference would be untrue. At any rate, <b>things</b> <b>were</b> not <b>going</b> <b>well</b> with Lady Alexandrina, for she, on her mother's first arrival in town, had rushed to Portman Square with a long tale of her sufferings.|$|R

60|$|On {{the eighth}} day came {{a letter from}} Uncle Chris--a cheerful, even rollicking letter. <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>well</b> with Uncle Chris, it seemed.

50|$|In 1902, Colonel Springs {{borrowed}} $125,000 {{from the}} Southern Railway {{to convert the}} L&C rails to standard gauge.

60|$|The {{case with}} young Frank Gresham may be {{supposed}} to much nearer the former than the latter; but yet the ceremony of his {{coming of age}} {{was by no means}} like that which fate had accorded to his father.
