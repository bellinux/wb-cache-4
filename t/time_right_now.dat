500|$|During a {{performance}} at a May 2004 Blue Jays-Rangers game in Toronto, Hung {{revealed that he}} would begin work on a second album. He said that it [...] "will include original songs and cover songs... There will be more bands this time. That's all I can tell you." [...] Hung also {{announced that he was}} taking singing lessons before starting the recording sessions. When interviewed by MTV News in June 2004, he said that recording was [...] "gonna be a much slower process than the first <b>time.</b> <b>Right</b> <b>now</b> I'm concentrating on just picking songs... starting to practice them and things like that." [...] Producers submitted the songs to Koch Records, and Hung said in the interview that the label had [...] "some ideas and stuff, and we'll see. It's still early — very, very early." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{her first}} {{performance}} since the Uh Huh Her tour at the Hay Festival of Literature & Arts on 26 May 2006, Harvey revealed that her next studio album {{would be almost}} entirely piano-based. Following the October release of The Peel Sessions 1991–2004, a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel, she began recording her seventh studio album White Chalk in November, together with Flood, John Parish, and Eric Drew Feldman in a studio in West London. White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked {{a radical departure from}} her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads. The album received favourable reviews, its style being described by one critic as containing [...] "pseudo-Victorian elements—drama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds." [...] Harvey herself said of the album: [...] "when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe, really, and I'm not sure whether it's in the past or in the future. The record confuses me, that's what I like—it doesn't feel of this <b>time</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> but I'm not sure whether it's 100 years ago or 100 years in the future", summing up the album's sound as [...] "really weird." [...] During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band, and also began performing on an autoharp, which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since White Chalk.|$|E

[...] He also revealed that David M. Allen would be producing. The Brightest Light was released in September 2013, and the band embarked on a tour in support around North America, Germany and the UK. In 2014 the band returned to South America for a nine-date tour.|$|E

5000|$|Kelley {{described}} it as [...] "about the world we are living in. By that, I mean, the situations us young folks are in due {{to some of our}} elders' decisions, we have the power to take things into our own hands nowadays. Following your dreams, working at it, and education are key." [...] Oller remarked, [...] "We're just really trying to do an anthem for our generation, what us kids go through in the economic <b>times</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> is not easy." [...] He also added, [...] "We wanted to have a song that described our views of our generation, and to describe how we feel about being in the circumstances we are in, thanks to previous generations making mistakes." ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2008, Joe Budden told Billboard.com that Padded Room is completed. [...] "It {{basically}} {{will be in}} {{the same}} vein as 'Mood Muzik,' just a little more structure and the mood will probably be a little lighter. I'm definitely pleased with the direction that it's going." [...] He added that the album [...] "sounds like Joe Budden. I can't really say it sounds like the times, because the <b>times</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> I'm not too fond of. I'm not too big on how that sound is going. But Joe Budden fans will get what they're accustomed to, and there's music on there for the casual listener as opposed to 'Mood Muzik,' which is not for the casual fan." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, Jedi Mind Tricks {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Visions of Gandhi. The album title {{was inspired by}} Foxy Brown's verse on the song [...] "Affirmative Action" [...] from Nas' 1996 album It Was Written, in which she raps [...] "They praise Allah with visions of Gandhi". Vinnie Paz explained that it was [...] "always something that stuck in my head but I never applied it to anything. Then I thought with everything going on in Palestine, the war with Iraq, Mumia's in jail. I just felt this is a <b>time</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> that the world and society need someone like Gandhi. So Visions of Gandhi just kind of reflects that." [...] In the following year they released Legacy of Blood.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he rejects}} the label, Maus is {{recognized}} as a progenitor of the hypnagogic pop scene, a genre noted for its reliance on memory and nostalgia. His compositions tend to employ the use of particular modal scales previously associated with Renaissance and Medieval music, which he believes is often mistaken {{as an attempt to}} evoke the 1980s. He explains that [...] "I'm not trying to evoke that time, I just hear that sound and it seems to suit this <b>time</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> ... People associate the kind of harmonies that associate from the modes with the 80s sound, and for me it's not about the 80s, it's about what I think the kind of harmony is that arises from these modes - what I'm interested in." [...] He adds: [...] "For whatever reason, the pioneers of electronic music that came out of Sheffield and Manchester in the 1980s became interested in these ecclesiastical modes that, historically, were associated with the divine. ... The palette was there in the 80s so why was it set aside and forgotten? That thread can be taken up again." [...] He goes on to opine that synthesizers and waveforms offer more [...] "color and possibility" [...] than the guitar, which he feels is an [...] "exhausted" [...] instrument.|$|E

Life is full of challenges, and sometimes when you look deep into yourself, you can feel weighed down by sin and the ‘Monster’ that lives inside us all. But the more you realize your need for Christ, the less you focus on that, and on Him instead. Everything we sing about on this album is something someone can relate to, and if anything, the songs will let you know you are not alone.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Emma Sundstrom of PopMatters {{was more}} mixed towards the album, calling the track [...] "Candy" [...] "annoying" [...] and the album's longer songs [...] "hit and miss."
