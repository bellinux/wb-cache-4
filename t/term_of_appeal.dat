40|$|The {{sustainable}} mobility agenda (Banister, 2008) places {{a key role}} on the railways, as this mode provides an efficient form of transport and it encourages a modal switch. With the overriding policy concern about the environmental agenda, rail is considered to have an advantage over other modes of transport (on long distance, inter-city journeys), and promotion of rail transport has become {{an important element in}} achieving a (more) sustainable transport system. Indeed, rail is experiencing a renaissance, not only in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> its <b>appeal</b> to policy makers and transport planners, but more important, in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> its <b>appeal</b> to travellers.

40|$|Stereoscopic telepointing to be {{employed}} inter alia in cooperative telework applications yields many benefits but also poses {{a number of problems}} addressed in a study with 96 subjects under four different conditions. For two conditions, 3 D-input devices were designed implementing different input metaphors. The 'Light Beam Metaphor' is analogous to pointing to objects with a slide show pointer or laser pointer. The 'Reference Space Metaphor' provides the users with the possibility of pointing to details of an object {{in such a way as}} if a re-sized model of the object was present in front of them and within reach of their hands. The other two conditions were stereoscopic and monoscopic control conditions without pointers. The subjects' task was to identify differences between a remote and a local object within a limited time. The results show that the Light Beam Metaphor pointer was easier to handle and conformed to a larger degree to the users' expectations, whereas the Reference Space Metaphor pointer received better subjective ratings on efficiency and Telepresence.

It consisted of a registry of the adopted procedures, the order in which they occurred, and a record of episodes of greater and lesser engagement {{of the participants in the}} activities. The second part, which is the object of analysis of the present study, consisted of a 5 -point Likert for the external observers to rate the sessions’ procedures in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> (to what extent are the procedures interesting and promote engagement and motivation of the participants?), relevance (to what extent do the procedures relate with the local culture and contemplate relevant elements of the Brazilian culture?), and clarity (to what extent were the procedures carried out in a way that was understandable to the participants?). For low scores (1, 2, or 3), it was requested that the observer indicate what could be changed to improve the cultural appropriateness of the SFP for Brazil with open questions such as: “What must change to make the session more coherent for the local culture?”. At the end, the observer was requested to openly and honestly record impressions of the weak and strong points of the sessions.|$|R
