5|$|The main medieval Germanic {{cognates}} (words of {{a common}} origin) of elf are Old Norse alfr, plural alfar, and Old High German alp, plural alpî, elpî (alongside <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> elbe). These words must come from Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *ɑlβi-z and ɑlβɑ-z.|$|E
5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E

In college, she learned Spanish, music, <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> crafts and social graces. She spent her girlhood partly in their hometown and partly in the convent. Accordingly, Agoncillo was skilled in needlework.|$|E

5|$|The Modern English noun Valhalla {{derives from}} Old Norse Valhöll, a {{compound}} noun {{composed of two}} elements: the masculine noun valr 'the slain' and <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> noun höll 'hall'. Valr has cognates in other Germanic languages such as Old English wæl 'the slain, slaughter, carnage', Old Saxon wal-dād 'murder', Old High German 'battlefield, blood bath'. All of these forms descend from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun *walaz. Among related Old Norse concepts, valr also appears as the first element of the nouns valkyrja 'chooser of the slain, valkyrie' and Valfreyja, one of the goddess Freyja's several names.|$|E

In contrast to the Republican orders, <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> style Dama is used for women.|$|E
5|$|The {{inverted}} triangle, {{found in}} Chhinnamasta's iconography {{as well as}} in her yantra, signifies the yoni (womb) and <b>the</b> <b>feminine.</b> The goddess is often prescribed to be visualised in the centre of the inverted triangle in the navel. It also signifies the three gunas (qualities) and three shaktis (powers)–iccha ("will-power"), kriya ("action"), and jnana ("wisdom"). The goddess is called Yoni-mudra or Yoni-gamya, accessible through the yoni.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconographic}} 16th century work Shilparatna, the Matsya Purana and Agamic texts like Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama and Karanagama – {{most of them}} of South Indian origin – {{describe the}} iconography of Ardhanarishvara. The right superior {{side of the body}} usually is the male Shiva and the left is the female Parvati; in rare depictions belonging to the Shaktism school, <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> holds the dominant right side. The icon usually is prescribed to have four, three or two arms, but rarely is depicted with eight arms. In the case of three arms, the Parvati side has only one arm, suggesting a lesser role in the icon.|$|E
5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E
