Scully researches the material on Ed's laptop and tries to call Mulder, but hangs up before Mulder {{has a chance to}} answer. When Ed arrives, Scully tells him that they found blood in his neighbor's apartment and that it was likely his. She thinks that the chemical came from the <b>tattoo</b> <b>ink</b> and wants them both to head to the hospital to be tested. Ed tells Scully about the voice he has been hearing from his tattoo.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Tattoo</b> <b>inks</b> {{have been}} {{described}} as [...] "remarkably nonreactive histologically". However, cases of allergic reactions to <b>tattoo</b> <b>inks,</b> particularly certain colors, have been medically documented. This is sometimes due to the presence of nickel in an ink pigment, which triggers a common metal allergy. Occasionally, when a blood vessel is punctured during the tattooing procedure, a bruise/hematoma may appear.|$|R

2500|$|Cremated remains {{can be kept}} in an urn, {{stored in}} a special {{memorial}} building (columbarium), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or in the sea. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered {{in a variety of}} ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat [...] or scattered from an aeroplane. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before reentering the atmosphere. Some companies offer a service to turn part of the cremated remains into synthetic diamonds that can then be made into jewelry. Cremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in <b>tattoo</b> <b>ink,</b> for remembrance portraits. [...] Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the United States with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the permission of the owner. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into special glass keepsakes and glass orbs. The cremated remains may also be entombed. Most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight.|$|E
2500|$|Maero, {{the leader}} of the Brotherhood, calls a meeting with Carlos and the Boss. The Brotherhood and The Saints's meeting is {{interrupted}} by cops. After escaping the police, they go back to The Brotherhood's headquarters. Aware that the Saints have very little influence left, he offers to give them 20% of Stilwater while The Brotherhood gets 80%. Insulted, the Saints refuse and declare war on the Brotherhood. With the help of Donnie, a former Westside Rollerz member who now works as Maero's head mechanic, the Boss blows up several of the Brotherhood's prize trucks and laces Maero's private supply of <b>tattoo</b> <b>ink</b> with toxic waste, leaving him with severe facial burns. As revenge, the Brotherhood kidnaps Carlos and drags him through the streets tied to a moving vehicle. With his injuries too severe for medical treatment, the Boss is forced to kill him. Furious at Maero for killing Carlos, the Saints abduct his girlfriend Jessica at a bank and lock her in the trunk of a car which is then destroyed by Maero during a Brotherhood-sponsored demolition derby, resulting in her death. With most of his remaining allies locked up, an enraged Maero forces Ultor CEO Dane Vogel to pressure Bradshaw to release them. However, The Boss blows up the prison buses and prison boats before they reach their destination. Vogel orders his company's security forces to confiscate a Brotherhood weapons shipment as [...] "compensation", but the Saints steal it first. Using the stolen weapons, the gang lays waste to the Brotherhood's dockside headquarters. While there, The Boss kills Matt, Maero's tattoo artist, for distracting him/her from killing Maero. Maero escapes due to Matt's distraction. Maero calls the Boss out to the Ultor Dome, where he and his surviving thugs plan to kill him/her in a derby. The Boss then kills them and then Maero.|$|E

40|$|Most people {{concerned}} about tattoos and their health are usually worried {{about whether or}} not tattoo parlour needles have been properly sterilised. Needles that haven't gone through the autoclave process could expose a person to hepatitis B or C, tuberculosis, bacterial infection, syphilis, malaria, HIV and even leprosy. Allergies, chronic skin reactions, infection and inflammation from sun exposure have also been linked to tattoos. However how many people ask questions about the inks that are injected into the skin via the tattooing process? Recent information collated from Europe, North America and New Zealand has found {{that there are a number}} of disturbing health problems that people could be exposed to via <b>tattoo</b> <b>inks.</b> Research assessing <b>tattoo</b> <b>inks</b> in Europe found potentially more serious problems with 60 % of <b>tattoo</b> <b>inks</b> tested having to be withdrawn from the market. Permanent make-up and temporary tattoos have also seen issues emerging about toxicity of these products as well. We urge anyone thinking about getting a tattoo to get detailed information from their tattooist about the exact constituents of the ink that they are about to use. If the tattooist cannot provide this basic information then we urge people not to go ahead with getting a tattoo. We also urge people to do their own research about the potential toxicity of <b>tattoo</b> <b>inks.</b> We have also provided some useful references at the bottom of this document...|$|R

40|$|The histopathologic {{spectrum}} of decorative tattoo complications Tattooing for ornamental purposes {{is an ancient}} practice that remains popular in modern times. Tattoos are encountered by the dermatopathologist either as incidental findings on skin biopsies or because of complications specific to the tattoo. A range of neoplasms and inflammatory conditions are seen in association with tattoos, many {{of which may be}} attributed to hypersensitivity to <b>tattoo</b> <b>inks.</b> The composition of <b>tattoo</b> <b>inks</b> is highly variable, and inks can contain numerous potentially allergenic or carcinogenic compounds. Infections with bacterial, viral and fungal species can occur after tattooing, sometimes after substantial delay. Atypical mycobacterial infections in particular are increasingly reported; special stains for mycobacteria should be performed and cultures recommended particularly when dense, mixed or granulomatous infiltrates are present...|$|R
