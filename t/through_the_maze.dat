5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Since 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of {{ammunition}} had traveled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked {{up with a}} similar logistical system in neighboring Cambodia known as the Sihanouk Trail. However, following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, the pro-American Lon Nol regime had denied {{the use of the}} port of Sihanoukville to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port. A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come {{in the spring and summer}} of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/NLF Base Areas during the Cambodian Campaign.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Maze</b> of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he is saying this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E

5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
5|$|Amid strong resistance, the Australians {{were made}} to fight their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of bunkers, punji stakes and booby traps but they were {{eventually}} able to force a Viet Cong regional force company to withdraw as they continued their advance. The area was heavily seeded with trip wires connected to shells and grenades dangling from branches, one of which blew McFarlane {{and several of his}} men off their feet. The defenders subsequently withdrew, with 7th Cu Chi Battalion forced north and 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion to the east. Suspecting they were being drawn into a trap—as one of the American battalions of the brigade had been previously during Operation Hump—the Australians moved into a tightly defended perimeter before dark and waited for the communists to counter-attack. As night fell, movement was detected along a trench on the C Company perimeter when a squad of Viet Cong attempted to infiltrate the Australian position. Initially believing the movement to be another Australian patrol that had just departed on a clearing patrol, the machine-gunner on sentry duty finally opened fire at the last safe moment, killing one of the infiltrators at point-blank range and wounding a number of others before they withdrew.|$|E
25|$|These are {{intended}} for measuring spatial ability in children. With this test, an experimenter presents the participant with a drawing of a maze {{with a picture of}} a man in the centre. While the participant watches, the experimenter uses his or her finger to trace a pathway from the opening of the maze to the drawing of the man. The participant is then expected to replicate the demonstrated pathway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> to the drawing of the man. Mazes vary in complexity as difficulty increases.|$|E

John chose Orsini as his legate, seeing him as an Italian prince who could find his way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of Italian politics as no Gaul could hope to do. However, the people of Italy saw Orsini not as an Italian but as a Roman, and very specifically as a prince of the Orsini family.|$|E
500|$|The {{change in}} combat systems {{was not the}} only {{difference}} between Barbarian II and its predecessor that influenced reviewers' opinions about the sequel. [...] The first Barbarian game was enjoyed by reviewers for providing exciting head-to-head action between two players. [...] Barbarian II abandoned this, setting up an adventuring experience for the single player. [...] Jim Douglas, reviewing for Sinclair User, doubted that players who were looking for quick action would appreciate plotting a path <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> to reach the final goal. [...] Your Sinclairs Marcus Berkmann felt the two genresslash 'em up and arcade adventurewere [...] "fundamentally incompatible", agreeing with Douglas that the maze was a distraction. [...] Crashs reviewers, however, felt the combination of genres made the game interesting. [...] James Price wrote in Amiga Force that the adventuring element and unending number of enemies made Barbarian II a far better game than the first, while The Games Machines staff said the expanded menagerie of foes adequately made up for a reduction in combat moves.|$|E

[...] That skull has been split open vertically to reveal various compartments inside. Through the eyes, nose, and mouth we can see {{the rest of the body}} lying in a wheat field. Inside the skull itself, each compartment holds a scrap of paper, representing a memory or thought. The center compartment, however, holds only a white rat, which represents Kurelek's spirit. The rat is wound up and inert, having run <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of the skull chewing a piece of each scrap of paper and finding it undigestible.|$|E

The huge walls of the fortress loom over the landscape as one travels from Neo Limani (Νέο Λιμάνι, [...] "New Port") to the city, taking the road that passes through the fishmarket (ψαραγορά). The new citadel was until recently a restricted area due {{to the presence of}} a naval garrison, but old restrictions have been lifted and it is now open to the public, with tours possible <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of medieval corridors and fortifications. The winged Lion of St Mark, the symbol of Venice, can be seen at regular intervals adorning the fortifications.|$|E
2500|$|... "Theseus", {{created in}} 1950, was a {{magnetic}} mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it {{to move around}} a labyrinth of 25 squares. Its dimensions {{were the same as}} those of an average mouse. The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions. The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze,</b> the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior. Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.|$|E

Dewey also streamlined and consolidated many state agencies to make them more efficient. During the Second World War construction in New York was limited, which allowed Dewey to create a $623 million budget surplus, which he placed into his [...] "Postwar Reconstruction Fund." [...] The fund would eventually create 14,000 new beds in the state's mental health system, provide public housing for 30,000 families, allow for the reforestation of 34 million trees, create a water pollution program, provide slum clearance, and pay for a [...] "model veterans' program."

On 14 October at 5:30am, the division broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of barbed wire and took the line of trenches forming the Hindenburg Line and moved on to the last German stronghold at Kriemhilde Stellung, where they reached the Meuse River. The 32nd was the first Allied Army unit to penetrate the Hindenburg Line. They then captured Côte Dame de Marie, the key to all the defenses in the area. the next five [...] days the division continued to advance while under nearly constant machine gun and artillery fire.

2500|$|Film critic Jonathan Romney {{writes that}} the film has been {{interpreted}} in many different ways; as being about the crisis in masculinity, sexism, corporate America, and racism: [...] "It's tempting to read The Shining as an Oedipal struggle not just between generations but between Jack's culture of the written word and Danny's culture of images...." [...] Romney writes, [...] "Jack also uses the written word to more mundane purpose – to sign his 'contract' with the Overlook. 'I gave my word,' [...] which we take to mean 'gave his soul' in the [...] Faustian sense. But maybe he means it more literally – by the end [...] he has renounced language entirely, pursuing Danny <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> with an inarticulate animal roar. What he has entered into is a conventional business deal that places commercial obligation [...] over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy {{that he seems to}} have neglected to sign with his family." [...] These varied interpretations spawned the 2012 documentary Room 237, directed by Rodney Ascher, which provides an in-depth exploration of various interpretations of, and myths surrounding, the film.|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, in {{addition}} to climbing Mount Stuart, Rusk and a group from the Cascadians went on an expedition to Mount Adams. This expedition had as its primary goal to climb the [...] "Great East Side" [...] of Adams. They made their base camp in Avalanche Valley. Fifteen members of the Cascadians completed a climb up {{the south side of}} the mountain. However, the main climb was the ascent up the east side led by Rusk. The rest of those in this group were Edgar E. Coursen, Wayne Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. The route was very difficult for the climbing equipment that they had available, which was limited to two Swiss ice-axes, five alpenstocks, rope, and hobnailed boots. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier to the base of the Battlement Ridge, up onto Battlement Ridge and over The Castle, and finally, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of crevasses on the vast summit ice cap. The route was very difficult and it took a great amount of time to reach The Castle and required that they bivouac for the night on the west side of The Castle next to the summit ice cap. The route also made it clear that there was to be no easy retreat. The whole party completed the climb. Some climbers who had come up from the south side, who some in the Cascadians party knew, were incredulous and could not believe that they had made the climb from the east side.|$|E
