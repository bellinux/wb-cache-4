25|$|Note that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{difference}} between pool types.

Open sea gives the really bad side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer back to where they came from, this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> gap {{among various}} {{countries}} {{between high and}} low yields, even with the same variety of potato. Average potato yields in developed economies ranges between 38–44 tonnes per hectare. China and India accounted for over a third of world's production in 2010, and had yields of 14.7 and 19.9 tonnes per hectare respectively. The yield gap between farms in developing economies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over 400 million tonnes of potato, or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production. Potato crop yields are determined by factors such as the crop breed, seed age and quality, crop management practices and the plant environment. Improvements in {{one or more of these}} yield determinants, and a closure of the yield gap, can be a major boost to food supply and farmer incomes in the developing world.|$|E

After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel."

500|$|In {{the same}} paper, Serre {{found the first}} place that p-torsion occurs in the {{homotopy}} groups of n dimensional spheres, by showing that πn+k(S'n) has no p-torsion if k < 2p − 3, and has a unique subgroup of order p if n ≥ 3 and k = 2p − 3. [...] The case of 2-dimensional spheres is slightly different: the first p-torsion occurs for k = 2p − 3 + 1. In the case of odd torsion there are more precise results; in this case <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> difference between odd and even dimensional spheres. If p is an odd prime and n = 2i + 1, then elements of the p-component of πn+k(S'n) have order at most p'i [...] This is in some sense the best possible result, as these groups {{are known to have}} elements of this order for some values of k [...] Furthermore, the stable range can be extended in this case: if n is odd then the double suspension from πk(S'n) to πk+2(S'n+2) is an isomorphism of p-components if k < p(n + 1) − 3, and an epimorphism if equality holds [...] The p-torsion of the intermediate group πk+1(S'n+1) can be strictly larger.|$|E
