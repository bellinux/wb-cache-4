40|$|Antioxidant {{properties}} of ethanol extract of Silybum marianum (milk <b>thistle)</b> <b>seeds</b> was investigated. We have also investigated the protein damage activated by oxidative Fenton reaction and its prevention by Silybum marianum seed extract. Antioxidant potential of Silybum marianum seed ethanol extract {{was measured using}} diff erent in vitro methods, such as lipid peroxidation, 1, 1 –diphenyl– 2 –picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing power assays. The extract significantly decreased DNA damage caused by hydroxyl radicals.

40|$|Introduction: Milk thistle (Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn.) is a {{medicinal}} plant belonging to Asteraceae family. Extract from milk thistle achenes (termed in practice as seeds) contains sylimarin, which protects liver cells against inorganic and organic toxic compounds. Objective: The {{aim of the}} research was to evaluate the effect of colour grading on the quality of milk <b>thistle</b> <b>seeds.</b> Methods: Seeds were graded manually by colour according to the Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, issued in Great Britain. In three samples two fractions of seeds were separated: beige and brown, whereas seeds of the fourth sample were graded into three fractions: yellow, beige and brown. The 1000 -seed weight and germination of graded and non-graded seeds were evaluated. Infestation of graded seeds with fungi was assessed. Results: Brown seeds had a higher 1000 -seed weight than beige or yellow ones. Germination at the final count of beige seeds did not differ as compared to that of brown seeds or was even better. Milk <b>thistle</b> <b>seeds</b> were infested with numerous fungi, however Alternaria alternata and Ulocladium consortiale predominated. Conclusions: Less mature beige seeds can be used as sowing material because their germination at the final count did not differ as compared to that of fully mature brown seeds or was even better. Infestation of these seeds with some of the fungi was lower than brown seeds...|$|R

Moreover, the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of the SC-CO 2 oil seeds extracts were evaluated in Caco- 2 carcinoma cells. Pressure and temperature had a significant effect on oil and flavonolignans recovery, although there was not observed a clear trend. SC-CO 2 with co-solvent extraction at 220 bars, 40 degrees C was the optimum treatment to recover oil (30. 8 %) and flavonolignans from milk <b>thistle</b> <b>seeds.</b> Moreover, linoleic (47. 64 - 66. 70 %), and oleic (19. 68 - 24. 83 %) acids were the predominant fatty acids in the oil extracts recovered from milk thistle under SC-CO 2. In addition, SC-CO 2 extract showed a high antioxidant activity determined by DPPH and ABTS tests. Cytotoxic activities of silychristin, silydianin and silybinin and the obtained SC-CO 2 extract (220 bars, 40 degrees C) were evaluated against Caco- 2 cells. The SC-CO 2 extract inhibited the proliferation of Caco- 2 cells in a dose-responsive manner and induced the highest percentage of mortality of Caco- 2 cells (from 43 to 71 % for concentrations from 10 up to 100 mu g/ml of SC-CO 2 oil seeds...|$|R
50|$|Townsend's {{chipmunk}} (Neotamias townsendii) is {{a species}} of rodent in the squirrel family Sciuridae. It lives in the forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America, from British Columbia through western Washington and Oregon. A large chipmunk, adults can be 36 cm from nose to tail. In much of its range, {{it is the only}} chipmunk; it can be identified by its tail which is grayish above and reddish below, and by its brown coloration with indistinct tawny stripes. Townsend's chipmunk hibernates in regions where the winter is harsh, but in other parts of its range that have a more mild climate it can be active year-round. It is omnivorous, eating a variety of plants and insects and even birds' eggs. Townsend's chipmunks in the Oregon Coast Range have higher population densities in areas with dense shrubbery, especially salal (Gaultheria shallon). In the summer and early fall, Townsend's chipmunks eat blackberries, salal berries, and thimble berries. In the late fall, they eat acorns, huckleberries, maple <b>seeds,</b> <b>thistle</b> <b>seeds,</b> grain seeds, grass, roots, and conifer seeds.|$|R

50|$|After {{the station}} is established, it can take some weeks for birds to {{discover}} and start using it. This is particularly true if the feeding station {{is the first one}} in an area or (in cold-winter areas) if {{the station is}} being established in spring when natural sources of food are plentiful. Therefore, beginners should not completely fill a feeder at first. The food will get old and spoil if it is left uneaten for too long. This is particularly true of unshelled foods, such as <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> and suet. Once the birds begin taking food, the feeder should be kept full. Additionally, people feeding birds should be sure that there is a source of water nearby. A bird bath can attract as many birds as a feeding station.|$|E

While {{biological control agent}}s have been effectively utilized to manage invasive plant species and preserve existing biodiversity, not all biological control agents are successful. The invasive <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> head weevil (Rhinocyllus conicus) was originally introduced to America as a biological control agent to manage musk thistle (Carduus nutans), {{but it has been}} found to attack several species of native thistle. This study examined the movements of the invasive <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> head weevil away from musk thistle into two different species of native thistle in the Colorado Front Range: wavyleaf thistle (Cirsium undulatum) and fringed thistle (Cirsium centaureae). Specifically, the proximity of invasive musk thistle to wavyleaf thistle was observed to see if it has any influence on <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> head weevil attack upon wavyleaf thistle. Additionally, fringed thistle was observed in three different habitat types in the Colorado Front Range (i. e. meadow, riparian, and tree line habitat) to see if the invasive <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> head weevil has been moving up in elevation in response to climate change. The results indicate that the proximity between musk thistle and wavyleaf thistle had no significant effect on <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> head weevil abundance on the native thistle. Moreover, the invasive <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> head weevil is still restricted to elevations below 3100 meters, meaning the tree line population of fringed thistle are protected from attack. Although both species of native thistle seem to have little risk of local extirpation due to the invasive seed head weevil, continued monitoring is advised to assess the indirect impacts of this invasive species through time and space...|$|E

From the perspective of fattening was decreased growth of chickens where a higher percentage of milk <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> cakes (MT 15). The group MT 15 was up to 420 g lower slaughter weight compared to the control group. This was probably due to the higher content of fiber in the feed.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of chronic renal disease exceeds 10 % in industrialized societies. Oxidative damage {{is thought to}} be one of the main mechanisms involved in nearly all chronic renal pathologies. Objective: We aimed to use the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method and a sequential multisolvent extraction process to compare the in vitro antioxidant capacity of 55 medicinal herbs and prioritize them for in vivo studies investigating the value of herbal therapies in the treatment of renal disorders. Methods: The herbs were chosen on the basis of their traditional use in kidney or urinary system disorders, or because they have attracted the attention of recent investigations into renal pathologies. The three solvents used for extraction were ethyl acetate, methanol, and 50 % aqueous methanol. Silybum marianum (milk <b>thistle)</b> <b>seed</b> and Camellia sinensis (tea) leaf, both known to possess high antioxidant capacity, were included for comparison. Results: Twelve of the 55 herbs were comparable to or exceeded ORAC levels of milk <b>thistle</b> <b>seed</b> or tea leaf. The highest radical-scavenging activity was found in Olea europaea (olive leaf), Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh), Rheum palmatum (rhubarb), Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice), and Scutellaria lateriflora (Virginia skullcap). Conclusions: The antioxidant capacity of many of the herbs studied may, at least in part, be responsible for their reputation as being protective of organs of the urinary system. Overall, the combined ORAC values for the methanol and aqueous methanol extracts comprised 84 % of the total ORAC value.
