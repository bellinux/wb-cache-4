40|$|The World Health Organization {{considers}} training <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> {{for healthcare}} professionals a priority. Indeed, increased life expectancy {{and a high}} prevalence of chronic and incurable diseases further emphasise the need for well-trained healthcare professionals <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> The European Association for <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care</b> (EAPC) shares the concern of the WHO. Some countries, such as France and Canada, have developed national action plans to implement basic training and continued education <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> <b>In</b> Switzerland, the ‘Manifeste de Fribourg' called for a similar action plan <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> training and set it as a top priority...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE Depression {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> patients. <b>In</b> clinical practice, {{there is concern}} about both insufficient and excessive {{diagnosis and treatment of}} depression. In the Netherlands, family physicians have a central role <b>in</b> delivering <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> We explored variation in family physicians' opinions regarding the recognition, diagnosis, and management of depression <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> patients. METHODS We conducted a focus group study in a sample of family physicians with varied practice locations and varying expertise <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Transcripts were analyzed independently by 2 researchers using constant comparative analysis in ATLAS. ti. RESULTS In 4 focus group discussions with 22 family physicians, the physicians described the diagnostic and therapeutic process for depression <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> patients as a continuous and overlapping process. Differentiating between normal and abnormal sadness was viewed as challenging. The physicians did not strictly apply criteria of depressive disorder but rather relied on their clinical judgment and strongly considered patients' context and background factors. They indicated that managing depression <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> patients is mainly supportive and nonspecific. Antidepressant drugs were seldom prescribed. The physicians described difficulties in diagnosing and treating depression <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> and gave suggestions to improve management of depression <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> patients <b>in</b> primary care. CONCLUSIONS Family physicians perceive the diagnosis and management of depression <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> patients as challenging. They rely on open communication and a long-standing physician-patient relationship in which the patient's context is of great importance. This approach fits with the patient-centered care that is promoted in primary care...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{there is}} {{increasing}} interest in combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to provide comprehensiveness and greater knowledge yield. Mixed methods are valuable {{in the development and}} evaluation of complex interventions. They are therefore particularly valuable <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> research where the majority of interventions are complex, and the identification of outcomes particularly challenging. Aims: this paper aims to introduce the role of mixed methods in the development and evaluation of complex interventions <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> and how they may be used <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> research. Content: the paper defines mixed methods and outlines why and how mixed methods are used to develop and evaluate complex interventions, with a pragmatic focus on design and data collection issues and data analysis. Useful texts are signposted and illustrative examples provided of mixed method studies <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> including a detailed worked example of the development and evaluation of a complex intervention <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> for breathlessness. Key challenges to conducting mixed methods <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> research are identified in relation to data collection, data integration in analysis, costs and dissemination and how these might be addressed. Conclusions: the development and evaluation of complex interventions <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> benefit from the application of mixed methods. Mixed methods enable better understanding of whether and how an intervention works (or does not work) and inform the design of subsequent studies. However, they can be challenging: mixed method studies <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> will benefit from working with agreed protocols, multidisciplinary teams and engaging staff with appropriate skill sets...|$|R
40|$|Evaluating {{the work}} of {{clinical}} nurse specialists <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> The importance of rigorous evaluation <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> is now widely acknowledged. Less clearly articulated are the problems encountered in seeking to establish such an evidence base to guide service development, and how these problems might be overcome. These issues are brought into sharp focus when examining the evidence for effectiveness <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nursing. <b>In</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> general and in nursing in parti-cular, {{there has been a}} preoccupation with questions regarding the benefits that may arise from referral to a specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> service, or to a nurse special-ist, {{and there has been a}} long history of advocating outcomes research in nursing.

40|$|Quality-of-life {{assessment}} {{is a central}} concept <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Clinical interventions focused on assessing quality of life are complex interventions. Current research is insufficient {{to determine how to}} implement interventions focused on quality-of-life assessment <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> To explore the different components of interventions focused on quality-of-life assessment <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> a systematic review and 5 databases were searched. Publications included were analyzed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) Framework Programme 7 practical guidance on using patient-reported outcome measurements <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and the Quality of Life Assessment Principles <b>in</b> <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care.</b> Interventions and their components were identified and discussed. Identifying problems and monitoring change or response to treatment, screening for hidden problems, and facilitating communication were the 3 different types of intervention identified. None of the interventions fulfilled all the 11 Quality of Life Assessment Principles <b>in</b> <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care.</b> Overall, 6 characteristics of the components were identified: the quality-of-life measure, educational training, completing the measure (patients or proxy), collecting quality-of-life data (baseline and further assessment), identifying a coordinator, and presenting quality-of-life data.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{experiences}} of a nursing-led research group, ‘The Palliative and End of Life Care Research Group’, within the School of Nursing and Midwifery at the University of Sheffield. There is {{a long tradition of}} research <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> which nurses have played an important role and currently opportunities to conduct research <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> are expanding. Nurses face a number of ethical and methodological challenges <b>in</b> conducting <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> research, many of which extend beyond individual research conduct. Drawing on practical examples in each case, this paper explores the following themes: issues involved in raising participation and recruitment to studies of palliative care; how the topics of <b>palliative</b> and end-of-life <b>care</b> are introduced and explored with participants; what ‘special’ needs participants have <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> research; interpersonal issues <b>in</b> conducting <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> research; and providing support and supervision to researchers...|$|R

40|$|Patients <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> can {{experience}} substantial psychological suffering. Acceptance-based interventions from approaches such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy have demonstrated effectiveness in helping people {{cope with a}} range of life challenges. However, there is a dearth of research examining mechanisms of therapeutic change for patients <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Objectives: To assess the relationships between acceptance, anticipatory grief, anxiety, and depression among patients <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Methods: A cross-sectional survey was verbally administered to inpatients (N = 73) receiving <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Results: Correlations revealed that acceptance had a strong relationship with anticipatory grief, anxiety, and depression. A hierarchical regression analysis on anticipatory grief showed that acceptance was the largest predictor and accounted for an additional 13 % of variance in anticipatory grief over and above anxiety and depression.

40|$|Background. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the general practitioner's perception of educational needs <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Method. A qualitative study with focus groups was performed. Results. General practitioners estimate <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> as an important and valuable part of primary care. Nevertheless, they consider their coordinating role as a course with increasing obstacles. Pain, nausea, dysphagia, delirium, insomnia, anxiety, and depression were mentioned frequently as symptoms difficult to deal with <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Also, psychosocial issues such as communication, bereavement, and defense mechanisms were subject to discussion in the focus groups. Ethical issues such as euthanasia were mentioned as the most complex subject <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Conclusions. General practitioners experience difficulties with their coordinating role <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> With more basic knowledge and skills in communication, but also with consultation, their roles as coordinators of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> primary care will improve. Reflection and deepening of ethical values are necessary conditions for an optimal functioning...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{pressing}} workforce shortage and leadership scarcity <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> to adequately {{meet the demands}} of individuals with serious illness and their families. To address this gap, the Cambia Health Foundation launched its Sojourns Scholars Leadership Program in 2014, an initiative designed to identify, cultivate, and advance the next generation of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> leaders. This report intends to summarize the second cohort of Sojourns Scholars 2 ̆ 7 projects and their reflection on their leadership needs. OBJECTIVE: This report summarizes the second cohort of sojourns scholars 2 ̆ 7 project and their reflection on leadership needs. METHODS: After providing a written reflection on their own projects, the second cohort participated in a group interview (fireside chat) to elicit their perspectives on barriers and facilitators <b>in</b> providing <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> issues facing leadership <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> the United States, and lessons from personal and professional growth as leaders <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> They analyzed the transcript of the group interview using qualitative content analysis methodology. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from descriptions of the scholars 2 ̆ 7 project experience: challenges <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> practice, leadership strategies <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> and three lessons learned to be a leader were identified. Challenges included perceptions of <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> payment and policy, and workforce development. Educating and collaborating with other clinicians and influencing policy change are important strategies used to advance <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Time management, leading team effort, and inspiring others are important skills that promote effectiveness as a leader. DISCUSSION: Emerging leaders have a unique view of conceptualizing contemporary <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and shaping the future. CONCLUSIONS: Providing comprehensive, coordinated care that is high quality, patient and family centered, and readily available depends on strong leadership <b>in</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> The Cambia Scholars Program represents a unique opportunity...|$|R
