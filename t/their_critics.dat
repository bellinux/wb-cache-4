5|$|Don't Look Now is {{also very}} well {{regarded}} by other industry professionals, placing in the top 100 on Sight & Sound's directors poll, run in tandem with <b>their</b> <b>critics</b> poll. A survey of 1000 people who work across the film and television industry, undertaken by the British Film Institute in 1999, saw the film ranked eighth on their list of top 100 British films of the 20th century. It also topped a similar list organised by Time Out London in 2011, in which 150 film industry professionals were polled. In 2012 Time Out also undertook a poll of the horror industry, {{in which more than}} 100 professionals who work within or have connections to the genre selected their favourite horror films, which saw Don't Look Now finish in twelfth position.|$|E
5|$|Scott's restorations {{were not}} without <b>their</b> <b>critics</b> and caused much debate in {{architectural}} circles. Scott {{claimed to have}} archaeological evidence for his work, but the Liverpool architect, Samuel Huggins argued in an 1868 address to the Liverpool Architectural Society, that the alterations were less like restoration and more like rebuilding. One of the larger changes was to shorten the south aisle and restyle it as an apse. The changes also proposed {{the addition of a}} spire above the existing tower, but this proposal was later rejected. Samuel's further paper of 1871 entitled On so-called restorations of our cathedral and abbey churches compelled the Dean to attempt to answer the criticism. The debate contributed to the establishment of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.|$|E

5000|$|Variety {{condemned}} {{the film as}} [...] "schlocky" [...] and sentimental. <b>Their</b> <b>critic</b> found Modine's performance started to wear and Davis brought [...] "little conviction", but praised director John Kent Harrison for the performance {{he got out of}} Rendall.|$|R
25|$|VAN has {{disputed the}} 'pessimistic' {{conclusions}} of <b>their</b> <b>critics,</b> but the critics have not relented. It was suggested that VAN failed {{to account for}} clustering of earthquakes, or that they interpreted their data differently during periods of greater seismic activity.|$|E
25|$|Past {{and present}} city councils have been {{committed}} to providing for the explosive population growth that is coming with the local economic boom. Rapidly developing subdivisions are often described by <b>their</b> <b>critics</b> as urban sprawl that threatens environmentally sensitive areas and valuable agricultural land.|$|E
25|$|Although Kermit and TR faced {{skepticism}} about their claims of navigating a completely uncharted river over 1000km long, they eventually silenced <b>their</b> <b>critics</b> through the elder Roosevelt's oratory {{and one of}} his most popular books, Through the Brazilian Wilderness. The 1913–14 expedition was later recounted in The River of Doubt by Candice Millard (Doubleday 2005).|$|E
50|$|Eric McLean (25 September 191919 August 2002) was a Canadian pianist, music critic, and historian. From 1979 to 1988 he was {{the music}} critic for the Montreal Gazette in Canada, and retired as <b>their</b> <b>critic</b> emeritus. His overall career spanned 60 years.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to a few articles in print media, the Bogdanov Affair has been discussed extensively in various newsgroups, webpages and blogs; the Bogdanov brothers have often participated in the discussions, sometimes using pseudonyms or represented by friends acting as proxies. They have used these methods to defend their work and sometimes to insult <b>their</b> <b>critics,</b> among them the Nobel Prize recipient Georges Charpak.|$|E
25|$|This {{style was}} {{promoted}} by the critic John Ruskin, who had defended the Pre-Raphaelites against <b>their</b> <b>critics.</b> Millais's friendship with Ruskin introduced him to Ruskin's wife Effie. Soon after they met she modelled for his painting The Order of Release. As Millais painted Effie they fell in love. Despite having been married to Ruskin for several years, Effie was still a virgin. Her parents realised something was wrong and she filed for an annulment.|$|E
25|$|The Cathars (Cathari, Albigenses or Albigensians) {{were also}} accused by their {{enemies of the}} traits of Gnosticism; though {{whether or not the}} Cathari possessed direct {{historical}} influence from ancient Gnosticism is disputed. If <b>their</b> <b>critics</b> are reliable the basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology {{are to be found in}} Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser, Satanic, creator god), though they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (gnosis) as an effective salvific force.|$|E
5000|$|Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. Human nature {{does not}} like to admit fault.

25|$|Australia toured {{with what}} some {{considered}} to be the weakest side to leave Australia: the touring party lost the three matches they played before leaving Australia. However, they surprised <b>their</b> <b>critics</b> by winning their first five matches. In a low-scoring Test series, seven of the ten completed innings were completed for 100 or fewer. In the first Test, England only needed 124 runs to win after getting 53 in response to Australia's 116 and 60, on a poor pitch at Lord's, but despite WG Grace's admirable 24, fell 61 runs short. This was Australia's first victory in England since the Test that started the Ashes legend 6 years before.|$|E
25|$|Exat's first {{manifesto}} in 1951 was fiercely {{attacked by}} the traditional art establishment. However, an exhibit of paintings by the group in 1952 in Zagreb was well attended, and in that same year, they participated in the VII Salon des Réalités Nouvelles in Paris. In 1953, an exhibition of paintings {{was held in the}} Society of Croatian Architects and there the group issued a second manifesto in response to <b>their</b> <b>critics.</b> Other exhibits followed in Belgrade (1953), Rijeka (1954,1956), Dubrovnik (1956) and finally in Belgrade (1956). Under their influence, Croatian artists moved to more creative and personal forms of expression, to surrealism and lyrical abstraction.|$|E
25|$|Traffic and {{transportation}} remain {{a problem in}} urban areas. Solutions are implemented, but inevitably the implementation expense and {{the time required to}} plan, approve, and build infrastructure can't keep pace with the population growth. There have been some improvements. Carpool lanes have become common in urban areas, which are intended to encourage people to drive together rather than in individual automobiles. San Jose is gradually building a light rail system (often over routes of an original turn-of-the-century electric railroad line that was torn out and paved over to encourage the advent of the automobile age). None of the implemented solutions are without <b>their</b> <b>critics.</b> The sprawling nature of the Bay Area and of the Los Angeles Basin makes it difficult to build mass transit that can reach and serve {{a significant portion of the}} population.|$|E

5000|$|Variety {{compared}} it to Dog Day Afternoon and Juggernaut, as a socially-committed thriller with more talk than action. <b>Their</b> <b>critic</b> praised the technical values and performances, but found some of the plotting to be [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "forced" [...] with some characters [...] "underwritten". Jack G Shaheen criticised it for the [...] "one-dimensional" [...] portrayal of the villains.|$|R
25|$|The RSS was {{instrumental}} in relief efforts after the 1971 Orissa Cyclone, 1977 Andhra Pradesh Cyclone and in the 1984 Bhopal disaster. It assisted in relief efforts during the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, and helped rebuild villages. Approximately 35,000 RSS members in uniform were engaged in the relief efforts, and many of <b>their</b> <b>critics</b> acknowledged their role. An RSS-affiliated NGO, Seva Bharati, conducted relief operations {{in the aftermath of}} the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Activities included building shelters for the victims and providing food, clothes, and medical necessities. The RSS assisted relief efforts during the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. Seva Bharati also adopted 57 children (38 Muslims and 19 Hindus) from militancy affected areas of Jammu and Kashmir to provide them education at least up to Higher Secondary level. They also took care of victims of the Kargil War of 1999.|$|E
25|$|Although {{poetry in}} {{traditional}} classical forms had mostly {{fallen out of}} fashion by the 1960s, the practice was kept alive by poets of great formal virtuosity like James Merrill (1926–1995), author of the epic poem The Changing Light at Sandover, Richard Wilbur, and British-born San Francisco poet Thom Gunn. The 1980s and 1990s saw a re-emergent interest in traditional form, sometimes dubbed New Formalism or Neoformalism. These include poets such as Molly Peacock, Brad Leithauser, Dana Gioia, Donna J. Stone, Timothy Steele, and Marilyn Hacker. Some of the more outspoken New Formalists have declared that the return to rhyme and more fixed meters {{to be the new}} avant-garde. <b>Their</b> <b>critics</b> sometimes associate this traditionalism with the conservative politics of the Reagan era, noting the recent appointment of Gioia as Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts. More recent examples of New Formalism, however, have sometimes crossed over into the more experimental territory of Language poetry, suggesting that both schools are being gradually absorbed into the poetic mainstream.|$|E
