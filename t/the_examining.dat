The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E

The number of workers younger than the age 30, number of overweight workers, workers with alcohol consumption and was statistically significantly more frequent in <b>the</b> <b>examined</b> than in <b>the</b> control group. Workers with the practice of sporting activities were statistically significantly more frequent in the control than in <b>the</b> <b>examined</b> group. <b>The</b> number of workers with work experience less than five years was statistically significantly greater in <b>the</b> <b>examined</b> than in <b>the</b> control group.
