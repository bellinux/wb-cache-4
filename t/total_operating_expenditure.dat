40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the cost frontier for large Victorian public hospitals using the econometric technique of stochastic frontier regression. An {{estimate of the}} mean level of hospital cost inefficiency in 1994 / 95 is obtained, in the period following the introduction of casemix funding. One of the major goals of Victoria's casemix funding system introduced in 1993 was to promote efficiency, hence hospital efficiency under the new system is of interest. We might expect to find {{a low level of}} cost inefficiency under a casemix funding system. The cost frontier is estimated by the econometric technique of stochastic frontier regression, which is the preferred efficiency measurement technique as it allows for data errors. The application of frontier models allowed us to estimate the degree of random and non-random efficiency variation across hospitals. Inpatient output is found to explain the majority of inter-hospital variation in total cost. The average level of cost inefficiency in <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> is estimated to be around 3 percent, using an exponential distribution for the inefficiency component. Where there are differences in costs between hospitals, they appear to be related to administrative, medical support and hotel labour inputs...|$|E

In {{the past decade}} alone, the price of jet-fuel has quadrupled and the fuel component of DOC has increased from 14 % {{to a third of}} <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> in 2013. Currently, airlines attempt to improve their financial position by downsizing or reconstructing their operations. This strategy has only limited effectiveness and avoids addressing the central DOC problem. With an increasing demand for jet-fuel and a reduction in global supply, the price of fuel is projected to increase further. The air transport sector faces a considerable challenge in reducing its cost base to keep air travel affordable and environmentally sustainable. Aviation is a significant contributor to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2), a gas that is attributed to global warming. To address this contribution, International Air Transport Association (IATA) has issued a global commercial aviation mandate to reduce net CO 2 to 50 % of 2005 levels by 2050 with carbon neutral growth from 2020. In 2012, IATA stated that air travel capacity increase (5. 3 % per annum) outpaced percentage efficiency improvements (2 % per annum) resulting in 20 million tonne increase in net CO 2 emissions...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} high performing school districts in Texas and to determine if there are different characteristics leading to the provision of an adequate education in high performing districts as compared to low performing districts. It specifically sought to determine which characteristics contributed most to an adequate education and used data from the Texas Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS) which chronicled scores on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS). The population for this study consisted of all 2001 - 2002 Texas public school districts with the exception of charter schools, special-purpose statutory districts, and state-administered districts, which resulted in using data from 1027 Texas school districts. Descriptive discriminant analysis was chosen as the method for statistical analysis. Data were obtained from the Texas Education Agency (TEA). Adequate and inadequate districts were analyzed according to eight variables. They were (1) taxable value per pupil, (2) the percentage of special education students, (3) the percentage of students coded as bilingual and ESL, (4) pupil-teacher ratio, (5) the size of the district, (6) the percentage of economically disadvantaged students in the district, (7) the district community type, such as rural or suburban, and (8) the <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures</b> per pupil. Two analyses were conducted. The first analysis sought to determine the different characteristics between adequate districts (districts that scored 80 % or above on the TAAS test) and inadequate districts (districts that scored 79 % or below on the TAAS test). In order to determine these differences with a higher standard for adequacy, a second analysis was performed. The second analysis focused on districts deemed adequate by scoring 90 % or above on the TAAS test compared to those districts deemed inadequate by scoring 69 % and below. The eight variables accounted for 21 % and 37 % of the variance between groups respectively. For both analyses performed, the three variables that clearly contributed most to predicting membership in the two groups were the percentage of economically disadvantaged students(. 935,. 652), the percent of students in bilingual or ESL programs (. 332,. 371), and the taxable values per pupil (. 178,. 058). The percentage of economically disadvantaged students indicated that this variable explained 94 % and 65 % of the overall effect sizes. The percentage of bilingual and ESL students explained 33 % and 37 % of the effect size. Taxable Value per pupil explained 17 % and 6 % of the effect size. The percentage of special education students, <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures</b> per pupil, the student-teacher ratio, community type, and the size of the district each, revealed only slight contribution to group differences. These results clearly suggested that the inadequate districts had higher percentages of economically disadvantaged students and ESL students while the adequate districts had higher taxable value per pupil, or wealth...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{intent of}} this degree {{paper is to}} analyze the fiscal impact of nonresidential {{development}} on annexed territory in the City of East Point, Georgia. The analysis projects the direct, current, public costs and revenues associated with nonresidential development on one hundred fifty (150) acres of annexed land. The analysis considers the current costs and revenues of the development {{as if it were}} completed and operating today. The Proportional Valuation Method (PVM), developed by Robert W. Burchell and David Listokin (1980) was used to conduct the analysis. PVM is an average costing approach used to project the impact of nonresidential development on local costs and revenues. The method assigns costs attributable to the share of the real property value that nonresidential use adds to a city 2 ̆ 7 s real property tax base. The method employs a two step process to assign a share of municipal costs to the new development. First, a share of the city 2 ̆ 7 s <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures</b> is given to all local nonresidential uses. Second, a portion of these nonresidential costs is allocated to the incoming nonresidential facility. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the costs and revenues associated with the development of an office industrial park complex on 150 acres of nonresidential land acquired by the City of East Point, Georgia. This study is significant because of the fact that the analysis provides useful information which the officials of the City of East Point can use to determine whether the annexation will impact positively on the revenue base of the city. The findings indicate that there is the possibility that the city 2 ̆ 7 s goal of increasing its revenue base can be realized.
