25|$|On December 29, 1863, Dodd {{was stopped}} by a Union sentry in west Little Rock, near Ten Mile House on Stagecoach Road, and {{was found to be}} without a pass. For {{identification}} he showed his small leather notebook, where Union soldiers found his birth certificate and a page with dots and dashes. A Union officer was able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> of the Morse code messages, which contained information about Union troop strength and locations in Little Rock; Dodd was arrested.|$|E
25|$|Although the show's {{writers and}} {{producers}} received a minimal negative reaction from Willow choosing Tara over Oz, {{the response from}} viewers and critics alike was overwhelming towards Whedon for killing Tara, accusing him of homophobia. Particularly because Tara's death came {{at a point where}} Willow and Tara had reconciled and were shown following an apparent sexual encounter, the writers were criticized for representing the consequences of lesbian sex as punishable by death. Series writer and producer Marti Noxon—whose mother fell in love with another woman when Noxon was 13 years old—was unable <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> of the mail the writing team received because it was so upsetting. To her, the pain expressed in viewers' letters was a logical reaction to the lack of realistic lesbian role models on television.|$|E
25|$|By {{the twentieth}} century Frenchtown had its own stores, doctors, pharmacy, schools, restaurants, nightclubs, and (on Tennessee Street) a movie theater. When James Baldwin visited <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> of his work at FAMU, he stayed at (and could only stay at) the Tookes Hotel. Frenchtown was {{a stop on the}} Chitlin' Circuit, and famous black musicians like Louis Armstrong, B. B. King, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Little Richard, Little Milton, Al Green, Lou Rawls, and Nat and Cannonball Adderley {{performed}} there; in the 1940s Ray Charles and the Adderley brothers lived there. All the businesses and night clubs on the western side of Macomb Street were torn down when it was widened around 1990. Macomb Street, together with Old Bainbridge Road, which starts where Macomb ends, was {{in the early twentieth century}} the main route out of Tallahassee to the northwest (toward Quincy, Florida, and Bainbridge, Georgia).|$|E
5000|$|Laird {{also cited}} the {{enduring}} influence of Irish poet Seamus Heaney {{on his life}} and work, tracing his love of literature back <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>some</b> of Heaney's early work, which he claimed [...] "seems to be written {{out of the same}} place that you live." ...|$|R

2500|$|Efforts <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> {{significance}} {{into the}} numbers of towers and faces have run up against the circumstance that these numbers have not remained constant over time, as towers have been added through construction and lost to attrition. At one point, the temple was host to 49 such towers; now only 37 remain. [...] The number of faces is approximately 200, but since some are only partially preserved {{there can be no}} definitive count.|$|E
2500|$|Kight also acted {{while he}} was in Albuquerque. From 1950 to 1955, he was {{involved}} in the [...] "Summerhouse Theater" [...] and the [...] "Old Town Players" [...] in Albuquerque. The two companies brought in many actors from California, and Kight was able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> of the new [...] "Homophile" [...] organizations' pamphlets and circulations that these actors brought with them. [...] This was his first exposure to groups like the Mattachine Society, which he considered elitist.|$|E
2500|$|Paulo Coelho is {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of spreading his books through peer-to-peer file sharing networks. He put his own books on file-sharing networks like BitTorrent, and noted that The Alchemist received a boost in sales due to this. He stated that [...] "I do think that when a reader has the possibility <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> chapters, {{he or she can}} always decide to buy the book later." [...] Currently, chapters from The Alchemist can be found on Google Books and Coelho's agency Sant Jordi Associados.|$|E

5000|$|The show is {{scheduled}} to air weekdays from 5:30AM to 10:00AM (though they often begin and end several minutes late, sometimes going to 10:15). The host(s) typically begin the program by announcing what is {{coming up on the}} show that day. They then take calls from their listeners and gives away prizes to the first caller of each show. They continue taking listener calls throughout the day, in addition <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>some</b> listener e-mails. Sometimes they will introduce a particularly ridiculous, confusing, or embarrassing phone call as [...] "Stupid Call of the Day." ...|$|R
2500|$|Orthography {{describes}} or {{defines the}} set of symbols used in a language, and the rules about how to write these symbols. [...] Orthographic Development proceeds in increasing complexity as a child learns <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>Some</b> {{of the first things}} to be learnt are the orthographic conventions such as the direction of reading and that there are differing typefaces and capitalization for each symbol. In general, this means that to read proficiently, the reader has to understand elements of the written language including hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{had a major}} {{advantage}} in their ability <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> German naval Enigma codes. An understanding of the German coding methods {{had been brought to}} Britain via France from Polish code-breakers. Thereafter, code books and equipment were captured by raids on German weather ships and from captured U-boats. A team including Alan Turing used special purpose [...] "Bombes" [...] and early computers to break new German codes as they were introduced. The speedy decoding of messages was vital in directing convoys away from wolf packs and allowing interception and destruction of U-boats. This was demonstrated when the Naval Enigma machines were altered in February 1942 and wolf-pack effectiveness greatly increased until the new code was broken.|$|E

60|$|From her tone, and the eager, {{strained}} {{expression of}} her face, {{it was not}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>read</b> that <b>some</b> mighty interest of hers was involved in my reply. It needed not the low moan that burst from her companion to tell me so.|$|R

5000|$|In his {{biography}} of Waugh, journalist Christopher Sykes recalled, [...] "I {{was in a}} nursing home when Decline and Fall came out, and Tom Driberg visited me and brought a copy. He began <b>to</b> <b>read</b> out <b>some</b> favourite passages and was literally unable <b>to</b> <b>read</b> them <b>to</b> the end because he and I were so overcome by laughter." ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the spring}} of 1866, the {{condition}} of the graves and markers were worsening. Many of the wooden markers were beginning to be hard <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and <b>some</b> had been used as firewood at a time of shortages. The full identities of these men were in danger.|$|R

60|$|He {{took the}} book with an eager hand, and perused the sketch as if trying <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> secret there. After a minute he handed it back with a light sigh, {{apparently}} of relief, but said nothing.|$|E
60|$|After lunch {{the boys}} {{sat down to}} write some letters and <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> {{newspapers}} which had just come in. In the news was word of some big oil well strikes at a place about forty miles distant.|$|E
50|$|Zag, {{wanting to}} bring some Saturday morning classiness to the show persuades Zig <b>to</b> <b>read</b> out <b>some</b> poetry, however despite the {{classical}} music {{in the background and}} polite applause Zig inevitably reads out song lyrics from hot club tracks in a posh style, until Zag realises that he’s been duped.|$|R
50|$|Kirk co-authored {{many books}} with Dr. Frank Laubach and son Dr. Robert Laubach, {{which are still}} in use for {{teaching}} adults <b>to</b> <b>read</b> English.

50|$|She {{continued}} {{her work with}} the blind by teaching Braille at the hospital. As blind patients learned how <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Braille, <b>some</b> of them taught others. Delaney acquired talking books for the blind patients. Delaney taught more than 600 patients how <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Braille. They were also encouraged to join the clubs and programs that were run, giving them the same opportunities as the other patients.|$|R
60|$|So now {{remember}} that chalk is carbonate of lime, {{and that it}} is made up of three things, calcium, oxygen, and carbon; and that therefore its mark is CaCO(3), in Analysis's language, which I hope you will be able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> day.|$|E
6000|$|The {{student who}} wishes to acquire an {{elementary}} knowledge of philosophy will find it both easier and more profitable <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> {{of the works of}} the great philosophers than to attempt to derive an all-round view from handbooks.

60|$|He liked much to {{look over}} the books in the library. Many of them were old novels, the names of which were {{familiar}} enough to him, but which he had never read. He determined <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>some</b> of them as soon as he felt fixed and settled.|$|E
50|$|Gersen frees the {{servants}} at the Palace, informs the planet’s inhabitants {{that they need}} pay taxes no more, and entrusts the various Drusillas to Navarth’s eccentric care.

50|$|Two {{autograph}} sources exist: {{the parts}} for the Kyrie and Gloria sections that Bach deposited in Dresden in 1733, and the {{score of the}} complete work that Bach compiled in 1748-50, which was inherited by C.P.E. Bach (the autograph has been published in facsimile from the source in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin. However, for his 1786 public performance of the Symbolum Nicenum, C.P.E. Bach, as was typical practice in the era, made additions to the autograph score for performance by adding a 28-bar introduction, replacing the now-obsolete oboe d'amore with newer instruments (clarinets, oboes, or violins) and making other changes in instrumentation for his own aesthetic reasons. C.P.E. also wrote in his own solutions <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>some</b> passages made nearly illegible by his father's late-life handwriting problems.|$|R
50|$|Finding a spare moment {{four days}} before another Methodist conference, Theron gets around <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>some</b> books he {{borrowed}} from Dr. Ledsmar. He reads nearly all day long, and when Alice enters the room she is surprised to find him researching his book on Abraham that she thought he abandoned. He tells her {{that he has a}} headache, and she is concerned that he is getting sick. When she leaves, he is pleased by his solitude and ability <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the books. He suddenly has a realization that he envies Forbes and Ledsmar, who are able to live with their own theories and ideas, and that Forbes can still work in the religious field. He contemplates leaving his job as a pastor when Alice returns home and introduces him to Sister Soulsby, a debt-raiser whom she hired so the congregation would not take away from the Ware's income and so they can possibly afford a new house.|$|R
