5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of {{symptoms such as}} anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, {{in the absence of}} the drug, <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is severe; and scores of 6 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|E
25|$|The checklists {{also make}} it {{straightforward}} to collect and compare information from multiple informants. Teachers and parents oftentimes spend much {{more time with the}} youth than the clinician does. There are both parent and teacher checklists available. Clinicians can look at both <b>the</b> <b>Symptom</b> Count scores and <b>the</b> <b>Symptom</b> Severity scores and analyze them in order {{to determine whether or not}} it surpasses the Clinical Cutoff score.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{include many}} of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{associated}} with milder degrees of hypoglycemia, especially <b>the</b> adrenergic <b>symptoms,</b> {{but do not}} progress to objective impairment of brain function, seizures, coma, or brain damage.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{associated}} with <b>the</b> disorder are often confused for other dermatological disorders. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> below are ones specifically {{associated with}} IPS.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptom</b> of {{prenatal}} {{growth retardation}} {{is the most}} common finding and can be moderate to severe. Postnatal growth retardation can also be moderate to severe and correlates with the degree of severity of limb and craniofacial malformations.|$|E
25|$|According to United States {{data for}} 2004, in about 66% {{of men and}} 47% of women, the first symptom of {{atherosclerotic}} cardiovascular disease is {{a heart attack or}} sudden cardiac death (death within one hour of onset of <b>the</b> <b>symptom).</b>|$|E

50|$|A CRT is a {{statement}} of an underlying core problem and <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> that arise from it. It maps out a sequence {{of cause and effect}} from the core problem to <b>the</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Most of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> will arise from the one core problem or a core conflict. Removing the core problem may well lead to removing each of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> as well. Operationally working backwards from the apparent undesirable effects or symptoms to uncover or discover the underlying core cause.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> usually affect <b>the</b> nipple {{and then}} {{spread to the}} areola and then the breast. It is common for <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> to wax and wane.|$|R
25|$|Headache is <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> of pain {{anywhere}} {{in the region of}} the head or neck. It occurs in migraines (sharp, or throbbing pains), tension-type headaches, and cluster headaches. Frequent headaches can affect relationships and employment. There is also an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches.|$|E
25|$|Both {{parent and}} teacher {{assessment}} scales have two components: symptom assessment and impairment in performance. <b>The</b> <b>symptom</b> assessment component screens for symptoms relevant to inattentive and hyperactive ADHD subtypes. To meet criteria for ADHD diagnoses, one must have 6 positive responses to either the core 9 inattentive symptoms or core 9 hyperactive symptoms, or both.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptom</b> {{of black}} pod disease is the {{necrotic}} lesion on the cocoa pod with brown or black color, which eventually enlarged {{to cover the}} whole pod. White mycelia growth on lesions that appeared several days after infection is the sign for the causal pathogen of black pod disease, which is Phytophthora spp.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{of local}} {{allergic}} rhinitis {{are the same}} as <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of allergic rhinitis, including <b>symptoms</b> in <b>the</b> eyes. Just as with allergic rhinitis, people can have either seasonal or perennial local allergic rhinitis. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> of local allergic rhinitis can be mild, moderate, or severe. Local allergic rhinitis is associated with conjunctivitis and asthma.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> of {{stimulant}} psychosis {{may vary}} slightly {{depending on the}} drug ingested but generally include <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of organic psychosis including hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder.|$|R
50|$|This {{problem can}} also be caused by {{excessive}} weight in children. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> are more like <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> adults feel such as restlessness, exhaustion, etc.|$|R
25|$|Morphine is {{beneficial}} in reducing <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> of {{shortness of breath}} due to both cancer and noncancer causes. In the setting of breathlessness at rest or on minimal exertion from conditions such as advanced cancer or end-stage cardiorespiratory diseases, regular, low-dose sustained-release morphine significantly reduces breathlessness safely, with its benefits maintained over time.|$|E
25|$|Usually no causative {{abnormality}} can {{be identified}} and treatment is directed at <b>the</b> <b>symptom,</b> rather than a specific mechanism. However, there are known causes of abnormal uterine bleeding {{that need to be}} ruled out. Most common causes based on the nature of bleeding is listed below followed by the rare causes of bleeding (i.e. disorders of coagulation).|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} measure above, {{systemic}} immediate release opioids are beneficial in emergently reducing <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> of {{shortness of breath}} due to both cancer and non cancer causes; long-acting/sustained-release opioids are also used to prevent/continue treatment of dyspnea in palliative setting. Pulmonary rehabilitation may alleviate symptoms in some people, such as those with COPD, but will not cure the underlying disease. There {{is a lack of}} evidence to recommend midazolam, nebulised opioids, the use of gas mixtures, or cognitive-behavioral therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{may vary}} {{depending}} upon the person, {{the severity of the}} allergy, and type of fruit. For example, mango allergy symptoms include hoarseness, dyspnoea and bronchitic rales (asthma) (Sareen and Shah). The duration of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> tested by Saree and Shah were variable and ranged from 4 h 11 to 7 days 12. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> may appear within a few minutes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{signs and}} {{criteria}} {{used to establish}} a diagnosis are important. First, <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> must clearly follow a stressor. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> should be more severe than would be expected. There should {{not appear to be}} other underlying disorders. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> that are present are not part of a normal grieving for the death of family member or other loved one.|$|R

25|$|There are {{a number}} of habits possessed by {{individuals}} that can be classified as nervous habits. These include nail-biting, stammering, sniffling, and banging the head. They are known as symptoms of an emotional state and are generally based upon conditions of anxiety, insecurity, inferiority and tension. These habits are often formed at a young age and may be because of a need for attention. When trying to overcome a nervous habit it is important to resolve the cause of the nervous feeling rather than <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> which is a habit itself.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Henrik Sjögren (1899–1986), an {{ophthalmologist}} in Jönköping, Sweden, {{observed a}} patient with low secretions from the lacrimal and salivary glands. Sjögren introduced the term keratoconjunctivitis sicca for <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis). In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis, describing 19 females, {{most of whom were}} postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. Sjögren clarifies that keratoconjunctivitis sicca, resulting from water deficiency, had no relation to xerophthalmia, resulting from vitamin A deficiency. Sjögren's thesis was not well received as the Board of Examiners criticized some clinical aspects.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia {{can occur}} during the aura {{phase of a}} {{migraine}} attack, a phase that often precedes the onset of a headache and is commonly characterized by visual disturbances. Micropsia, along with hemianopsia, quadrantopsia, scotoma, phosphene, teicopsia, metamorphopsia, macropsia, teleopsia, diplopia, dischromatopsia, and hallucination disturbances, {{is a type of}} aura that occurs immediately before or during the onset of a migraine headache. <b>The</b> <b>symptom</b> usually occurs less than thirty minutes before the migraine headache begins and lasts for five to twenty minutes. Only 10-20% of children with migraine headaches experience auras. Visual auras such as micropsia are most common in children with migraines.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment of CVI {{in the leg}} {{involves}} managing <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> (and preventing <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> getting worse) {{instead of}} effecting a cure. It is sometimes called conservative treatment. Conservative treatments include: ...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of DES {{fall into}} three broad categories: cognitive, {{emotional}} and behavioural. Many of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{can be seen}} as a direct result of impairment to the central executive component of working memory, which is responsible for attentional control and inhibition. Although many of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> regularly co-occur, it is common to encounter patients who have several, but not all <b>symptoms.</b> <b>The</b> accumulated effects of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> have a large impact on daily life.|$|R
50|$|Envenomation {{with the}} male venom {{produced}} mostly <b>the</b> same <b>symptoms,</b> although <b>the</b> onset of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{was a little}} delayed. The female venom also produces <b>the</b> same <b>symptoms,</b> but far less severe.|$|R
25|$|Many {{people with}} {{neurologic}} disorders exhibit uncontrollable episodes of laughing, crying, or both {{that are either}} exaggerated or contradictory to {{the context in which}} they occur. Where patients have significant cognitive deficits (e.g., Alzheimer's) it can be unclear whether it is true PBA as opposed to a grosser form of emotional dysregulation, but patients with intact cognition often report <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> as disturbing. Patients report that their episodes are at best only partially amenable to voluntary control, and unless they experience a severe change of mental status, they often have insight into their problem and judge their emotional display as inappropriate and out of character. The clinical effect of PBA can be severe, with unremitting and persistent symptoms that can be disabling to patients, and may significantly affect quality of life for caregivers.|$|E
25|$|Hyposalivation is a {{clinical}} diagnosis {{that is made}} based on the history and examination, but reduced salivary flow rates have been given objective definitions. Salivary gland hypofunction {{has been defined as}} any objectively demonstrable reduction in whole and/or individual gland flow rates. An unstimulated whole saliva flow rate in a normal person is 0.3–0.4 ml per minute, and below 0.1 ml per minute is significantly abnormal. A stimulated saliva flow rate less than 0.5 ml per gland in 5minutes or less than 1 ml per gland in 10minutes is decreased. The term subjective xerostomia is sometimes used to describe <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> {{in the absence of any}} detectable abnormality or cause. Xerostomia may also result from a change in composition of saliva (from serous to mucous). Salivary gland dysfunction is an umbrella term for the presence of either xerostomia or salivary gland hypofunction.|$|E
25|$|An Autistic spectrum. In its {{simplest}} form this joins together Autism and Asperger syndrome, and can additionally {{include other}} pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). These include PDD 'not otherwise specified' (including 'atypical autism'), {{as well as}} Rett syndrome and Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). The first three of these disorders are commonly called the autism spectrum disorders; the last two disorders are much rarer, and are sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not. The merging of these disorders is based on findings that <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> profiles are similar, such that individuals are better differentiated by clinical specifiers (i.e. dimensions of severity, such as extent of social communication difficulties or how fixed or restricted behaviors or interests are) and associated features (e.g. known genetic disorders, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities). The term Specific developmental disorders is reserved for categorizing particular specific learning disabilities and developmental disorders affecting coordination.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{must also}} be {{inappropriate}} and must interfere with social, school, or work functioning, in addition to meeting multiple other diagnostic requirements. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> used in <b>the</b> diagnosis are shown below.|$|R
50|$|There {{is great}} deal of variety in <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{associated}} with ventriculitis. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> vary based {{on a number of}} different factors including severity of inflammation, underlying cause, and the individual patient.|$|R
50|$|Although some of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of PMDD and BPD are similar, {{they are}} {{different}} disorders. They are distinguishable by the timing and duration of symptoms, which are markedly different: <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of PMDD occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, whereas BPD symptoms occur persistently at all stages of the menstrual cycle. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> of PMDD do not include impulsivity.|$|R
