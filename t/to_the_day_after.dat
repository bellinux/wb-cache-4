5|$|Hart {{arrived in}} his home town of Carterton to a hero's welcome on 25 April 1919, five years <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> being landed at Gallipoli. The guest of honour at several receptions held around the Wairarapa {{over the next several}} days, he made a point of {{acknowledging}} the role played by the ordinary soldier in the eventual victory over the Germans while downplaying his own contributions. He was eventually discharged from the NZEF in late May 1919. His services in the war were subsequently recognised with his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath. The French government also awarded him with the Croix de guerre.|$|E
5|$|A {{film of the}} O2 performance, Celebration Day, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was {{released}} on home video on 19 November. The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed {{that he had been}} remastering the band's discography. The first wave of albums, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III, were released on 2 June 2014. The second wave of albums, Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014. Physical Graffiti {{was released}} on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> the original release.

5|$|Day 3 outlooks refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> tomorrow, {{and include}} the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are {{less and less}} likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
