As a specific example, recent sensitivity analyses for the Very High Temperature Gen-IV reactor concept (Taiwo et al, 2005 a, Salvatores et al., 2005, Taiwo et al, 2005 b), which features a somewhat harder thermal neutron spectrum and a significantly higher fuel burnup target than is the case for standard light-water reactors, show a potential need for improved cross sections for some isotopes, including 238 U, 239 Pu, 240 Pu, 41 Pu, and 243 Am, primarily in the resonance energy range, in order to satisfy the defined accuracy requirements on key computed integral parameters.

A lot of fission or activation products (137 Cs, 134 Cs, 133 Ba, 60 Co, 152 Eu, etc.) can be detected quite easily using gamma spectrometry. Although pure beta-emitting radionuclides such as 3 H, 14 C, and 90 Sr and the <b>transuranic</b> <b>nuclides</b> 238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu and 241 Pu are difficult to detect by gamma spectrometry, they can be detected using liquid scintillation counting (LSC) (3 H, 14 C, 90 Sr, 241 Pu) and alpha spectrometry (238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu).

The objective of this thesis is to analyze the impact of conventional PWR spent fuel variations on TRU-fueled Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) systems.

40|$|Key {{aspects of}} the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) are to {{significantly}} advance the science and technology of nuclear energy systems and the Advanced Fuel Cycle (AFC) program. It consists of both innovative nuclear reactors and innovative research in separation and transmutation. To accomplish these goals, international cooperation is very important and public acceptance is crucial. The merits of nuclear energy are high-density energy, with low environmental impacts (i. e. almost zero greenhouse gas emission). Planned efforts involve near-term and intermediate-term improvements in fuel utilization and recycling in current light water reactors (LWRs) {{as well as the}} longer-term development of new nuclear energy systems that offer much improved fuel utilization and proliferation resistance, along with continued advances in operational safety. The challenges are solving the energy needs of the world, protection against nuclear proliferation, the problem of nuclear waste, and the global environmental problem. To reduce spent fuel for storage and enhance the proliferation resistance for the intermediate-term, there are two major approaches (a) increase the discharged spent fuel burnup in the advanced LWR (Gen-III Plus), which not only can reduce the spent fuel for storage, but also increase the 238 Pu and 240 Pu isotopes ratio to enhance the proliferation resistance, and (b) use of <b>transuranic</b> <b>nuclides</b> (237 Np and 241 Am) in the high burnup fuel, which can drastically increase the proliferation resistance isotope ratio of 238 Pu /Pu. For future advanced nuclear systems, the minor actinides (MA) are viewed more as a resource to be recycled, or transmuted to less hazardous and possibly more useful forms, rather than simply as a waste stream to be disposed of in expensive repository facilities. As a result, MAs play a much larger part in the design of advanced systems and fuel cycles, not only as additional sources of useful energy, but also as direct contributors to the reactivity control of the systems into which they are incorporated. In the study, a typical boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel unit lattice cell model with UO 2 fuel pins will be used to investigate the effectiveness of minor actinide reduction approach (MARA) for enhancing proliferation resistance and improving the fuel cycle performance in the intermediate term goal for future nuclear energy systems. To account for the water coolant density variation from the bottom (0. 76 g/cm 3) to the top (0. 35 g/cm 3) of the core, the axial coolant channel and fuel pin were divided to 24 nodes. The MA transmutation characteristics at different elevations were compared and their impact on neutronics criticality discussed. We concluded that the concept of MARA, which involves the use of <b>transuranic</b> <b>nuclides</b> (237 Np and/or 241 Am), significantly increases the 238 Pu/Pu ratio for proliferation resistance, as well as serves as a burnable absorber to hold-down the initial excess reactivity.

40|$|The Deep-Burn (DB) concept [] {{focuses on}} the {{destruction}} of <b>transuranic</b> <b>nuclides</b> from used light water reactor (LWR) fuel. These <b>transuranic</b> <b>nuclides</b> are incorporated into tri-isotopic (TRISO) coated fuel particles and used in gas-cooled reactors {{with the aim of}} a fractional fuel burnup of 60 to 70 % in fissions per initial metal atom (FIMA). This high performance is expected through the use of multiple recirculation passes of the fuel in pebble form without any physical or chemical changes between passes. In particular, the concept does not call for reprocessing of the fuel between passes. In principle, the DB pebble bed concept employs the same reactor designs as the presently envisioned low-enriched uranium core designs, such as the 400 MWth Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR- 400) []. Although it has been shown in the previous Fiscal Year (FY) (2009) that a PuO 2 fueled pebble bed reactor concept is viable, achieving a high fuel burnup while remaining within safety-imposed prescribed operational limits for fuel temperature, power peaking, and temperature reactivity feedback coefficients for the entire temperature range, is challenging. The presence of the isotopes 239 Pu, 240 Pu, and 241 Pu that have resonances in the thermal energy range significantly modifies the neutron thermal energy spectrum as compared to a standard, UO 2 -fueled core. Therefore, the DB pebble bed core exhibits a relatively hard neutron energy spectrum. However, regions within the pebble bed that are near the graphite reflectors experience a locally softer spectrum. This can lead to power and temperature peaking in these regions. Furthermore, a shift of the thermal energy spectrum with increasing temperature can lead to increased absorption in the resonances of the fissile Pu isotopes. This can lead to a positive temperature reactivity coefficient for the graphite moderator under certain operating conditions. Regarding the coated particle performance, the FY 2009 investigations showed that no significant failure is to be expected for the reference fuel particle during normal operation. It was found, however, that the sensitivity of the coating stress to the CO production in the kernel was large. The CO production is expected to be higher in DB fuel than in UO 2 fuel, but its exact level has a high uncertainty. Furthermore, in the fuel performance analysis transient conditions were not yet taken into account. The effort of this task in FY 2010 has focused on the optimization of the core to maximize the pebble discharge burnup level, while retaining its inherent safety characteristics. Using generic pebble bed reactor cores, this task will perform physics calculations to evaluate the capabilities of the pebble bed reactor to perform utilization and destruction of LWR used-fuel transuranics. The task will use established benchmarked models, and will introduce modeling advancements appropriate {{to the nature of the}} fuel considered (high transuranic [TRU] content and high burn-up).

Facility siting, laboratory location, and adjacent support areas were often determined based on criteria, which while appropriate at the time, are not always the most conducive to a D&D project.

Thus, we can reduce the spent fuel volume while increasing the proliferation resistance by increasing the isotopic ratio of 238 Pu/Pu. For future advanced nuclear systems, MAs are viewed more as a resource to be recycled, and transmuted to less hazardous and possibly more useful forms, rather than simply disposed of as a waste stream in an expensive repository facility.

However, adding MAs will increase plutonium production in the discharged spent fuel. In this work, the Monte-Carlo coupling with ORIGEN- 2. 2 (MCWO) method was used to optimize the MA loading in the UO 2 fuel such that the discharged spent fuel demonstrates enhanced proliferation resistance, while minimizing plutonium production.

A combined total of over 90 million gallons of high-level waste (HLW) and low-level waste (LLW) are stored in 335 underground storage tanks at four different DOE sites. Roughly 98 % of this waste is highly alkaline in nature and contains high concentrations of nitrate and nitrite salts along with lesser concentrations of other salts. The primary waste forms are sludge, saltcake, and liquid supernatant with {{the bulk of the}} radioactivity contained in the sludge, making it the largest source of HLW. The saltcake (liquid waste with most of the water removed) and liquid supernatant consist mainly of sodium nitrate and sodium hydroxide salts. The main radioactive constituent in the alkaline supernatant is cesium- 137, but strontium- 90, technetium- 99, and <b>transuranic</b> <b>nuclides</b> are also present in varying concentrations. Reduction of the radioactivity below Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) limits would allow the bulk of the waste to be disposed of as LLW. Because of the long half-life of technetium- 99 (2. 1 x 10 5 y) and the mobility of the pertechnetate ion (TcO 4 -) in the environment, it is expected that technetium will have to be removed from the Hanford wastes prior to disposal as LLW. Also, for some of the wastes, some level of technetium removal will be required to meet LLW criteria for radioactive content. Therefore, DOE has identified a need to develop technologies for the separation and concentration of technetium- 99 from LLW streams.

The Fuel Development Plan (FDP) includes the work on fuel necessary to support the design and licensing of the DB-MHR. The FDP is organized into ten sections. Section 1 provides a summary of the most important features of the plan, including cost and schedule information. Section 2 describes the DB-MHR concept, the features of its fuel and the plan to develop coated particle fuel for transmutation. Section 3 describes the knowledge base for fabrication of coated particles, the experience with irradiation performance of coated particle fuels, the database for fission product transport in HTGR cores, and describes test data and calculations for the performance of coated particle fuel while in a repository. Section 4 presents the fuel performance requirements in terms of as-manufactured quality and performance of the fuel coatings under irradiation and accident conditions. These requirements are provisional because the design of the DB-MHR is in an early stage. However, the requirements are presented in this preliminary form to guide the initial work on the fuel development. Section 4 also presents limits on the irradiation conditions to which the coated particle fuel can be subjected for the core design. These limits are based on past irradiation experience. Section 5 describes the Design Data Needs to: (1) fabricate the coated particle fuel, (2) predict its performance in the reactor core, (3) predict the radionuclide release rates from the reactor core, and (4) predict the performance of spent fuel in a geological repository. The heart of this fuel development plan is Section 6, which describes the development activities proposed to satisfy the DDNs presented in Section 5.

40|$|To assure {{nuclear power}} sustainability, ongoing efforts on {{advanced}} closed-fuel cycle options and adapted open cycles {{have led to}} investigations of various strategies involving utilization of <b>Transuranic</b> (TRU) <b>nuclides</b> in nuclear reactors. Due to favorable performance characteristics, multiple studies are focused on transmutation options using High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). Prismatic HTGRs allow for 3 -Dimensional (3 D) fuel shuffling and prior shuffling algorithms were based on experimental block movement and/or manual block shuffle patterns. In this dissertation, a physics based 3 D multi-directional reloading algorithm for prismatic deep burn very high temperature reactors (DB-VHTRs) was developed and tested to meet DB-VHTR operation constraints utilizing a high fidelity neutronics model developed for this dissertation. The high fidelity automated neutronics model allows design flexibility and metric tracking in spatial and temporal dimensions. Reduction of TRUs in DB-VHTRs utilizing full vectors of TRUs from light water reactor spent nuclear fuel has been demonstrated for both a single and two-fuel composition cores. Performance of the beginning-of-life and end-of-life (EOL) domains for multi-dimensional permutations were evaluated. Utilizing a two-fuel assembly permutation within the two-fuel system domain for a Single-Fuel vector, the developed shuffling algorithm for this dissertation has successfully been tested to meet performance objectives and operation constraints...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{designed}} and analyzed advanced sodium-cooled fast reactor cores using uranium-free metallic fuels for maximizing burning rate of <b>transuranics</b> (TRU) <b>nuclides</b> from PWR spent fuels. It {{is well known}} that the removal of fertile nuclides such as 238 U from fuels in liquid metal cooled fast reactor leads to the degradation of important safety parameters such as the Doppler coefficient, coolant void worth, and delayed neutron fraction. To resolve the degradation of the Doppler coefficient, we considered adding resonant nuclides to the uranium-free metallic fuels. The analysis results showed that the cores using uranium-free fuels loaded with tungsten instead of uranium have a significantly lower burnup reactivity swing and more negative Doppler coefficients than the core using uranium-free fuels without resonant nuclides. In addition, we considered the use of axially central B 4 C absorber region and moderator rods to further improve safety parameters such as sodium void worth, burnup reactivity swing, and the Doppler coefficient. The results of the analysis showed that the final design core can consume ~ 353 kg per cycle and satisfies self-controllability under unprotected accidents. The fuel cycle analysis showed that the PWR–SFR coupling fuel cycle option drastically reduces the amount of waste going to repository and the SFR burner can consume the amount of TRUs discharged from 3. 72 PWRs generating the same electricity...|$|R
40|$|The current waste {{management}} strategy for {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) mandated by the U. S. Congress is the disposal of high-level waste (HLW) in a geological repository at Yucca Mountain. Ongoing efforts on closed-fuel cycle options and difficulties in opening and safeguarding such a repository have led to investigations of alternative {{waste management}} strategies. One potential strategy would make use of fuels containing <b>transuranic</b> (TRU) <b>nuclides</b> in nuclear reactors. This would prolong reactor operation on a single fuel loading and by doing so, would reduce current HLW stockpiles. The analysis has already shown that high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) and their Generation IV extensions, very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), have encouraging performance characteristics that will allow for prolonged operation with no intermediate refueling, {{as well as for}} transmutation of TRUs. The objective of this research was to show that TRU-fueled VHTRs have the possibility of prolonged operation on a single fuel loading while retaining their Generation IV safety features. In addition, this research evaluated performance characteristics, and identified operational domains of these systems, as well as the possibility of HLW reduction. A whole-core, 3 -D model of a power size prismatic VHTR with a detailed temperature distribution was developed for calculations with the SCALE 5. 1 code package.

40|$|The current waste {{management}} strategy for {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) mandated by the US Congress is the disposal of high-level waste (HLW) in a geological repository at Yucca Mountain. Ongoing efforts on closed-fuel cycle options and difficulties in opening and safeguarding such a repository have led to investigations of alternative {{waste management}} strategies. One potential strategy for the US fuel cycle would be {{to make use of}} fuel loadings containing high concentrations of <b>transuranic</b> (TRU) <b>nuclides</b> in the next-generation reactors. The use of such fuels would not only increase fuel supply but could also potentially facilitate prolonged operation modes (via fertile additives) on a single fuel loading. The idea is to approach autonomous operation on a single fuel loading that would allow marketing power units as nuclear batteries for worldwide deployment. Studies have already shown that high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) and their Generation IV (GEN IV) extensions, very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), have encouraging performance characteristics. This paper is focused on possible physics features of TRU-fueled VHTRs. One of the objectives of a 3 -year U. S. DOE NERI project was to show that TRU-fueled VHTRs have the possibility of prolonged operation on a single fuel loading. A 3 D temperature distribution was developed based on conceivable operation conditions of the 600 ?MWth VHTR design. Results of extensive criticality and depletion calculations with varying fuel loadings showed that VHTRs are capable for autonomous operation and HLW waste reduction when loaded with TRU fuel.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of measuring the <b>transuranic</b> (TRU) <b>nuclide</b> content of equipment removed from Hanford`s high-level radioactive-waste tanks {{has been established}} for components heavier than about 30 kg/m (20 lbs/ft). This conclusion has been reached based on experience with the TRU assay of waste burial boxes, planned improvements to the assay equipment design and assay methodology, and experimental investigation of neutron detector performance in high gamma-ray fields. The experiments indicate that the neutron detectors presently used with Pacific Northwest Laboratory`s box scanner perform correctly in gamma-ray exposure rates of at least 3 R/h. The design of equipment proposed for measuring TRU content incorporates multiple, BF{sub 3 }-gas-filled neutron counters in a configuration that is approximately 0. 5 m wide and 2 m long, with polyethylene to moderate high-energy neutrons down to thermal energy. Specially developed electrical systems are used to eliminate response to gamma-rays. Performance of the assay would require 10 to 14 hours of time during which close-range access is provided to the waste and its burial container. A standard neutron source, will be placed within the burial container (before inserting components) to allow calibration of the detector. Final calculation of the TRU contamination will utilize plausible conservative assumptions concerning the spatial, isotopic, and elemental distributions of any TRU present. For long-length equipment, the detector array collects data at various positions {{along the length of}} the equipment. Separate monitoring of the cosmic-ray-induced neutron background during the assay period will provide confidence that observed changes in counts at the equipment are not related to changing background. Background measurements using the burial container and equipment {open_quotes}skid{close_quotes} will allow compensation for neutrons that are created by cosmic-ray spallation within the burial container...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{transuranic}} radionuclide contamination in sediments and groundwater at the DOE’s Hanford Site was conducted. The review {{focused primarily on}} plutonium- 239 / 240 and americium- 241; however, other <b>transuranic</b> <b>nuclides</b> were discussed as well, including neptunium- 237, plutonium- 238, and plutonium- 241. The scope of the review included liquid process wastes intentionally disposed to constructed waste disposal facilities such as trenches and cribs, burial grounds, and unplanned releases to the ground surface. The review did not include liquid wastes disposed to tanks or solid wastes disposed to burial grounds. It is estimated that over 11, 800 Ci of plutonium- 239, 28, 700 Ci of americium- 241, and 55 Ci of neptunium- 237 have been disposed as liquid waste to the near surface environment at the Hanford Site. Despite the very large quantities of transuranic contaminants disposed to the vadose zone at Hanford, only minuscule amounts have entered the groundwater. Currently, no wells onsite exceed the DOE derived concentration guide for plutonium- 239 / 240 (30 pCi/L) or any other transuranic contaminant in filtered samples. The DOE derived concentration guide was exceeded by a small fraction in unfiltered samples from one well (299 -E 28 - 23) in recent years (35. 4 and 40. 4 pCi/L in FY 2006). The primary reason that disposal of these large quantities of transuranic radionuclides directly to the vadose zone at the Hanford Site has not resulted in widespread groundwater contamination is that under the typical oxidizing and neutral to slightly alkaline pH conditions of the Hanford vadose zone, transuranic radionuclides (plutonium and americium in particular) have a very low solubility and high affinity for surface adsorption to mineral surfaces common within the Hanford vadose zone. Other important factors are {{the fact that the}} vadose zone is typically very thick (hundreds of feet) and the net infiltration rate is very low due to the desert climate. In some cases where transuranic radionuclides have been co-disposed with acidic liquid waste, transport through the vadose zone for considerable distances has occurred. For example, at the 216 -Z- 9 Crib, plutonium- 239 and americium- 241 have moved to depths in excess of 36 m (118 ft) bgs. Acidic conditions increase the solubility of these contaminants and reduce adsorption to mineral surfaces. Subsequent neutralization of the acidity by naturally occurring calcite in the vadose zone (particularly in the Cold Creek unit) appears to have effectively stopped further migration. The vast majority of transuranic contaminants disposed to the vadose zone on the Hanford Site (10, 200 Ci [86 %] of plutonium- 239; 27, 900 Ci [97 %] of americium- 241; and 41. 8 Ci [78 %] of neptunium- 237) were disposed in sites within the PFP Closure Zone. This closure zone is located within the 200 West Area (see Figures 1. 1 and 3. 1). Other closure zones with notably high quantities of transuranic contaminant disposal include the T Farm Zone with 408 Ci (3. 5 %) plutonium- 239, the PUREX Zone with 330 Ci (2. 8 %) plutonium- 239, 200 -W Ponds Zone with 324 Ci (2. 8 %) plutonium- 239, B Farm Zone with 183 Ci (1. 6 %) plutonium- 239, and the REDOX Zone with 164 Ci (1. 4 %) plutonium 239. Characterization studies for most of the sites reviewed in the document are generally limited. The most prevalent characterization methods used were geophysical logging methods. Characterization of a number of sites included laboratory analysis of borehole sediment samples specifically for radionuclides and other contaminants, and geologic and hydrologic properties. In some instances, more detailed research level studies were conducted. Results of these studies were summarized in the document...|$|R
