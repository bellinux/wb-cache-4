5|$|Early on September14, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} to a tropical depression. It weakened slowly while moving northeastward across the Deep South, before dissipating near Athens, Georgia on September15. Operationally, {{it was considered}} the third tropical cyclone of the season. A telegraph from the Weather Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C. warned vessels to remain in port for portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Strong gales were experienced along the coast from eastern Louisiana to western Florida and severely disrupted <b>telegraph</b> <b>services</b> in the region. The remnants brought heavy rains from Virginia to New England. Rough seas {{along the coast of}} New Jersey washed the schooner Willie ashore.|$|E
5|$|After re-emerging {{into the}} Caribbean Sea, Ella deepened further and peaked as 115mph (185km/h) Category3 {{hurricane}} on September2, {{while it was}} making landfall near Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. Heavy rainfall lead to flooding, which in turn caused hundreds to flee their homes, and resulted in 5fatalities. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>services</b> were disrupted in many areas. The storm became disorganized while moving across the southern coast of Cuba and weakened to a tropical storm by later on September2. Ella reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 4 and briefly re-strengthened. However, it began to weaken again while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm made landfall as a weak tropical storm near Corpus Christi, Texas on September6. It rapidly weakened inland and dissipated later that day. Rainfall and rough surf caused both inland and coastal flooding in Texas. Offshore, the captain of a snapper boat fell overboard and went missing; he was later presumed to have drowned.|$|E
5|$|Flooding also {{occurred}} in Cuba. Hundreds were evacuated {{their homes in}} four different provinces in Cuba, including 400peasant families in Oriente Province. Near Santiago de Cuba, 25houses were swept away after the Bayamo River overflowed. In the same area, {{a woman and her}} four sons drowned due to the swollen river. Additionally, a body of a man was recovered near Santa Cruz del Sur. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>services</b> were disrupted in many areas. Losses in Cuba were estimated to have reached $100,000. Ella had a role in the Cuban Revolution as the government troops of Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar stayed in their barracks during the storm while the rebels made progress under cover of Ella. Later, when the guerrillas heard about Hurricane Fifi on the radio, Che Guevara taught his illiterate comrades that entities like tropical cyclones are named in alphabetical order.|$|E

5|$|Havana {{sustained}} major {{damage from}} the hurricane, with 50 houses destroyed, and cable operators in Miami, Santiago, and Jamaica were unable to reach <b>telegraph</b> <b>services</b> in the city. The wall of a legation of the United States was blown down. Vedado's sea baths were severely damaged. Havana's streetcar service was temporarily disrupted by the storm. Trees were blown down in the parks of Havana. Twenty {{people were killed in}} the city, while in Batabanó, nine people were killed, with many others missing. In Matanzas, the location of the United States' 28th Infantry, tents were destroyed and there was widespread damage. However, nobody was killed or injured in the city. In San Luis, tobacco crops were ruined, and 150 tobacco barns in the Alquízar municipality were destroyed. The sugar crop in Pinar del Río Province survived well during the hurricane. In the La Guria section of Cuba, the banana crops were completely destroyed. Rivers topped their banks throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|In Miami, {{sustained}} winds reached , shattering plate-glass {{windows and}} interrupting electrical and <b>telegraph</b> <b>services.</b> The Florida East Coast Railway Station in Hallandale Beach was nearly destroyed. Windows and roofs were damaged in Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, but damage was minor overall. At the latter, the storm also downed power lines, telephone wires, and trees, and destroyed car garages. The hurricane caused two fatalities in the city. In Pompano Beach, the recently constructed Pompano Theater was severely damaged. The Kester Building, a drug store, and {{a grocery store}} also suffered impact. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed. A freight train was blown off its tracks. An eight year old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refugee, while 51 additional people were injured throughout Broward County.|$|E

25|$|The island's {{isolation}} {{has been}} remedied during the 20th century, {{first with the}} installation of <b>telegraph</b> <b>services,</b> then the establishment of Radio-Flores (1909), and later with point-to-point telephone communication (1925). Service between the island {{and the rest of}} the archipelago was handled by small sailing ships until the beginning of the century, with ships such as the 36-ton yacht Santa Cruz or 80-ton yacht Flores, until the latter was lost in the bay of Porto Pim, Horta, Faial during a storm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year of the colony, the {{harbourmaster}} was appointed to perform the postal services for the colony. A General Post Office was proclaimed in St Georges Terrace in 1835, and in 1841 a Postmaster General was appointed. The colonial Posts and Telegraph Department took over control of Perth's <b>telegraph</b> <b>services</b> in 1871, and telephone services in 1889. The Perth General Post Office was relocated to St Georges Terrace between 1887 and 1890, however by 1910 this accommodation was inadequate for the services provided. In 1900 there were 175 post offices across Western Australia, together with 160 telephone exchanges. The Commonwealth took over control of postal and telecommunication services at Federation in 1901.|$|E

500|$|Over 800 {{people were}} {{involved}} in reporting {{the news of the}} Games to the world. [...] Nearly 500 press credentials were issued by the Press Commission for the Games. [...] Television would not make its Olympic debut until 1956. [...] The coverage of the 1948 Games was split between newspapers and radio broadcasts. [...] The organizing committee had to provide technology, such as long distance telephone lines and <b>telegraph</b> <b>services,</b> to assist the press in communicating with their constituents.|$|E
500|$|The {{departments}} {{can be seen}} as loosely {{corresponding to}} ministries. Three departments were dedicated to war-related issues: the Department for Elimination of the Consequences of War, the Department for Public Works and Reconstruction, and the Department for Information and the Press; the other departments mirrored pre-war Polish ministries (e.g., Department of Post Offices and Telegraphs, or Department of the Treasury). The Delegate's Office was divided into departments, 14 of which existed {{toward the end of the}} war; the full list included: the Presidential Department, the Department of Internal Affairs, Justice Department, Employment and Social Welfare Department, Agriculture Department, Treasury Department, Trade and Industry Department, Postal and <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Services</b> Department, the Department for Elimination [...] of the Consequences of War, Transport Department, Information and the Press, Department of Public Works and Reconstruction, Department of Education and Culture and the Department of National Defence.|$|E
2500|$|Service Industries: At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, the {{services}} industries were already developed, but largely fragmented. [...] In 1900 the U.S. service industry consisted of banks, professional services, schools, general stores, railroads and <b>telegraph.</b> <b>Services</b> were largely local in nature (except for railroads and telegraph) and owned by entrepreneurs and families. [...] The U.S. in 1900 had 31% employment in services, 31% in manufacturing and 38% in agriculture.|$|E

2500|$|With Chulalongkorn's reforms, {{governance}} {{of the capital}} and the surrounding areas, established as Monthon Krung Thep Phra Mahanakhon (...) , came under the Ministry of Urban Affairs (Nakhonban). During his reign many more canals and roads were built, expanding the urban reaches of the capital. Infrastructure was developed, {{with the introduction of}} railway and <b>telegraph</b> <b>services</b> between Bangkok and Samut Prakan and then expanding countrywide. Electricity was introduced, first to palaces and government offices, then to serve electric trams in the capital and later the general public. The King's fascination with the West was reflected in the royal adoption of Western dress and fashions, but most noticeably in architecture. He commissioned the construction of the neoclassical Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall at the new Dusit Palace, which was linked to the historic city centre by the grand Ratchadamnoen Avenue, inspired by the Champs-Élysées in Paris. Examples of Western influence in architecture became visible throughout the city.|$|E
2500|$|In 1793, Vakhatsinhji {{conquered the}} forts of Chital and Talaja, and later conquered Mahuva, Kundla, Trapaj, Umrala and Botad. Bhavnagar {{remained}} the main port of the state, with Mahuva and Ghogha also becoming important ports. Because of the maritime trade, the state prospered {{compared to other}} states. During the late 19th century, the Bhavnagar State Railway was constructed. This made Bhavnagar the first state that was able to construct its railway system without any aid from the central government, which was mentioned in The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Mr. Peile, a political agent, described the state as follows: [...] "With flourishing finances and much good work in progress. Of financial matters I need say little; you have no debts, and your treasury is full." [...] Between 1870 and 1878, the state was put under joint administration, {{due to the fact}} that Prince Takhtsinhji was a minor. This period produced some notable reforms in the areas of administration, revenue collection, judiciary, the post and <b>telegraph</b> <b>services,</b> and economic policy. The ports were also modernized. The two people who were responsible for those reforms were E. H. Percival of the Bombay Civil Service and Gaurishankar Udayshankar Oza, Chief Minister of Bhavnagar State Bhavnagar Boroz.|$|E
60|$|It {{appears to}} be universally agreed, for the reasons already mentioned, that it is {{unnecessary}} and undesirable for the State to attempt to promote the acquisition of wealth by any direct interference with commerce. But {{there is no such}} agreement as to the further question whether the State may not promote the acquisition of wealth by indirect means. For example, may the State make a road, or build a harbour, when it is quite clear that by so doing it will open up a productive district, and thereby add enormously to the total wealth of the community? And if so, may the State, acting for the general good, take charge of the means of communication between its members, or of the postal and <b>telegraph</b> <b>services?</b> I have not yet met with any valid, argument against the propriety of the State doing what our Government does in this matter; except the assumption, which remains to be proved, that Government will manage these things worse than private enterprise would do. Nor is there any agreement upon the still more important question whether the State ought, or ought not, to regulate the distribution of wealth. If it ought not, then all legislation which regulates inheritance--the statute of Mortmain, and the like--is wrong in principle; and, when a rich man dies, we ought to return to the state of nature, and have a scramble for his property. If, on the other hand, the authority of the State is legitimately employed in regulating these matters, then it is an open question, to be decided entirely by evidence as to what tends to the highest good of the people, whether we keep our present laws, or whether we modify them. At present the State protects men in the possession and enjoyment of their property, and defines what that property is. The justification for its so doing is that its action promotes the good of the people. If it can be clearly proved that the abolition of property would tend still, more to promote the good of the people, the State will have the same justification for abolishing property that it now has for maintaining it.|$|E
