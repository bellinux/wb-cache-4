5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E
50|$|A new FIA {{regulation}} saw {{changes made}} to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> used in <b>the</b> cars. Previously, elastic straps {{had been used}} to keep <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> out of <b>the</b> way during driver changes. An investigation by the FIA found that the elastic straps could cause <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> to slip in a frontal impact, increasing the risk of injury to the driver. As a result, Supercars mandated that the elastic straps be removed. During test days prior to the event, teams found that the removal of the elastic straps increased the time required for a driver change, noting that this could have an impact during pit stops with a short refuelling time.|$|R

Follow up enquiries with French investigators found that they had declared all <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> operational at an examination in October 1998, suggesting the damage to this <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> took place after the accident.|$|R

25|$|Atwater and her husband, Michael Haas, an {{emergency}} room physician at a local hospital, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, represented by Charles Lincoln, alleging that the city violated her Fourth Amendment right {{to be free from}} unreasonable seizures by arresting her for a crime whose only punishment was a fine. This argument required her to concede that the police had probable cause to arrest her for violating <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law, and thus the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas found summary judgment for the city. A panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that arresting a person for a fine-only misdemeanor was per se unreasonable. The Fifth Circuit sitting en banc reversed the panel, agreeing with the district court's reasoning. Three judges dissented from the en banc panel's ruling, arguing that the police had to have a specific reason for arresting Atwater for only violating <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E

The official NASCAR report, which had cost over a million dollars and was published on August 21, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt's death {{was the result of a}} combination of factors, which included the last-second collision with Schrader's car, the speed and angle of impact, and the separation of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> as being contributing factors. It was also noted that investigators could not determine whether a head and neck support (HANS) device would have saved Earnhardt's life, and that airline-style black boxes would be mandated for all vehicles in order to better understand the forces at work in a crash such as Earnhardt's.|$|E

On a typical transatlantic 707 charter, there were individually printed menus. The inflight service began with tartan-clad cabin staff serving each passenger free cocktails from the drinks trolley at each seat row as soon as <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> signs were turned off.

500|$|The {{structures}} in the tracheobronchial tree are well protected, so it normally takes {{a large amount of}} force to injure them. In blunt trauma, TBI is usually the result of violent compression of the chest. Rapid hyperextension of the neck, usually resulting from vehicle crashes, can also injure the trachea, and trauma to the neck can crush the trachea against the vertebrae. A crush injury of the larynx or cervical trachea can occur in head-on collisions when the neck is hyperextended and strikes the steering wheel or dashboard; this has been called a [...] "dashboard injury". The larynx and cervical trachea may also be injured in front-on collisions by <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Novas and all 1974 {{cars were}} {{fitted with a}} weight {{sensitive}} relay within the front seat that prevented the vehicle from being started until the driver's seatbelt had been fastened, following a safety mandate from the NHTSA.

The tasks and properties of the pretensioners and force limiters used in cars will be described in the paper. Implementations of the forces acting at the driver's lap belts and shoulder belts during a frontal collision into a rigid barrier, at the speed of 56 km/h, will be presented. On this basis the properties of the pretensioners and belt force limiters will be determined. The characteristics of rigidity (force- displacement) of the shoulder belts of various designs will be presented, too. On the basis {{of the results of the}} crash tests (NHTSA, USA) for several cars the dynamic loads, which act on the driver during a frontal collision into a rigid barrier, will be analysed.

Another interesting note is that the Century windows switches were not backlit, but lit by a small bulb in the door panel trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the front outboard seat belts from the A pillar into the door, functioning as [...] "automatic" [...] seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and {{the door opened and}} closed while still buckled.
