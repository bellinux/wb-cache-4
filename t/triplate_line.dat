40|$|Two {{methods to}} improve the {{aperture}} efficiency of a type of triplate array are presented. 1. INTRODUCTION <b>Triplate</b> <b>line</b> fed arrays have been researched extensively over the last 10 years for DBS television subscriber antenna in Japan and Europe. The chief advantage {{of this type of}} planar array is the reduction of radiation from the array's feedlines. One class of triplate fed array employs a thin metal sheet with apertures punched for radiation from patches on the triplate layer [1], Figure 1. This type of triplate array is considered as a candidate for LMCS subscriber antenna. The focus of this research is to identify different methods for increasing the aperture efficiency of this type of triplate fed array, in order to counter the losses that are expected to occur at EHF. With careful spacing of the radiating elements, the parallel plate mode can be suppressed, and an aperture efficiency of 73 % can be achieved [2]. Addition of a small parasitic patch above each aperture has been [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} adhesives have, {{in comparison}} with solders, significantly higher non-homogeneity of the structure, and therefore stability of electrical as well as mechanical properties of adhesive joints is lower than soldered ones. The impedance of the joints has been measured in wide frequency range (20 Hz to 1 MHz and 300 MHz to 3 GHz). Measurements {{have been carried out}} by two methods: impedance in the range 20 Hz to 1 MHz has been measured by LCR meter HP 4284 A. A special test board for assembly of 1 jumper (of the type 1206) by electrically conductive adhesive has been fabricated for this measurement. The measurements at the frequencies 300 MHz and higher have been carried out using a shielded high-Q <b>triplate</b> <b>line.</b> Specimens have been prepared on Teflon boards, a scalar analyzer Rohde Scwartz ESPI has been used for evaluation. Very low changes of impedances of the joints have been found in the range of 20 Hz to 1 MHz. Typical courses of real and imaginary components of joints impedances in the frequency range 300 MHz to 3 GHz are as follows: the real components have grown in consequence of a skin-effect and have dominated. The imaginary components have been very low. The task for the future research is to explain decrease of the resistance of the joints with growing frequency for two types of adhesives...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} our vulnerability {{measurements on}} some mobile phones with pulsed {{fields in the}} frequency range between 0. 15 - 3. 2 GHz. The experiments {{have been carried out}} in our field coupling facility, which consists of an asymmetric <b>triplate</b> transmission <b>line</b> and a high power pulsed signal source. At the position of the test objects field strengths up to 4 kV/m can be achieved, the pulse length and pulse repetition can be varied between 0. 25 - 10 micro seconds and 1 - 10000 Hz, respectively. In most cases the receiving capability with regard to the GSM net was reduced permanently. In three cases the hardware was destroyed, that is, the mobile phones were not able to communicate furthermore. The destruction thresholds were 3. 3 kV/m and 1 kV/m, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} our {{low power}} microwave coupling measurements on terminally guided missiles {{in the frequency}} range between 10 [...] . 8000 MHz. The plane wave excitation experiments {{have been carried out}} in our field coupling facility, which consists of a asymmetric <b>triplate</b> transmission <b>line</b> with maximum field levels of about 40 V/m in the working volume. As test objects we examined five (semi) autonomous guides missiles. Three of them, former experimental studies from the Diehl company (GE), are presented in this paper. The test objects were positioned in the simulator in three orthogonal orientation with respect to the external field and were not connected to a power supply (inactive condition). In {{order to be able to}} systematically analyze the interaction of the external electromagnetic fields with the avionics and its wiring, we had to divide the investigations into three independent phases, namely, external interaction with the fuselage, mode of penetration to the interior of the m issile and excitation of the electric systems and the cabling...|$|R
40|$|A {{device on}} a single 2 "-LaAlO 3 wafer for a four bit {{instantaneous}} frequency measurement between 9. 5 GHz and 10. 5 GHz has been developed with coplanar Y 1 B 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d d delay lines and power dividers. Compared to known <b>triplate</b> strip <b>lines,</b> coplanar delay lines are easier to fabricate monolithically and allow for a greater flexibility in the circuit design. Simulated and measured results are in good agreement. I. INTRODUCTION A 5 bit instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) subsystem for a bandwidth of 500 MHz and a center frequency of 4 GHz has already been implemented with Y 1 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d delay lines on LaAlO 3 substrates [1].

40|$|Atlas is a {{facility}} being designed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to perform high energy-density experiments {{in support of}} weapon-physics and basic-research programs. It {{is designed to be}} an international user facility, providing experimental opportunities to researchers from national laboratories and academic institutions. For hydrodynamic experiments, it will be capable of achieving pressures exceeding 20 -Mbar in a several cm{sup 3 } volume. With the development of a suitable opening switch, it will also be capable of producing soft x-rays. The 36 -MJ capacitor bank will consist of 240 -kV Marx modules arranged around a central target chamber. The Marx modules will be discharged through vertical <b>triplate</b> transmission <b>lines</b> to a parallel plate collector inside the target chamber. The capacitor bank is designed to deliver a peak current of 45 to 50 MA with a 4 - to 5 -{micro}s risetime. The Marx modules are designed to be reconfigured to a 480 -kV configuration for opening switch development. Predicted performance with a typical load is presented.

40|$|A three-dimensional, fully {{electromagnetic}} {{model of}} the principal pulsed-power components of the 26 -MA ZR accelerator [D. [*]H. McDaniel et al., in Proceedings of the 5 th International Conference on Dense Z-Pinches (AIP, New York, 2002), p.   23] has been developed. This large-scale simulation model tracks the evolution of electromagnetic waves through the accelerator’s intermediate-storage capacitors, laser-triggered gas switches, pulse-forming <b>lines,</b> water switches, <b>triplate</b> transmission <b>lines,</b> and water convolute to the vacuum insulator stack. The insulator-stack electrodes are coupled to a transmission-line circuit {{model of the}} four-level magnetically insulated vacuum-transmission-line section and double-post-hole convolute. The vacuum-section circuit model is terminated by a one-dimensional self-consistent dynamic model of an imploding z-pinch load. The simulation results are compared with electrical measurements made throughout the ZR accelerator, and are in good agreement with the data, especially for times until peak load power. This modeling effort demonstrates that 3 D electromagnetic models of large-scale, multiple-module, pulsed-power accelerators are now computationally tractable. This, in turn, presents new opportunities for simulating the operation of existing pulsed-power systems used {{in a variety of}} high-energy-density-physics and radiographic applications, as well as even higher-power next-generation accelerators before they are constructed...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} an accelerator architecture that can {{serve as the basis}} of the design of petawatt-class z-pinch drivers. The architecture has been applied to the design of two z-pinch accelerators, each of which can be contained within a 104 -m-diameter cylindrical tank. One accelerator is driven by slow (∼ 1 [*]  μs) Marx generators, which are a mature technology but which necessitate significant pulse compression to achieve the short pulses (≪ 1 [*]  μs) required to drive z pinches. The other is powered by linear transformer drivers (LTDs), which are less mature but produce much shorter pulses than conventional Marxes. Consequently, an LTD-driven accelerator promises to be (at a given pinch current and implosion time) more efficient and reliable. The Marx-driven accelerator produces a peak electrical power of 500  TW and includes the following components: (i) 300 Marx generators that comprise a total of 1. 8 × 10 ^{ 4 } capacitors, store 98  MJ, and erect to 5  MV; (ii) 600 water-dielectric <b>triplate</b> intermediate-store transmission <b>lines,</b> which also serve as pulse-forming lines; (iii) 600 5 -MV laser-triggered gas switches; (iv) three monolithic radial-transmission-line impedance transformers, with triplate geometries and exponential impedance profiles; (v) a 6 -level 5. 5 -m-diameter 15 -MV vacuum insulator stack; (vi) six magnetically insulated vacuum transmission lines (MITLs); and (vii) a triple-post-hole vacuum convolute that adds the output currents of the six MITLs, and delivers the combined current to a z-pinch load. The accelerator delivers an effective peak current of 52  MA to a 10 -mm-length z pinch that implodes in 95  ns, and 57  MA to a pinch that implodes in 120  ns. The LTD-driven accelerator includes monolithic radial transformers and a MITL system similar to those described above, but does not include intermediate-store transmission lines, multimegavolt gas switches, or a laser trigger system. Instead, this accelerator is driven by 210 LTD modules that include a total of 1 × 10 ^{ 6 } capacitors and 5 × 10 ^{ 5 } 200 -kV electrically triggered gas switches. The LTD accelerator stores 182  MJ and produces a peak electrical power of 1000  TW. The accelerator delivers an effective peak current of 68  MA to a pinch that implodes in 95  ns, and 75  MA to a pinch that implodes in 120  ns. Conceptually straightforward upgrades to these designs would deliver even higher pinch currents and faster implosions...|$|R
