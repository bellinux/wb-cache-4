40|$|The {{practice}} of transportation engineering and planning has employed <b>trip</b> <b>and</b> parking generation rates {{to determine the}} number of <b>trips</b> generated <b>and</b> attracted by developments, as well as the required number of parking spaces for facilities. Trip generation serves as an input to modeling transportation requirements and traffic flows influenced by the development. For example, a residential condominium may directly impact traffic within a 10 km radius. Meanwhile, a shopping mall can impact an area of over 50 km in radius. Thus, it is expected that most trips generated or attracted by the development would be captured within these influence areas. These <b>trips</b> generated <b>and</b> attracted are represented by standard rates for <b>trip</b> <b>and</b> parking generation. This paper reviews the <b>trip</b> <b>and</b> parking generation rates used in transportation practice and research in the Philippines. The review includes the ascertaining of various rates used in traffic analysis. An assessment of issues and concerns pertaining to local <b>trip</b> <b>and</b> parking rates are discussed, and recommendations for future research directions are made based on information derived for this review...|$|R

In the spring of 1934, they replaced the SS-Begleitkommando for Hitler's overall protection throughout Germany. The FSK was renamed the Reichssicherheitsdienst ("Reich Security Service"; RSD) in August 1935. Thereafter, the RSD and FBK worked together for security and protection during <b>trips</b> <b>and</b> public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles.

5|$|In human civilization, {{wind has}} {{inspired}} mythology, influenced {{the events of}} history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short <b>trips,</b> <b>and</b> powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed.|$|E

Both the interior and exterior of multiple sets were the result of researched reference material.
