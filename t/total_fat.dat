Averaged over all backcross calves in the trial (total of 766), animals homozygous for the mutation had approximately 6% heavier carcases than animals without the mutation, 15% larger eye muscle (also known as rib eye) area, 13% heavier silverside weight, and 13% heavier total meat weight. Increased meat weight and size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in <b>total</b> <b>fat</b> weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second backcross study conducted in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat and fat quantities in cattle homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, <b>total</b> <b>fat</b> and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{relationships}} between <b>total</b> dissected <b>fat</b> {{and weight of}} intramuscular fat in nine ‘standard muscle groups’ and total side muscle were investigated in 18 steer carcasses varying in fatness from 9. 1 to 38. 9 % of chilled side weight. A simple correlation matrix showed that both weight and percentage of <b>total</b> dissected <b>fat</b> were more highly correlated with the proportion by weight of intramuscular <b>fat</b> in <b>total</b> side muscle than {{in any of the}} ‘standard muscle groups’. Predictions of <b>total</b> dissected <b>fat</b> weight from regressions of the intramuscular fat percentages of ‘standard muscle groups’ and total side muscle were not as accurate as a relatively simple equation employing fat thickness at the 10 th rib together with chilled carcass weight. For all six muscle groups used in regression equations, the percentage of <b>total</b> dissected <b>fat</b> in the carcass was more accurately predicted than <b>total</b> dissected <b>fat</b> weight. Standard muscle group 7 was the most accurate of the muscle groups in predicting <b>total</b> dissected <b>fat</b> weight, and it contained the fewest muscles (five), but they were large, expansive muscles which required extensive trimming.

Previous studies have not adequately investigated differences in discrete regions of abdominal adiposity across ethnic groups. Objective: We compared the relation between abdominal adipose tissue and <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> between persons living in Canada of Ab-original, Chinese, and South Asian origin with persons of European origin. Design: Healthy Aboriginal, Chinese, European, and South Asian participants (n 822) aged between 30 and 65 y were matched by sex, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2) range. Total abdominal adipose tissue (TAT), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> mass, lifestyle, and demographics were assessed. Relations between BMI and <b>total</b> body <b>fat,</b> TAT, SAT, and VAT and between <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> and TAT, SAT, and VAT were investigated. Results: BMI significantly underestimated VAT in all non-European groups. Throughout a range of <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> mass, VAT was not significantly different between the Aboriginals and the Eu-ropeans.

40|$|Background: An {{important}} aspect of occupational health surveillance of firefighters is cardiorespiratory fitness. In Belgium, representative data on firefighters' cardiorespiratory fitness assessed in a standardized way are lacking. Aims: To report data on cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index (BMI) and <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> percentage in a large cohort of Belgian firefighters; to relate the data on cardiorespiratory fitness to the new Belgian criteria and to explore the relationship of cardiorespiratory fitness with age, BMI and <b>total</b> body <b>fat.</b> Methods: VO 2 -max was assessed in male firefighters by maximal exercise test on a treadmill. <b>Total</b> body <b>fat</b> percentage was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Stratified analyses of mean VO 2 -max and proportions of subjects that {{did not meet the}} criteria were performed for different age, <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> percentage and BMI categories. Relationships between VO 2 -max and the continuous variables were explored in univariate (correlation coefficients) and multivariate analyses (multiple linear regression analysis). Results: In 1225 participating firefighters (96 % participation rate), mean VO 2 -max was 46. 5 ml/kg/min. Percentages of subjects that did not meet the criteria ranged from 1 to 83 % depending on age, BMI and <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> percentage. Both in univariate and multivariate analyses, strongly significant relationships were found between VO 2 -max and age, BMI and <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> percentage, the latter being the strongest predictor.

40|$|Objective: To develop {{prediction}} equations for <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> {{specific to}} Latino children, using demographic and an-thropometric measures. Research Methods and Procedures: Ninety-six Latino chil-dren (7 to 13 years old) were studied. Two-thirds {{of the sample}} was randomized into the equation development group; the remainder served as the cross-validation group. <b>Total</b> body <b>fat</b> was measured by DXA. Measures included weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, and skinfolds (suprailiac, triceps, abdomen, subscapula, thigh, and calf). Results: The previously published equation from Dezen-berg et al. did not accurately predict <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> in Latino children. However, newly developed equations with either body weight alone (intercept SE 1. 78 1. 53 kg, p 0. 05; slope SE 0. 90 0. 07, p 0. 05 against slope 1. 0; R 2 0. 86), weight plus age and gender (intercept SE 2. 28 1. 20 kg, p 0. 05; slope SE 0. 91 0. 05, p 0. 05; against slope 1. 0; R 2 0. 92), or weight plus height, gender, Tanner stage, and abdominal skinfold (in-tercept SE 1. 47 1. 01 kg, p 0. 05; slope SE 0. 93 0. 04, p 0. 05; against slope 1. 0, R 2 0. 97) predicted <b>total</b> body <b>fat</b> without bias.
