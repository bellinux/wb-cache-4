Preceding these rulings, the Bell System Companies held a monopoly and did not allow an interconnection with <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>equipment.</b> The incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) and other local access providers are now mandated by federal law to provide a point where the operational control or ownership changes. This separation between the local access provider and the end user/subscriber is called the demarcation point within a facility (typically a short distance from the minimum point of entry). This then becomes the responsibility of the end user to extend their service to the CPE location within a facility to provide connectivity for service, requiring a service interface extension, or otherwise called a demarc extension.|$|E

MAINBOT aims at using already available robotic solutions to deploy innovative systems {{in order to}} fulfill project industrial objectives: to provide a means to help measuring several physical parameters in multiple points by autonomous robots, able to navigate and climb structures, handling sensors or special non destructive testing equipment. MAINBOT will validate the proposed solutions in two solar plants (cylindrical-parabolic collectors and central tower), that are very demanding from mobile manipulation point of view mainly due to the extension (e. g. a thermal solar plant of 50 Mw, seven hours of storage, with 400 hectares, 400. 000 mirrors, 180 km of absorber tubes, 140 m tower height), the variability of conditions (outdoor, day-night), safet y requirements, etc. The objective is to increase the efficiency of the installation by improving the inspection procedures and technologies. Robot capabilities are developed at different levels: (1) Simulation: realistic testing environments are created in order to validate the algorithms developed for the project using available robot, sensors and application environments. (2) Autonomous navigation: Hybrid (topological-metric) localization and planning algorithms are integrated in order to manage the huge extensions.

Shared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> signal insider status and have a predictable positive effect on knowledge transfer.

Surprisingly, unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> have been ignored in empirical analysis, and so we do not know if or how much unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> contribute to the process.

Our results provide a more complete view of how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> contribute to knowledge sharing. The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly.

Drawing {{on data from}} the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, supplemented with unique data on mediation efforts, which together cover all mediation efforts in civil wars in Africa between 1960 and 2012, this article presents quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of African <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Compared to non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{are far more likely}} to conclude peace agreements and these peace agreements are more likely to be durable. Most effective, however, are mixed mediation efforts in which there is coordination between African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> but in which African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> take the lead. The phrase, ‘African solutions to African challenges’ should thus be understood as a division of labour and responsibilities, rather than an excuse for non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to ignore Africa’s problems or African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> acting on their own. Indeed, whilst African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should take the lead in mediation processes in African civil wars, non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should support these processes by lending additional strength.

40|$|How is two-party electoral {{competition}} {{influenced by}} <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> even under normal political conditions? I {{argue that the}} mere threat of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry into the election induces anticipatory electoral strategies by the major parties. This effect, which is a normal aspect of the two-party system, is how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. elections. The ability for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to influence the major parties is moderated by electoral institutions. The ballot access requirement, {{in the form of}} a signature requirement, varies widely across House elections and is a significant predictor of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> electoral success. Consistent with conventional wisdom, I find that it has a negative effect on the likelihood of entry. Notably, the requirement also has a positive effect on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> vote shares, conditional on successful petitioning, due to a screening and quality effect. I explore the effects of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat in unidimensional and multidimensional settings. A formal model of elections predicts that the threat of entry induces major party divergence in a unidimensional ideological space. The major parties diverge in anticipation of potential <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry. An empirical analysis of candidate positioning in the 1996 U. S. House elections finds support of this hypothesis. Data on major party campaign advertising in the 2000 to 2004 U. S. House elections are used to assess <b>third</b> <b>party</b> effects in a multidimensional framework. I show that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat influences the scope and content of campaign advertising. Major party candidates, particularly incumbents, discuss a broader range of issues when <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat is higher. I use the case of environmental issues and the Green party to assess the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on issue-specific content. I find that Green party threat leads to predictable differences between Democratic and Republican advertising on environmental issues. In sum, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. House elections by inducing anticipatory strategies by the major parties. This strategic framework for understanding <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> stresses two things. First, one should focus on the major parties in order to gauge the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Second, one should not conclude that <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> are irrelevant because of their minimal electoral success. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> effects are in fact present even in elections where a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> does not enter.

Equally, the <b>third</b> <b>party,</b> on discovering the undisclosed principal, may sue the principal on the contract. it follows that the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> has a choice or an election to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, when discovered; but having elected to sue one of them the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> is debarred from suing the other, even if he or she sues the agent before being aware that there is a principal.
