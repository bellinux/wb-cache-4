The transactions of this Council were recorded and have been printed and published by the Public Record Office.

Other sources providing details from Pacificus' life include the fourteenth-century work Historiae Imperialis (Imperial History) by Giovanni de Matociis (commonly known as Giovanni Mansionario), and the 16th-century work Antiquitates Veronenses by the Augustinian monk Onuphrius Panvinius.|$|E

25|$|There {{exists a}} folio of {{drawings}} by Villard de Honnecourt from Picard in France, who between {{the years of}} about 1220 and 1230 travelled, for reasons unknown, in France {{and other parts of}} Europe as far as Hungary, producing drawings of motifs architectural, scientific and figural. The drawings, for the most part, are not original designs. They are drawn from buildings and artworks that he saw on his travels. In order that they might be utilised as designs for students, they were carefully annotated by a skilled calligrapher and placed into a leather portfolio. <b>They</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a clear indication {{of the way in which}} decorative motifs and figurative subjects could be transferred from one region to another and from one artform to another.|$|E

2500|$|Eudoxus {{rose to the}} {{challenge}} by assigning to each planet a set of concentric spheres. By tilting the axes of the spheres, and by assigning each a different period of revolution, {{he was able to}} approximate the celestial [...] "appearances." [...] Thus, {{he was the first to}} attempt a mathematical description of the motions of the planets. A general idea of the content of On Speeds, his book on the planets, can be gleaned from Aristotle's Metaphysics XII, 8, and a commentary by Simplicius on De caelo, another work by Aristotle. Since all his own works are lost, our knowledge of Eudoxus is obtained from secondary sources. Aratus's poem on astronomy is based on a work of Eudoxus, and possibly also Theodosius of Bithynia's Sphaerics. <b>They</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> an indication of his work in spherical astronomy as well as planetary motions.|$|E

2500|$|By the mid 13th century, {{gunpowder}} weapons {{had become}} {{central to the}} Song war effort. In 1257 the Song official Li Zengbo was dispatched to inspect frontier city arsenals. Li considered an ideal city arsenal to include several hundred thousand iron bombshells, and also its own production facility to produce {{at least a couple}} thousand a month. The results of his tour of the border were severely disappointing and in one arsenal he found [...] "no more than 85 iron bomb-shells, large and small, 95 fire-arrows, and 105 fire-lances. This is not sufficient for a mere hundred men, let alone a thousand, to use against an attack by the ... barbarians. The government supposedly wants to make preparations for the defense of its fortified cities, and to furnish them with military supplies against the enemy (yet this is all <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>us).</b> What chilling indifference!"

2500|$|Egypt {{qualifying}} for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, {{six months to}} the day after being devastated by Port Said Stadium disaster. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team's captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. [...] "Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying," [...] he recalled. [...] "They are always with us and <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Late in 2010, Nina {{revealed}} {{that she was}} recording a studio album set for release in mid-January 2011. It was originally set {{to be the first}} of her two-album recording deal with her new label, Universal Records. After a couple of push-backs, Stay Alive was finally released on November 19, 2011. In choosing such title for the album, she explained, [...] "It's like some people are saying that I'm gone [...] So I’m here to say that I’m still here and staying alive." [...] She called the album [...] "special" [...] {{due to the fact that}} she contributed from its musical production to the cover art design." [...] Stay Alive was a universal acclaim, being called [...] "futuristic and edgy" [...] by critics who also predicted that it [...] "may set new trends in Filipino music," [...] tagging Nina as the new [...] "dance diva." [...] Philippine Entertainment Portal praised the album, stating [...] "Stay Alive is a testament to Nina's evolution as an artist and determination to be a better performer." [...] "Dance" [...] was released on October 6, 2011 as the lead single from the album. Nina explained, [...] "The carrier single is a dance song for it to be different from my previous albums." [...] The song is described as [...] "an upbeat track with a catchy melody." [...] Its music video was released on December 9, and features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes while performing a dance routine. Due to lack of promotion, the song failed to achieve commercial success. On January 30, 2012, [...] "However Much Love" [...] was released as a radio-only pre-Valentine single. The song was critically acclaimed, being called a [...] "standout" [...] by Abby Mendoza of Philippine Entertainment Portal. It also performed well commercially, becoming Nina's first chart-topper since 2008. On February 13, she staged a pre-Valentine concert entitled Update Your Status... at the Music Museum, which supported the album. In the same month, she expressed disappointment with the album's lack of promotion, saying [...] " [...] always have a meeting, but no actions are initiated. <b>They</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> schedules that are not really followed. When it's already okay, then they cancel it." [...] On April 14, she staged another concert at the Music Museum, entitled Timeless: Tribute to a Diva, which was dedicated to late pop diva Whitney Houston. [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from Stay Alive, accompanied by a lyric video.|$|E
