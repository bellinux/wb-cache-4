Upon revealing Columbine's identity as Ledonne, Kovacs said [...] "One of the girls who died [...] {{was a friend of}} mine, Rachel. We were in the same church group. Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." [...] The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game [...] "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." [...] One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that [...] "It probably sounds a bit odd for someone like me to say, but I appreciate the fact at least to some degree <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> was made." [...] While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.|$|E

[...] He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in America it has become very politicized.

The city reeked with smoke and acrid, stale gas, the electric lights were turned on to dispel the November gloom. It was not a cheerful conference, nor a confident one. For {{the first time in}} a collective experience the men gathered there were confronted with a situation which they doubted their ability to control, a situation for which there was no precedent. They had to reckon with a new and unsolvable equation in politics and finance,--the independent voter. There was an element of desperation in the discussion. Recriminations passed. Dickinson implied that Gorse with all his knowledge of political affairs ought to have foreseen <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> was sure to happen, should have managed better the conventions of both great parties. The railroad counsel retorted that it had been as much Dickinson's fault as his. Grierson expressed a regret that I had broken out against the reformers; it had reacted, he said,--and this was just enough to sting me to retaliate that things had been done in the campaign, chiefly through his initiative, that were not only unwise, but might land some of us in the penitentiary if Krebs were elected.|$|E
60|$|We slowly {{returned}} to the inn by the road we had ascended, noting again the mansion of the surprising Englishman {{who had come to}} Capri for three months and had remained thirty years; passed through the darkness of the village,--dropped here and there with the vivid red of a lamp,--and so reached the inn at last, where we found the landlord ready to have the Tarantella danced for us. We framed a discreeter fiction than that prepared for us by the patriarch, and went in to dinner, where there were two Danish gentlemen in dispute with as many rogues of boatmen, who, having contracted to take them back that night to Naples, were now trying to fly their bargain and remain at Capri till the morrow. The Danes beat them, however, and then sat down to dinner, and to long stories of the imposture and villany of the Italians. One of them chiefly bewailed himself that the day before, having unwisely eaten a dozen oysters without agreeing first with the oyster-man upon the price, he had been obliged to pay this scamp's extortionate demand to the full, since he was unable to restore him his property. We thought <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> might have happened to an imprudent man in any country, but we did not the less join him in abusing the Italians--the purpose for which foreigners chiefly visit Italy.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{go out of}} {{the house}} for a walk, {{uncertain}} as yet whither I will bend my steps, and submit myself to my instinct to decide for me, I find, strange and whimsical as it may seem, that I finally and inevitably settle southwest, toward some particular wood or meadow or deserted pasture or hill in that direction. My needle is slow to settle,--varies a few degrees, and does not always point due southwest, it is true, and it has good authority for this 'variation, but it always settles between west and south-southwest. The future lies that way to me, and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side. The outline which would bound my walks would be, not a circle, but a parabola, or rather like one of those cometary orbits which have been thought to be non-returning curves, in this case opening westward, in which my house occupies the place of the sun. I turn round and round irresolute sometimes for a quarter of an hour, until I decide, for a thousandth time, that I will walk into the southwest or west. Eastward I go only by force; but westward I go free. Thither no business leads me. It is {{hard for me to believe}} that I shall find fair landscapes or sufficient wildness and freedom behind the eastern horizon. I am not excited by the prospect of a walk thither; but I believe that the forest which I see in the western horizon stretches uninterruptedly toward the setting sun, and there are no towns nor cities in it of enough consequence to disturb me. Let me live where I will, on this side is the city, on that the wilderness, and ever I am leaving the city more and more, and withdrawing into the wilderness. I should not lay so much stress on this fact, if I did not believe <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> is the prevailing tendency of my countrymen. I must walk toward Oregon, and not toward Europe. And that way the nation is moving, and I may say that mankind progress from east to west. Within a few years we have witnessed the phenomenon of a southeastward migration, in the settlement of Australia; but this affects us as a retrograde movement, and, judging from the moral and physical character of the first generation of Australians, has not yet proved a successful experiment. The eastern Tartars think that there is nothing west beyond Thibet. [...] "The world ends there," [...] say they, [...] "beyond there is nothing but a shoreless sea."

40|$|Having {{attended}} the first German-American folklore conference in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1988, where public folklore {{was nowhere to}} be seen, I am particularly struck by the divide that this topic has opened up at the Bad Homburg Symposium ten years later. <b>That</b> divide looks <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> While Volkskunde has a long institutional history and bad conscience about how the discipline was instrumentalized in the past, American folklore has a short institutional history and optimism in the potential for a critical public folklore practice to serve progressive ends. Public folklore in the United States is flourishing, for the time being. It has never existed in this form in German-speaking countries, nor is it likely to emerge in the foreseeable future. To read the Bad Homburg symposium proceedings is to see a faultline between the Volkskundler and folklorists gradually emerge and coalesce. 1 The struggle to find a common language and common ground reveals just how incommensurable the two situations are. They cannot be mapped onto one another. The terms do not translate. Different historical experiences have produced different dispositions to the issues at hand. It is the aim of this afterword to reflect on the divide...|$|R

30|$|Short of {{individualized}} in-person counseling (discussed next), which opponents {{might argue}} {{is too expensive}} (Stark & Choplin, 2010), similar benefits might be possible with well-designed interactive online disclosures and these benefits could go well beyond addressing the shortcomings of APR discussed {{in the previous section}} (Stark, Choplin, LeBoeuf, & Pizor, 2014). Such disclosures could present information serially so that consumers will be required to look at critical information serially rather than all at once, as is currently the case when consumers receive paper-based disclosure forms. Such disclosures could also generate personalized norm information, such as information about interest rate offers received by local consumers with the consumer’s same credit score. As noted above, the CFPB already has an online tool <b>that</b> does <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> asking the consumer for information such as their location and credit score and providing a histogram of the interest rates that other consumers with their credit score and in their location have recently received (“Explore interest rates”; [URL] As noted earlier, we believe in addition to this type of information, the CFPB should include a similar tool for APRs. The online tool returns norm information: the median interest rate (Helson, 1964) and a frequency chart of common interest rates for consumers in the same situation, thereby providing range and frequency information (Parducci, 1965, 1995), similar tools could generate norms for other loan features. The importance of this type of information is striking as it makes otherwise incomprehensible numbers evaluable (Hsee, 1996). This strategy is also more likely than other interventions to encourage consumers to comparison shop as it resembles social norm interventions that have already been found effective in improving health behaviors (e.g., reducing binge drinking; Perkins, 2003) and conservation (e.g., reducing energy, Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, & Griskevicius, 2007, and hotel towel use, Schultz, Khazian, & Zaleski, 2008) by educating consumers about others’ behaviors (i.e., alcohol consumption, energy use, towel reuse rates). Consumers see these norms and change their behaviors to conform to them. Home-loan consumers may similarly be motivated to reject loan offers that contain “predatory features” (such as being overpriced, unaffordable, or containing risky terms that make default more likely) when they see norms that differ from the problematic loan being offered (Stark, Choplin, LeBoeuf, & Pizor, 2014).|$|R
