Circular patterns on his kneecaps, right forearm, and headdress have been interpreted by R. Gordon Wasson as stylized fruit bodies of Psilocybe aztecorum. Wasson says that the convex shape and incurved margins depicted in these images show the mushroom caps just before maturity.

The variety P.aztecorum var. bonetii has smaller spores than the main variety, and is found at lower elevations with Montezuma pine (Pinus montezumae) and sacred fir (Abies religiosa).

In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, the mushrooms were called <b>teonanácatl,</b> or [...] "God's flesh". Following the arrival of Spanish explorers to the New World in the 16th century, chroniclers reported the use of mushrooms by the natives for ceremonial and religious purposes. According to the Dominican friar Diego Durán in The History of the Indies of New Spain (published c.1581), mushrooms were eaten in festivities conducted {{on the occasion of the}} accession to the throne of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II in 1502. The Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún wrote of witnessing mushroom usage in his Florentine Codex (published 1545–1590), and described how some merchants would celebrate upon returning from a successful business trip by consuming mushrooms to evoke revelatory visions. After the defeat of the Aztecs, the Spanish forbade traditional religious practices and rituals that they considered [...] "pagan idolatry", including ceremonial mushroom use.

50|$|After the Spanish conquest, Catholic missionaries campaigned {{against the}} {{cultural}} {{tradition of the}} Aztecs, dismissing the Aztecs as idolaters, {{and the use of}} hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, like other pre-Christian traditions, were quickly suppressed. The Spanish believed the mushroom allowed the Aztecs and others to communicate with devils. In converting people to Catholicism, the Spanish pushed for a switch from <b>teonanácatl</b> to the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist.

5000|$|Psilocybe mexicana is a {{psychedelic}} mushroom. Its {{first known}} usage {{was by the}} natives of Central America and North America over 2,000 years ago.

5000|$|Hallucinogenic {{species of}} the Psilocybe genus {{have a history of}} use among the native peoples of Mesoamerica for {{religious}} communion, divination, and healing, from pre-Columbian times to the present day. Mushroom stones and motifs have been found in Guatemala. A statuette dating from ca. 200 AD and depicting a mushroom strongly resembling Psilocybe mexicana was found in a west Mexican shaft and chamber tomb in the state of Colima. A Psilocybe species was known to the Aztecs as <b>teonanácatl</b> (literally [...] "divine mushroom" [...] - agglutinative form of teó (god, sacred) and nanácatl (mushroom) in Náhuatl) and were reportedly served at the coronation of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II in 1502. Aztecs and Mazatecs referred to psilocybin mushrooms as genius mushrooms, divinatory mushrooms, and wondrous mushrooms, when translated into English. Bernardino de Sahagún reported ritualistic use of <b>teonanácatl</b> by the Aztecs, when he traveled to Central America after the expedition of Hernán Cortés.|$|E

5000|$|The Aztec entheogenic {{complex is}} {{extremely}} well documented. Through historical evidence, there {{is proof that}} the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs.

The Xochipilli statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants.

This book recorded a number of second-hand observations on New World psychoactive drugs, paraphrased from notes he took of conversations with his cousin, the eminent Mexican ethnobotanist Dr. Blas Pablo Reko, including the first published refutation of Dr. William Edwin Safford's uncharacteristically untenable assertion that <b>teonanácatl</b> was not a mushroom, but a cactus.|$|E

Continuing at Harvard {{as a graduate student}} under Ames, he completed his Master of Arts in Biology in 1938 and his Ph.D. in Botany in 1941. Schultes's doctoral thesis investigated the lost identity of the Mexican hallucinogenic plants <b>teonanácatl</b> (various mushrooms belonging to the Psilocybe genus) and ololiuqui (a morning glory species) in Oaxaca, Mexico.

5000|$|Psilocybe mexicana, {{known to}} the Aztecs as <b>teonanacatl</b> (agglutination of [...] "teo" [...] - god and [...] "nanacatl" [...] - mushroom, {{literally}} divine mushroom), is a psychedelic mushroom {{that has been used}} in Mesoamerican cultures for over 2000 years. The fungus contains two separate entheogenic compounds, psilocybin and psilocin that cause the user to experience visual hallucinations. Often cited archaeological evidence for Maya use of Psilocybe mexicana is the existence of [...] "mushroom stones," [...] carved stone objects from highland Guatemala that have been interpreted as representations of mushrooms, some of which have anthropomorphic figures on the base or stem.

5000|$|By the 20th century, hallucinogenic {{mushroom}} use was thought by non-Native Americans to have disappeared entirely. However, in 1955, Valentina and R.

The Wassons did much to publicize their discovery, even publishing an article on their experiences in Life in 1957. In 1956, Roger Heim identified the {{hallucinogenic mushroom}} that the Wassons had brought back from Mexico as Psilocybe and in 1958, Albert Hofmann first reported psilocin and psilocybin as the active compound in these mushrooms. There is some skepticism in {{whether or not these}} [...] "sacred mushrooms" [...] were actually those of the Psilocybe genus.

During Heim's field and culture work, he was under the guidance of a descendent of the Mazotecan ancestors (the natives which partook in experimenting with these hallucinogens), the head of the family, Isauro Nava Garcia. [...] He was an avid observer of the fungi in his environment while identifying specific characteristics about the fruit body of the Psilocybe genus his ancestors utilized, as well as knowing where they could be found.|$|E
