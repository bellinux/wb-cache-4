40|$|The {{expression}} of two Xenopus laevis ribosomal protein genes (L 1 and L 14) has been analysed by microinjection of the cloned genomic sequences into frog oocyte nuclei. While the injection of the L 14 gene causes {{the accumulation of}} the corresponding protein in large excess with respect to that synthesized endogenously, the L 1 gene does not. Analysis of the RNA shows that both genes are actively transcribed. The seven-intron-containing L 14 transcript is completely processed to a mature form, while two out of nine intron sequences persist in the L 1 transcript. This precursor RNA is confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nucleus; its accumulation {{is due to a}} specific block of splicing operating at the level of two defined introns and not <b>to</b> saturation of <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>apparatus</b> of <b>the</b> oocyte. The different behaviour of the two genes may reflect different mechanisms of regulation which, {{in the case of the}} L 1 gene, could operate at the level of splicing...|$|R

40|$|In order <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> nonsmooth surface drag {{reduction}} {{structure on}} the inner polymer coating {{of oil and gas}} pipelines and improve the efficiency of pipeline transport, a structural model of the machining robot on the pipe inner coating is established. Based on machining robot, an experimental technique is applied to research embossing and coating problems of rolling-head, and then the molding process rules under different conditions of rolling temperatures speeds and depth are analyzed. Also, an orthogonal experiment analysis method is employed <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> different effects of hot-rolling process apparatus on the embossed pits morphology and quality of rolling. The results also reveal that elevating the rolling temperature or decreasing the rolling speed can also improve the pit structure replication rates of the polymer coating surface, and the rolling feed has little effect on replication rates. After the rolling-head separates from the polymer coating, phenomenon of rebounding and refluxing of the polymer coating occurs, which is the reason of inability of the process.

The computational complexity of such methods grows rapidly {{with the level of}} connectivity, and are restricted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> of positional graphs. The concept proposed in this paper addresses these issues by reducing the computational demand, and by allowing <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> of non-positional graphs. This is achieved by utilising the state space of the self organising map instead of the states of the nodes in <b>the</b> graph for <b>processing.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Bacillus subtilis {{is one of}} {{the best}} known Gram-positive {{bacteria}} at both the genetic and physiological level. The entire sequence of its chromosome is known and efficient tools for the genetic modification of this bacterium are available. Moreover, B. subtilis and related Bacillus species are widely used in biotechnology, in particular for the production of secreted enzymes. Although bacilli can secrete large amounts of several native enzymes, the use of these bacteria for the production of heterologous enzymes has frequently resulted in low yields. Here we describe the identification of several components of the Bacillus protein secretion machinery. These components can now be engineered for optimal protein secretion. Special emphasis is given on type I signal peptidases, which remove signal peptides from secretory precursor proteins. Five genes specifying such enzymes (sip, for signal peptidase) are present on the B. subtilis chromosome. Although none of the sip genes is essential by itself, a specific combination of mutations in these genes is lethal. The expression pattern of some of the sip genes coincides with that of many secretory proteins, which seems to reflect an adaptation to high demands on the secretion machinery. Although the various B. subtilis type I signal peptidases have at least partially overlapping substrate specificities, clear differences in substrate preferences are also evident. These observations have implications for the engineering of <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>apparatus</b> for improved secretion of native and heterologous proteins by Bacillus.
