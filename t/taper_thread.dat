40|$|Due to high {{efficiency}} in helping breaking rocks, positive displacement motor has a widespread application {{in the field}} of oil and gas drilling engineering. However, service life of positive displacement motor becomes shorter resulting from failure of the driving shaft thread. The three-dimensional simulation model of driving shaft’s connecting thread has been developed based on the principle of virtual work, Von Mises yield criterion, and contact nonlinear theory. This article has put forward the plan to optimize structure of driving shaft with straight thread based on the design principle of double-shouldered thread; besides, fatigue life of driving shaft with straight thread before and after optimization has been assessed by resorting to the multiaxial fatigue principle and Brown–Miller critical plane rule. In line with research results, mechanical properties of driving shaft with straight thread are superior to those of driving shaft with <b>taper</b> <b>thread.</b> Under the load of axial drill pressure with fluctuation and alternating torque, fatigue life of driving shaft with straight thread after optimization is greatly improved.

40|$|Background/purposeStable osseointegration between implant threads and the {{surrounding}} marginal bone provides the mechanical base of an implant for daily chewing activity. The contact area of implant-bone interfaces and the concentrated stresses on the marginal bones are principal concerns of implant designers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of thread shape and taper on the initial stability of the implant-bone structure. Materials and methodsThe thread design was parameterized by shape and <b>taper.</b> <b>Thread</b> shapes included symmetrical, square, and buttressed. Thread tapers were divided into cylindrical and conical profiles. Nine variations of the thread design were developed to numerically evaluate their geometric and mechanical effects on the marginal bone. ResultsAmong the three thread shapes with the same pitch, the contact area of the square thread was the highest. Among all implant models, it was found that the site with the greatest stress in {{the surrounding}} jaw bone was consistently concentrated at the root radii of the first thread. The maximal stress of the square thread was the least. For the same thread shape and taper, a finer pitch resulted in a remarkable increase in the contact area and a decrease in the peak stress. The contact areas and peak stresses of the conical and cylindrical implants were nearly equal. ConclusionTaking wall thickness and stress concentrations into consideration, the square thread with a 0. 60 -mm pitch possessed the optimal contact area and stress values compared to the others...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a {{tendency}} to increase the proportion of thread milling operations, among other ways of tapping, which is associated with increasing number of CNC machines, flexibility and versatility of the process. Developments presently existing in the RF and used in the thread mills deal, mainly, with the thread milling cutter designs, to process internal and external thread with straight flutes made from high-speed steel. The paper presents a technique to calculate and select the initial design parameters, i. e. the external diameter of the tapping part of thread milling cutter, which is chosen as a basic computational design.   The analysis of directories of tool companies containing foreign de-signs of solid thread end-milling cutters has shown that most of them rep-resent the thread cutter designs made of solid carbide. There are solid and interlocking side milling cutters, which use a tapping part both as a single-disk and as a multi-disk one; chip flutes are made to be both as direct and as screw; solid designs of cutters are made from carbide with a diameter of up to 20 [...] . 25 mm; thread cutters can be left- and right-hand cutting; Designs of the combined thread mills are proposed; internal channels are used for coolant supply. It is shown that the purpose of the external diameter of the tapping part of the thread mill should take into account the effect of the thread mill diameter on the milling process performance, precision of thread profile received, <b>taper</b> <b>thread,</b> tool strength, and the volume of flutes. The analysis has shown that when choosing the external diameter of the thread mill it worth taking its maximum diameter to improve the char-acteristics of the process under the restrictions imposed on the accuracy of the formed thread. </p...|$|E

40|$|In a bolted joint, it {{is known}} that {{failures}} usually happen {{at the root of the}} first bolt thread where the maximum stress concentration occurs. Previously several methods were proposed to reduce the stress concentration through improving bolts and nuts profile.
