Patients are then treated with more <b>toxic</b> <b>standard</b> therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel and more effective treatments for prostate cancer. The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is an attractive therapeutic target for treating endocrine-dependent cancers because cholesterol is an essential structural and functional component of cell membranes {{as well as the}} metabolic precursor of endogenous steroid hormones. In this study, we have examined the effects of RO 48 - 8071 (4 &# 39;-[6 -(allylmethylamino) hexyloxy]- 4 -bromo- 2 &# 39;-fluorobenzophenone fumarate; Roche Pharmaceuticals internal reference: RO 0488071) (RO), which is an inhibitor of 2, 3 -oxidosqualene cyclase (a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway), on prostate cancer cells. Exposure of both hormone-dependent and castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells to RO reduced prostate cancer cell viability and induced apoptosis in vitro. RO treatment reduced androgen receptor protein expression in hormone-dependent prostate cancer cells and increased estrogen receptor β (ERβ) protein expression in both hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Combining RO with an ERβ agonist increased its ability to reduce castration-resistant prostate cancer cell viability. In addition, RO effectively suppressed the growth of aggressive castration-resistant human prostate cancer cell xenografts in vivo without any signs of toxicity to experimental animals. Importantly, RO did not reduce the viability of normal prostate cells in vitro. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor RO effectively suppresses growth of human prostate cancer cells. Our findings suggest that cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors such as RO, when used in combination with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs or ERβ specific ligands, could represent a novel therapeutic approach to prevent the growth of prostate cancer tumors.

40|$|Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is, with approximately half a million new cases every year, the sixth most common cancer worldwide and is etiologically linked to tobacco and alcohol consumption and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. It is generally accepted that HPV related HNSCC are a distinct entity with biological, demographical as well as clinical differences. One of the interesting features of HPV related HNSCC {{is that they have}} better response rates after treatment with chemoradiotherapy (cRT). However, despite this fact all HNSCC patients are treated with the same highly <b>toxic</b> <b>standard</b> treatment cRT schedules. Treatment adaptation through de-intensification of current standard cRT treatments or through introduction of tumor specific targeted approaches can form a solution to spare patients from the long-term complications. However, for both of these approaches thorough understanding of the biology of the radiation response of HPV related HNSCC is needed. The main objective of this thesis was to further elucidate the radiobiology of human HPV related HNSCC (see specific aim 1. 1) and to implement this knowledge in order to improve the radio-therapeutic index by better stratification of patients (see specific aim 1. 2) and by innovative, effective combination therapies (see specific aim 1. 3). Here we mainly focus on p 16 INK 4 a, which is an important regulator of the cell cycle and is currently accepted as a surrogate marker for HPV+HNSCC. However, to our knowledge no functional assessment of this protein in relation to the RT response is made. To achieve the main objective of the thesis, we mainly focus on the role of p 16 INK 4 a in radiation and DNA damage response. Below a short summary of the major findings of our research is described. 1. 1 nbsp; Understanding the underlying mechanism of radiation response in HPV positive head and neck cancers In this section of the project the DNA damage response and the interaction with p 16 INK 4 a was studied in vitro and the results were verified in a patient cohort treated with cRT. Briefly, we found that HPV- cells showed higher survival after treatment with radiation compared to p 16 INK 4 a/HPV+ cells. Interestingly, we found that the radiation sensitivity seen in HPV+ cells was directly related to p 16 INK 4 a overexpression. Further assessment of the function of p 16 INK 4 a in radiation response revealed that p 16 INK 4 a actively modulates DNA repair by impairing the recruitment of RAD 51, a marker for homologous recombination mediated DNA repair (HRR), through down-regulation of cyclin D 1 protein levels. These results clearly indicate that p 16 INK 4 a expression mediates rsquo; HRR repair and p 16 INK 4 a+ cells are characterized with genomic instability. In agreement with our in vitro results patients with high p 16 INK 4 a expression showed a better therapy response compared to patients with lower p 16 INK 4 a expression. In conclusion, these data confirmed the importance of p 16 INK 4 a expression in modulation of RT response and indicates the possibility to use p 16 INK 4 a as a marker for this response. The latter is further investigated in the second specific aim of this thesis. 1. 2 nbsp; Investigating the importance and localization of p 16 INK 4 a in HPV positive head and neck cancers Despite the fact that the prognostic value of HPV in HNSCC is well-described in literature, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the detection method. As direct methods of HPV detection are complex to implement in a clinical setup, p 16 INK 4 a expression is suggested as ideal surrogate marker for HPV positivity. However, lack of specificity and uniform scoring guidelines makes it difficult to reach a consensus regarding the role of p 16 INK 4 a as a marker for HPV detection. Furthermore, several papers indicate in subpopulation analysis that p 16 INK 4 a expression {{even in the absence of}} HPV seems to predict better prognosis after RT treatment. Since we demonstrated an active role of p 16 INK 4 a in RT response we hypothesized that p 16 INK 4 a is more than just surrogate marker for HPV detection, but can potentially predict RT response in HNSCC patients on its own. Moreover, because our research indicates that p 16 INK 4 a is involved in active DNA repair, which takes mainly place in the nucleus, we also have taken the localization of p 16 INK 4 a into account. Briefly, we analyzed 241 patient tumor samples (oropharynx) for p 16 INK 4 a expression and examined the predictive value of this protein in response to RT. These tumor samples were pre-treatment biopsies of HNSCC patients (oropharynx) treated with cRT. Indeed, we demonstrated that nuclear p 16 INK 4 a expressing HNSCC patients showed significant (p< 0. 05) better locoregional control rates (5 -year 82 %) compared to p 16 INK 4 a cytoplasmic positive (5 -year 55 %) and p 16 INK 4 a negative patients (5 -year 48 %). Moreover, only nuclear p 16 INK 4 a expression was a significant prognostic factor for locoregional control with a hazard ratio of 0. 48 (p< 0. 05; 95 % CI: 0. 22 - 101). The less pronounced effect of nuclear p 16 INK 4 a expression on overall survival (p< 0. 04; with 5 -year rates of 44 % p 16 INK 4 a nuclear, 42 % p 16 INK 4 a cytoplasmic and 34 % p 16 INK 4 a negative) suggest that nuclear p 16 INK 4 a expression is an important predictor for locoregional control and hence radiotherapy response. In conclusion, despite the fact that we could not exclude the confounding effect of HPV positivity on therapy response our results indicate the possibility to use nuclear p 16 INK 4 a expression as a predictive marker of the RT response. Currently we are further investigating the localization effect of p 16 INK 4 a in vitro. We believe in vitro verification of our observation in patient samples will increase the strength of our findings and will show that stratification of HNSCC can be made by looking at nuclear p 16 INK 4 a expression. This is important for risk assessment of patients but also important for further clinical trials. 1. 3 nbsp; Targeted therapies in combination with radiotherapy as novel treatment approach for head and neck cancers The third specific aim of our project was to improve the therapy options for HPV related HNSCC patients. Since we demonstrated defects in DNA repair systems of HPV+ HNSCC, we hypothesized that targeting of non-defective DNA repair pathways could result in selective tumor radiation sensitization. Briefly, we assessed the radiation sensitization potential of two DNA repair inhibitors (PARP 1 / 2 and DNA-PK inhibitors) targeting mainly non-homologous recombination repair in HNSCC cells. We showed that PARP inhibition in combination with ionizing radiation results in a p 16 INK 4 a dependent radiation sensitization of HNSCC cells, indicating the potential use of this inhibitor in p 16 INK 4 a+ HNSCC patients. Moreover, we showed that DNA-PK inhibition did also result in radiation sensitization. However, this effect was nor p 16 INK 4 a nor HPV dependent indicating the potential of DNA-PK as a therapeutic target for HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC patients. Further preclinical investigating of the mode of radiation sensitivity in vitro as well as in vivo is necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of action of these drugs. This will give us the opportunity to look for biomarkers which can predict the response rates to these drugs. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|As of July 7 2011, utility {{companies}} will {{shut down and}} retire aging coal-fired power plants following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) announcement of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAP). The extent of shutdowns and reduction in utilization will depend on factors such as future price of natural gas and cost of installation of pollution control equipment; however, as of 2013, the future of coal-fired power plants in the United States did not appear promising. Recent estimates gauge that an additional 40 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired capacity will retire by 2020 (in addition to the nearly 20GW that have retired as of 2014). This is driven most strongly by inexpensive natural gas competing with coal, and EPA’s Mercury and Air <b>Toxics</b> <b>Standards</b> (MATS), which require significant reductions in emissions of mercury, acid gases, and toxic metals, scheduled to take effect in April 2015.

We developed an assessment method linking global-scale atmospheric chemical transport modeling to regional-scale economic modeling to consistently evaluate the potential benefits to the United States of global (UN Minamata Convention on Mercury) and domestic [Mercury and Air <b>Toxics</b> <b>Standards</b> (MATS) ] policies, framed as economic gains from avoiding mercury-related adverse health endpoints. This method attempts to trace the policies-to-impacts path while taking into account uncertainties and knowledge gaps with policy-appropriate bounding assumptions. We project that cumulative lifetime benefits from the Minamata Convention for individuals affected by 2050 are $ 339 billion (2005 USD), with a range from $ 1. 4 billion to $ 575 billion in our sensitivity scenarios. Cumulative economy-wide benefits to the United States, realized by 2050, are $ 104 billion, with a range from $ 6 million to $ 171 billion. Projected Minamata benefits are more than twice those projected from the domestic policy. This relative benefit is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities, with the ratio of benefits (Minamata/MATS) ranging from ≈ 1. 4 to 3. However, we find that for those consuming locally caught freshwater fish from the United States, rather than marine and estuarine fish from the global market, benefits are larger from US than global action, suggesting domestic policies are important for protecting these populations. Per megagram of prevented emissions, our domestic policy scenario results in US benefits about {{an order of magnitude}} higher than from our global scenario, further highlighting the importance of domestic action.

30|$|Results {{show that}} the {{drinking}} water quality in Najran generally meets the international <b>standards.</b> <b>Toxic</b> elements such as Cd, Al, As, and Pb were either present in minute quantities or not detectable at all, and were below the WHO, USEPA and GSO guideline values. As such, human consumption of treated drinking water or bottled drinking water in Najran should not lead to adverse health effects typically associated with these elements. The levels of trace elements in the bottled and treated drinking water samples do not suggest any implications for human health, based on international/national guideline values (Tables  3, 4).|$|R
40|$|The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), {{enacted in}} 1980, {{provides}} a regulatory and legal mechanism to reduce risks from prior disposal of hazardous and <b>toxic</b> chemicals. Regulations, <b>Standards,</b> and Guidelines {{have been published}} to further define the CERCLA Process. The OU 7 - 10 Staged Interim Action Project at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) is a CERCLA project working to remediate the pre- 1970 disposal pit in which transuranic materials have been disposed. This paper analyzes the CERCLA process from a systems engineering perspective and describes how systems engineering is implemented on this project...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} inhaled pentamidine for the treatment of patients with mild and moderate Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis. Eight adults with AIDS and pneumocystis pneumonia (4 with a first episode and 4 with a repeat pneumocystosis) received daily inhalations of aerosol pentamidine isethionate for 21 days. Six patients were treated with doses of 300 mg of pentamidine and the remaining 2 received 600 mg every day. In the 300 mg treatment group, 2 individuals showed discrete and transient neutropenia. However, both subjects that received 600 mg of aerosol pentamidine daily developed leukopenia. One of them had major toxicity (overall severe intolerance of 12. 5 %) that required drug discontinuation and did not allow any analysis of the treatment efficacy. Of the 7 evaluable patients, 6 (88 %) completed the treatment successfuly. One subject of the 300 mg regimen experienced an early recurrence. In conclusion, inhaled pentamidine is an effective treatment for mild and moderate cases of P. carinii pneumonia. It is less <b>toxic</b> than <b>standard</b> anti-pneumocystis therapy and is suitable for outpatient use...|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} lymph node-negative patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy do not derive any {{benefit from this}} aggressive and potentially <b>toxic</b> treatment. However, <b>standard</b> histopathological indices cannot reliably detect patients at low risk of relapse or distant metastasis. In {{the past few years}} several prognostic gene expression signatures have been developed and shown to potentially outperform histopathological factors in identifying low-risk patients in specific breast cancer subgroups with predictive values of around 90 %, and therefore hold promise for clinical application. We envisage that further improvements and insights may come from integrative expression pathway analyses that dissect prognostic signatures into modules related to cancer hallmarks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{contents}} of mineral elements in wild traditional Tibetan medicines Fritillaria ussuriensis and Gastrodia elata from Tibet {{were determined by}} ICP-MS to study their efficacy mechanism and quality. The results showed that wild Gastrodia elata contained more Ca, Fe and Mn than F. ussuriensis, and less Zn, which proved that different traditional Tibetan medicines had different abilities to absorb mineral elements, which should be relative to their efficacy. Compared with F. ussuriensis, Gastrodia elata contained more Pb, Cr and Se, and less Cd and As. Referred to relative <b>standards,</b> <b>toxic</b> elements’ content in Gastrodia elata is not excessive, but Cd in F. ussuriensis was much {{higher than that of}} standard...|$|R
40|$|No {{controlled}} {{trials of}} therapy for invasive aspergillosis have been done. This review ap-praises 2, 121 cases reported in 497 {{articles in the}} literature and analyzes 440 courses of treatment of infection at various body sites in 379 patients. The exclusion of early failures of therapy skews the results toward a favorable outcome. The rate of response to am-photericin B is 55 %. Mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant recipients exceeds 94070 regardless of therapy, as does that from cerebral aspergillosis in all hosts. Amphotericin B (1 mg/Ikg-dj) with flucytosine lowers mortality in neutropenic patients with pulmonary aspergillosis who did not receive a bone marrow transplant; re-lapse is common. Surgical debridement of aspergillus maxillary sinusitis is usually cura-tive in nonimmunocompromised patients, whereas it increases mortality among neutro-penic patients. Valve replacement is essential for aspergillus endocarditis. Both vitrectomy and intravitreal amphotericin B treatment are essential for aspergillus endophthalmitis. Flucytosine is somewhat useful clinically. Itraconazole shows efficacy {{in the treatment of}} pulmonary, skeletal, and pericardial aspergillosis. Although liposomal amphotericin B is less <b>toxic</b> than <b>standard</b> preparations of the drug, relevant data are limited. The pro...|$|R
40|$|Iododoxorubicin 80 mg m- 2 i. v. {{was given}} 3 weekly for {{a maximum of}} six cycles as {{first-line}} chemotherapy to 14 evaluable women with metastatic breast cancer. The response rate was 14 % (95 % confidence intervals 4 - 40 %); median time to progression was 3. 5 months (range 0. 7 to > 9. 3) and median survival was 10. 2 months (range 2. 3 to > 20. 4). Neutropenia was the main toxicity but {{was not associated with}} severe sepsis. Two patients had a significant (> 10 %) but asymptomatic fall in cardiac ejection fraction; other toxicities were mild. Plasma pharmacokinetics was studied during the first cycle of treatment. Iododoxorubicin was extensively metabolised to iododoxorubicinol. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were both significantly correlated with the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for iododoxorubicin and the total AUC for iododoxorubicin and iododoxorubicinol. Quality of life (QOL), evaluated by self-report questionnaire and interview, showed little evidence of benefit in terms of physical symptom relief, level of activity, psychological symptoms or global evaluation of QOL during treatment. Iododoxorubicin is subjectively less <b>toxic</b> than <b>standard</b> anthracyclines, but at the dose and schedule used has limited activity in metastatic breast cancer, possibly because iododoxorubicinol is not clinically active...|$|R
