60|$|But to return. I am {{sufficiently}} {{instructed in}} the principal duty of a preface if my genius, {{were capable of}} arriving at it. Thrice have I forced my imagination to take the tour of my invention, and thrice it has returned empty, the latter having been wholly drained by the following treatise. Not so my more successful brethren the moderns, who will by no means let slip a preface or dedication without some notable distinguishing stroke to surprise the reader at the entry, and kindle a wonderful expectation of what is to ensue. Such {{was that of a}} most ingenious poet, who, soliciting his brain for something new, compared himself to the hangman and his patron to the patient. This was insigne, recens, indictum ore alio {51a}. When I went through that necessary and noble course of study, {51b} I had the happiness to observe many such egregious touches, which I shall not injure the authors by transplanting, because I have remarked that nothing is so very tender as a modern piece of wit, and which is apt to suffer so much in the carriage. Some things are extremely witty to-day, or fasting, or in this place, or at eight o'clock, or over a bottle, or spoke by Mr. Whatdyecall'm, or in a summer's morning, any of which, by the smallest <b>transposal</b> or misapplication, is utterly annihilate. Thus wit has its walks and purlieus, out of which it may not stray the breadth of a hair, upon peril of being lost. The moderns have artfully fixed this Mercury, and reduced it to the circumstances of time, place, and person. Such a jest there is that will not pass out of Covent Garden, and such a one that is nowhere intelligible but at Hyde Park Corner. Now, though it sometimes tenderly affects me to consider that all the towardly passages I shall deliver in the following treatise will grow quite out of date and relish with the first shifting of the present scene, yet I must need subscribe to the justice of this proceeding, because I cannot imagine why we should be at expense to furnish wit for succeeding ages, when the former have made no sort of provision for ours; wherein I speak the sentiment of the very newest, and consequently the most orthodox refiners, as well as my own. However, being extremely solicitous that every accomplished person who has got into the taste of wit calculated for this present month of August 1697 should descend to the very bottom of all the sublime throughout this treatise, I hold it fit to lay down this general maxim. Whatever reader desires to have a thorough comprehension of an author's thoughts, cannot take a better method than by putting himself into the circumstances and posture of life that the writer was in upon every important passage as it flowed from his pen, for this will introduce a parity and strict correspondence of ideas between the reader and the author. Now, to assist the diligent reader in so delicate an affair--as far as brevity will permit--I have recollected that the shrewdest pieces of this treatise were conceived in bed in a garret. At other times (for a reason best known to myself) I thought fit to sharpen my invention with hunger, and in general the whole work was begun, continued, and ended under a long course of physic and a great want of money. Now, I do affirm it will be absolutely impossible for the candid peruser to go along with me in a great many bright passages, unless upon the several difficulties emergent he will please to capacitate and prepare himself by these directions. And this I lay down as my principal postulatum.|$|E

40|$|A <b>transposal</b> {{of a word}} is a {{rearrangement}} of its letters into a new word, as CORSET to ESCORT or AGNOSTIC to COASTING. Although {{the words}} <b>transposal</b> and anagram are often used interchangeably, this practice is to be deplored. An anagram is a <b>transposal</b> of a word or phrase into another word or phrase which has the same meaning, as ENDEARMENT to TENDER NAME or H. M. S. PINAFORE to NAME FOR SHIP. Anagramming has been practiced for centuries, but transposing has been recognized as a separate art for only the past half-century or so...|$|E
40|$|Long <b>transposal</b> pairs, {{especially}} those in which the letters of one word must be thoroughly rearranged to form the other, have always fascinated logologists; in the February 1976 issue of Word Ways, I presented a list of well-mixed <b>transposal</b> pairs of 13 letters or more. A well-mixed <b>transposal</b> pair is defined as one in which at most three consecutive letters in one word appear in the other; for example, both words of the 17 -letter <b>transposal</b> pair baSIPaRACHromATin - marSIPobRAnCHiATa contain the trigram SIP and the bigrams CH, RA and AT, but no others. This <b>transposal</b> pair, discovered by Charles Holding and first appearing in The Enigma in 1972, is the longest well-mixed one known; in fact, the February 1976 article and the May 1976 Colloquy listed no 16 -letter well-mixed pairs, four 15 -letter well-mixed pairs, and eleven 14 -letter well-mixed pairs. Since then, John Edward Ogden discovered in 1978 the 16 -letter well-mixed pair HEmatocrySTaLLin - tHErmonaSTicaLLy, with three bigrams HE, ST and LL; furthermore, a well-known 15 -letter well-mixed pair can be pluralized to obtain megachiropteRAns - cinematogRAphers...|$|E

40|$|To improve {{yarn quality}} in ring {{spinning}} frame, this paper examines <b>transposal</b> spinning with the movable balloon control ring. The left-transposal spinning and the right-transposal spinning were experimented to spin two yarns; after installing the movable balloon control ring, the two methods were respectively used to spin two other yarns again. All the experiments {{were on the}} same ring frame and the raw material was wool/polyester blend roving with a ration of 30 / 70. The main quality indexes of the four yarns were tested and analyzed, including hairiness, tensile property, evenness and usual faults. The results show that the yarn spun by the left-transposal spinning has a better quality than the right-transposal spinning, and after adding the movable balloon control ring, the improvement of yarn hairiness strength and evenness, as well usual faults, is very obvious. So, in the advantage of <b>transposal</b> spinning, the method of installing the movable balloon control ring can improve some deteriorative problems and make yarn quality better. In addition, the method gives new insight into energy efficiency. The research in this field in on the way and the result is in accord with the Low-carbon Economy...|$|E
