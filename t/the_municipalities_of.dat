5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise.

In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
5|$|Across Puerto Rico, {{heavy rains}} from the weather system caused river {{flooding}} and landslides.
