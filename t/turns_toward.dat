25|$|Picasso's Rose Period <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> {{the theme}} of the {{fairground}} and circus performers; subjects often depicted in Post-Impressionist, romantic and symbolist art and verse (from Baudelaire and Rimbaud to Daumier and Seurat), where melancholy and social alienation pervade the saltimbanque. Corresponding to the tone of Picasso, acrobats represent both mystery and enchantment in the poems of Guillaume Apollinaire written in the same period.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the Existential Analytic grieving activity of <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> loss. Four women, each bereaved of either a parent, spouse, child, or sibling, participated {{in one hour}} interviews. The research question was, “what is the lived experience of <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> loss?” To understand how participants encountered and engaged with their grief, a hermeneutic phenomenological method was employed. Through lived experience descriptions, eight thematic meaning structures were revealed: (a) encounter with death, (b) surrendering to grief, (c) choosing community, (d) permitting and pursuing grief, (e) transformation of self, (f) rooting in relationship, (g) embracing life, and (h) ground of faith. From the thematic meanings emerged the metaphor of a labyrinth of grief, which symbolized the various paradoxes of grieving, signifying that <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> loss was essentially spiritual and transformative. In describing how they <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> their losses, the participants highlighted the inherent relational and dialogical nature of grieving. <b>Turning</b> <b>toward</b> lossExistential Analysisgrievinggrief workgrief encounterhermeneutic phenomenologylived experiencelabyrinthparadoxmetapho...|$|R

The smell makes P. fimbriata to quicker {{to see the}} prey, possibly by lowering thresholds in the visual system. Sometimes P. fimbriata cannot see J. queenlandicus through the prey's camouflage, and [...] "hunts by speculation", jumping high in the air, so that J. queenlandicus betrays itself by turning and looking for the disturbance. P. fimbriata then <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> J. queenslandicus and waves its palps. It appears that only P. fimbriatas from Queensland behaves this way while Portia species from other areas did not, that P. fimbriata from Queensland reacts this way only to J. queenslandicus, and that J. queenslandicus perceives no chemical warnings that P. fimbriata is around.|$|E
500|$|NY36 {{begins at}} the Pennsylvania state line in Troupsburg, where it {{continues}} south into Pennsylvania as PA249. Heading north from the state line in Steuben County, the route follows Troups Creek northward through rural Troupsburg {{on its way to}} the equally isolated town of Jasper, where it meets NY417 at a junction [...] west of the small hamlet of Jasper. NY36 joins NY417 here, following the east–west route to the western fringe of the community. At a T-intersection just outside the hamlet, the two routes split, with NY417 turning to the right (eastward) toward Corning and NY36 making a left-hand turn to continue northward toward the town of Canisteo. Across the town line, NY36 <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> the northwest and serves the hamlet of South Canisteo, which marks the southern end of both Colonel Hills Creek and a valley formed by the waterway.|$|E
500|$|Season three {{revealed}} why Lex endured Lionel's harsh parenting; {{his father}} blames {{him for his}} younger brother Julian Luthor's death, however, Lex took the blame to protect the true killer, his mentally unwell mother Lillian Luthor (Alisen Down), from Lionel's wraith. Also, Lex's curiosity into the symbols (and Clark) leads to a blowout between the two. When Lionel gives Clark a key to {{a room in the}} Luthor Mansion where Lex has been collecting information on Clark's family, Clark informs Lex that their friendship [...] "is over". In season four, Lex replaces his father as LuthorCorp's CEO and turns his attention <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> finding three ancient stones, which contain the same symbols as those in the cave and on the disc. He fails to find all three stones but suspects that Clark did, and used the stones to find the treasure of knowledge they were supposed to have led to, often having confrontations with Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles). Around this time, Lex's lifestyle of bedding women and then leaving them the next day would catch up to him when one (Cobie Smulders) that he had previously slept with attempts to kill him.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Andrade was {{developing}} an extensive {{familiarity with the}} dialects and cultures of large parts of Brazil. [...] He started to apply to prose fiction the speech-patterned technique he had developed in writing the poems of Hallucinated city. [...] He wrote two novels during this period using these techniques: the first, Love, Intransitive Verb, was largely a formal experiment.; the second, written shortly after and published in 1928, was Macunaíma, a novel about a man ("The hero without a character" [...] is the subtitle of the novel) from an indigenous tribe who comes to São Paulo, learns its languages—both of them, the novel says: Portuguese and Brazilian—and returns. [...] The style {{of the novel is}} composite, mixing vivid descriptions of both jungle and city with abrupt <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> fantasy, the style that would later be called magical realism. [...] Linguistically, too, the novel is composite; as the rural hero comes into contact with his urban environment, the novel reflects the meeting of languages. [...] Relying heavily on the primitivism that Andrade learned from the European modernists, the novel lingers over possible indigenous cannibalism even as it explores Macunaíma's immersion in urban life. Critic Kimberle S. López has argued that cannibalism is the novel's driving thematic force: the eating of cultures by other cultures.|$|E
500|$|The Southern {{terminus}} of the Yellow Line is {{adjacent to}} Kings Highway (Virginia Route 241) in Fairfax County, Virginia. The line heads northeast on a bridge over Hunting Creek and the Washington Beltway (Interstate 95) to a station {{just south of}} Eisenhower Avenue, which serves a number of government office buildings including the United States Patent Office. The Yellow Line then merges with the Blue Line and follows the right-of-way of the CSX Railroad through the City of Alexandria. The line enters a short tunnel under U.S. Route 1. After crossing a bridge over Four Mile Run, the line enters Arlington County on an elevated structure above the National Airport parking lots. At {{the north end of}} the airport, the Yellow Line enters a tunnel under 18th Street South and South Hayes Street. The tunnel continues along the southwest face of the Pentagon which is a two level station to facilitate a fork with the Blue Line. After the Pentagon station, the Yellow Line emerges from its tunnel east of the Pentagon and crosses the Charles R. Fenwick Bridge over the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the Potomac River, and Ohio Drive. At the end of the bridge, the Yellow Line re-enters a tunnel near the Jefferson Memorial and crosses under the Washington Channel. The tunnel merges with the Green Line tunnel under 7th Street Southwest just south of the L'Enfant Plaza. The joint Yellow Line— Green Line tunnel continues north through downtown Washington under 7th Street, turns west under Florida Avenue and U Street, and then north under 14th Street Northwest. The tunnel then <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> the northeast under Park Road and New Hampshire Avenue. [...] The tunnel then bends eastward under Rock Creek Cemetery and Fort Totten Park to emerge just before entering the lower level of the Fort Totten station. The track continues northeast as just the Green Line to the Greenbelt terminus.|$|E
