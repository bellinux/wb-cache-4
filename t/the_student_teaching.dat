Studies seeking to understand this experience {{from the perspectives of}} <b>the</b> <b>student</b> teacher and cooperating teacher are commonly found in the literature; yet research specific to the university supervisor has been considered meager at best. Building upon Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior, we sought to reveal the university supervisor’s voice regarding the relevance of traditionally required <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> skills and activities commonly included in <b>the</b> capstone <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> experience. A descriptive census study consisting of university supervisors (N = 62) from the North Central Region of the American Association for Agricultural Education (AAAE) was implemented.

A second purpose was to determine if administrator perceptions as measured by two selected instruments would correlate significantly with student perceptions during <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> experience and after one year of teaching experience. ^ Student perceptions were measured by the 7 -A Student Questionnaire (7 -A SQ) and the Purdue Teacher Evaluation Scale (PTES). Administrator or supervisor perceptions were measured by the Student Teacher Reference (STR) form and a validated Administrator Evaluation (AE) form. ^ Eleven hypotheses were investigated to answer the basic questions of this study. These questions were: (1) What is the relationship between scores from the PTES and 7 -A SQ taken during <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> experience and scores from the PTES and 7 -A SQ taken after one year of teaching experience? (2) What is the relationship between scores from the student perception instruments, 7 -A SQ and PTES, and scores from the administrator perception instruments, STR and AE, both during <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> experience and after one year of teaching experience. ^ Student and administrator perceptions from the actual teaching experience were gathered during the last quarter of the first year of teaching experience. Statistical procedures included use of the Pearson correlation, dependent t-test, and step-wise regression analyses.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{descriptive study}} uses an intersubjective approach to examine relational aspects of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> triad. Triad members include the student teacher, {{the cooperating teacher}} and the university supervisor. Beginning with a close reading of teaching socialization literature that focuses on <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> experience, various roles or scripted power relations, are carefully laid out. Working from the premise that conceptions of power may determine the quality of relationships, this interpretive study examines the power dynamics of eight specific student teaching triads from all three perspectives. The primary researcher was also the university supervisor {{in each of the}} triads studied. As an adjunct faculty member and former public school teacher, the researcher as supervisor brought a non-traditional 'eye' to the role of supervisor. Student teaching triad members were encouraged to consider and articulate the influence and control each triad member had in relation to decision-making concerning curriculum, classroom management and evaluation in an elementary classroom. Results reinforced much conventional wisdom about <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> experience and attempted to establish that in the institutional context studied an ideology of reputation and dependability held sway. Strong personal connections were found to be paramount for optimal functioning of the triads studied. Power struggles were noted as triad members strategically maneuvered in efforts to hide various aspects of their scripted roles. Conclusions from this study included the difficulty of moving <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> experience beyond ritual, how a cooperating teacher's own student teaching experience may strongly influence their supervisory styles and the difficulty of establishing spaces for critical dialogue within <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> triad as constituted. Suggestions include the establishment and maintenance of sustained robust communication between triad members. Critical dialogue that includes the articulation and consideration of various scripted power relations or roles in relation to potential strategic power relations would be encouraged. This recognition and 'naming' of power in language more in line with the elementary public school context, as perceived by the elementary teacher, could perhaps precipitate modifications to the traditional student teaching triad that would benefit all triad members...|$|E

40|$|Socialization is {{the process}} of {{gathering}} knowledge and constructing it in a social context. This gathering of knowledge is often acquired formally through an educational process or informally by interaction with other people (Capel, 2007). A physical education teacher goes through a socialization process where beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and teaching philosophies are influenced. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how pre-service teachers’ application of theory and practice learned during the professional teacher education program (PETE) was influenced by aspects of socialization while immersed in <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teaching</b> practicum. Data were collected using a variety of qualitative techniques and analyzed using standard interpretive methods.
