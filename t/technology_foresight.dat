40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to present a methodological concept {{allowing}} to demonstrate the development directions of materials surface engineering according {{to the level of}} generality and the intensity of the phenomena analysed on other phenomena. Design/methodology/approach: A set of analytical methods and tools was used to present the development directions of materials surface engineering at the three levels analysed, i. e. : a macro-, meso- and microlevel. The analytical methods and tools comprise the scenario method, artificial neural networks, Monte Carlo method, e-Dephix method, statistical lists as bar charts, foresight matrices together with technology development tracks, technology roadmaps, technology information sheets and the classical materials science methods. Findings: A research methodology allowing to combine a presentation and description of the forecast future events having a varied level of generality and capturing the cause and effect relationships existing between the events. Research limitations/implications: The methodological concept discussed, implemented with reference to materials surface engineering, has a much broader meaning, and can be successfully applied in other <b>technology</b> <b>foresights,</b> and also in industrial and thematic foresights after minor modifications. Practical implications: The outcomes of the research conducted may be and should be used in the process of creating and managing the future of materials surface engineering and, within the time horizon of 20 years, may and should influence positively the development of the economy based on knowledge and innovation, sustainable development and the statistical level of the technologies used in industry, especially in small- and medium-sized enterprises. Originality/value: An own methodological concept constitutes an original way of presenting the development directions of the investigated field of knowledge.

30|$|<b>Technology</b> {{assessment}} and <b>foresight</b> studies {{have pointed out}} the importance of analyzing visions to understand the future of technoscience [19]. Such studies, however, have not focused on films as sources to conduct such analyses. As shown in this article, films are rich documents for investigating how future techno-scientific worlds are imagined. The inclusion of films in <b>technology</b> {{assessment and}} <b>foresight</b> studies should focus on two aspects [41]. First are the ways techno-scientific futures manifest themselves in films. Films {{can be used as}} a starting point for analysis in order to examine the sociotechnical imaginaries expressed via cinematic images. Such analysis was conducted for this article. The second aspect incorporates the sociotechnical constellations and processes in which cinematic futures are generated. The starting point of analysis for this second perspective is not the films, but the contexts of their production and use. Drawing from Social Studies of Scientific Imaging and Visualization [42], such analysis should focus on the production, interpretation, distribution, and use of cinematic visions in order to explore their societal implications. Qualitative interpretive research methods are preferred for this investigation. The collection of Jasanoff and Kim [20] can serve as a conceptual and methodological template for both analytical perspectives. According to the authors in this collection, sociotechnical imaginaries can appear in individual objects and phenomena and are culturally produced and disseminated.|$|R

40|$|Creation of new institutions, {{organizational}} structures and instruments of governance {{is one of}} the administrative reform directions in Ukraine. Recently, when addressing this issue, Ukrainian experts have more and more frequently mentioned the term of «Foresight». The notion entered the Ukrainian scientific community (including public administration field) not long time ago. So, in order to assess the real situation and determine the prospects of regional Foresight in the system of public administration the author conducted a survey involving local government experts. Its purpose was to draw attention of the experts working in local government bodies to <b>Foresight</b> <b>technology,</b> as well as to provide state assessment, conceptualization of regional Foresight directions (vectors, focus, principles) and consider the possibilities of its implementation (problems, initiators, sources of funding, possible threats) in Ukraine. Applying some elements of <b>Foresight</b> <b>technology,</b> we tried to define some future prospects of regional Foresight in Ukraine and tried to form two roadmaps on this basis. The analysis of domestic and foreign scientific background revealed some results highlighted in a number of proposals and recommendations on Foresight researches in general. In addition, {{on the basis of the}} obtained material and using a dual choice approach, the author developed some scientific and practical recommendations.

We evaluated three study characteristics that are pertinent for design of Delphi foresight research: (1) the number of survey questions, (2) the sample size, and (3) the extent to which experts conform to group opinion (the Group Conformity Index) in a Delphi study. Their impacts on the following nine Delphi consensus indices were then examined in 1000 simulations: Clustered Mode, Clustered Pairwise Agreement, Conger's Kappa, De Moivre index, Extremities Version of the Clustered Pairwise Agreement, Fleiss' Kappa, Mode, the Interquartile Range and Pairwise Agreement. The dependency of a consensus index on the Delphi survey characteristics was expressed from 0. 000 (no dependency) to 1. 000 (full dependency). The number of questions (range: 6 to 40) in a survey did not have a notable impact whereby the dependency values remained below 0. 030. The variation in sample size (range: 6 to 50) displayed the top three impacts for the Interquartile Range, the Clustered Mode and the Mode (dependency = 0. 396, 0. 130, 0. 116, respectively). The Group Conformity Index, a construct akin to measuring stubbornness/flexibility of experts' opinions, greatly impacted all nine Delphi consensus indices (dependency = 0. 200 to 0. 504), except the Extremity CPWA and the Interquartile Range that were impacted only beyond the first decimal point (dependency = 0. 087 and 0. 083, respectively). Scholars in <b>technology</b> design, <b>foresight</b> research and future(s) studies might consider these new findings in strategic planning of Delphi studies, for example, in rational choice of consensus indices and sample size, or accounting for confounding factors such as experts' variable degrees of conformity (stubbornness/flexibility) in modifying their opinions...|$|R

Thereby, <b>Foresight</b> is not a trend analysis on which predictions can derive.

5000|$|Community education, {{engagement}} and consultation tend to occur [...] "downstream": once {{there is at}} least a moderate level of awareness, and often during the process of disseminating and adapting technologies. [...] "Upstream" [...] engagement, by contrast, occurs much earlier in the innovation cycle and involves: [...] "dialogue and debate about future technology options and pathways, bringing the often expert-led approaches to horizon scanning, <b>technology</b> <b>foresight</b> and scenario planning to involve a wider range of perspectives and inputs." [...] Daniel Sarewitz Director of Arizona State University’s Consortium on Science, Policy and Outcomes, argues that [...] "by the time new devices reach the stage of commercialization and regulation, it is usually too late to alter them to correct problems." [...] However, Xenos, et al. argue that upstream engagement can be utilized in this area through anticipated discussion with peers. Upstream engagement in this sense is [...] "meant to create the best possible conditions for sound policy making and public judgments based on carefull assessment of objective information". Discussion may act as a catalyst for upstream engagement by prompting accountability for individuals to seek and process additional information ("anticipatory elaboration"). However, though anticipated discussion did lead to participants seeking further information, Xenos et al. found that factual information was not primarily sought out; instead, individuals sought out opinion pieces and editorials.|$|E
