5|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether Lucas {{intended}} Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor or just the first of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author of The Secret History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt Emperors, not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sole villainous ruler.|$|E
5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} created Shikamaru {{in order}} {{for him to be}} the only winner of an early Naruto arc: the Chunnin Exams, based on his high intelligence.

Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends becoming the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the series.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Badami Chalukyan temples {{featured}} in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its importance and wider use.

When the team develops an open-world game, they prioritise quest design over the size of its world in the belief that having choices to make encourages players to immerse themselves in the game.|$|E

5|$|In late 2007 {{following}} the band's Stadium Arcadium tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{went on a}} hiatus, with Kiedis citing exhaustion as the main reason. The band's hiatus lasted until October 2009 when they started to write and rehearse for their tenth album however absent from these rehearsals was Fruciante although present was the band's touring guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer leading many to speculate Frusciante had again left the band. Speculation proved to be true with Frusciante already having quit the band {{for a second time}} on July 29, 2009 however it wasn't until December 2009 in a post on his official website that he made his departure from the band official to the public.

During this tour, the band added backing musicians, Mauro Refosco and Chris Warren (also Smith's drum technician) to their touring lineup.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers did not need <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of}} the game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The Missing Link, it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
