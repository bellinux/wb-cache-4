5|$|This strong odour can be {{detected}} {{half a mile away}} by animals, thus luring them. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.|$|E

5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows the growth of <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which <b>the</b> <b>fruit</b> body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
