Tomaszewska et al. found that polysulfone coated fertilizers had excellent controlled release property (Tomaszewska and Jarosiewicz 2006; Tomaszewska et al. 2002). However, polymer-coated fertilizers have a disadvantage that large amounts of non-degradable <b>coating</b> <b>materials</b> are left in soil when the nutrients are exhausted.
