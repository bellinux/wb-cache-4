Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.|$|E

Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension.

Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} approximate cloaking from a regularization viewpoint {{introduced in}} [13] for EIT and further investigated in [12] [17] for the Helmholtz equation. <b>The</b> <b>cloaking</b> schemes in [12] and [17] are {{shown to be}} (optimally) within |ρ|^- 1 in 2 D and ρ in 3 D of perfect cloaking, where ρ denotes the regularization parameter.

40|$|Electromagnetic cloaks are {{devices that}} can be used to reduce the total {{scattering}} cross section of various objects. An ideal cloak removes all scattering from an object and thus makes this object "invisible" to the electromagnetic fields that impinge on the object. However, ideal cloaking appears to be possible only at a single frequency. To study cloaking from an electromagnetic pulse we consider propagation of a pulse inside a waveguide with a cloaked metal object inside. There are several ways to achieve cloaking and in this paper we study three such methods, namely, <b>the</b> coordinate-transformation <b>cloak,</b> <b>the</b> transmission-line <b>cloak,</b> and <b>the</b> metal-plate <b>cloak.</b> In <b>the</b> case of <b>the</b> two last <b>cloaks,</b> pulse propagation is studied using experimental data whereas <b>the</b> coordinate-transformation <b>cloak</b> is studied with numerical simulations.

During the summer of 2007 the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawai`i, under the supervision of its conservator, Valerie Free, commenced a project to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>cloaks</b> so that they could be safely exhibited in the museum. This project was funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Over the course of the summer three of <b>the</b> twelve <b>cloaks</b> in <b>the</b> museum’s collection were treated: <b>the</b> “Chapman” <b>cloak</b> (Fig. 1), <b>the</b> “Joy” <b>cloak</b> (Fig. 2) and the smaller second “Joy” cape (Fig. 3). The Bishop Museum completed a conservation survey documenting the condition of <b>the</b> <b>cloaks</b> before treatment.
