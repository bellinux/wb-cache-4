5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2004, {{during the}} Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq, a {{training}} mission to assist <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> {{in conjunction with}} the US led MNF-I. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established {{at the request of the}} Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17December 2011.|$|E
