5|$|In the {{original}} club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905, when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers {{would have to}} play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which was meant as an insult. For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern have mostly worn an all red home kit, with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour {{for the first time}} when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> be worn for Champions League matches. Bayern also wore a Rotwein coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|For 2015, the Nissan 370Z NISMO {{has seen}} various updates: an {{automatic}} (seven-speed) transmission, a built-in navigation system, and tweaks to its restyled {{front and rear}} fascia and body <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> give it a more prominence attitude than before.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} by the USAF determined that the crash was likely caused by an improper stabilizer trim setting. The investigation was unable to determine conclusively what had caused the horizontal stabilizer <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> be set improperly, but theorized that the most likely cause was an aircraft system malfunction.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{the hook}} sheet is <b>trimmed</b> <b>to</b> fit {{the size of}} the open abdomen wound. In case of the massive peritoneal {{hypertension}} both sheets cover the open space and the hook sheet does not need <b>trimming</b> <b>to</b> fit the wound opening.|$|R

Generally, after {{either a}} cold forming or a fire forming operation, {{the mouth of}} the case will be longer than ideal, and the case will be <b>trimmed</b> back <b>to</b> the [...] "trim to" [...] length. Trimming is a normal {{reloading}} operation, as high pressure cartridges will flow each time they are fired, and periodically need <b>trimming</b> <b>to</b> remove the brass that flows to the mouth.|$|R

25|$|Preparing the Vampire for {{take-off}} {{would only}} require pilots to perform six vital actions: setting the <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> neutral, opening {{the high and}} low-pressure fuel cocks, activating the booster pump, setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly upon leaving the ground, else increasing airflow as the aircraft picked up speed would prevent the undercarriage doors from closing. Landing procedure was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the wheel brakes, lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and effecting the air brakes. Typically, power-on landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, while the wheel brakes had to be applied carefully {{in order to avoid}} locking the wheels; there was no anti-lock braking system present.|$|E
25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection {{on each side of}} the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks utilized flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light.|$|E
500|$|A revised {{design was}} {{approved}} on 28 February 1938 {{and the first}} ship was to be laid down on 15 July, but even this design was incomplete and would be revised later. Trials with similarly shaped motor launches suggested that the hull's propulsive efficiency would be [...] less than planned, and this was accepted in the November 1938 revision as a maximum speed of [...] However, a new propeller design {{proved to be more}} efficient and was predicted to increase speed to [...] Another change was the deletion of the centerline rudder when tests showed that the two wing rudders {{would not be able to}} counteract its effects if it jammed. The weight toward the stern of the boat was calculated to be too great, producing a substantial stern-down <b>trim.</b> <b>To</b> remedy this, the two 100mm turrets mounted on the quarterdeck were deleted and the height of the armor belt abreast the rear turret was lowered, but this decision was reversed and they were restored by a decision of the State Defense Committee on 14 January 1941. This forced a revision of the aircraft arrangements as the aircraft catapult had to be removed from the centerline of the quarterdeck; two catapults were added to the sides of the quarterdeck instead.|$|E

To comply with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety standards there were exterior side marker lights, and three-point seat belts and headrests {{for the front}} seats, while the interior was devoid of bright <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> help reduce glare.|$|E
2500|$|The Astre {{features}} Pontiac's trademark split grill, emblems {{and steering}} wheel with an upgraded interior <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> help differentiate {{itself from the}} Chevrolet Vega. Other styling differences compared to the Vega include [...] 1973 model Astres have a black-finish grill and clear parking lamp lenses on all models, and chrome headlight bezels on non-GTs. Taillight lenses (same as the Vega) have a chrome trim piece surround. The 1974-1977 models have first generation Firebird-styled taillights (also shared with the 1973/74 Ventura) on the notchback and hatchback.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961 Chevrolet {{introduced}} the Monza upscale <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> the four door sedans {{and the club}} coupe body styles. [...] With its newly introduced 4 speed floor mounted transmission, DeLuxe vinyl bucket seats and upscale trim the Monza Club Coupe gained in sales, as nearly 110,000 were produced along with 33,745 Monza four-door Sedans. [...] The 4 speed Monza {{caught the attention of}} the younger market and was sometimes referred to as [...] "the poor man's Porsche" [...] in various car magazines. The Monza series contributed to about half of the Corvair sales in 1961.|$|E

2500|$|The atrium {{beginning}} at the building line, became instead a gabled roof extruded beyond the building facade and stepping back to its seven-story peak. The developer {{wanted it to be}} [...] wide but it was narrowed to 90 feet. The skyway linking Galtier Plaza and the Farm Credit Bank toward downtown was proposed as a [...] "festive" [...] design with gabled peaks, lots of glass, and cream and red aluminum <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> match Galtier's. Lowertown's Weiming Lu and the city planning staff stood fast for the standard Vierendeel truss and bronze aluminum. Galtier Plaza opened in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Middle-specification Club trim was dropped, and on Connoisseur trim light oak wood {{took the}} place of the {{original}} walnut, which remained standard fitment on the entry-level Classic trim. Rover also added a new <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> the range called Contemporary which featured revised fittings such as larger alloy wheels, body colour exterior accents, black oak wood trim and sports seats as well as an altered equipment tally. [...] The instrumentation and its back-lighting were modernised, the console texture finish was upgraded and the seat bolsters revised to offer more support. [...] Access to the rear seats was improved and leg-room increased.|$|E

They there standard models without accessories and {{were used for}} cab service. The interior layout remained the American 1968 version for the entire run. The ignition switch remained dash mounted as the US-mandated steering lock was not required in Argentina. Power steering became available {{at the end of}} the production run. V8s versions weren't produced: [...] Power windows were not available, tinted windows were darker than American versions, and the darker band on the upper edge of the windshield was not present.|$|E

The lowest priced CX model received microscopic hubcaps, painted black, as were the bumpers (chromed on better equipped versions). The CX-L was added in September 1978 and had brighter <b>trim,</b> <b>to</b> specifically target feminine customers. Only the CX-G had front disc brakes; the others had {{to make do with}} drums all around. Handling was as can be expected, the rear-engine leading to a somewhat twitchy front end. In the SC100s, the heavier four-cylinder engine was countered by a balancing weight in the front bumper.|$|E
2500|$|Academic {{dress for}} the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum {{graduates}} consists of a black toga or academic gown with <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> follow {{the color of the}} faculty, and an academic ring. [...] For the doctoral degree a four corned biretta is to be worn, and for the Licentiate degree a three corned biretta is to be worn. See:. [...] The 'traditional' biretta at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, is white, to correspond to the white Dominican habit. Also, the academic senate of the Angelicum in its May 2011 meeting indicated that the black biretta may be used with trim and pom in the color of the particular faculty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{name change}} also {{included}} new logos, colors and uniforms, {{coinciding with the}} team's move to the new MCI Center. The new team's colors were blue, bronze and black. The primary logo depicted a wizard conjuring a basketball with a quarter moon. In 2007, the Wizards made minor modifications on their team jerseys and logos. To accommodate the gold–black alternate jerseys they introduced the previous season along with the design change on the Verizon Center floor, they changed their secondary team colors from bronze to metallic gold, and the player's name {{on the back of}} the jersey was changed from white/blue with bronze <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> gold (blue on home uniforms) with a change in lettering.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Mark IV was {{introduced}} to the market at the International Motor Show at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham in 1978. The main update was that construction was now all steel, frontal design was completely different from the past 14 years. The headlights were now rectangular and mounted above each other with side lights and indicators in the same cluster. The grill was not so prominent and various options were available as a package. So now the range consisted of Supreme IV, Supreme IV Express and Supreme IV GT. The GT option ushered in a distinctive grill design with a smart dual chrome flash, tinted windows and better sound system and soft <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> the ceiling to name a few [...] "standard" [...] extras.|$|E
2500|$|For unstated reasons, Human Head had quietly stopped {{development}} of Prey 2 {{near the end}} of 2011, after having spent about two years of development on the title.

Norm Nazaroff of Human Head believed they had added much more content and technical innovations to the title, as to make it [...] "one of the best looking games of the [...] console generation". Another Human Head employee, Jason Blair, who had worked on narrative elements for Prey 2, said that reasons for ending development were [...] "political" [...] and [...] "petty".|$|E
