Shawn {{said in an interview}} that [...] "it’s usually because <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> came along is kind of hokey, but I think the quality of Fringe is really high and the episode is done well and our characters are intelligent. We’re going to have some fun." [...] Holly Dignard guest starred as Danielle Rose, while recurring guest actors Amy Madigan and Ryan McDonald returned as Marilyn Dunham and Brandon Fayette, respectively. Seth Gabel and former series regular Kirk Acevedo reprised their characters Lincoln Lee and Charlie Francis, Fringe Division agents from the Other Side.|$|E

In a June 2010 interview with The Columbians Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, [...] " [...] <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> {{people are talking about}} on the streets...to get attention, you have to speak their language. You have to interest them, gain their trust, talk to them and show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of your experiences. Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion".|$|E
500|$|Bill Drummond {{summed up}} The JAMs' {{approach}} to composition {{in the first}} [...] "KLF Information Sheet", sent out in October 1987: [...] "We made [...] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> came out of our mouths.... Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{rated the}} episode [...] "C", in its {{review of the}} fifth season. It cited Chandler's line [...] "You've got to push past this, okay? Because it's about to get sooo good" [...] as {{the best of the}} episode. The review criticized the manner in which an {{employee}} can feel pressured into smoking, adding it is [...] "not exactly <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> laughs are made of". Moreover, it argued the same over the competitive vibe between Joey and Ross. Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide added in a review of the fifth season DVD: [...] "Although I don't like the cutesy kid who plays Ben, the audition bits become funny due to Joey’s screw-ups. His inability to correctly read the line [...] "mmm – soup!" [...] becomes very amusing and offers the show's highlights." ...|$|E
500|$|Halo 2s soundtrack was {{composed}} primarily by Martin O'Donnell and his musical partner Michael Salvatori, {{the team that}} had composed the critically acclaimed music of Halo. O'Donnell noted in composing the music for Halo 2 that [...] "Making a sequel is never a simple proposition. You want to make everything that was cool even better, and leave out all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> was weak." [...] O'Donnell made sure that {{no part of the}} game would be completely silent, noting [...] "Ambient sound {{is one of the main}} ways to immerse people psychologically. A dark room is spooky, but add a creaking floorboard and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes really creepy." [...] Halo 2, unlike its predecessor, was mixed to take full advantage of Dolby 5.1 Digital surround sound.|$|E
500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E

5000|$|For Deth Red Sabaoth, Danzig took a {{different}} approach to recording: “I wanted to have an organic sound, bigger and thicker, so I went out and bought some 1970s Kustom tuck ’n’ roll bass amps to play some of the guitar parts through.

500|$|Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said {{although}} {{he liked the}} pilot episode, he thought jokes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were [...] "pretty thin on the ground", the supporting cast lacked good material and the Leslie character was less likable than the previous week. Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour my notes to remind myself of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis. He particularly praised Poehler and Ansari, and said of the episode, [...] "Tune in just to hear her say to her canvassing companion, who complains it's hot and wants to cool off: 'We could blow in each other's faces.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On November 8, 2006, the {{day after}} she filed for divorce from Federline, Spears {{recorded}} [...] "Radar" [...] with Ezekiel Lewis and Patrick M.

Smith stated that the team tried to create a record [...] "for the Britney Spears that we know and love" [...] and that it did not [...] "touch on anything that was really dealing with all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> she was dealing with." [...] Both commented that although Spears arrived late to the recording sessions, she caught them off guard with her efficiency and professionalism, with Lewis adding, [...] "It was absolutely nuts, and she took directions very well.

500|$|Selena Gomez cited Stripped as an {{inspiration}} for her second studio album Revival, saying [...] "That’s {{one of my favorite}} albums and that was kind of what I started off Revival as, some sort of story. I mean, that album for her was incredible — 'Beautiful', 'Can’t Hold Us Down', all of that — that’s <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I love," [...] she said. [...] "That was an album, that was complete on my record. I have 'Rise', 'Survivors', 'Revival', 'Kill Em With Kindness'.

Although the popularity of rapcore declined, some believe that rapcore may regain popularity, with younger music fans discovering bands in the genre.

5000|$|Lisa Fernandes of Next Projection {{rated the}} episode with 7.5/10 stating that it {{combined}} some odd morals with some decent comedy and that Alex's plot saves the episode. [...] "It’s not a tragically bad episode like last week’s, but it’s {{not very much}} better than <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that’s</b> come before it. The generally charming Alex plot is what saves this one from the dung heap, and makes it worth recommending." ...|$|R
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series. Daniels said, [...] "This year feels like the last chance to really go out together and make an artistic ending for the show that pays off a lot of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> matters most to fans." [...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E

He considered its story to be [...] "good" [...] but [...] "nothing great" [...] and its graphics to be [...] "decent"; but he commented that the game was [...] "really all about the gameplay", which he praised as [...] "quite compelling and fun". Benjamin E. Sones of Computer Games Magazine considered the game's story to be [...] "quite good", but he faulted Looking Glass for failing to detail {{the events of the}} first game for new players. He wrote that Thief IIs graphics were passable but that its sound design was [...] "phenomenal". Sones praised its missions as [...] "very well crafted", and noted that they gave the impression of being in [...] "a living, breathing world."

500|$|Burt Reynolds makes a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "The Man from Jupiter", as the love interest of Malory Archer. His guest appearance was formally announced in October 2011. Prior to his appearance, Reynolds was referenced in several episodes of the series. Series creator Adam Reed opined: [...] "I {{think the only}} person on the planet who's a bigger fan of Burt Reynolds than me is Sterling Archer. Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing." [...] After receiving the episode's script from Reed, Reynolds made several edits; while editing the script of the episode, Reynolds added {{a scene in which}} Sterling reveals that his career choice was largely influenced by his films. [...] "We sent him the script beforehand and he noted the script up pretty good. But it was all to make it more self-deprecating." [...] Reed, a fan of Reynolds, said that working with him was a great experience. [...] "It was such a surreal experience being in the room with Burt Reynolds, my childhood hero," [...] he affirmed. [...] "Just hearing him read <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I wrote, it was pretty great." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerning inspirations on the season, Loeb {{revealed}} that [...] "Chinatown... {{is one of}} the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character.

[...] Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create [...] "unconventional" [...] compositions, with Billeter explaining, [...] "There were a lot of foreground elements [...] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia." [...] Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and [...] "good composition", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the [...] "warm, dirty color of sodium vapor" [...] for night exterior scenes.|$|E
