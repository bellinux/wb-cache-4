She was so devoted to Alexander's memory <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore</b> a small package around her neck containing the pieces of a sonnet which Alexander wrote for her during the early days of their courtship.|$|E

Polanski was planning The Fearless Vampire Killers, which was being coproduced by Ransohoff, and had decided that he wanted the red-headed actress Jill St. John for the female lead.

25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore</b> a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished {{all she had to}} do was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through in the setting of her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread that she was going to do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, near an {{abandoned}} farm. To extract the body, investigators were forced to chisel away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence. Some articles of clothing were found, including a black and pink top with a pink bow, originating from Family Dollar, distributed in the spring of 2008. The underclothing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore,</b> also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008. Her jeans were that of the Angels brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic ponytail holder was found on her wrist. No socks or shoes were found at the scene. Initially, no jewelry was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but it may not have belonged to her, as examiners could not be certain how long {{it had been in the}} water. However, some reports claim that a bracelet containing several pendants was also found on the girl's remains. The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having hair highlights due to having some different shades. The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.|$|E

500|$|Stefani made {{most of the}} {{clothing}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore</b> on stage with No Doubt, resulting in increasingly eclectic combinations. Stylist Andrea Lieberman introduced her to haute couture clothing, which led to Stefani launching a fashion line named L.A.M.B. in 2004. The line takes influence {{from a variety of}} fashions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, and Jamaican styles. The line achieved popularity among celebrities and is worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, and Stefani herself. In June 2005, she expanded her collection with the less expensive Harajuku Lovers line, which she referred to as [...] "a glorified merchandise line", with varied products including a camera, mobile phone charms, and undergarments. In late 2006, Stefani released a limited edition line of dolls called [...] "Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Fashion dolls". The dolls are inspired by the various fashion that Stefani and the Harajuku Girls wore while touring for the album.|$|E

500|$|On April 9, 2005, Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson {{were cast}} as the goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. Johnson, who was {{starring}} in the Canadian television series Instant Star (2004–2008), had auditioned to play Wendy's sister Julie; that role later went to Amanda Crew, who originally auditioned to play Erin. Johnson said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore</b> a rocker jacket during her second reading and was in a bad mood. As she was leaving, the filmmakers called her back to read for Erin, with the dialogue in her scene being sarcastic. Johnson thought that her dry sense of humor, which the filmmakers caught, helped her land the role. Regarding his role, Lemche said that Ian [...] "spouts some interesting facts {{that seem to be}} just right there on the tips of his fingers". Lemche researched most of Ian's information. During read-throughs, he often asked Morgan about Ian's facts; to help him, Morgan wrote Lemche notes and gave him URLs to research the information Ian gives out.|$|E
500|$|In February 1992, Al Rendon {{was hired}} by EMI Latin to take {{photographs}} for Entre a Mi Mundo. A previous photographer had taken some photos of the singer, which were not well received by the company, and Rendon was asked to do a [...] "quick session". Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena picked out the outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; this outfit included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she runs her fingers through her hair, a pose that Abraham was noticeably bothered with. In 1998, the outfit <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore</b> for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
500|$|Newspaper records {{suggest that}} between 1916 and 1917, the Cornwall Victorias went unbeaten for 46 games; winning 45 and tying 1. During that period, they outscored their opponents 228–29, of which Lapensée scored 150, {{averaging}} {{more than three}} goals per game. Lapensée's ability and strength led to some odd occurrences in games she was involved in. In one, the Montreal Westerns played a 17-year old, Ada Lalonde, who was being touted as [...] "a hockey prodigy" [...] and a talent to rival Lapensée. Lalonde {{turned out to be}} a young man that Montreal's owner had convinced to take part to try and outshine Lapensée. In another game, the Westerners goaltender, a Miss Hardman, was so scared of Lapensée's powerful shot <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore</b> a baseball catcher's mask. Lapensée realised how much money the league was making for the arenas, and how significant her role was in her team's success, and she demanded a share of the profits. These claims, leaked to the press, led the Montreal Star to dub her a prima donna. The team owners refused, and Lapensée retired from the league in 1918.|$|E

500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore</b> during her first two episodes.|$|E
500|$|Joe Lynch of Fuse {{felt that}} the music video channeled the retro R vibe of the song and praised Beyoncé for [...] "looking like a {{gorgeous}} '70s disco diva". Phaneuf of the website HitFix reviewed the music video for the song positively by writing, [...] "'Blow' takes Beyonce back to the 80s heyday of big hair, booty shorts and roller discos. It's kitschy eye-candy, perfectly stylized". Bronwyn Barnes of Entertainment Weekly commented that Beyoncé was [...] "the center of attention in the video" [...] partly due to a neon tiger-print mink coat from Versace <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore.</b> Melissa Locker of Time magazine wrote that the singer managed to channel her inner rollergirl. Vanity Fairs Michelle Collins compared the video with the film Boogie Nights (1997) {{and went on to}} describe the scene where the singer dances on a car as a [...] "Cinemax After Dark". In 2014, Michael Cragg writing for The Guardian ranked the video in the ten best of Beyoncé's career. He deemed it a [...] "70s-referencing visual feast that looks like its [...] been shot through a filter called Strawberry Hubba Bubba". He also praised the singer's [...] "kitsch" [...] dance moves and concluded, the clip was [...] "retty standard".|$|E
500|$|Betty Cortina of People {{magazine}} said Selena's provocative {{choice of}} clothing was an acceptable emulation of Janet Jackson and Madonna, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>wore</b> [...] "sexy outfits that [...] {{a body of}} a Latina woman".

Selena wore outfits that accented her physical attributes and was not afraid to wear outfits she liked, despite criticism from parents who thought Selena's choice of outfits were inappropriate for young girls, who began emulating Selena. Her views on public image in the fashion industry were bothersome; she said she was opposed to the image that all woman should be [...] "rail-thin" [...] and the notion that they must wear certain outfits and be [...] "super-young to be beautiful".|$|E
