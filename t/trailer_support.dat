40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{extending}} our earlier {{work on the}} mathematical modelling of lashed trailer dynamics. The trailer can be placed anywhere on the vehicle deck(s) of a Ro/Ro ship. The paper begins with a discussion on the cargo-securing manual as applied to an existing ship. Thereafter we present the developed mathematical model where the excitation of the lashed trailer {{is provided by the}} combined roll and pitch motions, incited by steep waves encountering the ship from the side. The characteristics of the lashings, {{as well as those of}} the <b>trailer</b> <b>support</b> (trestle) and suspension systems are taken into account. Ship motions are simulated with a panel code and they are imported to the mathematical model of the lashed trailer, thus providing an integrated environment for the investigation of the cargo securing system on board a Ro/Ro ship. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the dynamic}} behaviour of lashed trailers placed at various locations on the vehicle deck(s) of a ferry is discussed. Excitations on the lashed trailers are produced by the combined roll and pitch motions, caused by steep waves encountered by the ship from various angles. Firstly, the typical requirements of the IMO's Cargo Securing Manual, as implemented for an existing ferry, are presented. Thereafter the mathematical model that has been developed {{for the needs of}} the present study is set out. The characteristics of the lashings, {{as well as of the}} <b>trailer</b> <b>support</b> (trestle) and suspension systems, are taken into account. Ship motions are simulated with a well-known panel code, and they are subsequently imported into the mathematical model of lashed trailers. This is a step towards an integrated 'performance-based' framework for the investigation of cargo safety on board that is ship and environment specific. © 2009 IMechE...|$|E

50|$|Long haul {{transport}} usually {{operates as}} B-doubles with two trailers (each with three axles), {{for a total}} of nine axles (including steering). In some lighter duty applications only one of the rear axles of the truck is driven, and the trailer may have only two axles. From July 2007, the Australian Federal and State Governments allowed the introduction of B-triple trucks on a specified network of roads. B-Triples are set up differently from conventional road trains. The front of their first <b>trailer</b> is <b>supported</b> by the turntable on the prime mover. The second and third <b>trailers</b> are <b>supported</b> by turntables on the trailers in front of them. As a result, B-Triples are much more stable than road trains and handle exceptionally well. True road trains only operate in remote areas, regulated by each state or territory government.|$|R

50|$|A 'fifth-wheel' is {{a travel}} <b>trailer</b> <b>supported</b> by a hitch {{in the center}} of the bed of a pickup truck instead of a hitch at the back of a vehicle. The special hitch used for fifth-wheels is a smaller version of the one used on 18-wheeler trucks and can be {{connected}} by simply driving the tow vehicle under the trailer. Fifth wheel trailers are popular with full-time recreational vehicle enthusiasts, who often live in them for several months in one place, using their pickup truck tow vehicle for local errands. A fifth wheel trailer tows more securely than a traditional travel trailer because the hitch weight sits directly over the pickup truck's rear tires. Since part of a fifth wheel sits over the bed of the pickup, it also reduces the overall length of the vehicle/trailer package while allowing the same room as a comparable length travel trailer. Additionally, the hitch's location in the pickup's bed reduces the risk of jackknifing and allows for more maneuverability when backing. Because of the greater room available on the roads in North America, these vehicles are more popular in the United States and Canada than in Europe or other parts of the world. For uneven terrain a gooseneck hitch is an option to fifth-wheel.|$|R

25|$|A {{proof of}} concept {{prototype}} was built with a 4.02inch (102mm) barrel, but otherwise was as intended. It was mostly automatic, and could be operated by a single person sitting in a covered control cabin on the right hand side of the vehicle. However, the enormous power and ammunition requirements for the piece resulted in it having to have two <b>trailers</b> in <b>support</b> - one for power, and one for ammunition - and a crew with a small crane in order to reload the two ammunition drums. With only 28 rounds available in the drums, and an 80-90 rounds/minute fire rate, reloading was a frequent task. It took a crew between ten and fifteen minutes to reload.|$|R
