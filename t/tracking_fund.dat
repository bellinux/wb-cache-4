5000|$|Malcolm, though, {{discovered}} that the tracker fund {{was not going to}} buy the PCC stock through the exchanges at all. It made a private off-exchange deal with PCC's founder Richard Li. This meant that, when the day of the expected fund purchases arrived and no purchases took place, there'd be a strong downward pressure on the stock price. Accordingly, on Malcolm's suggestion, Carney's hedge fund took a [...] "short" [...] position on $100 million of PCC stock. In the event, the <b>tracking</b> <b>fund</b> did not make the expected purchases, and the price dropped dramatically—Malcolm covered the short position, winning his firm more than twenty million dollars. This one deal made Malcolm a star, known to expat western traders throughout east Asia as their [...] "hot young gunslinger." ...|$|E

40|$|An Index <b>Tracking</b> <b>fund</b> is {{designed}} to achieve similar investment performance to a market index by holding a portfolio of stocks in which each is weighted with consideration of its corresponding index weight. An ideal index <b>tracking</b> <b>fund</b> is exposed solely market risk. An enhanced index <b>tracking</b> <b>fund</b> should maintain a similar level of risk exposure through {{a high level of}} diversification (investing over a sufficiently wide base of assets) with a higher return on investment. In the approach suggested here, technical and fundamental valuation models found using an evolutionary fuzzy system provide enhancement by recommending under or over weighting some stocks in an index tracking portfolio.

40|$|Quantitative fund {{management}} invariably involves portfolio performance being {{measured in}} terms of a quadratic objective function (due to the inclusion of variance terms as a measure of risk). Periodically, the constituents of the fund are adjusted to improve performance. This adjustment incurs a transaction cost which is a modulus function of the changes in holdings. Thus the fund manager wishes to minimise a combined quadratic and modulus function. This paper presents a new approach to deal with the minimisation of this hybrid function, using a well tried quadratic programming algorithm. The new algorithm is demonstrated using a tactical asset allocation problem and an equity index <b>tracking</b> <b>fund.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{a sample}} of 8 Asian {{countries}} to test whether the stock market volatility would be induced higher during national election periods. Our empirical findings show the country-specific component of variance in election periods can easily reach up to 43 % higher than the no election periods. It indicates that the investors are shocked with the election outcomes and investors’ sentiments {{are affected by the}} political events, no matter how well the preparation is made by investors. For further research on the magnitude of excessive volatility, the minority government can significantly enhance the degree of volatility while there is no political coalition hold {{more than half of the}} parliament seats. On the contrary, early election can reduce the level of volatility because early election can settle down the country-specific political strife and let the eligible voters choose the most suitable political coalition to manage the country. The investors who choose to invest in a country that is facing election event, the compensation for taking additional risk in the political event is negligible and the modest return may only suitable for those risk lover. Our results show the important implications for the index <b>tracking</b> <b>fund</b> and hedge fund managers that need to beware the volatility risk during political events...|$|E

In addition, in a merger, the non-surviving firm would be removed from all the indices. Index <b>tracking</b> <b>funds</b> would then have to sell the shares of the surviving company.

Although most organizations could identify their relationships with other key CIP entities, relationships among all organizations performing similar activities were not consistently established. Most of the organizations in GAO's review do not receive appropriations specifically designated for cyber CIP and, therefore, do not <b>track</b> these <b>funds.</b> A complicating factor in <b>tracking</b> <b>funds</b> spent on cyber CIP activities is that organizational totals often include funds spent on physical, cyber, and agency-specific CIP spending. ...|$|R
