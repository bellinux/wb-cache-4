25|$|Average load factor, {{in transit}} systems, is {{the ratio of}} the total number of riders to the total {{theoretical}} capacity. A <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> running at full capacity has a 100% load factor, while an empty vehicle has 0% load factor. If a <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> spends half the time running at 100% and half the time running at 0%, the average load factor is 50%. Higher average load factor corresponds to lower energy consumption per passenger, so designers attempt to maximize this metric.|$|E

500|$|Metrorail uses 136 heavy-rail cars {{built by}} the Budd Company under the name [...] "Transit America"; they are {{identical}} to those used on the Baltimore Metro Subway (save for the modifications made to Baltimore's cars during their refurbishment in 2005), as the two systems were built at the same time, and the two agencies were able to save money by sharing a single order. The Batimore-Miami order was among the last orders Budd filled before shuttering its railcar manufacturing business. They were marketed as the Universal <b>Transit</b> <b>Vehicle.</b>|$|E

50|$|Low-floor <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> (buses, streetcars, {{light rail}} cars) - fitted with rampsor bridge plates rather than lifts - later began {{to become more}} common than lifts for {{heavy-duty}} <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles,</b> while lifts continued {{to be used in}} paratransit vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Wheeled {{mobility}} {{devices have}} been accessing public <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> for decades, and most new rail transit systems are accessible. This has increased ridership {{by people with}} disabilities. Side-facing orientation on rail <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> often is considered an option to increase capacity for wheeled mobility devices. This paper reports findings of a study of vehicle dynamics and wheeled mobility device orientation on rail <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The study used acceleration data and field observations to evaluate wheeled mobility devices in longitudinal and side-facing orientations on streetcar and light rail vehicles. Results from the study include recommendations for longitudinal-oriented areas for wheeled mobility devices as well as additional public outreach on best practices for passengers who use wheeled mobility devices on rail <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Citizens Area Transit (now RTC Transit) of Las Vegas had {{its first}} 50 Enviro500s enter service by October 2005. The service, marketed as [...] "The Deuce", {{runs along the}} Las Vegas Strip. Certain {{high-traffic}} routes, such as along Maryland Parkway and Nellis Boulevard, have also used these buses. They offer extra ventilation grilles outside the engine compartment to cope with Southern Nevada's dry desert climate and high summertime temperatures. Las Vegas's Enviro500s have the largest air conditioning system ever created for a <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle,</b> with eight fans fitted on the air conditioning unit. As of October 2006, CAT had firm orders for another 41 [...] of the type worth $29.8 million; these were delivered in late 2007. A further 40 had also been ordered for delivery in 2008; these were 12.8 meters long and had a second staircase to speed loading and unloading. All these vehicles were used for regular fixed-route operations, not for sightseeing operations.|$|E
50|$|The {{advertising}} on the <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> exterior is produced {{from a high}} resolution vinyl which can be visible from distance by pedestrians. <b>Transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> exterior advertising includes advertisements on the entire <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> body {{as well as on}} panels on the sides and back of the <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The vinyl displays are able to withstand the rigors of cleaning and all types of weather, and they can also be removed without harming the paint on the <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{through the use of a}} special adhesive.|$|E
50|$|While major <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> shelters are {{traditional}} shelters, there are increasingly modern <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> shelters constructed of lightweight stainless steel providing comfort to waiting passengers and also an advertising medium to advertisers. <b>Transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> shelter panels mostly have two sides, {{both of which}} can display advertisements. The back of the panels is illuminated to highlight the advertisements and to reach both the vehicular and the pedestrian audiences. Advertisements for display in <b>transit</b> <b>vehicle</b> shelters consist of posters supplied by the advertiser.|$|E
2500|$|Section 7-705 of the Maryland Transportation article (Annotated Code of Maryland) enumerates {{a list of}} acts {{specifically}} prohibited {{on public}} <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles,</b> with penalties of fines and possible jail terms for violations. In addition to the enumerated rules of behavior, Section 7-705 also allows the MTA to enforce local government laws on public <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Many of these rules are conspicuously posted on <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles,</b> bus stops and rail platforms. [...] However, they are rarely enforced, making many unpleasant trips for those who actually follow these rules.|$|R
30|$|Rapid <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{are used}} to rapidly {{transport}} passengers inside cities and rapid <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> are mainly classified according to the axle load. In over-crowded cities, heavy rapid <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> may have axle loads ranging between 15 – 17 tonnes at AW- 8 loading conditions (8 persons per square meter). The axle load also depends on the car body material, whether car body is made of aluminum or stainless steel. The trip time for rapid <b>transit</b> <b>vehicles</b> could take longer than an hour for large cities, and hence, passenger ride comfort is an important fact and it shall be considered during the design of suspension systems. Human body is most sensitive to accelerations in lateral direction; hence, lateral acceleration {{can be used as}} a good and simple indicator of passenger ride comfort in rail vehicles.|$|R
