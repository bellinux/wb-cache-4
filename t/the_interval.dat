5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens <b>the</b> <b>interval</b> in which the maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the maximum length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if <b>the</b> <b>interval</b> is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing <b>the</b> <b>interval,</b> it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E

5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, <b>the</b> <b>interval</b> between copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.|$|E
