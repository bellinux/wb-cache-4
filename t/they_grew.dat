The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust {{pectoral}} girdles than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other flapping theropods, implying that they may have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as <b>they</b> <b>grew.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burger King {{was founded}} in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King by Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle, Matthew Burns. Their first stores were centred around a piece of {{equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very effective at cooking burgers. It proved so successful that, as <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> through franchising, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.|$|E
5|$|All {{families}} {{had their own}} gardens in which <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> vegetables that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E

5|$|Angie's storylines mostly {{deal with}} her family—husband Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling) and son Danny Bolen (Beau Mirchoff)—and their {{attempts}} to escape their mysterious past, which is explored throughout the season. Although critics initially welcomed the character as a diverse addition to the cast, <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> frustrated with {{the slow pace of}} her storyline as the season progressed. Critics compared Angie to Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), a character whose lagging storyline was slow in developing during the series' second season.|$|E
5|$|Annette Nicholls, aged 29, {{a mother}} of one from Ipswich, was {{initially}} thought to have gone missing on 4 December, but at the trial it was revealed she was last seen in Ipswich town centre on 8 December. Her family reported her missing after <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> concerned at {{the news of the}} other murders. Nicholls' body was found on 12 December near Levington, naked but not sexually assaulted, and also posed in the cruciform position; a definite cause of death could not be established, but her breathing had been hampered.|$|E

He and his two younger sisters were raised in Springfield by their mother, a housewife, and their father, a {{custodian}} at MassMutual. Neal's maternal grandparents were from Northern Ireland and his paternal grandparents were from Ireland. Neal's mother {{died of a heart}} attack when he was 13, and he was attending Springfield Technical High School when his father, an alcoholic, died. Neal and his two younger sisters moved in with their grandmother and later their aunt, forced to rely on Social Security checks as <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> up.|$|E
5|$|The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 safeguarded {{the rights}} of labour tenants living on farms where <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> crops or grazed livestock. This {{legislation}} ensured that such tenants could not be evicted without a court order or if they were {{over the age of}} 65. Recognising that arms manufacturing was a key industry for the South African economy, Mandela endorsed the trade in weapons but brought in tighter regulations surrounding Armscor to ensure that South African weaponry was not sold to authoritarian regimes. Under Mandela's administration, tourism was increasingly promoted, becoming a major sector of the South African economy.|$|E
5|$|The dinner {{scene was}} shot in a revamped version of the Enterprise-D's {{observation}} lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard), and an unnamed Andorian ambassador. The food prepared for the scene was colored blue so it would look alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> ripe under hot studio lights), {{and it became a}} running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte was a {{favourite}} of her paternal grandparents, {{whom she}} frequently saw. King Wilhelm and Queen Augusta spoiled their granddaughter and encouraged her {{rebellion against the}} Crown Prince and Princess, and Charlotte and her brother frequently took their side in disputes with her parents. This rebellion was encouraged by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who held political disagreements with the liberal Crown Prince and Princess. Charlotte also enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} her eldest brother, though <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> apart after his marriage in 1881 to Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein ("Dona"), a princess described by Charlotte as plain, slow-witted, and shy. Charlotte's relationship with Wilhelm would remain troubled as a result.|$|E
5|$|Ernest's {{position}} was often linked {{to his brother}} Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. The two boys were raised as though twins, and became closer upon the separation and divorce of their parents, {{as well as the}} eventual death of their mother. The princes' relationship experienced phases of closeness as well as minor arguments as <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> older; after Albert's death in 1861, Ernest became gradually more antagonistic to Victoria and her children, as well as increasingly bitter toward the United Kingdom, publishing anonymous pamphlets against various members of the British royal family. Despite their increasingly differing political views and opinions however, Ernest accepted his second eldest nephew Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as his heir-presumptive. Upon Ernest's death on 22 August 1893 at Reinhardsbrunn, Alfred succeeded to the ducal throne.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{guided the}} party into the Mohave Canyon, {{indicating}} {{the location of}} rapids and advising the Explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached {{the entrance to the}} Black Canyon of the Colorado, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the boiler, and damaging the wheelhouse. Using their skiff, the crew towed the Explorer to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes.|$|E

His father was a {{department}} chair at the University of Minnesota and his mother worked for Minneapolis public schools. Taborn's older brother, John Gregory, became a careers counselor. <b>They</b> <b>grew</b> up in Golden Valley, Minnesota, where Craig Taborn attended Breck School. His parents gave him a Moog synthesizer as a present when he was 12, which was also around {{the time when he}} started playing piano. He received basic instruction initially from his father, who played by ear. Taborn borrowed records from a public library and listened to public radio, discovering music from the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and Sun Ra, among others. As a youth he also listened to heavy metal and contemporary classical music, and identified commonalities among these disparate forms of music.|$|E

5|$|The Cormier {{brothers}} were {{the sons of}} Edmond Cormier and Bernadette Doucette. <b>They</b> <b>grew</b> {{up on a farm}} in what is now Memramcook, New Brunswick. Four of the brothers had long careers as professional wrestlers, while a fifth, Malcolm Cormier, competed briefly before becoming a referee. None of the brothers wrestled under the family surname, however, as they all adopted ring names. One of the brothers explained that the brothers' real names were too hard to pronounce, so they adopted other names that were easier for international fans. Yvon Cormier was given the name The Beast, Jean-Louis was known as Rudy Kay, Leonce took the name Leo Burke, and Romeo competed as Bobby Kay. Malcolm, the oldest of the brothers involved in wrestling, used the name Mel Turnbow while working as a referee.|$|E

5|$|The {{world of}} comic strips saw {{a number of}} works pop up. Ben Wicks was doing The Outsiders and Wicks, Jim Unger's Herman debuted in 1975, and Ted Martin's Pavlov in 1979. In 1978, Lynn Johnston, living in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, began For Better or For Worse, which was noted for {{following}} {{the lives of the}} Patterson family as <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> older in real time, and dealt with real-life issues. The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, as well as social issues such as the midlife crisis, divorce, the coming out of a gay character, child abuse, and death. In 1985, she became the first female cartoonist to win a Reuben Award, and the Friends of Lulu added her to the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 2002.
