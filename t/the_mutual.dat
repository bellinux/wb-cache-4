5|$|Gliese 876 has {{a notable}} orbital arrangement. It {{is the first}} {{planetary}} system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> inclination of the planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions).

5|$|Also in 1947, Chandler {{sold the}} rights to {{broadcast}} the World Series on the radio for $475,000; he used {{the money from the}} contract to establish a pension fund for baseball players.

Proceeds from the $4,370,000 deal went directly into the pension fund. The same two companies negotiated a six-year, $6million contract to broadcast the Series on television in 1950.

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Mutuals</b> {{transferred}} {{their team}} to the National League in 1876, Phelps played in one game for them, playing in center field, {{and then he was}} loaned to the Philadelphia Athletics in a game against <b>the</b> <b>Mutuals</b> on August 10, playing catcher when they were short a player.

5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> exclusivity constraint.|$|E

5|$|Maximilian of Habsburg, who {{had also}} laid claim to Hungary after Matthias Corvinus's death, invaded Hungary in November.

Ernuszt entered into negotiations with Reinprecht von Reichenburg, the commanders of Maximilian's army in Hungary, but refrained from providing military assistance to him against Vladislaus' troops.

5|$|Preliminary astrometric {{measurements}} {{suggest the}} orbit of Upsilon Andromedae d may be inclined at 155.5° to {{the plane of the}} sky.

The true inclination of Upsilon Andromedae d was determined as 23.8° after combined results were measured from the Hubble Space Telescope and radial velocity measurements.|$|E
5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E
5|$|The half-lives of {{mendelevium}} isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 245Md onwards, {{reaching a}} maximum at 258Md.
