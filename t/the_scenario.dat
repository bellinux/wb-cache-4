5|$|After {{the release}} of Little Busters! Ecstasy in 2008, Key decided to produce a {{spin-off}} of that game which focused on the heroine Kudryavka Noumi. The project's planning was headed by Kai, who returned to Key after he last contributed to <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> of Clannad released in 2004. Chika Shirokiri returned after his work on Little Busters!, in which he wrote <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> for Kudryavka. The artists Na-Ga and Itaru Hinoue were the art directors and character designers, both of whom previously worked on Little Busters! for Key. Jun'ichi Shimizu composed the game's music and was supervised by Jun Maeda.|$|E
5|$|Leo Kashida {{worked as}} an {{outsourced}} writer with Key on Tomoyo After, Little Busters! and Angel Beats. Chika Shirokiri, another outsourced writer who worked with Key on Little Busters!, also wrote <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> for Kud Wafter. Manack and members of PMMK composed music in Little Busters!, and members of MintJam helped with arrangement. Magome Togoshi had been with Key since before Kanons release, working {{as one of the}} signature composers, but left the brand in October 2006 after contributing to the soundtrack of Little Busters!. Jun'ichi Shimizu composed all the music in Kud Wafter. Two outsourced writers worked on <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> for Rewrite and its fan disc Rewrite Harvest festa!: Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, and Romeo Tanaka. Rewrite and Harvest festa! also featured three outsourced musical composers: Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki. Mizutsuki later returned to compose music for Harmonia. At the time Maeda stepped down as the main scenario writer, Yūto Tonokawa joined Key and first worked on <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> in Little Busters!. Tonokawa later contributed to <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> in Rewrite and Harvest festa!, but resigned from Key in 2015. Itaru Hinoue, one of Key's founding members, was Key's main artist and was the sole art director and character designer for six of Key's games. Hinoue resigned from Key in September 2016 after working on Harmonia.|$|E
5|$|The June 1911 {{issue of}} The Motion Picture Story Magazine {{included}} an adapted story written by John Eldridge Chandos from <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> written by Wilbert Melville.|$|E
30|$|Note that <b>the</b> <b>Scenarios</b> 1  ~  6 {{only give}} an example of <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> in (5). <b>The</b> {{determination}} of <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> {{should be based on}} the actual requirements.|$|R
50|$|There are six <b>scenarios,</b> <b>the</b> {{first five}} {{of which are}} {{individual}} battles. In <b>the</b> first <b>scenario</b> (which is also <b>the</b> tutorial <b>scenario),</b> <b>the</b> player leads the 9th Infantry Division {{in its attempt to}} clean out all German resistance behind American lines. In <b>the</b> second <b>scenario,</b> <b>the</b> 101st Airborne must take Carentan within three days. In <b>the</b> third <b>scenario,</b> <b>the</b> player faces an SS Panzergrenadier Division counterattack attempting to recapture Carentan. In <b>the</b> fourth <b>scenario,</b> <b>the</b> player assaults Cherbourg using four divisions, and in <b>the</b> fifth <b>scenario</b> <b>the</b> player attempts to permanently isolate Cherbourg. <b>The</b> sixth <b>scenario</b> is a total campaign game which will require hours of play to finish.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> use of <b>scenarios</b> was audited by Arie de Geus's team in {{the early}} 1980s and {{they found that the}} {{decision-making}} processes following <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> were <b>the</b> primary cause of the lack of strategic implementation [...] ), rather than <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> themselves. Many practitioners today spend as much time on the decision-making process as on creating <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> themselves.|$|R
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Defense of the Ancients increased over time. <b>The</b> <b>scenario</b> was featured by Computer Gaming World {{in a review}} of new maps and mods in Warcraft III. DotA Allstars became an important tournament scenario, starting with its prominence at the debut of Blizzard's BlizzCon convention in 2005. DotA Allstars was also featured in the Malaysia and Singapore World Cyber Games starting in 2005, and the World Cyber Games Asian Championships beginning with the 2006 season. Defense of the Ancients was included in the game lineup for the internationally recognized Cyberathlete Amateur League and CyberEvolution leagues. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> appeared in Electronic Sports World Cup (ESWC) 2008; Oliver Paradis, ESWC's competition manager, noted that the high level of community support behind <b>the</b> <b>scenario,</b> as well as its worldwide appeal, were among the reasons it was chosen.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenario</b> {{consists}} of spin-off stories which expand on Rewrites story, the harvest festival from Rewrites story is expanded on in Harvest festa!, and minigames are included {{during the course}} of gameplay, as in Rewrite. The size of <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> in Harvest festa! is roughly comparable in size to Tomoyo After. The fan disc also features official character art of Inoue, a supporting character who was not illustrated in Rewrite. Unlike Rewrite, Kotarou is fully voiced in the fan disc. The five system sound themes included with the Rewrite laptops were released with the fan disc, with the addition of dialogue of Kagari by Kana Hanazawa.|$|E
5|$|The third {{mission was}} begun in 1998. It was a {{search and rescue}} mission {{requiring}} fully autonomous robots to take off, fly to a disaster area and search for survivors and the dead amid raging fires, broken water mains, clouds of toxic gas, and rubble from destroyed buildings. <b>The</b> <b>scenario</b> was recreated at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility where the above hazards could be recreated. Because of the realism of <b>the</b> <b>scenario,</b> animatrons were used instead of human actors to simulate survivors incapable of extracting themselves from the disaster area.|$|E
30|$|The overall {{observation}} from <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> {{developed with}} USA as a TPP member shows a higher output growth {{for most of}} the sectors compared to <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> without USA. Further, most of <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> result in more output growth in the agri-food sector, industrial products, metals and minerals and services sectors.|$|R
40|$|The article shows four <b>scenarios</b> for <b>the</b> {{development}} of ITS communications technologies in Poland {{for the years}} 2007 - 2013. Global Business Network methodology is used to make up <b>the</b> <b>scenarios.</b> <b>The</b> basic dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> are (a) type of sectors in the national economy (public vs. private), (b) type of communications technology (wireline vs. wireless). <b>The</b> <b>scenarios</b> present possible futures...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenarios</b> for <b>the</b> game {{were used}} to {{recreate}} the battles described in the novel in a realistic way. The game is broken down into seven different <b>scenarios,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> are designed so that the game rules are introduced a few at a time as <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> progress (but can then all be played using the full set of rules).|$|R
5|$|According to Gygax, both <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> {{that became}} Expedition to the Barrier Peaks and Metamorphosis Alpha were {{successful}} at the convention. Although Metamorphosis Alpha became {{available to the}} general public in mid-1976, only a few copies of the Expedition to the Barrier Peaks tournament adventure survived after the convention.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of development, Soma Bringer {{was to be a}} standard role-playing game. During early testing, it was seen that typical role-playing games were not well suited to the DS' limited hardware and controls, so they adjusted the gameplay to its current form as an action role-playing game. After positive feedback from this, the team went ahead. The move to being an action role-playing game enabled the incorporation of cooperative multiplayer: the team wanted to focus as much as possible on the combat and related gimmicks over environmental puzzles. Rather than a separate mode, multiplayer was incorporated into the main story. The development cycle differed greatly from previous Monolith Soft titles. In Takahashi's earlier games, <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> was written first then the gameplay was tailored to fit. For Soma Bringer, the gameplay was finalized first, and <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> was built around the locations, dungeons, and mechanics the team had created. Also in contrast to earlier Monolith Soft titles was the lack of lengthy cutscenes, which could not be incorporated into the game with the DS' limited hardware. Instead, the team used the real-time graphics and gameplay models for equivalent scenes.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5000|$|Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, called <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> in <b>the</b> {{first volume}} [...] "run-of-the-mill", {{but said that}} <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> in <b>the</b> second [...] "tend to be more inspired".|$|R
40|$|Scenarios {{have become}} an {{important}} concept for understanding and specifying the required behaviors for a system and its components. To gain confidence for the correctness of the implementation, software developers must compare <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> identified during requirements analysis and software design with the behaviors observed during execution. This paper presents an execution monitoring framework that facilitates such a comparison. The framework allows the software developers to specify, in scenario implementation models, how <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> {{are expected to be}} implemented and used in the program. Enhanced with statements that check properties of <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> or visualize <b>the</b> progress of <b>the</b> <b>scenarios,</b> these models can be used to check at runtime whether <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> have been implemented and used correctly. Our initial case study indicates that the framework can be useful for uncovering bugs. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> various <b>scenarios</b> require from 2 to 6 players, with <b>the</b> two-player <b>scenarios</b> only {{using one}} of <b>the</b> maps. Each <b>scenario</b> lists <b>the</b> initial set-up, any special rules, and the victory conditions. <b>The</b> <b>scenarios</b> attempt to replay the {{situations}} described in the war history.|$|R
5|$|Development of Xenosaga Episode III began while {{work was}} {{finishing}} on Episode II. While the team {{were open to}} further entries based on the game's commercial performance, {{it was designed to}} be the last entry in the series. Arai and Yonesaka returned respectively as director and scriptwriter. Takahashi provided <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> draft and supervised the writing. Episode III released in 2006 in Japan and North America. Episode III was the last game released in the Xenosaga series.|$|E
5|$|DotA {{offers a}} variety of game modes, {{selected}} by the game host {{at the beginning of the}} match. The game modes dictate the difficulty of <b>the</b> <b>scenario,</b> as well as whether players can choose their hero or are assigned one randomly. Many game modes can be combined, allowing more flexible options.|$|E
5|$|Each human player {{controls}} one hero, {{a powerful}} unit with unique abilities. In DotA, players {{on each side}} choose one of 112 heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes. <b>The</b> <b>scenario</b> is highly team-oriented; {{it is difficult for}} one player to carry the team to victory alone. DotA allows up to ten players in a five-versus-five format.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} three Population and Labour Force <b>Scenarios</b> for <b>the</b> {{countries of}} the European Union. <b>The</b> <b>scenarios</b> project <b>the</b> population and the labour force by age and sex, both at the national and regional level (NUTS II classification). <b>The</b> na-tional <b>scenarios</b> cover <b>the</b> period 1995 - 2050, <b>the</b> regional <b>scenarios</b> <b>the</b> period 1995 - 2025. <b>The</b> <b>scenarios</b> are based on {{an analysis of the}} determinants of popula-tion growth and labour force participation. <b>The</b> Baseline <b>scenario</b> aims to project the most likely development while the Low and High scenarios describe alternative de-velopments in different economic and cultural contexts. 1...|$|R

30|$|In a next step, <b>the</b> raw <b>scenarios</b> {{identified}} are aggregated to {{a manageable}} number of scenarios {{by means of}} a cluster analysis. The cluster analysis provides the scenario-DNA {{in the form of a}} table that shows the percentage distribution of <b>the</b> characteristics per <b>scenario</b> for a better interpretation and communication of <b>the</b> <b>scenarios.</b> <b>The</b> scenario-DNA includes today’s situation in addition to <b>the</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Graphic visualizations of <b>the</b> future <b>scenarios</b> are also created. This includes multidimensional scaling (MDS) or pictures of the future.|$|R
5|$|For work on <b>the</b> <b>scenario,</b> Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} {{some of the}} game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new scenario writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the scenarios for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the scenarios for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, {{it was reported that}} the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this {{does not take into account}} the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Northern Ballet premiered {{a version}} of The Great Gatsby at Leeds Grand Theatre in the UK, with choreography and {{direction}} by David Nixon, a musical score by Richard Rodney Bennett, and set designs by Jerome Kaplan. Nixon also created <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> and costumes designs.|$|E
5|$|Key's fifth game, , was {{released}} in 2005 as an adult game and spin-off from Clannad; it expanded on <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> of the heroine Tomoyo Sakagami. Key released their sixth visual novel, Little Busters!, in 2007 with a rating for all ages. Key's seventh title, Little Busters! Ecstasy, was an expanded, adult version of Little Busters! released in 2008. Key's eighth game, Kud Wafter, {{was released}} in 2010 as an adult game and spin-off from Little Busters! Ecstasy; it expanded on <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> of the heroine Kudryavka Noumi. Key released their ninth game Rewrite in 2011 with a rating for all ages. Key released a fan disc of Rewrite titled Rewrite Harvest festa! in 2012. The first volume in the episodic Angel Beats! visual novel {{was released in}} 2015. Key released the kinetic novel Harmonia in 2016. Key has announced the visual novel Summer Pockets.|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo DS {{version was}} {{directed}} by Hironori Ishigami and planned and supervised by Tomie, while Hiroyoshi Umetani was the main planner and in charge of game balance, Shin-ichiro Tomie created <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> and events, Tanaka worked on the presentation and assisted with <b>the</b> <b>scenario,</b> and Masayasu Yamamoto programmed the dungeons. In addition to Sugiyama, the Nintendo DS version's music was worked on by Hayato Matsuo. The idea of developing a Nintendo DS version started when Chunsoft was considering creating a series of Mystery Dungeon games for the Nintendo DS. Previous Mystery Dungeon titles came up in conversation: they considered doing something with the Game Boy games, but decided against it {{as it would have}} required them to redraw all the art, leaving them to decide between working on the Super Famicom or the Nintendo 64 titles; they eventually settled on working on the Super Famicom title Shiren the Wanderer.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of user-made scenarios or series of scenarios (campaigns) {{for the game}} was made possible using <b>the</b> <b>Scenario</b> Builder. This tool is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games, but it has fewer capabilities as a result. Ensemble Studios used <b>the</b> <b>Scenario</b> Builder to make the single-player campaigns which shipped with the retail game. Various unofficial sites exist where custom scenarios can be submitted and downloaded. In late 2005, {{it was discovered that}} by modifying various data files, units present in the beta versions of the game could be made available in the editor. Some obscure units include a spaceship and a hero that changes ownership when units move near it. Through data editing, the rules of unit placement can also be modified. This allows units to be placed on any terrain and on top of other units, which creates new possibilities for design. Other significant discoveries include new terrain templates, a mode to triple each unit's hitpoints and a tool to edit map sizes.|$|E
