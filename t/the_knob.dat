5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> to the right and the other with <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} sounds are produced using dampening techniques. The desired effect is produced after striking <b>the</b> <b>knob,</b> by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it. When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it {{at an angle}} and dampens its surface using their hands.|$|E
5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} while {{standing beside the}} instrument, holding the upper edge of its flange between the thumb and other fingers with the left hand while striking <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks about half a foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. Using these balus, players handle the agung {{similar to the way}} a brass tom-tom is played.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{the metal}} {{used for the}} gandingan was bronze but due to its {{scarcity}} after WWII, gandingan are more commonly made of less valuable metals such as steel sheets. Recently, galvanized steel sheets {{have been used by}} Maguindanaon instrument manufacturers where different parts of the gong (<b>the</b> <b>knob,</b> body and rim) would be made from separate sheets and welded together, then ground out to produce a finished product. Comparatively, these newer gongs have a higher pitch and are smaller in size than those made in older times.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} {{is one of}} the most common species of birds {{represented}} in the Maya codices. Its glyph is easily distinguishable by <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> on the bird's beak and by the concentric circles that make up the bird's eyes. Sometimes the bird is portrayed as a god with a human body and a bird head. According to Maya mythology, this god often carried messages between humans and the other gods. It may also be used to represent Cozcacuauhtli, the thirteenth day of the month in the Aztec calendar (13 Reed). An ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata) was also considered to be the bird depicted, but the hooked bill and wattle point to the raptor.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Newton {{brothers}} {{suggested that}} the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by inbreeding. This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to inbreeding, {{it would also be}} present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead {{suggested that the}} wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form <b>the</b> <b>knob.</b> This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{skeletal}} features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from pigeons {{have been attributed}} to their flightlessness. The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic, meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, meaning that they changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded skull roof, and smaller orbits. The dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> present on the solitaire's wrists.|$|E
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We study <b>the</b> {{parameters}} (<b>knobs)</b> of distributionbased {{anomaly detection}} methods, {{and how their}} tuning affects the quality of detection. Specifically, we analyze the popular entropy-based anomaly detection in detecting covert channels in Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic. There has been little effort in prior research to rigorously analyze how <b>the</b> <b>knobs</b> of anomaly detection methodology should be tuned. Such analysis is, however, critical before such methods can be deployed by a practitioner. We develop a probabilistic model to explain {{the effects of the}} tuning of <b>the</b> <b>knobs</b> on <b>the</b> rate of false positives and false negatives. We then study the observations produced by our model analytically as well as empirically. We examine <b>the</b> <b>knobs</b> of window length and detection threshold. Our results show how <b>the</b> <b>knobs</b> should be set for achieving high rate of detection, while maintaining a low rate of false positives. We also show how the throughput of the covert channel (the magnitude of the anomaly) affects the rate of detection, thereby allowing a practitioner {{to be aware of the}} capabilities of the methodology.

25|$|Ef. surinamensis are {{characterized}} by their long tongue and yellow hindtibial posterior fringe. The forehead and thorax are black with a colorful, metallic face; the labrum is also rounded. One can distinguish between the two sexes {{by looking at the}} ridges on the clypeus. Males have three, while females only have one. Also, a female's clypeus is not depressed at the tentorial pits. Males are approximately 16–19mm in length, with a tongue of about 13–14mm long. Ef. surinamensis can be distinguished from other Euglossine species by <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> above their hindtibial spurs and by the darkened medial cell in their wings.|$|E

25|$|The PfEMP1 {{molecule}} is deposited at the RBC membrane at the knobs. These knobs {{are easily}} identified as conspicuous bumps on the infected RBCs {{from the early}} trophozoite stage onward. The malarial parasite cannot induce its virulence on RBCs without knobs. As many as 10,000 knobs are distributed throughout {{the surface of a}} mature infected RBC, and each knob is 50-80nm in diameter. The export of pfEMP1 from Maurer's cleft to RBC membrane is mediated by binding of another protein produced by the parasite called knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP). KAHRP enhances the structural rigidity of infected RBC and adhesion of PfEMP1 on the knobs. It is also directly responsible for forming knobs, as indicated by the fact that kahrp gene-deficient malarial parasites do not form knobs. To form a knob, KAHRP aggregates several membrane skeletal proteins of the host RBC, such as spectrin, actin, ankyrin R, and spectrin–actin band 4.1 complex. Upon arrival at <b>the</b> <b>knob,</b> PfEMP1 is attached to the spectrin network using the PHIST proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{adults are}} black with a silvery-gray coat on the thorax and abdomen. They are 6 to 7mm long, with clear wings and {{yellowish}} calypters. <b>The</b> <b>knob</b> of the haltere is yellow while the stalk is brownish yellow. The dorsal abdomen has a dark median stripe {{that produces a}} series of triangular markings with the segmentally arranged transverse bands. The thorax of the adult has three longitudinal stripes. They are darker than F. canicularis. The tibia on the mesothoraic leg has a distinct process, and the coxae have two setae at the apex. The fourth vein on the wing of this species is straight, as compared to it being curved in the house fly. There is a great variance between the sexes of this species, and more {{is known about the}} male. For instance; their mid femur does not have blunt spines, the ventral tubercle of the mid tibia is indistinct, and the abdomen has no spots or stripes and is short and broad.|$|E
25|$|Entry {{of adenoviruses}} into the host cell {{involves}} {{two sets of}} interactions between the virus and the host cell. Most of the action occurs at the vertices. Entry into the host cell is initiated by <b>the</b> <b>knob</b> domain of the fiber protein binding to the cell receptor. The two currently established receptors are: CD46 for the group B human adenovirus serotypes and the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) for all other serotypes. There are some reports suggesting MHC molecules and sialic acid residues functioning in this capacity as well. This {{is followed by a}} secondary interaction, where a motif in the penton base protein interacts with an integrin molecule. It is the co-receptor interaction that stimulates entry of the adenovirus. This co-receptor molecule is αv integrin. Binding to αv integrin results in endocytosis of the virus particle via clathrin-coated pits. Attachment to αv integrin stimulates cell signaling and thus induces actin polymerization resulting in entry of the virion into the host cell within an endosome.|$|E
