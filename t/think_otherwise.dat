5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows everything, and must <b>think</b> <b>otherwise</b> to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E
25|$|Cynthia Muldoon – Apparent {{widow of}} Lord Albert Muldoon who {{disappeared}} ten years ago. She {{claims to be}} very upset about her husband's disappearance, but the audience is led to <b>think</b> <b>otherwise.</b> Sophisticated and beautiful. She has {{had an affair with}} Simon.|$|E
25|$|One common {{misconception}} of BDSM and kink is {{that women}} are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might <b>think</b> <b>otherwise</b> lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.|$|E

Dimi of Nehardea, Rav Zevid of Nehardea, and Amemar. In many Talmud citations, there is a mention of Nehardea's academy methods, however Amemar states that {{despite the fact that}} he is a Nehardean, he <b>thinks</b> <b>otherwise.</b> It is unclear whether he meant that Nehardea's academy <b>thinks</b> <b>otherwise</b> and not as what is known to be the methods, or was he an independent in his thinking.|$|R

25|$|In Shusterman’s and, also, Dewey's opinion, {{the eastern}} {{meditation}} practices repair perception for understanding {{our dependence on}} the society’s moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, Wilfrid Sellars’s critique of {{the myth of the}} given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to <b>think</b> <b>otherwise</b> would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the fact that we can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation {{has been one of the}} reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.|$|E
2500|$|Villapiano {{has also}} stated that he was {{illegally}} blocked by Steelers tight end John McMakin as he was pursuing Harris following the reception, {{and he would have}} tackled Harris without it. Raiders coach Madden echoed this complaint; McMakin, who calls his contribution the [...] "Magnificent Obstruction", insists the block was perfectly legal, and is [...] "puzzled" [...] that the Raiders would <b>think</b> <b>otherwise.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Constitution {{does not}} require that [...] "special" [...] antidiscrimination rights, once extended, irrevocably vest via some magic and antidemocratic one-way ratchet. [...] And if Denver, Aspen, and Boulder can repeal these ordinances, presumably the Colorado {{legislature}} can repeal them by statute; and so too the people of Colorado can repeal them by state constitutional amendment (via initiative or referendum). To <b>think</b> <b>otherwise</b> is terminally silly.|$|E

2500|$|Powers {{expressed}} scathing {{criticism of}} the lack of rigour of the Hutton inquiry, and asserted that the officially stated cause of death was highly implausible. The Independent on Sunday [...] published a [...] "head-to-head" [...] exchange of letters between two journalists: Miles Goslett, who argued that (as with all sudden or violent deaths) a proper inquest should be held; and John Rentoul, who was convinced that the death was a suicide and that to <b>think</b> <b>otherwise</b> was a [...] "ridiculous and tasteless fairy story" [...] conjured up by conspiracy theorists.|$|E
2500|$|Shusterman’s {{account of}} {{interpretation}} is constructed {{in opposition to}} both analytic aesthetics and deconstruction, which are often said to constitute the two opposite poles of contemporary interpretive theory. As he claims, both of them share “a picture of understanding as the recapturing or reproducing of a particular [...] meaning-object”, yet they differ as to whether such act is possible. Deconstructionists, assuming their protean vision of language as “systematic play of differences”, claim it is not, and hence deem every reading a “misreading”, while analytic aestheticians <b>think</b> <b>otherwise,</b> usually construing the objective work-meaning as “metaphysically fixed in the artwork” and identifying it {{with the intention of}} the artist or “semantic features of the work itself”.|$|E
2500|$|The first book, Regeneration deals {{primarily}} with Rivers's treatment of Sassoon at Craiglockhart. In the novel we {{are introduced to}} Rivers as a doctor for whom healing patients comes at price. The dilemmas faced by Rivers are brought to the fore and the strain leads him to become ill; on sick leave he visits his brother and the Heads and we learn more about his relationships outside of hospital life. We are also introduced {{in the course of}} the novel to the Canadian doctor Lewis Yealland, another factual figure who used electric shock treatment to [...] "cure" [...] his patients. The juxtaposition of the two very different doctors highlights the unique, or at least unconventional, nature of Rivers's methods and the humane way in which he treated his patients (even though Yealland's words, and his own guilt and modesty lead him to <b>think</b> <b>otherwise).</b>|$|E

50|$|Many {{were shocked}} on December 2, 2008, {{to hear from}} the news that former 1970s singing star Didith Reyes died. The reports said she had a heart attack. Her only son, Arvey, <b>thinks</b> <b>otherwise.</b> He {{believes}} that the alleged constant beating her mother experienced from her live-in partner Eulogio Disongla may have caused her death.|$|R
2500|$|In 2003 when then University of South Florida {{professor}} Sami Al-Arian {{was indicted}} on terrorism-related charges ADC issued {{a press release}} stating that a “pattern of profiling and targeting the community is of deep concern to ADC {{and we will continue}} to monitor the situation.” Speaking on CNN, then- communications director Hussein Ibish stated: [...] "Until we have some reason based in fact to <b>think</b> <b>otherwise,</b> I think that the presumption has to be that this is a political witch-hunt, a vendetta, and a kind of very, very ugly post-9/11 McCarthyism." [...] In December, 2005, after Al-Arian was acquitted of eight charges, and the jury deadlocked on nine others, ADC stated that in the verdict was seen as a “major defeat” for some of the most controversial elements of the Patriot Act. [...] On March 2, 2006, Al-Arian entered a guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to help the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a [...] "specially designated terrorist" [...] organization. [...] He was sentenced to 57 months in prison, and ordered deported following his prison term.|$|E
2500|$|Fifty {{five percent}} (55%) of the {{respondents}} believe that [...] "Both husband and wife should work"; while 45% said it is wrong for both husband and the wife to work. Interestingly more than 50% of men including those from rural areas agree that both husband and wife should work for a better living. [...] When the respondents were asked whether [...] "Men are better politicians as compared to women or not"; 67% agree men are better politicians while 33% <b>think</b> <b>otherwise.</b> More women agree with this statement as compared to men. In response to the following statement [...] "If jobs are in shortage should men be given priority for employment"; 72% {{of the respondents}} believe they should be given priority while 28% disagree. Eighty three percent (83%) of the respondents think that [...] "To live a happy life women need children"; while only 17% think they do not. A vast majority of all respondents including 82% of women respondents believe that [...] "prosperous women should raise their voice to support the rights of poor women." ...|$|E
2500|$|One man lay wounded [...] "just {{under the}} parapet" [...] while a {{sergeant}} and two troopers {{managed to escape}} back to the infantry and light horse lines. All the riderless horses started grazing in between the two lines of combatants. [...] "Turks {{think this is a}} grand chance to collect some Australian remounts. We <b>think</b> <b>otherwise.</b> I organize a competition between the two right–hand guns (prize 50 piastres) to see who can knock off most Turks without hitting horses. The Turks don't get any remounts." [...] At 14:15, touch was established by the 11th Light Horse Regiment with the 4th Light Horse Brigade, when the situation was reported, and support from machine guns and artillery, was requested for the left flank. When the artillery start shelling the Ottoman rearguard position, they also [...] "make it unpleasant for the wounded Australian ... and he makes a run for it. Turks get him with m.g. fire when is about halfway back to our lines. Padre and another fellow dash out to bring him in but are shot down." [...] "Padre Dunbar ... and the stretcher bearer made a run for it. They reached the trooper and raised his shoulders. Simultaneously the three were hit. The wounded man was killed. The Padre was hit in the groin and abdomen, and the stretcher bearer in the hand. The latter made a run for it and reached our lines without further hurt. No one could reach Captain Dunbar who died of wounds before dusk." ... All along the track small mounds and a rough cross bear silent record to the fact that this land has once again been bought with blood.|$|E

2500|$|Victorian critics {{praised the}} poem and some {{examined}} {{aspects of the}} poem's background. John Sheppard, {{in his analysis of}} dreams titled On Dreams (1847), lamented Coleridge's drug use as {{getting in the way of}} his poetry but argued: [...] "It is probable, since he writes of having taken an 'anodyne,' that the 'vision in a dream' arose under some excitement of that same narcotic; but this does not destroy, even as to his particular case, the evidence for a wonderfully inventive action of the mind in sleep; for, whatever were the exciting cause, the fact remains the same". T. Hall Caine, in 1883 survey of the original critical response to Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan", praised the poem and declared: [...] "It must surely be allowed that the adverse criticism on 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' which is here quoted is outside all tolerant treatment, whether of raillery or of banter. It is difficult to attribute such false verdict to pure and absolute ignorance. Even when we make all due allowance for the prejudices of critics whose only possible enthusiasm went out to 'the pointed and fine propriety of Poe,' we can hardly believe that the exquisite art which is among the most valued on our possessions could encounter so much garrulous abuse without the criminal intervention of personal malignancy." [...] In a review of H. D. Traill's analysis of Coleridge in the [...] "English Men of Letters", an anonymous reviewer wrote in 1885 Westminster Review: [...] "Of 'Kubla Khan,' Mr. Traill writes: 'As to the wild dream-poem 'Kubla Khan,' it is hardly more than a psychological curiosity, and only that perhaps in respect of the completeness of its metrical form.' Lovers of poetry <b>think</b> <b>otherwise,</b> and listen to these wonderful lines as the voice of Poesy itself." ...|$|E
