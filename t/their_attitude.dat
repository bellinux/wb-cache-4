5|$|Although {{the poet}} was {{moving away from}} Surrealism, his {{adherence}} to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union. Semiotician Philip Beitchman places <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> in connection with Tzara's own vision of Utopia, which combined communist messages with Freudo-Marxist psychoanalysis and made use of particularly violent imagery. Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the party line, maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{revolutions}} split {{also the}} Russian army officers politically and <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> toward the Finnish civil war varied; Mikhail Svechnikov led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and Konstantin Yeremejev the Russian {{forces in the}} Karelian Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary underlings and co-operated with the former colleague General Mannerheim, assisting the Whites in the disarmament of the Russian garrisons in Finland. On 30 January 1918 Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in Finland that the White army did not fight against Russia: {{the goal of the}} White campaign was to beat the Finnish Red rebels and the Russian troops supporting them.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Messolonghi, Western Europe decided to {{intervene}} in favour of revolutionary Greece. <b>Their</b> <b>attitude</b> toward the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian ally, Ibrahim Pasha, was especially critical; their primary objective was to elicit the evacuation of the occupied regions, the Peloponnese in particular. The intervention began when a Franco-Russo-British fleet {{was sent to the}} region, winning the Battle of Navarino in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps disembarked at Koroni in the southern Peloponnese. The soldiers were stationed on the peninsula until the evacuation of Egyptian troops in October, then taking control of the principal strongholds still held by Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France from the end of 1828, there was a French presence in the area until 1833.|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} examinedwhether nations differ in <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward action and inaction. Itwas anticipated {{that members of}} dialectical EastAsian societies would show a positive association in <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward action/inaction. However,members of nondialectical European-American societieswere expected to showa negative association in <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward action/inaction. Young adults in 19 nations completed measures of dialectical thinking and attitudes toward action/inaction. Results frommulti-level modeling showed, as predicted, that people fromhigh dialecticism nations reported amore positive association in <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward action and inaction than people from low dialecticism nations. Furthermore, these findings remained after controlling for cultural differences in individualism-collectivism, neuroticism, gross-domestic product, and response style.

5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. <b>Their</b> <b>attitude</b> hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E
5|$|As expected, the Australian team's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller, {{retired from}} cricket after the tour. Harvey {{replaced}} Johnson as Victorian captain {{and was the}} logical choice as successor to the Test captaincy, as the most experienced {{member of the team}} (48 Tests). Queensland's captain, the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall, was no longer an automatic Test selection. However, both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. Harvey was surprisingly overlooked for the captaincy, which went to Ian Craig, who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper. Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests; he had yet to establish himself in the team. After several disappointing results against England, the selectors chose a youthful team. Harvey was named vice-captain to Craig for both the 1956–57 non-Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957–58 Test tour to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the DF renamed {{itself the}} Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and {{underwent}} an internal reorganisation. However, {{the group was}} facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary path toward socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division {{between the two groups}} developed into open conflict, with the majority of activists sharing Morris' position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.|$|E
40|$|Despite much {{research}} into vegetarianism, the psychological relationship between eating meat and evaluating animals remains relatively neglected. Through focus groups, questionnaires and experiments, {{this study investigated}} whether people experienced psychological inconsistency in this relationship and, if so, how they handled that inconsistency. Unlike vegetarians' attitudes, the content of meat-eaters' attitudes towards eating meat rarely included animals. Meat-eaters' positive attitudes towards eating meat were consistent with their eating behaviour; however, <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals were more positive than <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat. It therefore depends upon which attitudes are salient {{at any given time}} to determine whether psychological consistency is maximised overall. By focusing on the relationship between <b>their</b> own genuinely-held <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals, animals' slaughter, and eating meat, meat-eaters' cognitive dissonance increased. <b>Their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat were expected to become more positive in order to restore consonance between <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> and eating behaviour. However, meat-eaters' attitudes towards eating meat became less positive and <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards animals' slaughter became more negative. In contrast, <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals resisted change. Therefore meat-eaters' attitudes towards farm animals became relatively even more positive than <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat and animals' slaughter. Hence, the attitudes stimulated by this research, in an environment which prevented psychological denial strategies, caused (a) meat eaters' attitudes to become more inconsistent with their behaviour and (b) the consequent lack of consonance restoration. This study both helps to understand the empirical relationship between eating meat and evaluating animals and extends cognitive dissonance theory's explanatory power to real-world complex phenomena...|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Bem {{proposed}} the self-perception theory of attitude change, which proposes a different mechanism of change {{than that of}} Leon Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory. Although the two theories appear contradictory, evidence suggests that dissonance theory and self-perception theory each explain different aspects of how people adjust <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> and behaviors to one another. Dissonance theory explains how people change <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> when they find themselves acting {{in opposition to the}} attitudes they already hold, while self-perception theory explains how people create <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> in the first place.|$|R
50|$|There {{may also}} be pluralistic ignorance {{on the part of}} youth {{regarding}} how <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> compare to peers and parents. A study by Lerner et al. asked college students to compare <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> {{on a number of issues}} to the <b>attitudes</b> of <b>their</b> peers and parents. Most students rated <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> as falling somewhere between their parents' more conservative <b>attitudes</b> and <b>their</b> peers' more liberal attitudes. The authors suggested that the reason for this is that the students perceived their friends as more liberal than they really were.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 1956–57 season, the {{selectors}} met {{to choose}} a team for a short non-Test tour of New Zealand. The leading contender for the captaincy was 28-year-old Victorian Neil Harvey, who had been a regular member of the team for eight years and was the senior batsman. However, both Harvey and Miller had been criticised for <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. The selectors thus thrust Craig into the leadership at the age of 21 and a half. He was a young player leading an inexperienced team—the youngest cricket team from any country to be sent overseas, with no players older than 30. It was seen as a bold move, as Craig had only played six Tests, was far from being a regular member of the team and had only a year of captaincy at first-class level.|$|E
5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, {{was not an}} easy man to work with, and in {{some circles}} it was {{predicted}} that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Goss {{resigned}} as organist of St Paul's Cathedral and Stainer {{was appointed to}} the position early in 1872 at a salary of £400 per annum. By this time he had been married for seven years and had five children with another due shortly. The organ {{was in the process of}} being rebuilt, by the organ builder Henry Willis to Stainer's design, with portions on either side of the entrance to the choir stalls. Around this time he was asked to help revise Hymns Ancient and Modern, a task he did with enthusiasm. At St Paul's, he soon set about reinvigorating the choir. The appointment of vicars choral was for life, and the tenor and bass voices saw no need for rehearsal, meaning that the repertoire was static. Stainer was able to change <b>their</b> <b>attitude,</b> and new anthems and liturgies were introduced, a choir school built, and the number of choristers increased from twelve to thirty-five. When William Sparrow Simpson was appointed Succentor, the raising of standards continued, and St Paul's Cathedral became the focus of religious ceremony in the capital, including state occasions, ceremonial events, memorial services and the funerals of the great and famous. A peal of twelve bells was installed in 1878.|$|E

It is more probable then that the arms of the College really are those of Archbishop Rotherham and were assumed to be those of the College by John Speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map. Lawrence Hall in Ship Street was given to Rotherham in 1476 and leased to Jesus in 1572. It may well have displayed the Archbishop’s arms in its structure as did the building {{on the south side of}} the front quad of Lincoln which he completed. These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that College, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the centre section had been changed to Or (gold) and <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> to statant.|$|E

40|$|Personal {{characteristics}} {{of mental health}} professionals can impact <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward juvenile sex offenders (JSOs) and affect treatment. The correlation between mental health professionals 2 ̆ 7 religiosity and <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> has not been examined, and there is limited research about the correlation between professionals 2 ̆ 7 gender and attitudes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how mental health professionals 2 ̆ 7 religiosity and gender related to <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward JSO treatment. Labeling theory provided the theoretical foundation for this study. This theory posits that individuals label certain populations, such as sex offenders, as deviant and this labeling perpetuates a cycle of criminal behavior. Using a quantitative approach, 123 mental health professionals completed an Internet survey that included demographic information, the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire, and the Attitudes Toward Treatment of Sex Offenders survey. These served to identify gender and measure religiosity and attitudes toward JSO treatment. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was then used to examine the research questions and hypotheses. There were no statistically significant findings about how participants 2 ̆ 7 religiosity and gender relate to <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward JSO treatment. However, further analyses revealed that type of profession and race of the participants affected <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward treatment. The findings can guide training programs to educate professionals that personal characteristics may affect <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward treatment. The potential for social change is that professionals 2 ̆ 7 increased awareness may improve treatment effectiveness, which might ultimately lower offenders 2 ̆ 7 recidivism and increase protection for the public...|$|R
