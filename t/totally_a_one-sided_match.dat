50|$|Match Three: Rob Huxley v. Pat Gibson: In <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match,</b> Pat, despite {{losing the}} first head-to-head, was in {{imperious}} form. He totally outclassed Rob, whose main mistake was probably picking CJ, {{when he had}} the full choice of Eggheads, as he didn't use him in any of his 3 General Knowledge questions.|$|R
50|$|The tournament final of {{the tournament}} was {{predicted}} {{by some to be}} a close affair, with the British team heralded as slight favourites after finishing {{at the top of the}} league table. Instead, it was <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match</b> as Australia produced their best performance {{of the tournament}}. The game was effectively over by half-time when Australia led by 38-0.|$|R

However, the final was <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match</b> as Lin demolished Lee 21-12, 21-8, and became the first men's singles player to win the Olympic gold as a first seed.|$|R
50|$|Running up {{the score}} is {{considered}} poor sportsmanship by many fans, players, and coaches but with different opinions how big an insult it is. Allegations of poor sportsmanship are often brought up soon after a team scores multiple times {{near the end of}} <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match.</b> However, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden contended that it was not his job to call plays that are inconsistent with his regular offense. He felt that the prevention of further scoring was the responsibility of the opposing team's defense.|$|R
5000|$|Gibson {{first came}} to note as a rugby player whilst a member of Northern Football Club; and in 1899 was {{selected}} to represent England in the Home Nations Championship. Gibson was brought into a fairly inexperienced pack to face Wales at St. Helen's. The game was <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match,</b> with Wales winning by 26-3; afterwards Gibson, {{along with the other}} Northern players in the pack, were described as [...] "delinquents" [...] by The Times. Gibson was not re-selected for any further games of the tournament.|$|R
5000|$|The Times correspondents {{fears that}} Birmingham had missed their {{opportunity}} - [...] "here was a setting that favoured Birminghams particular style, {{and they did}} not win" [...] - were realised in the second leg. In <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match</b> in front of a crowd of 75,000, Barcelona were two goals up after six minutes, and doubled their tally before Murphy broke down the left and sent a long pass towards Hooper, whose mobility helped him beat Ramallets to the ball and score with a header.|$|R
50|$|Walden {{reached his}} second ranking event final {{of the season}} by coming back from 3-0 down against Thepchaiya Un-Nooh at the Indian Open to win 4-3. He met Michael White in <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match</b> where White scored 419 points to Walden's 27 as he thrashed him 5-0 in 53 minutes. He could not recover from this loss in the {{remaining}} three ranking events as he lost in the last 32 of each, ending his season with a 10-8 defeat to Graeme Dott {{in the first round}} of the World Championship.|$|R
50|$|This defeat was {{followed}} by a 1-1 draw against team Fgura FC and a 1-0 loss against rivals Xghajra Tornadoes. However, the Knights defeated Luqa SA 5-1 in <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match</b> in January 2009. The next fixture was a top of the table clash against Gharghur FC and presented the Knights with the chance to forge ahead at the top of Section A.

After the third goal, BBC commentator David Coleman said that Newcastle's defence had been [...] "stripped naked" [...] by Liverpool. When the score was 0-0, Liverpool left back Alec Lindsay had a goal disallowed for offside, but replays later showed that the final pass to Lindsay came from a Newcastle defender and therefore the goal should have stood. Liverpool won the FA Cup for the second time.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} intra-firm bargaining on the formation of firms in an economy with imperfect capital markets and contracting constraints.

He was mentioned in Wisden {{among a group of}} players who had failed to make the Australian tour but [...] "gave indications of their intention to renew their claims". That he was still in the selectors' thoughts was demonstrated by his selection for the Test trial match {{at the start of the}} 1964-65 season, when England were the tourists, though in <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match</b> he failed to take a wicket.|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} {{matching}} mechanisms {{that could be}} compatible with our scheme. For example, we could have <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>matching</b> mechanism in which only refugees and asylum seekers would express their preferences about their preferred destinations, while destination countries would have no say. In that case, candidate refugees would be ranked in a random order, with the first in line granted their first choice, the second in line their first choice, etc., until {{we have to go}} down the list as preferred destinations gradually fill up. This is known as the top trading cycles mechanism, which would be equivalent to a random serial dictatorship (the first in the line “dictates”). This mechanism is typically used for allocating students to housing units in a campus (Abdulkadiroglu and Sonmez, 1999).|$|R
25|$|The first match, at Jade Stadium, Christchurch on 21 January 2005, was <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match.</b> The world team batted {{first and}} lost early wickets. At one stage they {{were reduced to}} 20 {{for the loss of}} four wickets, before a {{partnership}} by Graeme Hick and Jonty Rhodes helped the team a less embarrassing, yet still low, total of 158. Any fear that spectators would not get their money's-worth from a truncated match were soon allayed by an astonishing innings from New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, who bludgeoned the bowling in scoring 106 from just 57 deliveries, including nine sixes and ten fours. Muttiah Muralitharan, arguably the world's best spin bowler, came in for most of the punishment, being hit for seven sixes in just three overs. New Zealand reached the winning total for the loss of only one wicket.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} deterministic dominant strategy {{implementation in}} multidimensional dichotomous domains in private values and quasi-linear utility setting. In such multidimensional domains, an agent 2 ̆ 019 s type {{is characterized by}} a single number, the value of the agent, and a non-empty set of acceptable alternatives. Each acceptable alternative gives the agent utility equal to his value and other alternatives give him zero utility. We identity a new condition, which we call generation monotonicity, that is necessary and sufficient for implementability in any dichotomous domain. If such a domain satisfies a richness condition, then a weaker version of generation monotonicity, which we call 2 -generation monotonicity (equivalent to 3 -cycle monotonicity), is necessary and sufficient for implementation. We use this result to derive the optimal mechanism in <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>matching</b> problem with agents having dichotomous types...|$|R

While representing Newport, Mantle was selected for his two Welsh rugby union caps. His first {{was when he was}} selected as part of the touring Wales team to Africa. Mantle played in the early games of the tour, including wins over East Africa in Nairobi and Boland at Wellington. His first international was against South Africa in Durban in 1964, but Wales were outclassed and lost 24-3 in <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match.</b> Mantle played in the later games on the tour, including matches against Northern Transvaal and Orange Free State.

25|$|India's first {{match in}} the tournament was against the West Indies at Old Trafford in Manchester. The West Indians were {{expected}} to steamroll India, but India caused a massive upset, winning the game by 34 runs in a match spread over 2 days. Middle-order batsman Sharma withstood the West Indian pace attack to score a fine half-century (89 from 120 balls, 9 fours) as India scored 262/8. Then, a disciplined performance from the Indian bowlers led by all-rounders Binny (3/48) and Shastri (3/26) ensured that the West Indian batsmen could not settle down after their starts, {{as a result of}} which the West Indies were bowled all out for 228. India followed this victory with another win against Zimbabwe at Leicester. In <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match,</b> India, bowling first, restricted Zimbabwe to 155 with Madan Lal taking 3/27, following which a half-century by Patil (50 from 54 balls, 7 fours, 1 six) ensured that India chased down the paltry total easily.|$|R
5000|$|Sasso {{engaged in}} a worked shoot angle with former world {{champion}} wrestler Bret Hart, which began on February 6, 1999 during Hart's second guest appearance on MADtv. In a sketch lampooning the election of Jesse Ventura to gubernatorial office, Hart [...] "broke character" [...] and attacked the cast members for making light of wrestling, apparently injuring Sasso. He then appeared in a later episode at the curtain call during the ending credits and again attacked Sasso in an [...] "unscripted" [...] assault. Sasso then appeared at ringside during the February 8, 1999 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, where Hart again attacked him. Sasso retaliated by interfering in Hart's match against Roddy Piper, making him lose the match and the WCW United States Championship. This led to a grudge match on the February 15, 1999 episode of Nitro, where Sasso appeared with castmate Debra Wilson, who turned on Sasso, making it <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
