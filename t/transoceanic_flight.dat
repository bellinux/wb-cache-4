5|$|In the mid-1980s, the 767 {{spearheaded the}} growth of twinjet flights across the {{northern}} Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing <b>transoceanic</b> <b>flights</b> by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could {{be no more than}} 90 minutes away from diversion airports. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of <b>transoceanic</b> 767 <b>flights</b> and boosted the aircraft's sales.|$|R

Locally, they use a roller-coaster flight, relying on thermals and wind to soar within a 50 - to 600 -meter altitude band under cumulus clouds and then glide over kilometers at low energy costs. To deal with the local scarcity of clouds and gain longer gliding distances, birds regularly soar inside cumulus clouds to use their strong updraft, and they can reach altitudes of 4000 meters, where freezing conditions occur...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{directions}} of birds migrating at high geographic and magnetic latitudes {{can be used}} to test bird orientation by celestial or geomagnetic compass systems under polar conditions. Migration patterns of arctic shorebirds, revealed by tracking radar studies during an icebreaker expedition along the Northwest Passage in 1999, support predicted sun compass trajectories but cannot be reconciled with orientation along either geographic or magnetic loxodromes (rhumb lines). Sun compass routes are similar to orthodromes (great circle routes) at high latitudes, showing changing geographic courses as the birds traverse longitudes and their internal clock gets out of phase with local time. These routes bring the shorebirds from high arctic Canada to the east coast of North America, from which they make <b>transoceanic</b> <b>flights</b> to South America.

[...] Humboldt State University, 1980 A {{study to}} {{determine}} the migration and wintering ground distribution, ecology, and population status of the endangered Aleutian Canada goose (Branta canadensis leucopareia) was conducted from October 1975 to May 1978. Field investigations extended from the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, to the. Central Valley of California. Prior to and during the study, 536 Aleutian geese were banded to document movement and survival. It was determined that the geese use traditional migration and wintering areas away from Alaska, returning to virtually the same fields annually. During September, Aleutian Canada geese migrate along the Aleutian Island chain from Buldir Island near the western end to the easternmost island of Unimak and then apparently shift southeast on a <b>transoceanic</b> <b>flight.</b> The geese arrive in California in early October; some stop near Crescent City, but most birds continue to the Sacramento Valley where over 95 {{percent of the population}} uses a small agricultural area in the Butte Sink. From mid-November to early December the geese move southward via the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to the grasslands of the upper San Joaquin Valley. Most of the birds are present as a single flock near Modesto from at least late December to early February. They begin shifting southward to an area near Los Banos in mid-January, and some are present until mid-March. Aleutian geese start moving northward to the Crescent City staging grounds as early as mid-January, with most of the birds arriving during March. They peak in number there in late March and early April when nearly the entire known iv population is present. In mid-April, geese begin to leave Crescent City to the breeding grounds, and by late April or early May all have left. Although a few Aleutian Canada geese have been reported near the mouth of the Columbia River, Washington, most apparently make a <b>transoceanic</b> <b>flight</b> to the eastern Aleutians. There, they continue westward to Buldir where they have been seen as early as the first week of May. During the study, hunting and avian cholera were found to be the main sources of winter mortality.

50|$|For second-generation jet airliners, {{with the}} {{innovations}} of the high-bypass turbofan for greater efficiency and reduced noise, and the wide-body (twin-aisle) for greater passenger/cargo capacity, the trijet design {{was seen as}} the optimal configuration for the medium wide-body jet airliner, sitting in terms of size, range, and cost between quadjets (four-engine aircraft) and twinjets, and this led to a flurry of trijet designs. The four-engine Boeing 747 was popular for <b>transoceanic</b> <b>flights</b> due to its long-range and large size, but it was expensive and not all routes were able to fill its seating capacity, while the original models of the Airbus A300 twinjet were limited to short- to medium-range distances.

As a result of these trijet wide-bodies, as well as the popularity of the Boeing 727, in their heyday of the 1980s trijets made up a majority of all such US jet airlines.|$|R
