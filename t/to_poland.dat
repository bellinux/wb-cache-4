5|$|Although {{the last}} Diet {{was held in}} the early 1350s, the queens convoked a Diet to deal with the grievances of the noblemen. Mary {{confirmed}} her father's decrees of 1351 summarizing the noblemen's privileges on 22June 1384. The negotiations of Mary's marriage in France caused a new rift within the Hungarian nobility, because the Lackfis, Nicholas Zámbó and Nicholas Szécsi and other high officers, who had been appointed during Louis the Great's reign, continued to support Mary's fiancé, Sigismund, in accordance with Louis the Great's will. The queen mother replaced them with Nicholas Garai's supporters in August 1384. The prelates were also opposed to the French marriage, because the French supported Clement VII whom the Hungarian clergy considered an antipope. Mary's sister, Jadwiga, went <b>to</b> <b>Poland</b> where she was crowned on 16October 1384. Cardinal Demetrius, who had accompanied Jadwiga <b>to</b> <b>Poland,</b> remained absent from the queens' court after his return to Hungary.

5|$|An early Italian humanist {{who came}} <b>to</b> <b>Poland</b> in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came <b>to</b> <b>Poland</b> with Bona Sforza of Milan, {{when she married}} King Sigismund I the Old in 1518. This was {{supported}} by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, {{as well as by}} newly established universities. The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellon dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.|$|E
