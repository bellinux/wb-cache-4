40|$|We {{investigate}} the comparative performance of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and private commercial banks (PCBs) of Bangladesh {{with respect to}} efficiency and profitability in <b>financing</b> international <b>trade.</b> Taking a ten-year panel data over 2003 - 2012 of all four SOCBs and four categorised PCBs, we apply the non-parametric approach data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure and compare efficiency of the banks using output-oriented Malmquist Productivity Indices (MPI). Furthermore, we develop some specialised profitability ratios on <b>trade</b> <b>financing</b> business of the banks to measure profitability. Our results suggest that PCBs are more efficient and profitable compared to SOCBs' although PCBs provide less <b>trade</b> <b>financing</b> than SOCBs'. The study recommends SOCBs to progress technologically for sustaining themselves in the competitive banking sector of Bangladesh. Moreover, we identify the sources of profitability that would explain the banks' strategic position in <b>trade</b> <b>financing</b> business which would motivate more banks to support international traders through <b>trade</b> <b>financing.</b> international <b>trade</b> financing; bank efficiency; data envelopment analysis; DEA; Malmquist productivity index; MPI; profitability; state-owned banks; commercial banks; private banks; banking industry; Bangladesh...|$|R

Lenin also disagreed with the Left Communists about economic organisation; in June 1918, he argued that centralised economic control of industry was needed, whereas Left Communists wanted each factory to be controlled by its workers, a syndicalist approach that Lenin considered detrimental to the cause of socialism.|$|E
