50|$|In 1996, {{the first}} model DVD/LD combi-player (and first Pioneer DVD player, for that matter) was <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> DVL-9 {{released}} in Japan. <b>The</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Elite DVL-90, an updated version, followed by a similar, though supposedly lower-end model, the DVL-700, were released in 1997. Successors to this model include <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> DVL-909, <b>Pioneer</b> DVL-919, and <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Elite DVL-91. Although the DVD/LD combi players offered competent LD performance, they paled in comparison to high-end LD players such as <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Elite CLD-99 and <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Hi-Vision/MUSE HLD-X9.|$|R
5|$|Another {{area where}} the Antiquary led was in {{recording}} folklore and folktales. Its publication of Punjab folktales was the first attempt to classify the events on which folk tales were based and <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> work on north Indian folklore of William Crooke and Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube was printed in its pages.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> efforts by Olav Selvaag and others, archaic and {{otherwise}} unnecessary restrictions were relaxed, improving opportunities for more Norwegians to build housing to suit their individual needs and preferences.

5|$|Westinghouse changed WDTV's call {{letters to}} KDKA-TV after <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> radio station {{of the same}} name, and {{switched}} its primary affiliation to CBS immediately after the sale. Westinghouse's acquisition of CBS in 1995 made KDKA-TV a CBS owned-and-operated station.|$|E
5|$|Aside from dancewear and conventions, {{developments}} in agency representation occurred as well. Although limited, representation for individual dancers had existed since the 1980s {{at the beginning}} of the music video era due to <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> work of talent agent Julie McDonald. However, the UK-based dance agencies ProDance and Superbad Talent were created to exclusively represent street dancers.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pioneers</b> of <b>the</b> Revolution (Pionniers de la Révolution) was a youth {{organisation}} in Burkina Faso, modelled along {{the pattern of}} <b>the</b> <b>pioneer</b> movements typically operated by communist parties, such as <b>the</b> contemporary <b>Pioneers</b> of Enver, José Martí Pioneer Organisation and Agostinho Neto <b>Pioneer</b> Organisation. <b>The</b> <b>Pioneers</b> of <b>the</b> Revolution organised children of all ages. Much like many other young pioneer movements, such as the Vladimir Lenin All-Union <b>Pioneer</b> Organisation and <b>the</b> Young <b>Pioneers</b> of China, <b>the</b> most distinct sign of <b>the</b> <b>Pioneers</b> were their red scarves, joined by rudimentary uniforms and yellow berets.|$|R
50|$|In 1903 <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Divisional Board became <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Shire Council, its subdivisions {{subsequently}} renamed divisions. During this period, as a {{means of}} opening <b>the</b> Upper <b>Pioneer</b> Valley to closer settlement, <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Shire Council funded the extension of <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Valley railway line from Pinnacle to Finch Hatton. This extension was opened on 21 September 1904. The Queensland Government completed the last extension to <b>the</b> <b>Pioneer</b> Valley line, west to Netherdale, after its takeover of the Finch Hatton section on 1 July 1910. This action made more land available for sugar cane growing, as well as allowing tourists easier access to the Eungella Range.|$|R
5|$|During the 1930s, the {{orchestra}} became {{renowned for its}} high standard of playing and for performing new and unfamiliar music. <b>The</b> <b>pioneering</b> work of Boult and the BBC SO included an early performance of Schoenberg's Variations, Op. 31, British premieres, including Berg's Wozzeck and Three Movements from the Lyric Suite, and world premieres, including Vaughan Williams's Symphony No. 4 in F minor. Anton Webern conducted eight BBC SO concerts between 1931 and 1936.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{facets of}} Minnesota culture that are {{perceived}} as the area's early history in fact originated after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration for which the state is known, and <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, {{the first half of}} the 19th century was characterized by sparsely populated communities, harsh living conditions, and to some degree, lawlessness.|$|E

5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor. This {{was based on the}} principle of the brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of more radical Expressionism and Modernism {{can be seen}} in buildings such as Basil Spence's Mortonhall Crematorium, Edinburgh (1964–67), with a series of irregular chapels, with smooth-faced blockwork and Wheeler & Sproson's Boghall Church, Bathgate (1965), influenced by Beaux-Arts architecture. <b>The</b> <b>pioneering</b> contribution from the Church of Scotland was St. Columbia's, Glenrothes (1960), which had seating for the congregation on three sides of a central platform, with the choir and elders on the fourth side behind the pulpit.|$|E
5|$|The {{reputation}} of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) amongst {{the rest of}} the world grew considerably. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Large-scale Wootz steel production in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon sources such as the plant Avāram occurred by the sixth century BC, <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, running {{independently}} from <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> FWD night, {{an event}} called Filthy Dub, co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, NType, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, protein {{sequencing}} had already transformed methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, which holds {{that some of the}} organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. At first {{he was told that}} tropical animals {{would never be able to}} live in a cold climate like Edinburgh's—a view that had to some extent been borne out by the failure of the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to read of <b>the</b> <b>pioneering</b> methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
