500|$|Edward's {{supporters}} {{felt that}} he had [...] "been hounded from the throne by that arch humbug Baldwin", but many members of the establishment were relieved by Edward's departure. Mackenzie King wrote in his diary on 8 December 1936 that Edward's [...] "sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years" [...] and, upon receiving news of Edward's final decision to abdicate, [...] "if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of man he is it is better he should not be longer on the Throne." [...] Edward's own Assistant Private Secretary, Alan Lascelles, had told Baldwin as early as 1927: [...] "I can't help thinking that the best thing that could happen to him, and to the country, would be for him to break his neck." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{topic of}} {{abortion}} is a prominent theme in [...] "Secrets". After discovering {{that she is}} pregnant, Lori asks Glenn to retrieve with emergency contraception pills from the pharmacy. Upon returning, an infuriated Maggie hands Lori her pills. Dale gently confronts her about her pregnancy when he sees that she becomes nauseated at the smell of cooking meat, and Lori explains that Rick is the biological father of the child. Writer Robert Kirkman opined that such assertions were [...] "wishful thinking". [...] "She was with those two men very close to each other. There was not a large span of time between her time with Shane and then Rick's return and her time with Rick. It's definitely {{up in the air}} and it’s not like there's a lot of paternity tests floating around out there." [...] Kirkman felt that he had to responsibly approach controversial issues from a neutral standpoint and insisted that abortion should warrant discussion, considering the circumstances. He stated: [...] "As far as the abortion stuff goes, it’s really just a matter of being realistic. These are the kinds of issues that people deal with in real life and in this situation I think that <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of thought process that Lori Grimes would be going through." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{criticized the}} Ninth Circuit's ruling, which had {{perceived}} a [...] "doctrinal anomaly" [...] between the toleration of employee speech made publicly but not made pursuant to assigned duties {{resulted from a}} misconception of [...] "the theoretical underpinnings of our decisions." [...] The Court instead found a reason for limiting First Amendment protection to public statements made {{outside the scope of}} official duties [...] "because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of activity engaged in by citizens who do not work for the government." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Tom Sawyer, {{later the}} chief {{executive}} officer of the hospital, described Krkpatrick as [...] "very compassionate [...] a great empathy for people, and he really loved hispital work. ...

2500|$|The fourth {{school of}} thought is that the play is a farce, and hence the speech should not be read seriously or ironically. For example, Robert B. Heilman argues that [...] "the whole wager scene falls {{essentially}} {{within the realm of}} farce: the responses are largely mechanical, as is their symmetry. Kate's final long speech on the obligations and fitting style of wives we can think of as a more or less automatic statement – <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> appropriate to farce – of a generally held doctrine."

My {{thinking}} is that if I focus on one song at a time I would approach them as beautiful, distinct paintings that would each require the attention they deserve. This would also mean I would choose what I am recording quite carefully as there would be tremendous internal pressure to get it just right, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of pressure I like, which is to make the most beautiful thing possible.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{standing}} {{threatened by}} the New Look, the Army questioned the wisdom of reliance on [...] "massive retaliation" [...] and strategic air power {{to the neglect of}} other force elements. Secretary Wilson reportedly observed that the United States [...] "can't afford to fight limited wars. We can only afford to fight a big war, and if there is one, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> it will be." [...] But by 1955 the Army, and later in the decade the Navy, departed from their emphasis on preparation for total war by urging the need to prepare for limited war, non-global conflicts restricted in geographical area, force size, and weapons (although tactical nuclear weapons were not ruled out). Generals Ridgway and Taylor stressed the need to have a variety of forces available and equipped to fight different kinds of war from a local non-nuclear war to a global strategic nuclear conflict. They rejected the notion that limited wars would occur only in less developed areas and argued that such conflicts might occur in the NATO region as well.|$|E

500|$|His 1985 film Revolution about a fur trapper {{during the}} American Revolutionary War, was a {{commercial}} and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production, {{resulting in a}} four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of Crystal Clear, National Anthems and other plays; he appeared in Julius Caesar in 1988 in producer Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: [...] "I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui on stage and reading that the reason I'd gone back to <b>the</b> stage <b>was</b> <b>that</b> my movie career <b>was</b> waning! <b>That's</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of ethos, <b>the</b> way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately." [...] Pacino returned to film in 1989's Sea of Love, when he portrayed a detective hunting a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews.|$|R
2500|$|... "Animal Nitrate", {{a play on}} amyl nitrite, {{would be}} the album's most {{successful}} single, peaking at no. 7. The song contained Anderson's most risqué lyrics to date: as their author concurred, [...] "You know it's about violence and abuse and sex and drugs. It's actually quite a hardcore song." [...] Anderson has since said that the first album was about [...] "sex and depression in equal measure". All the latter-day lyrics for the first album were directly influenced by extremely personal and emotional experiences in Anderson's life. [...] "So Young", featuring a piano bridge courtesy of Ed Buller, was about his girlfriend's overdose. Anderson says: [...] "it deals with the knife-edge of being young." [...] "The Next Life", which was Butler's first serious piano part, was a lament to his deceased mother, while [...] "Breakdown" [...] dealt with his schoolfriend's descent into extreme depression. [...] "She's Not Dead", was a true story written about the joint suicide of Anderson's aunt and her black clandestine lover. On the song, Anderson states: [...] "the ankle chain and stuff like <b>that,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of detail that can only come from truth, that can't be conjured up." ...|$|E

The group reached a consensus to go with Sony BMG/Epic, with the proviso that they buy out their last album from EMI.
