5|$|After {{reinforcing}} {{the team with}} several expensive players—including Thomas Wernerson and Stig Fredriksson—IFK had {{finished second in the}} league and reached the quarter-finals in the UEFA Cup as 1981 came to an end. 1982 then became a turbulent season as the whole board was replaced and the club almost went bankrupt—even needing to borrow money from the official supporter's association to travel to Valencia to play the quarter-final of the UEFA Cup. After <b>the</b> <b>troubled</b> start IFK won every competition they entered, including Allsvenskan, the Allsvenskan play-off, Svenska Cupen, and the UEFA Cup, defeating Hamburger SV 4–0 on aggregate in the finals.

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012–2015 {{revealed that}} Nyuserre Ini undertook building {{works on the}} valley temple of Menkaure, as witness by numerous seal impressions bearing his serekh discovered on the site. These works ended a long period from the reign of Shepseskaf until his reign during which the Giza necropolis was not the object of royal attention. Beyond Menkaure's valley temple, Nyuserre apparently also took a wider interest {{in the administration of}} the pyramid town of Khafra and revived the cult of both Menkaure and queen Khentkaus I. According to Mark Lehner, this queen, who bore the same name as Nyuserre's mother and like his mother bore two pharaohs, provided Nyuserre with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears. John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of both Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after <b>the</b> <b>troubled</b> times surrounding Neferefre's death.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began in 1993 before the novel was published. Mike Nichols {{purchased}} the film rights, and the project {{was picked up by}} Savoy Pictures. After Nichols stepped down, the film adaptation became mired in development hell; during <b>the</b> <b>troubled</b> pre-production, Ben Stiller and John Dahl turned down opportunities to direct the film. After Savoy closed in November 1995, the project was sold to Paramount Pictures, and financed by Mutual Film Company, which provided a budget of $17 million. John Boorman was hired to direct, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Raimi. Principal photography began in January 1998 and concluded in March after 55 days; filming took place in Wisconsin and Minnesota. The score was produced and composed by Danny Elfman.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as {{the worst day of}} his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer to take over <b>the</b> <b>troubled</b> organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did.

5|$|In the east, the Khwarezemids under Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu {{captured}} {{the town of}} Khilat from al-Ashraf, while the normally loyalist Rasulids began to encroach on Ayyubid territorial holdings in Arabia. In 1222 the Ayyubids appointed the Rasulid leader Ali Bin Rasul as governor of Mecca. Ayyubid rule in Yemen and the Hejaz was declining and the Ayyubid governor of Yemen, Mas'ud bin Kamil, {{was forced to leave}} for Egypt in 1223. He appointed Nur ad-Din Umar as his deputy governor while he was absent. In 1224 the local al-Yamani dynasty gained control of Hadramaut from the Ayyubids who had held it loosely due to <b>the</b> <b>troubled</b> situation of their administration in Yemen proper. Following Mas'ud bin Kamil's death in 1229, Nur ad-Din Umar declared himself the independent ruler of Yemen and discontinued the annual tribute payment to the Ayyubid sultanate in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the trail}} of the related {{negative}} publicity, Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk.

According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life each seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted <b>the</b> <b>troubled,</b> complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|E
