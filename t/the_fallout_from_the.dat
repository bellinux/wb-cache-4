5|$|First Great Western {{exercised}} a {{break clause}} in the Greater Western franchise thus avoiding large premium payments to the Department for Transport. With the franchise to now conclude in March 2013, it was put out to tender, but the process was scrapped as part of <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition.|$|E
5|$|First Great Western {{declined}} a {{contractual option}} {{to continue the}} Greater Western passenger franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2011, the Irish Examiner {{reported}} that Micheál Martin {{had moved to}} pull the party out of the presidential race over <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> approach to Gay Byrne, the cost involved and the slim chance of a candidate being elected. On 24 August, however, the party's deputy leader Éamon Ó Cuív told Raidió na Gaeltachta that he believed the party should put forward a candidate.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so it got little attention in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{negative}} impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks had missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time in four years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium {{was first}} {{identified}} in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley {{in collaboration with}} the Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, in <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ivy Mike nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.|$|E
50|$|This {{foundation}} {{paid off}} with Yankee championships in 1996, and from 1998-2000. However, Michael was fired before the Yankees dynasty began, {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>fallouts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1994 strike, which ruined the Yankees having {{the best record in the}} American League that year in 1995. It was the second time that the Yankees fired Michael {{as a result of}} a strike; in 1981, he was fired as manager as a result of the strike that year.|$|R

30|$|<b>From</b> Table 7, <b>the</b> {{prominence}} of tax {{as the principal}} component {{in the first four}} phases indicates that the loopholes in the tax administration policy in Nigeria is so obvious, and serves as an advantage to entrepreneurs.

This position in South Africa is not farfetched; given <b>the</b> <b>fallouts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> abolishment of apartheid regime and the standardized market policies.|$|R

5|$|In April 1849, part of {{the goals}} of the 1848 Revolution were {{fulfilled}} by the Convention of Balta Liman, through which the two suzerain powers of the Regulamentul Organic regime—the Ottoman Empire and Russia—appointed Grigore Alexandru Ghica, a supporter of the liberal and unionist cause, as Prince of Moldova (while, on the other hand, confirming the defeat of revolutionary power in Wallachia). Ghica allowed the instigators of the 1848 events to return from exile, and appointed Kogălniceanu, as well as Costache Negri and Alexandru Ioan Cuza to administrative offices. The measures enforced by the prince, together with <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> defeat of Russia in the Crimean War, were to bring by 1860 the introduction of virtually all liberal tenets comprised in Dorințele partidei naționale din Moldova.|$|E
5|$|In early July 2015, Marvel began a viral {{marketing}} campaign featuring Leslie Bibb, reprising her role from the Iron Man films as journalist Christine Everhart, reporting for the faux news program WHIH Newsfront. In the program, Everhart discuses <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Lang's imprisonment, and events leading to Captain America: Civil War. Also in July, Michael Douglas and executives from Marvel Entertainment rang the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange {{in celebration of}} the release of Ant-Man. Disney spent $34.8 million on television advertising for the film, more than the $26.9 million spent for Avengers: Age of Ultron, since the former was a new property.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had not developed, {{and did not}} employ {{radioactive}} poisons, so Operation Peppermint {{was never}} put into effect. After VE-Day, the equipment and all the documents relating to Operation Peppermint were collected, returned to the United States, and {{handed over to the}} Manhattan Project. However, the effort put into developing portable radiation detection equipment was not wasted. Survey teams from the Manhattan Project used the equipment to assess <b>the</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Trinity nuclear test, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Operation Crossroads, during which 10,000 film badges were used.|$|E

40|$|We {{invent a}} simple game, called the Evergreen Game, {{which is about}} {{generating}} and solving Boolean MAX-CSP problems. <b>The</b> <b>fallouts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Evergreen Game are surprising: (1) Although the game is about solving MAX-CSP problems, a simple, efficient algorithm is sufficient {{to play the game}} well. The best game-playing strategy leads to a significant reduction of the huge search space for both formula generation and solving. (2) The Evergreen Game shows us how to systematically translate a CSP formula into a polynomial that is fundamental in playing the game well. (3) We show evidence that those polynomials are useful for efficient MAX-CSP as well as MAX-SAT solvers...|$|R
50|$|By 1990, Independent Air was {{planning}} to start scheduled flights between New York and Puerto Rico but those plans were not realized.

5|$|The 0–14 {{record was}} {{matched by the}} 1980 New Orleans Saints, who won their {{penultimate}} game to end the season 1–15. The 1981 Baltimore Colts then won their opener and closer, but lost every game in between to equal the Buccaneers’ and Saints’ 14-game single-season losing streak. The 1982 Colts were winless in a strike-shortened season, but did get a tie in one game. The 1990 New England Patriots had a 1–1 record when several of the players sexually harassed a female reporter. <b>The</b> <b>fallout</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scandal contributed to the team finishing 0–14 in its remaining games. The 2013 Houston Texans also managed to match the Buccaneers' single-season losing streak after starting 2–0. Most recently, the 2016 Cleveland Browns lost their first 14 games (including an 0–4 preseason) to match the Buccaneers' single season streak, but managed to avoid becoming the NFL's second 0–16 team by winning their penultimate game against the San Diego Chargers.|$|E
