Agent-based simulation represents an attractive alternative to traditional simulation techniques. This project aims to develop software for agent-based factory shop floor simulation.

40|$|PaperPg. 157 - 160. Field {{testing of}} {{compressors}} may {{be carried out}} to monitor for performance shortfall in normal operation or to verify performance following an overhaul or revamp. Testing requires careful measurements of pressures, temperatures, flows, gas composition, speed and shaft power. Testing is discussed {{with reference to the}} procedures given in ASME Power Test Code 10. Some comparison is made of <b>shop</b> <b>testing</b> versus field testing and the latter is seen as complementary to the former. In most <b>tests,</b> <b>shop</b> as well as field, shaft power is determined by the heat balance method. This method is reviewed briefly in its application to single and multiple inlet compressors. An approach for calculating overall efficiency for multiple inlet machines, where internal temperature measurements are not available, is suggested. A few ways of plotting test results for ready comparison are set out. Finally, some <b>shop</b> and field <b>test</b> results are compared...|$|R

The section of the shop in which they were placed was railed off and under the sole charge and observation of the R.A.C. officials {{from the start of the}} test to the finish. The observers kept watch day and night just as on board a ship, and periodically tested the revolution counters and spring balances to ensure that the engines were always running under full load. Every possible precaution was taken to keep constant and close observation upon the test, and there were never less than two observers on duty.|$|R

40|$|SHOP (Simple Hierarchical Ordered Planner) and M-SHOP (Multi-task-list SHOP) are HTN {{planning}} algorithms {{with the}} following characteristics. • SHOP and M-SHOP plan for tasks {{in the same order}} that they will later be executed. This avoids some taskinteraction issues that arise in other HTN planners, making the planning algorithms relatively simple. This also makes it easy to prove soundness and completeness results. • Since SHOP and M-SHOP know the complete world-state at each step of the planning process, they can use highly expressive domain representations. For example, they can do planning problems that require Horn-clause inferencing, complex numeric computations, and calls to external programs. • In our <b>tests,</b> <b>SHOP</b> and M-SHOP were several orders of magnitude faster than Blackbox, IPP, and UMCP, and were several times as fast as TLplan. • The approach is powerful enough to be used in complex real-world planning problems.
