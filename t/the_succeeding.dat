40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 An intertheory {{comparison}} {{should be}} assessed {{with regards to}} what goals it seeks to accomplish. Traditionally reductions have sought to establish ontological primacy, and also to have the reducing theory explain features of the reduced. From a functionalist perspective, this dissertation assesses three major results: a reduction of general relativistic spacetimes to a Newtonian gravitational structure, a theory comparison that employs both wave and ray optics, and a reduction that limits the momentum equation of special relativity to the classical momentum equation. These case-studies reveal evidence of types of goals given little discussion in existing literature on theory reduction. I find that successional reductions can (i) provide an explanation of (aspects of) <b>the</b> <b>succeeded</b> theory by <b>the</b> successor; (ii) provide {{an explanation of the}} theories' successes/failures, as well as explaining details of the progress, both historical and conceptual, from <b>the</b> <b>succeeded</b> theory to <b>the</b> successor; (iii) transfer confidence to the successor from <b>the</b> <b>succeeded</b> theory; and (iv) delimit a range of applicability for <b>the</b> <b>succeeded</b> theory. Recognizing these new goals provides insight for analysis of the intertheoretic activity of scientists, as well as the work of philosophers that assess how scientific theories relate to one another...|$|R

5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and <b>the</b> <b>succeeding</b> combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E

5|$|Eadbald's {{influence}} {{was less than}} his father's, but Kent was powerful enough to be omitted {{from the list of}} kingdoms dominated by Edwin of Northumbria.

When Æthelburg fled to Kent on Edwin's death in about 633, she sent her children to Francia for safety, fearing the intrigues of both Eadbald and Oswald.
