25|$|The surgery {{most often}} used in such cases is called <b>transurethral</b> <b>resection</b> of the {{prostate}} (TURP or TUR). In TURP, an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate tissue that is pressing against {{the upper part of}} the urethra and restricting the flow of urine. TURP results in the removal of mostly transitional zone tissue in a patient with BPH. Older men often have corpora amylacea (amyloid), dense accumulations of calcified proteinaceous material, in the ducts of their prostates. The corpora amylacea may obstruct the lumens of the prostatic ducts, and may underlie some cases of BPH.|$|E

Of 115 patients, 67 underwent <b>transurethral</b> electrocautery <b>resection</b> of the prostate, and 48 underwent endoscopic neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser ablation of the prostate under direct vision. Analysis showed a cost differential between these 2 surgical treatments in excess of $ 2, 000, favoring laser prostatectomy (P <. 0001) over <b>transurethral</b> electrocautery <b>resection.</b> The single greatest difference between the treatments was the ability to manage all patients receiving laser treatment as outpatients, whereas the mean and median hospital stay after <b>transurethral</b> electrocautery <b>resection</b> was 3. 0 days. Taking additional cost variables into account and decreasing the cost of laser delivery systems would further increase this cost differential in favor of laser therapy.

40|$|Lower {{urinary tract}} infection, {{frequently}} troublesome {{and difficult to}} eradicate, has been considered as an almost inevitable complication following <b>transurethral</b> prostatic <b>resection.</b> In an effort to treat this complication after <b>transurethral</b> prostatic <b>resection,</b> achymotripsin enteric-coated tablet, a pancreatic proteolytic enzyme, was administered to twenty patients {{and the result was}} compared to that of twenty-one control patients. The administration of the a-chymotripsin enteric-coated tablet was, as a rule, started two weeks after the <b>transurethral</b> prostatic <b>resection</b> with a dosage of 2 tablets 3 times a day (1 tablet contains 100 Ch. Ti. of a-chymotripsin) and was continued as long as the urinary tract infection had persisted. The duratio n of postoperative urinary tract infection in the a-chymotripsin treated group was 8. 5 weeks on the average (varied from 5 to 15 weeks) which was 3. 1 weeks shorter than that of the control group (11. 6 weeks on the average, varied from 6 to 19 weeks). No unpleasant side effect occurred in this series, except for one patient who complained of a mild degree of loss of appetite during the treatment with a-chymotripsin enteric-coated tablet, which disappeared soon after the completion of the treatment. In conclusion, the use of a-chymotripsin enteric-coated tablet was believed to be an effective therapeutic measure for combating urinary tract infection following <b>transurethral</b> prostatic <b>resection...</b>|$|R
25|$|Although the {{prostate}} was first described by Venetian anatomist Niccolò Massa in 1536, {{and illustrated by}} Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853. Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction. Removal of the entire gland (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Surgical removal of the testes (orchiectomy) to treat prostate cancer was first performed in the 1890s, but with limited success. <b>Transurethral</b> <b>resection</b> of {{the prostate}} (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction {{in the middle of}} the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh. This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of penile function.|$|E

We also demonstrated an association between SRF protein expression and CRPC in a cohort of castrate-resistant <b>transurethral</b> <b>resections</b> of the prostate (TURPS). The mechanisms regulating the growth of CRPC bone and visceral metastases have not been explored in depth due to the paucity of patient-related material available for analysis.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} {{the outcome of}} repeat <b>transurethral</b> bladder tumor <b>resection</b> for high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer before induction and maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included {{in the study were}} 151 consecutive patients {{with a mean age of}} 68. 6 years (range 32 to 86) with primary high grade, nonmuscle invasive (Ta, T 1 or CIS) bladder cancer. All patients underwent repeat <b>transurethral</b> bladder tumor <b>resection</b> and were shown by repeat resection to be tumor-free or have residual tumor before bacillus Calmette-Guerin. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin response was evaluated by disease recurrence and progression. RESULTS: A total of 70 tumor-free patients and 47 with residual tumor received bacillus Calmette-Guerin induction and maintenance therapy after repeat <b>transurethral</b> bladder tumor <b>resection,</b> of whom 84 (71. 8 %) were disease-free during followup. In the tumor-free group 11. 4 % of tumors recurred compared with 27. 7 % in the residual tumor group (p < 0. 05). Progression was noted in 5. 7 % of tumor-free cases vs 17. 0 % of residual tumor cases (p < 0. 05). Time to recurrence was significantly less in the residual tumor group than in the tumor-free group (17. 8 vs 23. 9 months, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-free status at repeat <b>transurethral</b> bladder tumor <b>resection</b> improves the bacillus Calmette-Guerin response rate and delays tumor recurrence.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the durable effect of high-energy transurethral microwave thermotherapy and <b>transurethral</b> prostatic <b>resection</b> {{for treatment of}} patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of bladder outflow obstruction. Between January 1996 and March 1997, 155 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of bladder outflow obstruction were randomized to receive transurethral microwave thermotherapy (Prostatron*; device and commercial software) (82) or undergo <b>transurethral</b> prostatic <b>resection</b> (73). Initial patient evaluation was performed according to international standards. Patients were followed annually with the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) and uroflowmetry (maximum flow rate). The Kaplan-Meier survival {{analysis was used to}} calculate the cumulative risk of re-treatment, adjusted for loss to followup. A total of 78 patients received transurethral microwave thermotherapy and 66 underwent <b>transurethral</b> prostatic <b>resection.</b> Median followup was 33 months. In the thermotherapy group mean maximum urinary flow rate improved from 9. 2 ml. per second at baseline to 15. 1, 14. 5 and 11. 9 ml. per second at 1, 2 and 3 years, and mean I-PSS decreased from 20 to 8, 9, and 12, respectively. In the resection group the corresponding numbers for maximum urinary flow rate were 7. 8, 24. 5, 23. 0 and 24. 7 ml. per second at 1, 2 and 3 years, and for I-PSS were 20, 3, 4 and 3, respectively. At 36 months, 14 patients in the thermotherapy and 8 from the resection groups underwent re-treatment, and the cumulative risk was 19. 8 % (95 % confidence interval 10. 4 % to 29. 3 %) and 12. 9 % (4. 5 % to 21. 3 %), respectively (p = 0. 28). Transurethral microwave thermotherapy and <b>transurethral</b> prostatic <b>resection</b> achieve durable improvement in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of bladder outflow obstruction, while the magnitude of improvement is higher with resection.

The PIN status of tissue specimens from 789 men without prostate cancer was determined in 508 <b>transurethral</b> <b>resections</b> and 281 transvesical prostatic enucleations. All slides were reviewed blind and independently by two pathologists. The patients were followed for an average of 11 years, and the incidence of subsequent cancer and cause-specific survival were analysed. Thirty-six cases of clinical prostatic cancer occurred among the cohort of 789 men through follow-up. No association between the presence of PIN in the transition/central zone and subsequent cancer development was found. There was also no difference in survival related to PIN status among the subsequent cancer patients...|$|R
