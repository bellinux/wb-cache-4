In Mexico, New Zealand and Norway, the album just missed the top ten of the charts. The commercial success in Europe enabled the album to debut at position two on Billboards European Top 100 Albums chart, behind Norah Jones' studio album Not Too Late.

50|$|Need for Cognition moderates the {{occurrence}} of order effects. Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) demonstrated that a juror’s need for cognition affects which order effect the juror relies on for their vote. An ambiguous confession was played by {{one side of the}} case, and then both sides commented that <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> fit into their narrative of the crime. The side who presented <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> spoke first. Jurors who had high need for cognition were more likely to exhibit a primacy effect, meaning that they believed <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> fit with whichever side presented <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> as evidence. Conversely, jurors who had low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect, and believed that <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> supported <b>the</b> case for the side who did not submit <b>the</b> <b>confession.</b>|$|R

It also won her the VMA for Video of the Year for the title track. From 2001 to 2008, Madonna embarked on four worldwide concert tours—Drowned World (2001), Re-Invention (2004), Confessions (2006) and Sticky & Sweet (2008)—which received a total of eight nominations at the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, but won only one award for <b>the</b> <b>Confessions</b> Tour in 2006, in the category of Most Creative Stage Production. The Brit Awards have nominated Madonna in 12 categories, and in 2006 she won the International Female Solo Artist award, for her 10th studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor.

5|$|Melvin {{therefore}} {{resorted to}} arresting suspects– including juveniles, {{some of them}} regarded as vulnerable– and holding them for days without access to lawyers. Of the 359 people arrested {{in connection with the}} inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed {{in the presence of a}} lawyer. Many of <b>the</b> <b>confessions</b> that resulted, whether directly about the murder, or about having taken part in the rioting, were made before the lawyer was given access to the interviewee.|$|E
5000|$|Philipp Melanchthon {{made several}} changes to <b>the</b> {{original}} Augsburg <b>Confession</b> in <b>the</b> years following its 1530 publication.

John Calvin himself did sign the 1540 version of <b>the</b> <b>confession.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Triennial Convention {{accepted}} the 1833 New Hampshire Baptist <b>Confession</b> of Faith. <b>The</b> <b>Confession</b> {{was drafted by}} Rev. John Newton Brown, D.D. (1803-1868), of New Hampshire and other Triennial Baptist ministers, and adopted by the New Hampshire (Triennial) Baptist Convention. <b>The</b> <b>Confession</b> was traditional. <b>The</b> controversy {{of the day was}} free will verses predestination. While <b>the</b> New Hampshire <b>Confession</b> is shorter than <b>the</b> 1742 Philadelphia <b>Confession,</b> it affirms <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>Confession.</b> <b>The</b> New Hampshire <b>Confession</b> states that [...] "Humans by voluntary will transgression fell from the holy and happy state were created" [...] and that [...] "We believe that Election predestination is the eternal purpose of God, according to which he graciously regenerates, sanctifies, and saves sinners". However, many saw <b>the</b> New Hampshire <b>Confession</b> as accepting free will. The free-will Baptists in the Northeast and West accepted <b>the</b> <b>Confession,</b> while <b>the</b> Calvinist (predestination) Baptists in the Southeast rejected <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> but remained in the Triennial Convention.|$|R
50|$|Evidence of a {{confession}} may be excluded {{because it was}} obtained by oppression or because <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> was made in consequence of anything said or done to the defendant that {{would be likely to}} make <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> unreliable. In these circumstances, it would be open to the trial judge to exclude the evidence of <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> under Section 78(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), or under Section 73 PACE, or under common law, although in practice <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> would be excluded under section 76 PACE.|$|R

5|$|Confessions Tour was {{the seventh}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It {{supported}} her tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor. Madonna confirmed {{the possibility of}} {{going out on a}} tour as early as November 2005. Jamie King, Madonna's longtime collaborator, was then hired on to direct. The set list consisted of mainly songs from the supporting studio album and rehearsals started during 2006. As with many of her prior tours, <b>the</b> <b>Confessions</b> Tour did not go to Australia, prompting Madonna to release an apology statement on her website.|$|E
5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. <b>The</b> <b>confessions</b> do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of <b>the</b> <b>Confession,</b> it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. <b>The</b> <b>Confession</b> was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to <b>the</b> <b>Confession,</b> which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Book of <b>Confessions</b> {{contains}} <b>the</b> creeds and <b>confessions</b> of <b>the</b> Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).

The {{book was}} first published in 1983, and has since been revised. When it {{was first published}}, the intent was to blend the theological traditions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States and the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. The role of <b>the</b> Book of <b>Confessions</b> is to provide historical context for Biblical interpretations.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Confession</b> of Faith of the Evangelical United Brethren Church is one {{of three}} {{established}} Doctrinal Standards of the United Methodist Church, along with the Articles of Religion and the Standard Sermons of John Wesley. The United Methodist Church adopted <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> of Faith in 1968 when the Methodist Church merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form the United Methodist Church. <b>The</b> <b>Confession</b> of Faith covers much of the same ground as the Articles of Religion, but it is shorter and the language is more contemporary. <b>The</b> <b>Confession</b> of Faith also contains an article on the Judgment and Future State (derived from <b>the</b> Augsburg <b>Confession)</b> which had not been present in the Methodist Articles of Religion.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Confessions</b> Tour is {{the second}} live album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on January 26, 2007 by Warner Bros. Records.

The DVD contains the entire concert and the CD includes thirteen live songs only. The album became the first release from Semtex Films, a production company founded by Madonna in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities {{and the role of}} women in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its moral code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as <b>The</b> <b>Confessions</b> of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{agreement}} {{as to the}} order in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in each statement. The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the sheriff-substitute, the procurator fiscal and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was {{in the form of an}} interview with the Edinburgh Courant that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders. Contemporary reports also differ from <b>the</b> <b>confessions</b> of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and Owen Dudley Edwards, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.|$|E

50|$|During the diet, {{the cities}} of Weißenburg in Bayern, Heilbronn, Kempten, and Windesheim also {{expressed}} their concurrence with <b>the</b> <b>confession.</b> <b>The</b> emperor had ordered <b>the</b> <b>confession</b> to be presented {{to him at the}} next session, 24 June.

5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how <b>the</b> <b>Confession</b> of Faith would be interpreted.
