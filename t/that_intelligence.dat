5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Roger Fleetwood Hesketh TD, DL, OBE, {{was the son}} of Major Charles Hesketh Fleetwood-Hesketh. Like his father, he {{was educated}} at Eton and Oxford before {{becoming}} a barrister, and later a soldier. Hesketh, then a major, joined Ops (B) alongside Jervis-Read as the department's only intelligence officer. Colonel John Bevan, in setting up the unit, felt that it would only require operational capabilities, and <b>that</b> <b>intelligence</b> would remain with his own London Controlling Section; but with the arrival of Wild, Hesketh was handed control of an expanded intelligence section, which included his brother, Cuthbert, a civilian secretary and an MI5 liaison officer.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon then tells Rico {{to hurry}} to his hideout, where Rico learns <b>that</b> <b>intelligence</b> asset Jade Tan has been {{captured}} in Panay's military base {{and will be}} tortured and—possibly-summarily executed. Although Rico rescues her and destroys the base, Jade is bundled into a truck and a fleet of gunmen try to escape along a frozen lake. A nuclear submarine emerges from the ice, but Rico hijacks the truck and they are airlifted to safety by Kane (Sheldon and Rico's mission handler). Jade later explains that the Roaches, Reapers, and Ular Boys are secretly backed by Russia, China, and Japan, respectively, to bring down Baby Panay, but Rico and Sheldon wonder what the small island has which is so attractive to superpowers. They track down and assassinate the foreign intelligence officers liaising with the factions.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 two No. 38 Squadron King Airs were {{deployed}} to Vanuatu {{as part of}} Australia's aid effort following Cyclone Pam. The aircraft were used to conduct flights over the affected areas to assess {{the extent of the}} damage, and also evacuated Australian and New Zealand citizens. In February 2016 it was reported that the RAAF was considering consolidating its two squadrons equipped with King Airs into a single squadron located at RAAF Base East Sale. All of the RAAF's King Airs were grounded from 30 June 2016 after the hazardous chemical strontium chromate was detected in the aircraft; in the period immediately before the grounding No. 38 Squadron had been involved in flying politicians during the 2016 federal election. The King Airs began to return to service on 4 August that year after being cleaned. As part of its budget for the 2016-17 financial year, the Australian Government announced <b>that</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare equipment would be acquired for three of No. 38 Squadron's King Airs. This equipment will comprise roll-on/roll-off kits, and will be delivered during the financial year.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{days later}} he {{received}} permission for another daylight sortie. Squadron Leader Robertson joined him on this occasion as his flight engineer. He flew to Lasham {{to pick up a}} Mosquito. His target on this occasion would be Denmark. The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so he flew to Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie. Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft. So far away from the battle zones, the Germans did not expect to be attacked by the enemy. Neither made much attempt to defend themselves. The first, a Junkers W 34 transport, was shot down and the second, a Junkers Ju 52, tried a crash-landing only to nose-over and crumple the wings. Braham strafed it to ensure destruction. His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds. On 4 April he returned to France. Lacking radar, Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft. He flew to Bordeaux looking for He 177s <b>that</b> <b>intelligence</b> suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux–Mérignac. Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire.|$|E

25|$|The exact peak age {{of fluid}} {{intelligence}} or crystallized intelligence remains elusive.

25|$|In IQ and Global Inequality Lynn and Vanhanen argue <b>that</b> <b>intelligence,</b> as {{measured}} by IQ tests, is {{a major contributor to}} national wealth as well as to various measures of social well-being. They base this argument on the finding that nations' average IQs have a strong correlation with several such factors, among them adult literacy (0.64), tertiary education (0.75), life expectancy (0.77), and democratization (0.57). The book is a follow-up to Lynn and Vanhanen's 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, and expands on many of the ideas presented in their earlier book.|$|E
25|$|In {{the model}} Piaget {{developed}} in stage three, he argued <b>that</b> <b>intelligence</b> develops {{in a series}} of stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur. For each stage of development the child forms a view of reality for that age period. At the next stage, the child must keep up with earlier level of mental abilities to reconstruct concepts. Piaget conceived intellectual development as an upward expanding spiral in which children must constantly reconstruct the ideas formed at earlier levels with new, higher order concepts acquired at the next level.|$|E
25|$|Jensen {{also argued}} that even if g were {{replaced}} by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected.

Hans Eysenck responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said <b>that</b> <b>intelligence</b> was an area located in the brain. Eysenck also argued IQ tests were not racist, pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on IQ tests, and this would not please European racists.|$|E
