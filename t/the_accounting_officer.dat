40|$|The {{background}} {{for taking the}} topic of code-switching {{is due to the}} fact that for a large percentage of the people of the world speak more than one language which is a natural way of life with a variety of factors determining which language will be spoken on any particular occasion. People have frequently been immersed in a veritable ocean of cross current of talk: therefore, no one speaks in the same way. Besides that they code-switch, that is, they use more than one language in the execution of a speech act. In communicating people tend to code-switch from one language to another language. In other words, code switching commonly takes place in society and in any speech event. The study under report was done to find answer to the following research questions: (i) what language are mostly switched by <b>the</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Officers</b> of “Bisnis Bank” in Surabaya when interviewing their customers, and how often does the code-switching occur in each language? (ii) what are the reasons for <b>the</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Officers</b> of “Bisnis Bank” in Surabaya and their customers switch from one code to another when talking to each other during the interviews? And, (iii) how does the code-switching affect the interviewers and interviewees in the interviews? Using a set of questionnaires the writer elicited answers from <b>the</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Officers</b> of “Bisnis Bank” and their customers in Surabaya about the reasons and the effects they often switched from one code to another. The instruments used to analyze the data are of four kinds: (I) a set of questionnaires to elicit answer from the participants for reasons and effects of code-switching; (II) a parameter to designate factors accounted for code-switching; (III) a worksheet to record the number of occurrence of linguistic items being switched; (IV) a summary of the total number of frequency of occurrence of code-switching in the interviews. The data analysis brought the following results: First, the languages mostly switched were English Javanese and Chinese. The code-switching from Indonesian (which was the medium of the interviews) to English occurred 49 times, to Javanese 28 times and to Chinese 18 items. Second, <b>the</b> factors <b>accounted</b> for <b>the</b> code-switching were: (1) settings of interviews are formal, but once in a while become informal: (2) participant relationship was distance with low solidarity showing superiority, but once in a while showing high solidarity due to ethnic identity: (3) the function was referential, affective and rhetorical; and (4) the participants attitudes were positive due to multilingualism, showing ethnic consciousness and unawareness when code-switching. Third, the relatively high frequency of code-switching resulted in the effectiveness of the interviews, smoothened the progress of the interviews so that <b>the</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Officers</b> and their customers understood each other better. In brief, one can say that the code-switching done by both <b>the</b> <b>Account</b> <b>officers</b> and their customers have been proper and effective for the sake of better understanding between them in terms of the successfulness of doing business. The writer hopes that the study under report will be able to stimulate other students of socio-linguistics to carry out other researchers on the aspects of code-switching in particular and on other aspects of socio-linguistics in general. The writer also hopes that the findings of this study should give a good input to the field of sociolinguistics that is to enrich the branches of sociolinguistics studies in general. The findings of this study should also propose an input to the field of sociolinguistics especially at the English Department of Widya Mandala University that is to give a better understanding of code-switching...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Financial Accounting)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{report of}} <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> {{is of little}} or no value. There is {{uncertainty}} about the duties of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> where there are material omissions and mistakes in the accounting records and financial statements of the close corporation because the report of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> must only state that the financial statements are {{in agreement with the}} accounting records. Nowhere in the Close Corporation Act it is stated what the duties of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> are whether he is aware or not of such mistakes or omissions. The close corporation doesn't require <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> to do an audit on the books and records of the close corporation, and the accounting officers are therefore under the impression that they may not be held liable for all the debts of the close corporation. <b>The</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> is however vulnerable as his duties in terms of the Close Corporation Act are far reaching and he cannot fulfil his duties completely unless he has done an audit, and can therefore be held liable for the debts of the close corporation. He can further be held liable for the debts of the close corporation due to the following: 7. 1 the shortcomings in the Close Corporation Act nr. 69 of 1984; 7. 2 the impracticability of the Close Corporation Act; 7. 3 the vagueness and indistinctness of certain articles in the Act that <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> must comply with or are exposed to; 7. 4 <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> may use his professional judgment to investigate the accounting records of the close corporation, and nothing prohibits him to do so if he think it lit. If however he is of the opinion that {{it is not necessary to}} investigate the accounting records, this will contribute towards <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> becoming liable for the debts of the close corporation, although the Act doesn't require <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> to do an audit on the books and records of the close corporation. In the case where <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> decides to investigate the books and records of the close corporation, his duties are extensive because he takes the decision to investigate. 7. 5 <b>The</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> act in many cases as advisor/bookkeeper/ accountant for the CC, because of the size and nature of the entity, and by doing that, he then participates in the management of the CC and he is then vulnerable in terms of section 64 of the Close Corporation Act to be liable for all the debts of the corporation, without being the accounting officer's intention to participate in the management of the close corporation. 7. 6 The powers of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> are not fully addressed in the Close Corporation Act and <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> is not properly protected by the Act. Because of the current Close Corporations Act, the interpretation and use thereof, <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> is excessively vulnerable to creditors and third parties of the close corporation and he can be held liable for all the debts of the close corporation. Amendments and changes to the act are necessary to clarify the duties of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> and to get certainty about certain articles in the Act which are vague.
