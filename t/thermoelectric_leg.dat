40|$|Temperature {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} environmental stimuli to record and amplify. While traditional thermoelectric materials are attractive for temperature/heat flow sensing applications, their sensitivity is limited by their low Seebeck coefficient (similar to 100 mu V K- 1). Here we take advantage of the large ionic thermoelectric Seebeck coefficient found in polymer electrolytes (similar to 10, 000 mu V K- 1) to introduce the concept of ionic thermoelectric gating a low-voltage organic transistor. The temperature sensing amplification of such ionic thermoelectric-gated devices is thousands of times superior to that of a single <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>leg</b> in traditional thermopiles. This suggests that ionic thermoelectric sensors offer a way to go beyond the limitations of traditional thermopiles and pyroelectric detectors.

40|$|Abstract. Thermoelectric (TE) {{devices are}} an {{interested}} family of energy harvesters which could convert the thermal energy into electricity.

40|$|Traditional {{thermoelectric}} Peltier coolers {{exhibit a}} cooling limit which is primarily {{determined by the}} figure of merit, zT. Rather than a fundamental thermodynamic limit, this bound {{can be traced to}} the difficulty of maintaining thermoelectric compatibility. Self-compatibility locally maximizes the cooler's coefficient of performance for a given zT and can be achieved by adjusting the relative ratio of the thermoelectric transport properties that make up zT. In this study, we investigate the theoretical performance of thermoelectric coolers that maintain self-compatibility across the device. We find such a device behaves very differently from a Peltier cooler, and term self-compatible coolers "Thomson coolers" when the Fourier heat divergence is dominated by the Thomson, as opposed to the Joule, term. A Thomson cooler requires an exponentially rising Seebeck coefficient with increasing temperature, while traditional Peltier coolers, such as those used commercially, have comparatively minimal change in Seebeck coefficient with temperature. When reasonable material property bounds are placed on the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>leg,</b> the Thomson cooler is predicted to achieve approximately twice the maximum temperature drop of a traditional Peltier cooler with equivalent figure of merit (zT).

LIFT is a laser-assisted method {{that has been}} employed for the transfer of materials such as metals, semiconductors, liquids and dielectrics. A part of a thin film (donor) previously coated onto a transparent carrier substrate is transferred onto a nearby receiver by the explosive expansion of {{a small part of}} the donor volume transformed on absorption of a laser pulse. Thereby donor and receiver do not necessarily need to match their lattice or thermal parameters.

We compared the cases when a uniform voltage is applied at the contact and when a uniform current density is applied. The finite element calculation results demonstrate that in the latter case the 3 D single-leg element has a very non-uniform temperature distribution at the contact area. Maximum cooling in the center region is 92 0 C, which is 20 % higher than the 1 D limit (76 0 C) for a typical Bi 2 Te 3 material with ZT~ 1.

Liquid flow and heat transfer coefficient will change the background temperature of the chip but they also affect the performance of the solid-state coolers used to remove hot spots.

During the past decade or so, new thermoelectric materials have been an active area of research. As a result, several new high figure of merit (zT) materials have been identified, but practical devices using these new materials have not yet been reported. A physics-based compact model could be used to simulate a thermoelectric devices within a full system using SPICE-compatible circuit simulators. If such a model accepts measured or simulated material parameters, it would be useful in exploring the system level applications of new materials. In this thesis, the ground work for such a compact model is developed and tested. I begin with a discussion of thermoelectric transport theory within the Landauer formalism. The Landauer formalism is used as the basis of the tool LanTraP, which uses full band descriptions to calculate the distribution of modes and thermoelectric transport parameters, which can serve as the input to a compact model. Next, an equivalent circuit model is presented, explained, and tested using a simple Bi 2 Te 3 <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>leg.</b> The equivalent circuit is shown to perform well under a variety of DC, transient, and AC small signal operating conditions. With the equivalent circuit it is easy to determine the maximum cold side temperature drop, the maximum cold side heat absorbed, the temperature profile within the leg, the temperature response to a pulsed current, and impedance over a range of frequencies.

40|$|DoktorgradsavhandlingThermoelectric Generators (TEG) are a {{potential}} technology for waste heat recovery. At their hearts, thermoelectric materials convert a heat flux into electric current. By placing TEGs {{on the surface}} of a waste heat source, some of the heat can be converted into valuable electric energy. However, todays state-of-the art materials have low efficiencies, are limited to low temperature operation, contains toxic and rare elements and are in general not cost-effective for such applications. New thermoelectric materials are needed that can overcome these barriers. In this thesis, two classes of materials have been investigated; skutterudites and silicides. Both have relatively high efficiencies, can be used at high temperatures (400 - 500 °C) and contain cheaper and less toxic compounds than state-of-the-art materials. To move these materials from lab-scale testing into real-life applications, the focus is shifted from optimizing for thermoelectric efficiency to long-term stability. As these materials will be used at higher temperatures, different temperature activated processes leading to degradation of the materials needs to be accounted for and controlled, such as oxidation and interdiffusion. Adoption into industrial mass production requires simple and cheap synthesis methods that produces homogenous materials. Homogenous materials are very important for achieving stable thermoelectric and mechanical properties over time. Secondary phases can easily form during synthesis of skutterudites, and knowledge about the formation and annihilation of such phases during synthesis was therefore studied thoroughly as these can have unbeneficial effect on both thermoelectric properties and thermal durability. Understanding the mechanisms and kinetics governing skutterudite formation is of great importance for optimizing synthesis parameters leading to faster and more homogenous production of skutterudites. P-type skutterudites with composition Fi 0. 6 Co 2 Fe 2 Sb 12 (Fi = In, Ca, Ce and Yb) were synthesized to look at the effect of filler element and microstructure. Ce-filled sample was furthermore synthesized using four different methods to assess the effect of synthesis method on secondary phase formation and thermoelectric properties. A precursor method was found to not only be the fastest method, but also produce the most homogenous material with highest zT of 0. 7. An important contribution of this thesis is the results and discussion around peritectic formation and transformation in the skutterudite system. In addition to grain size, the diffusivity of the filler element in skutterudite was found to be the main factor governing transformation time into phase pure skutterudite. High temperature oxidation of skutterudites as a function of filler atoms and iron content were furthermore investigated. Residual secondary phases resulting from incomplete transformation into the phase pure skutterudite, such as FeSb 2 and CeSb 2, were found to have severe effects on the oxidation rate. High iron content was also found to lower the onset temperature of oxidation in accordance with previous studies. In addition, the effect of In as a filler element was found to form an intermediate InSb layer that actually caused a reduction in oxidation rate. Also the high temperature oxidation of Mg 2 (Si-Sn) was studied {{as a function of the}} Sn content. All these materials formed a passivating outer layer of MgO. Above a certain ignition temperature, the MgO layer broke down and the oxidation proceeded exponentially. An increasing Sn content was found to significantly lower the ignition temperature due to formation of liquid Sn below the MgO layer. Similarly, the Pilling-Bedworth ratio (ratio of volume of oxide to volume of underlying alloy) was found to affect the ignition temperature. In both these oxidation studies, the common theme is that variations in elemental composition affect the resistance towards oxidation significantly. Clearly, these materials need to be optimized not only in terms of thermoelectric performance, but also stability towards oxidation. First of all, oxidizing resistant materials can be employed in application without the need of protective environments such as coatings or encapsulations. Secondly, control of the oxidation mechanisms is import in a mass production process both to ease the production process and to avoid accumulation of oxides in the final material. An alternative to oxidation resistant materials is the application of coatings on the outer surfaces. Several commercially available coatings were tested on both skutterudite and silicide. An aluminum-based coating was found most promising and could protect both material classes from oxidation during thermal cycling up to temperatures of 500 - 550 °C. It is believed that further optimization of this type of coating has a good future for use in protection of thermoelectric materials at high temperatures. To assess how different thermally activated degradation process affect the performance of thermoelectric materials and modules, long term testing of both single functionalized legs and prototype modules were conducted. A new test method was developed, where several single legs were electrically characterized separately throughout thermal cycling. This made it possible to compare different types of coatings with uncoated material, thereby identify the effect of the degradation processes upon performance. Both diffusion of metal contact into <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>leg,</b> oxidation in from sides, and crack formation, were found to significantly affect the performance of the legs over time, by reducing open circuit voltage and increasing inner resistance. Finally, several silicide based modules were assembled and tested. The n-type and p-type material was Mg 2 (Si-Sn) and MnSi 1. 75 respectively. The highest power of 3 W was measured for one of these modules at hot side temperatures of 700 °C and an estimated efficiency of 5. 3 % – the highest efficiency recorded to date for modules made purely of silicides. However, long term testing of one of these modules revealed gradual reduction in performance. Post-characterization showed how particularly oxidation and interdiffusion between <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>leg</b> and metal contact played a major role in the decline in power output...|$|E
40|$|One way {{to further}} {{optimize}} the thermoelectric properties toward a higher ZT is a temperature stable nanoengineering of materials, where the thermal conductivity {{is reduced by}} increasing the phonon scattering at the grain boundaries. To study this, Nb-substituted CaMnO 3 perovskite-type material was synthesized by ultrasonic spray combustion (USC).

Micro or nano scale {{thermoelectric}} (TE) modules {{have received}} increasing attention {{because of their}} potential applications as energy supplying and thermal managing components in microelectronic devices and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). In the present work, microscale thermoelectric modules are fabricated by combining mechanical cutting and photolithograph processes from nano-sized silicon carbide (SiC) particles reinforced Bi 2 Te 3 -based materials (Bi 2 Te 3 for n type, and Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 for p type) prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS).

Concentrating solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs) {{have the advantage of}} replacing the mechanical power block with a solid-state heat engine based on the Seebeck effect, simplifying the system. The highest reported efficiency of STEGs so far is 5. 2 %. Here, we report experimental measurements of STEGs with a peak efficiency of 9. 6 % at an optically concentrated normal solar irradiance of 211 [*]kW[*]m⁻², and a system efficiency of 7. 4 % after considering optical concentration losses. The performance improvement is achieved by the use of segmented <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>legs,</b> a high-temperature spectrally selective solar absorber enabling stable vacuum operation with absorber temperatures up to 600 °C, and combining optical and thermal concentration.

40|$|Meeting {{the ever}} growing global energy demand with mostly fossil fuel based energy {{technologies}} is not sustainable, pollutes {{the environment and}} is {{the main cause of}} climate change threatening our planet as we know it. Solar energy technologies are a promising, sustainable and clean alternative due to the vast abundance of sunlight. Thus far, photovoltaic solar cells and concentrated solar power are considered to be the most promising approaches. Solar cells directly convert sunlight into electricity by photon induced electron-hole pair generation. Concentrated solar power captures the sunlight in form of heat which is then converted to electricity by means of a traditional mechanical power block. In this thesis, we explore solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs) as an alternative way to convert sunlight to electricity. Similar to concentrated solar power STEGs capture the sunlight in form of heat. However, the captured heat is directly converted to electricity by means of a thermoelectric generator. This solid-state direct heat-to-electricity conversion significantly simplifies the system, reduces cost and maintenance and enables transient operation and system scalability without affecting the performance. Therefore, STEGs have the potential to be deployed as small scale solar power converters in remote areas and on rooftops and as large scale concentrated solar power plants. While the concept of solar thermoelectric power conversion has been proposed over a century ago, most successful experimental efforts reported in, the literature have been limited to below 1 % for STEGs without optical concentration and to approximately 3 - 5 % with optical concentration. Theoretical STEG performances as modeled and discussed in this thesis predict significantly higher efficiencies. A detailed STEG model is introduced to theoretically investigate various parasitic losses and how to minimize their effect to obtain highest and most realistic performance predictions. Additionally, a methodology to optimize a photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid system based on spectral splitting is introduced. The optimization and performance prediction of a STEG is only accurate if the relevant material properties are known with high accuracy. However, typical spectroscopy techniques to determine the optical properties, namely the solar absorptance and infrared emittance, of a solar absorber have shortcomings which can lead to significant errors. Similarly, typical commercial equipment to measure the properties of thermoelectric materials including the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical resistivity and the thermal conductivity are prone to large errors. Therefore, we introduce in this thesis novel experimental techniques to measure all relevant properties with improved accuracies in particular the techniques to measure the total hemispherical emittance of a surface and a material's thermal conductivity. A record-low total hemispherical emittance of 0. 13 at 500 °C is demonstrated for an Yttria-stabilized-Zirconia-based cermet solar absorber with solar absorptance of 0. 91 and thermal stability up to 600 °C. Furthermore, a method was developed to directly measure the efficiency of a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>leg.</b> Using this method a record-high thermoelectric efficiency of 8. 5 % is demonstrated at a relatively small temperature difference of 225 °C for a novel MgAgSb-based compound with hot-pressed silver contact pads. By increasing the temperature difference to a material's compatible 275 °C a thermoelectric efficiency of 10 % is achievable which, thus far, has only been achieve at almost twice the temperature difference. The third main contribution of this thesis is the experimental demonstration of solar thermoelectric power conversion. A record-high STEG efficiency of 4. 6 % is demonstrated at AM 1. 5 G (1 kW/m 2) conditions which is 7 times higher than previously reported best values. The performance improvement is achieved by using a STEG with nano-structured bulk thermoelectric materials, a spectrally-selective solar absorber and taking advantage of large thermal concentrations under a vacuum. Despite the vacuum environment and the use of a low-temperature spectrally-selective solar absorber the optimal hot-junction operating temperature is limited to approximately 200 °C due to increasing thermal radiation heat loss. In order to substantially increase the operating temperature difference and STEG efficiency, larger incident solar power densities are required. Furthermore, the STEG requires segmented thermoelectric legs and a high-temperature stable solar absorber. The optimized STEGs are fabricated and tested at moderate and high optical solar concentration. Efficiencies of close to 8 % at 38 suns and close to 10 % at 211 suns, measured based on the solar flux at the absorber, are demonstrated for a STEG with a spectrally-selective solar absorber. The maximum demonstrated solar-to-electricity CSTEG efficiency is 7. 5 %. Furthermore, the performance of a STEG at moderate optical concentration with a high-temperature stable black paint solar absorber and a directionally-selective solar receiver cavity is demonstrated to be comparable to a STEG with a spectrally-selective surface at similar insolation. by Daniel Kraemer.

40|$|Traditional {{processes}} of making contacts (metallization layer) onto bulk crystalline Bi 2 Te 3 -based materials {{do not work}} for nanostructured thermoelectric materials either because of weak bonding strength or an unstable contact interface at temperatures higher than 200 °C. Hot pressing of nickel contact onto nanostructured <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>legs</b> in a one-step process leads to strong bonding.

A systematic study was carried out to investigate the detailed reaction and diffusion at the interface of the nickel layer and n-type Bi[subscript 2]Te[subscript 3]-based thermoelectric material layer. We found that a p-type region formed within the n-type Bi[subscript 2]Te[subscript 2. 7]Se[subscript 0. 3] during hot pressing due to Te deficiency and Ni doping, leading to a large contact resistance.

40|$|Recently, SnSe {{material}} with an outstanding high ZT (Figure of merit) of 2. 6 has {{attracted much attention}} due to its strong applicability for highly efficient thermoelectric devices. Many studies following the first journal publication have been focused on SnSe materials, not on thermoelectric devices. Particularly, to realize highly efficient intermediate-temperature (600 ~ 1000 K) thermoelectric modules with this promising thermoelectric material, a more thermally and electrically reliable interface bonding technology needs to be developed so that the modules can stably perform their power generation in this temperature range. In this work, we demonstrate several approaches to develop metallization layers on SnSe <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>legs.</b> The single-layer metallization shows limitations in their electrical contact resistances and elemental diffusions. The Ag/Co/Ti multi-layer metallization results in lowering their electrical contact resistances, {{in addition to providing}} more robust interfaces.
