5|$|In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly {{from its}} birthplace in Florence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Italy and soon <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Europe.

As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.|$|E
