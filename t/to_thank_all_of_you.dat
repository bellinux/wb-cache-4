5000|$|... "The Famine {{never should}} have existed. I don’t mean that like when a jealous brother screams 'I wish you were never born!' at his little sister. What I mean is that we came {{together}} {{as a group of}} married thirty-somethings with kids and small businesses. Our singer lived {{on the other side of}} the country. It was a cumbersome proposition, but we made it work. Most of you are familiar with the fire that claimed most of our equipment and the departure of our vocalist about a year ago. We should have never been able to make our last record, but we did. This brings us to the present day.As of this past Saturday, The Famine is no more. In my mind, bands break up because Courtney Lovekills their singer or because they can’t stand each other. Neither of those circumstances is descriptive of our situation. For us, life simply got in the way, as it often does. Mark and Andy both have families for which they are the breadwinners, and Jon has been putting off going to graduate school. Instead of trying to simultaneously satiate Mark’s drive and Andy’s inability to tour and my distance from the band and Jon’s webbed toes (sorry, Jon), we came together and decided as a group that it is time to lay The Famine to rest.Words cannot express how thankful we all are to have had these experiences, and without those of you who are reading this right now, none of this would have been possible. So, from the bottom of my heart, I want <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> for the support and kindness you have shown us for the past four years. Thank you for allowing us in to your lives, and for giving us the opportunity to connect, even though most of us have never met. You’ll see us around. You might not see the same faces or the same names, but I know that music means too much to all of us to let it die with this moniker. So, this is goodbye for now.-Love,Nick" ...|$|E
