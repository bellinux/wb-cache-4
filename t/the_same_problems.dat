5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade (Brigadier James Hill) {{began to}} land {{at the same time}} as the main {{elements}} of 5th Parachute Brigade, and suffered from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems.</b> All of its constituent units were scattered throughout the area due to poor navigation, heavy cloud cover, and several of the drop-zones either not being marked correctly or marked correctly but incorrectly positioned due to pathfinder error.|$|E
5|$|The BDI {{suffers from}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> as other self-report inventories, in that scores {{can be easily}} exaggerated or {{minimized}} by the person completing them. Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can {{have an effect on}} the final score. If a patient is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians. However, {{at least until}} the late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which suffered from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> as had the first Armstrong guns.|$|E

5|$|With {{the army}} revitalized, Saint-Just {{returned}} briefly to Paris where his success was applauded. However, {{there was little}} time to celebrate. He was quickly {{sent back to the}} frontlines, this time in Belgium where the Army of the North was experiencing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> of discipline and organization. Again he delivered results ruthlessly and effectively, but after less than a month the mission was cut short. As Paris convulsed in political violence, his assistance was required by Robespierre.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems,</b> a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Defence against torpedo boats was {{provided}} by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known. Four of these were mounted on the main deck in casemates {{on the sides of}} the hull and suffered from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> as the six-inch guns. Hood also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted in the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship was fitted with seven 18-inch Torpedo tubes. Two of these were mounted in the bow below the waterline, four were placed in the sides of the hull, two on each broadside, and one in the stern. These last five tubes were all above water. She also was fitted with a plough-shaped underwater ram.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems,</b> leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, {{he felt that the}} multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> with the controls. 1UP.com editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer editor Matthew Kato described the controls as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described the controls as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots. In the first four days of the Wii version's release in Japan, Mario Power Tennis sold 56,000 copies. By January 3, 2010, it had sold 205,070 copies in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Cyrus Cylinder bears {{striking}} {{similarities to}} older Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. Two notable examples are the Cylinder of Marduk-apla-iddina II, who seized the Babylonian throne in 722/1 BC, and {{the annals of}} Sargon II of Assyria, who conquered Babylon twelve years later. As a conqueror, Marduk-apla-iddina faced many of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> of legitimacy that Cyrus did when he conquered Babylon. He declares himself to have been chosen personally by Marduk, who ensured his victory. When he took power, he performed the sacred rites and restored the sacred shrines. He states that he found a royal inscription placed in the temple foundations by an earlier Babylonian king, which he left undisturbed and honored. All of these claims also appear in Cyrus's Cylinder. Twelve years later, the Assyrian king Sargon II defeated and exiled Marduk-apla-iddina, taking up the kingship of Babylonia. Sargon's annals describe how he took on the duties of a Babylonian sovereign, honouring the gods, maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding the privileges of the urban elite. Again, Cyrus's Cylinder makes exactly the same points. Nabonidus, Cyrus's deposed predecessor as king of Babylon, commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders – such as the Cylinder of Nabonidus, also in the British Museum – that follows the same basic formula.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to {{evacuate}} via Mogadishu International Airport. Soon after the evacuation request, the United States Air Force deployed C-130 transport planes and an AC-130, for gunfire support, to Nairobi, Kenya, awaiting clearances to enter Somalia {{and the ability to}} safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport. However, the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances. It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command-and-control structure, making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage. Likewise, government troops faced a command-and-control problem; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines, in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with. Thus, it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible. Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu, but faced <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport.|$|E
5|$|The script {{demanded a}} dry location: an {{agricultural}} village {{where it had}} not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> {{at that time and}} hence the village of Kunariya, located a few miles away from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of Lagaan, it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating , with further contributions during the year.|$|E
5|$|With the ROK army in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's 5th Divisions all {{advanced}} steadily {{south along}} the eastern roads without encountering much resistance. Across the entire front the North Korean Army had successfully routed the South Koreans and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment acted as an advance force, attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country. The rugged terrain of the eastern regions of Korea, poor communication equipment, and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the South Korean resistance. The North Koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problems</b> themselves. The 5th Division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously, sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure {{they would not be}} threatened from the rear. However, this more cautious advance began to give the South Koreans valuable time to build up further south. By June 28, the 766th had infiltrated into Taebaek-san from Uljin and was moving toward Ilwolsan, Yongyang and Cheongsong in order to block communications between Daegu and Busan, where United States Army forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing ROK Army.|$|E
