We study methods for <b>telling</b> <b>when</b> two fans give rise to homeomorphic toric varieties.

Beginners can find this information through research and classes. Tasting soap for readiness is not recommended, as sodium and potassium hydroxides, when not saponified, are highly caustic.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to <b>tell.</b> <b>When</b> I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

500|$|In a {{separate}} publishing from The New York Times, David Browne criticized the song's overuse of processed vocals, writing that: [...] "As heard on her current single 'We R Who We R' {{from her new}} mini-album, 'Cannibal,' Kesha has a thin, often computer-manipulated voice that recalls ’80s new-wave pop acts. It’s often hard to <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> her singing voice ends and the Vocoder processing kicks in." [...] Rolling Stone gave the song {{two and a half}} stars out of five, referring to the combination of Kesha's style and the song's themes as an [...] "awkward fit". However, Rolling Stone later placed the song at number 50 in its Best 50 Singles of 2010 list.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{partnership}} with Fingleton {{was regarded as}} one of the great opening pairings in Australian Test cricket history. In ten Tests as an opening combination, the pair averaged 63.75 for the first wicket, higher than any other Australian duo with more than 1000 runs. Brown was known for his self-effacing nature and was well liked among teammates and opponents alike. Of his batting, Brown joked that [...] "My wife said you could always <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> I was batting by the number of people leaving the ground". During a domestic match at the Adelaide Oval in December 1938, he deflected a ball onto his stumps without dislodging a bail. He added a further 147 runs to end unbeaten on 174, eternally apologising for his luck.|$|E

500|$|Although Hamming {{had been}} hired to work on {{elasticity}} theory, he still {{spent much of his}} time with the calculating machines. Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off. Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen [...] "bits". If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a parity bit was used to verify the correctness of each sequence. [...] "If the computer can <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> an error has occurred," [...] Hamming reasoned, [...] "surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{the three}} schools, St. Lulim has the least {{emphasis}} on romance between characters, although the Lulim characters are typically found together. The leader of their friendly group is Chikaru Minamoto, the student council president of Lulim, and a born leader. She has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to offer advice {{or simply a}} shoulder to cry on. The other three girls include Kizuna Hyūga, a very outgoing and excitable girl who enjoys following Chikaru's decisions, finding fun in doing so. She is very expressive in her actions and words, not wasting a chance to introduce herself to anyone new. Her close friend is Remon Natsume, who is much like Kizuna in personality, but is not as accident-prone as her. Of the pair, Kizuna is the more talkative; Remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be. Lastly, there is Kagome Byakudan, {{the youngest of the}} group, who is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear [...] which she often talks to as if it were alive. Although she does not talk or express her emotions much, she has a heightened perception of others' emotions and can <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> those around her are distraught or in emotional pain.|$|E

500|$|Work on DJ Hero 2 started {{some months}} after the first game was completed, as the {{development}} team had endured heavy working hours to meet the release deadline. [...] FreeStyleGames' creative director Jamie Jackson said that DJ Hero 2 took about seven months to complete. While {{they were able to}} easily build on the existing framework for DJ Hero, FreeStyleGames wanted {{to do more than just}} include new mixes, and sought to include additional features such as the Battle Mixes into the game. [...] Many of the game's new features are a result of feedback from players, including the game's social modes and improvements in the game's interface to provide a cleaner look and instantaneous visual feedback to the player. The team also worked at improving the game's graphics; the appearance of DJ Heros graffiti-based menus gave the impression of being a hip-hop game, but FreeStyleGames wanted to distance DJ Hero 2 from that. They also wanted to clean up the gameplay's interface, providing better feedback to the player and making it easily to <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> they were winning or losing. [...] While DJ Hero 2 does not use Kinect or PlayStation Move motion-sensing technology, Jackson had not ruled them out for a future iteration of the game.|$|E
500|$|... "The Stolen Earth" [...] is {{the first}} {{appearance}} of the Daleks since [...] "Evolution of the Daleks", which was filmed eighteen {{months prior to the}} episode; consequently, the prop controllers experienced difficulty re-adapting to their roles. Davies's inclusion of the Daleks as part of the crossover was intended to create a [...] "charged atmosphere" [...] for the protagonists: Jack was killed by the Daleks; Rose and Martha were present at two of their apparent extinctions; and Sarah was present at their creation. The animatronic of the Dalek mutant had to be recreated for the episode, because the previous prop that was used in [...] "Dalek" [...] and [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] was irreversibly damaged by water when the latter was filmed. [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] features two new variants of Daleks: the Supreme Dalek, coloured red as an allusion to the Peter Cushing film Dr. Who and the Daleks; and the partially destroyed Dalek Caan. Caan was described in the shooting script as: [...] Voice actor Nicholas Briggs adopted a different voice for each model: he adopted a grandiose voice for the Supreme Dalek to fit his perception of the character as egotistical; and he adopted a sing-song voice for Caan to reflect the character's insanity as a result of entering the Time War. Briggs justified his interpretation of Caan by explaining that [...] " [...] can't <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> he's happy or sad, his emphasis is very strange and he finds things funny when things aren't funny", creating a soothsayer personality with an [...] "almost pure" [...] mind.

500|$|While Retro Studios {{tried to}} create [...] "the {{ultimate}} first-person experience" [...] with the Metroid Prime series, Sakamoto's approach with gameplay was different, particularly for the story Other M intended to <b>tell.</b> <b>When</b> Sakamoto met Team Ninja, he said his intent was a game with [...] "controls as simple as those of a NES game", so it would appeal to modern players. Team Ninja agreed with that approach, as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre, {{and tried to make}} the game employ only the Wii Remote, without resorting to the Nunchuk expansion. The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action, with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed. Sakamoto focused on 2D-like gameplay because he considered it more [...] "comfortable" [...] for audiences, particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes, as he thought 2D [...] " [...] have the same distractions when you want to give them story sequences". While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the Prime series as they were games with different concepts, a few of the elements that [...] "made those games unique" [...] were implemented into Other M, such as the [...] "immersive sight" [...] of the first-person mode. When questioned if Other M would be too similar to Ninja Gaiden, Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action-based sequences, there will still be the exploration-based sequences characteristic of other Metroid games. Sakamoto said that Other Ms story progression was {{in the same manner as}} Metroid Fusion, and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is [...] "unlike anything that's ever been done at Nintendo; it's more than just a collaborative effort — it's one group working toward a common goal".|$|E
