5|$|Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a {{kind and}} loving boy living in poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four {{bedridden}} grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> on the tubes. However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his job because the factory replaced him with a machine that puts <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> and {{the stems}} contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E

5|$|Morchella snyderi can be {{distinguished}} from similar North American morels by differences in ecological and morphological features. M.frustrata resembles young specimens of M.snyderi, but the ridges of <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> of the former species do not darken in maturity, and it has smaller ascospores, measuring 20–29 by 14–19µm. Another potential lookalike, M.brunnea, has a browner fruit body color in young specimens, and a stipe that is not lacunose.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>caps</b> {{form from}} the top of the short stipe by the growth and {{expansion}} of a blunt margin and later as a thickening of the upper surface. Spines start to form when the cap hangs over the stipe slightly. They are white in many species, but become brown in maturity as the brown-colored spores accumulate on the surface.|$|E
5|$|The type {{material}} was collected in 1990, near the Haast Pass crossing the Makarora River. The specific epithet makarorae {{refers to the}} type locality. P.makarorae is classified in Gastón Guzmán's section Mexicanae owing to the spore shape and bluing reaction upon injury. It is distinguished from other species in this section {{by the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>caps,</b> the presence of pleurocystidia, and the short-necked cheilocystidia.|$|E

5|$|Accompanied {{in theaters}} by the Mickey Mouse {{featurette}} The Prince and the Pauper, The Rescuers Down Under (1990) was Disney's first animated feature sequel and the studio's first film {{to be fully}} colored and composited via computer using <b>the</b> <b>CAPS</b> system. However, the film did not duplicate the success of The Little Mermaid. The next Disney animated feature, Beauty and the Beast, had begun production in London but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided to shutter the London satellite office and retool the film into a musical-comedy format similar to The Little Mermaid. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were retained to write the song score, though Ashman died before production was completed.|$|E
5|$|Four {{overlapping}} ecological regions {{have been}} identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, {{mushrooms}} occur predominantly on decaying petioles of the palm Phenix roeberenii. The fungus requires a proper range of humidity to form mushrooms; for example, on Hachijo Island, fruiting only occurs in the rainy seasons in June/July and September/October when the relative humidity is around 88%, usually the day after rain falls. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} mushroom primordia that are too wet become deformed, while conditions that are too dry cause <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> to warp and break because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on the formation of <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere of Mars {{is similar to that}} of the Earth. Previous detections of water in the atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E

The color of <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> is bright or pale yellow, increasing in intensity towards the center of <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> C.asprata has a web-like ring that soon disappears.|$|R
5|$|The {{next year}} the Capitols went 28–20 but were {{eliminated}} from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948–49 BAA season, <b>the</b> <b>Caps</b> won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38–22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan.

However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned.|$|E
5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri, {{commonly}} known as Zeller's Bolete, is an edible species of mushroom in the family Boletaceae. First described scientifically by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, the species has been juggled by various authors to several genera, including Boletus, Boletellus, and Xerocomus. Found solely in western North America from British Columbia south to Mexico, the fruit bodies are distinguished by their dark reddish brown to nearly black caps with uneven surfaces, the yellow pores {{on the underside of}} <b>the</b> <b>caps,</b> and the red-streaked yellow stems. The fungus grows in summer and autumn on the ground, often in Douglas fir forests or on their margins. The development of the fruit bodies is gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tamper-evident}} band (also {{known as}} the pilfer-proof ring -however considered a misnomer given that pilfering is still technically possible) is a plastic or metal ring that is often found attached below a screw cap in bottles, connected by thin bridges. They can be molded along with <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> or slit afterwards. [...] When unscrewing <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>the</b> ring breaks: the ring can separate from <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> and two separate pieces remain, the sealing piece and the leftover ring; or the broken ring can form a [...] "pigtail" [...] still attached to <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b> [...] <b>The</b> ring therefore is a tamper warning: if the seal between the ring and <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> is broken, it {{is an indication that}} <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> has been opened.|$|R
5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface (hymenium) of <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> {{are covered}} by a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
5|$|Key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included the old cruiser , Bahias sister , the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their crews {{were in a}} state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's torpedoes. These could not be fired without firing caps, yet <b>the</b> <b>caps</b> were not where they were supposed to be. When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.|$|E
25|$|The {{electroscope}} is {{an important}} tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> <b>the</b> electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because {{the frequency of the}} light shining on <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> is above <b>the</b> <b>cap's</b> threshold frequency. <b>The</b> photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from <b>the</b> <b>cap,</b> reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope. However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting <b>the</b> metal <b>cap</b> does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the threshold value for <b>the</b> <b>cap),</b> then <b>the</b> leaf will never discharge, no matter how long one shines the low-frequency light at <b>the</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R
