The race took two hours, forty-six minutes, and <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.176 seconds.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} splits in the peloton at the finish.

But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the score remained 16–14 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Paris–Nice, three jerseys were awarded. The general {{classification}} {{was calculated}} by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on road stages (Stages 1–7): the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for {{the second and third}} riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints (three seconds for the winner of the sprint, <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third). The leader of the general classification received a yellow jersey.|$|E

5|$|Kerry led off the Australian team in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, {{but it was still}} <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> slower than his personal best time. Kerry finished in a time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead with a leadoff leg of 56.81s with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was last to reach the 100m mark, posting a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The remainder of the teams had been dropped, with a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a body length behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Tonelli's butterfly leg was such that if he had swum the same time in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the Australians were now more than a second clear of the third placed Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{came back}} from a 17-point deficit to defeat Notre Dame 35–31, scoring the winning {{touchdown}} with <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> remaining. Notre Dame started the scoring with two consecutive touchdowns in the first quarter, with the first coming from a seven-yard catch by Theo Riddick, and the second from a four-yard run by Cierre Wood. Michigan's only points of the first half came on a 43-yard reception by Junior Hemingway in the second quarter. Notre Dame answered with a 38-yard field goal by David Ruffer just before halftime to extend its lead to ten points. The score at halftime was 17–7 in favor of Notre Dame. The only points of the third quarter were when Notre Dame's T. J. Jones caught a 15-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter Michigan rallied from behind, scoring three consecutive touchdowns: first a one-yard run by Denard Robinson after Stephen Hopkins fumbled at the goal line, then a 47-yard catch by Jeremy Gallon, then a 21-yard catch by Vincent Smith to give them their first lead of the game. Notre Dame responded almost immediately, as Theo Riddick scored his second touchdown of the game less than a minute later on a 29-yard catch. Michigan received the ball on its 20-yard line with 30 seconds remaining, and drove 80 yards in 28 seconds with Roy Roundtree scoring the game-winning touchdown with <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> left in the game.|$|E

5|$|Most {{observed}} events (70%) have a {{duration of}} greater than <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> and {{are classified as}} long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute {{the majority of the}} population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a core-collapse supernova as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars. Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of California, Riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode (EV mode) that they may pose a risk to the blind, small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may have only one or <b>two</b> <b>seconds,</b> depending on the context, to audibly detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds. This research project {{was funded by the}} National Federation of the Blind.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher, Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne, and Jean Todt (hired in 1993), {{have been}} {{credited}} as turning this once struggling team {{into the most}} successful team in Formula One history.

During winter testing, Schumacher first drove a Ferrari, their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 33-yard line, but Virginia Tech decided to not run an inconsequential play to drain the final seconds from the clock and enter halftime. On the first play after the kickoff, Taylor threw a surprise pass downfield to Boykin, who was tackled at the Tennessee four-yard line. Instant replay revealed there were <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> remaining on the game clock after the play, and Virginia Tech placekicker Matt Waldron came onto the field to complete a 21-yard field goal as time expired. The Hokies thus regained a 17-14 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce {{began his}} final race weekend, the 1977 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, by setting the fastest {{time in the}} Wednesday {{practice}} session, held in wet weather. Pryce posted a time of 1 minute 31.57 seconds with the next best, the eventual 1977 World Champion Niki Lauda, a full second slower. The weather dried up prior to the Thursday session, and he slipped back down the grid to fifteenth place, almost <b>two</b> <b>seconds</b> slower than James Hunt's pole position time.|$|E

If Tonelli had replicated his relay leg in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the Australians were now more than a second clear of the third-placed Great Britain.|$|E
