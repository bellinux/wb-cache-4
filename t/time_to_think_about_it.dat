25|$|Carrie {{asks her}} {{contacts}} {{for information on}} an underground doctor {{in the area where}} Quinn went missing. Following a tip from former Hezbollah commander Al-Amin (George Georgiou), she tracks down one of the cell's supporters, Dr. Hussein (Mehdi Nebbou). Under threat of arrest, he brings her to an apartment belonging to Qasim (Alireza Bayram), one of the terrorists. In the apartment, Carrie finds extensive research on the Hauptbahnhof train station and heads there to investigate. She finds Qasim in the subway, and pleads with him to stop the plan to bomb the station. Qasim tries to reason with his cousin Bibi (René Ifrah), the ringleader, but Bibi kills him. Carrie then shoots and kills Bibi, neutralizing the threat. Back home, Jonas breaks up with Carrie, saying that neither he nor his son will ever be safe around her. Saul asks Carrie to rejoin the CIA, but she declines his offer. Düring essentially proposes to her, giving her a chance to co-head his Foundation. She does not answer him, and he gives her <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Mark and Kate {{broke up}} after Kate confessed to lying in her police {{statement}} during Paul's investigation. McGregor told Inside Soap that Mark {{did not stop}} loving Kate and that since he had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the issue was not as [...] "black and white" [...] as he first thought. Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) had taken an interest in Kate {{and he did not}} like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle. McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate, it forced Mark {{to come up with a}} plan to get closer to his ex-girlfriend. McGregor said, [...] "He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through!" [...] Mark later asked Lucas for his advice, but Lucas was not much help. Both Kate and Mark wanted to get back together and Brewer said, [...] "They both have a lot of history, such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which really hurts Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward." [...] The actress believed Mark was [...] "the one" [...] for Kate as they were both academic and focused.|$|E

2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
