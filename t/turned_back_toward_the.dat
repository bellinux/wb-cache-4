Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain saw the {{division}} flag {{moving to the}} left and followed Griffin with his brigade and a regiment of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory's brigade. By the time Warren returned to White Oak Road, Ayres's division had captured the return. Since no attack was now needed at the return (refused end) of the Confederate line, Warren sent Major Cope to tell Griffin to push westward toward the Ford's Road. Griffin turned his men to the right and headed west parallel to White Oak Road. Warren then <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> return to look again for Crawford's division.|$|E
25|$|Several vessels {{encountered}} the storm, with one reporting 110nbsp&km/h (70nbsp&mph) winds early on Decembernbsp&22. That day winds {{along the coast}} of Ceylon increased; the storm accelerated during this time as well. Early on Decembernbsp&23, the cyclone struck the northern tip of Ceylon and <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west-northwest. According to an officer on Pamban Island, located between Ceylon and Southern India, the storm's eye was no more than 16nbsp&km (10nbsp&mi) wide. Based on satellite imagery, it was estimated that the storm had peak winds of 240nbsp&km/h (150nbsp&mph), with gusts as high as 280nbsp&km/h (175nbsp&mph). This ranked the system as a modern-day super cyclonic storm. Additionally, the IMD estimated its central pressure to have been, at most, 970nbsp&mbar (hPa; 28.64nbsp&inHg). The lowest observed pressure was 978nbsp&mb (hPa; 28.88nbsp&inHg) in Mannar on the west coast of Ceylon. Weakening somewhat, the storm soon struck Tamil Nadu, south of Tondi. Once onshore, the cyclone rapidly weakened, becoming a depression before emerging over the Arabian Sea on Decembernbsp&24. The system degenerated into a remnant low later that day and dissipated over open waters on Decembernbsp&26.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong was {{involved}} in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore and/or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues. The first occurred during his sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, while Armstrong tested a self-adjusting control system. He flew to a height of over [...] (the highest he flew before Gemini 8), but the aircraft nose was held up too long during descent and the X-15 bounced off the atmosphere back up to [...] At that altitude, the air is so thin that aerodynamic surfaces have almost no effect. He flew past the landing field at Mach3 (...) at over [...] in altitude, and ended up [...] south of Edwards. After sufficient descent, he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> landing area, and barely managed to land without striking Joshua trees at the south end. It was the longest X-15 flight in both time and distance from the ground track.|$|E

60|$|<b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> fateful gate, I ran rapidly {{along the}} edge of the clearing, taking the ground in the mighty leaps that had first made me famous upon Barsoom.

60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Saunders {{clutched at}} Weston as he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hut. One had to enter it before gaining {{admission to the}} smaller shed in which they kept the giant-powder.|$|E

50|$|Pockley is a {{small village}} and civil parish in the Ryedale {{district}} of North Yorkshire, England. It is about 1 mile north-east of Helmsley turning north from the A170 road.

60|$|Mr. Oliver {{took the}} weapon {{and held it}} behind him, and <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> horse, gently stroked its head. Then there was a flash and detonation, and the beast dropped like a stone. After a moment the rancher turned around with a very curious look in his eyes, with the smoking weapon clenched hard in his hand.|$|R
60|$|He <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> fire, while Clarke stood {{a moment}} with clenched hand and a {{malignant}} look creeping into his eyes; then, following the Indian, the doctor silently moved forward across the muskeg.|$|E

60|$|It {{seems that}} the pursuit by the cruiser had so terrorized the mutineers that they had {{continued}} out across the Atlantic for several days after losing her; but on discovering the meager supply of water and provisions aboard, they had <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|E
60|$|I took {{advantage}} of the lull in hostilities to throw a quick glance over the edge toward Dian. She was half-way down the cliff and progressing finely. Then I <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> enemy. One of the bowmen was fitting an arrow to his bow. I raised my hand.|$|E
50|$|In the Central Region, <b>the</b> N1 <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> coast through Elmina.

After Winneba, the N1 continues east through Kasoa, entering the Greater Accra Region at Ngleshi-Amanfro.|$|R

50|$|Double Concerto for Violin, Cello, and Orchestra (1995) - {{winner of}} the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition. Tcherepnin {{described}} the piece as reminiscent of, and in some places actually borrowing from, the works of Tchaikovsky, Scriabin, Schoenberg, Debussy and Stravinsky, among others. The work invokes a celestial theme, with the violin descending and the cello ascending into a grand convergence and {{a brief period of}} reflection. <b>The</b> instruments then <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> extremes and a soft, peaceful conclusion.|$|R
60|$|Ida was {{not sure}} that she agreed with her; and, just then, Weston, {{swinging}} suddenly around, went down into the green depths, and, shooting up with white shoulders high above the water, swept away again down-stream.

60|$|When {{the grave}} {{had been filled}} with earth the little party <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cabin, and Esmeralda, still weeping copiously for the two {{she had never heard}} of before today, and who had been dead twenty years, chanced to glance toward the harbor.

60|$|Jav turned white, and {{commenced}} to tremble. At {{the crucial}} moment {{he appeared to}} lose the courage of his conviction.

50|$|Nic {{finds himself}} inside {{what appears to}} be a {{different}} facility behind a projected image of the outside world beyond <b>the</b> canyon. <b>Turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> bridge, he sees Damon remove his helmet to reveal he's actually a robotic alien. Nic walks towards a window and realizes he isn't in a facility, but is on an immense alien spacecraft numbered 2.3.5.41 (matching the numerical tattoo on his arm) that is about to dock at their home-world (signaled by the horn).|$|R
50|$|Sound propagates in {{the channel}} by {{refraction}} of sound, which makes sound travel near {{the depth of}} slowest speed. If a sound wave propagates away from this horizontal channel, {{the part of the}} wave furthest from the channel axis travels faster, so <b>the</b> wave <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> channel axis. As a result, the sound waves trace a path that oscillates across the SOFAR channel axis. This principle is similar to long distance transmission of light in an optical fibre.|$|R
