40|$|Conversion of Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory {{radioactive}} sodium-bearing {{waste into}} a single solid waste form by evaporation was demonstrated in both flask-scale and pilot-scale agitated <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> tests. A sodium-bearing waste simulant was adjusted to represent an evaporator feed in which the acid from the distillate is concentrated, neutralized, and recycled back through the evaporator. The advantage to this flowsheet is that a single remote-handled transuranic waste form is produced in the evaporator bottoms without the generation of any low-level mixed secondary waste. However, use of a recycle flowsheet in sodium-bearing waste evaporation results in a 50 % increase in remote-handled transuranic volume in comparison to a non-recycle flowsheet...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{components}} of a cane flexi-factory consist of a sugar factory, cogeneration power plant, refinery and a distillery. Bagasse, a residue obtained from the crushing a sugar cane in the sugar factory, is burnt in in an boiler of an annexed cogeneration plant to produce superheated steam which is then fed in a condensing extraction steam turbine coupled with an alternator to produce electricity and low pressure and temperature steam. The latter is used as process heat to produce raw sugar and refined sugar in the sugar factory and refinery respectively. Although the Mauritian sugar cane factories are equipped with the latest technology such as efficient electric motors equipped with variable speed drives, diffusers, automated systems, real-time monitoring of processes, efficient pumps, opportunities exist for a reduction in energy consumption for the evaporating process. Analysis of heat consumed by a flexi-factory shows that the five effect evaporator used by its sugar factory {{is by far the}} largest consumers. Robert and Kestner types of evaporators are mainly used. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the reduced steam consumption of a multiple effect evaporator by adding one effect of falling <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> type. Results shows that a savings of 41. 5 kg/h of steam consumption per ton of cane crushed can be achieved.

50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} <b>film</b> in <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is very {{important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling <b>film</b> plate <b>evaporator</b> is specifically designed to produce a <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporators,</b> the feed is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubes. Evaporation causes the vapor to expand thus causing a <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows down the tubes and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down the tubes is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the <b>thin</b> liquid <b>film</b> in the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|R

50|$|While {{the rising}} <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> are {{relatively}} efficient {{and have a}} several advantages, some literature suggests {{that they are not}} as efficient as the vertical or the horizontal tube falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> As such, in recent times falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> are usually chosen in place of rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> because they have similar advantages as rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> and have the additional benefits of better efficiency.

40|$|A {{study was}} made on the heat {{transfer}} and fouling in <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> with rotating surfaces. Both theoretical and experimental studies were carried out, {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of these evaporators and their design principles, so that this type of evaporator could be effectively used in an on-farm milk evaporation system. By using Nusselt-type assumptions, a theoretical model, which was used to predict the liquid film thickness and heat transfer coefficients on the rotating cone, was developed. The theoretical equations obtained revealed basic relationships between the variables and provided a fundamental knowledge of the liquid flow and heat transfer in the <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> with rotating surfaces. The experimental studies on heat transfer were conducted on a Centritherm evaporator, which is available commercially (40 ° half cone angle), a specially made cone evaporator (10 ° half cone angle) and a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> with a rotating tube. Variables evaluated were the rotating speed, the cone angle, the feed flow rate, the evaporating temperature, the temperature difference between the steam condensing and the liquid evaporating temperatures, and sugar concentration when sugar solution was used. The experimentally measured overall heat transfer coefficients were compared with the theoretical values. It was found that the measured overall heat transfer coefficients increased with increase of the cone rotating speed, and with the rise of the liquid evaporating temperature. The feed flow rate was found to have a more significant effect on the measured overall heat transfer coefficients in the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> with a rotating tube than that in the Centritherm and the cone evaporators. The overall heat transfer coefficients decreased with increase of the concentration of sugar solutions, mainly due to the increase of liquid viscosity. It was also found that the measured overall heat transfer coefficients in the Centritherm evaporator increased with an increase in temperature difference up to 30 K (for water, 10 % sugar solution and skim milk) and then decreased (for water and 10 % sugar solution). The formation of bubbles on the evaporating surface at high temperature differences was likely to be cause of this effect. Increase of the cone angle resulted in <b>thinner</b> liquid <b>films</b> and higher heat transfer coefficients. This was reflected in the following experimental results: the measured overall heat transfer coefficients in the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> with a rotating tube were slightly lower than those measured in the cone evaporator, but much lower than those obtained in the Centritherm evaporator. The experimental results showed that rotating the tube of a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> increased the overall heat transfer coefficient but the increase obtained was very dependent on feed flow rate, and was not sufficient to justify the use of this evaporator in the industry. With the Centritherm evaporator, good agreement between theoretical and experimental overall heat transfer coefficients as a function of the cone rotating speed was obtained by using water. The theoretical model, however, does not adequately describe the whole evaporation process at conditions other than those assumed in the model, which are: laminar liquid film flow, and heat transfer by conduction through the liquid film. It is suggested that waves existing in the liquid film at high Reynolds numbers, and bubble formation on the heating surface at high temperature difference, are the major reasons for the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results. For the fouling study, the Centritherm evaporator was mainly employed, and three liquid systems: reconstituted skim milk, reconstituted whey solutions and sweet cheese whey solution, were selected. It was found that no fouling was detected after 6 hours' operation in the Centritherm evaporator when reconstituted skim milk and reconstituted whey solutions were used. This indicates that the aggregated whey proteins, which are formed in the manufacture of skim milk powder and whey powder, are less active in inducing fouling. For this reason, only the sweet cheese whey solution was used in further studies. It was confirmed that fouling is strongly linked with the liquid evaporating temperature and the temperature difference between steam condensing and liquid evaporating temperatures. In general, the higher the evaporating temperature and the temperature difference, the faster the deposition rate and the greater the fouling on the surface. It was found that 72 % Bovine Serum Albumins (BSA) denatured after running the evaporator, at a evaporating temperature of 70 °C and a temperature difference of 20 K, for 6 hours. Though the content of BSA in whey solution is small, the denatured BSA could be easily attached to the surface. By association with other depositable materials existing in the whey solution, the thin layer of deposit could reduce the heat transfer coefficients significantly. This was attributed to the lower thermal conductivity of the deposited layer. Fouling was also found to be a function of the liquid velocity. This effect was more significant at lower evaporation temperatures. Increasing the rotating velocity would delay the formation of an initial layer and reduce the rate of fouling. It was also found that there was an induction period in the fouling curves when the evaporating temperature was 60 °C. The induction period was reduced when new whey solutions were introduced into the evaporator. It proved the fact that depositable materials are much more easily adsorbed on fouled or unclean surfaces than on clean surfaces. The increase of fouling rate when new whey solutions were introduced suggested that the concentration of activated molecules in the solutions strongly affected the fouling process. A possible mechanism of whey fouling on the rotating surface was proposed. During this study, an attempt was made to develop a new type of evaporator in which a vapour compressor would be integrated with the rotating surface. This was unsuccessful due to the failure of compressing the vapour. Concerning the on-farm evaporation system, which requires an evaporator with high efficiency, compact, and minimum heat load to milk, it is suggested that a rotating surface evaporator with the top cone angle close to 90 ° (like a disk evaporator) would be optimum and worth to explore...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{the working}} {{principles}} of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> used in dairy industries {{in relation to}} the evaporation of skim milk have been explored with a focus on the effect of milk solids content. The changes in rheological behaviour of skim milk and heat transfer within the evaporator during the concentration process have been investigated. With the better understanding of the rheological behaviour of skim milk and the operation of a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> the possibility of improving the performance of commercial falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> from its current configuration can be assessed. The use of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is a common and economical practice in the food and beverage industries to remove water from liquid products, e. g. juices, milk, etc., especially when the product is temperature sensitive. In dairy industries, falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> are used to evaporate water from dairy products such as milk, protein concentrate, etc. Falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is a well established technology but the understanding of rheological influence of milk on the performance and operation of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> remains relatively unexplored which formed the motivation of this project. In milk powder production, milk is normally concentrated from around 10 wt% to 50 wt% or 52 wt% (this depends on the type of milk) using multi-effect falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> prior to the spray drying process. The viscosity changes of milk during the concentration process are evident, especially the exponential rise in viscosity as solids level reaches 50 wt%. With the increase in viscosity, the flowing characteristics of the milks within the tubes in the evaporator change with the concentration of milk. Consequently, the performance of the evaporator, in terms of heat transfer, is considerably affected. The current research project has been divided into 3 main parts into context of viscosity and evaporation of milk using falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> Firstly, viscosity models of milk are established based on stringent viscosity measurement procedures that ensure the repeatability and reliability of the measurements. These models are used for process simulation, model based control and production planning. The second part is to evaluate the performance of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> under the influences of various operation conditions. In the last part, findings from the first two sections are merged into a pilot evaporator mathematical model that is able to predict the solid content, flow characteristics and residence time of milk concentrate in a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> The viscosity of milk is influenced by several factors such as solids content, temperature, ageing and shearing, etc. The focus in this thesis is on the instantaneous milk viscosity during the operation of the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> Therefore, viscosity measurements and modelling of the milk viscosity have been mainly focused on only on the effect of solids content, temperature and, to some extend, shear rate. A 2 m steam-heated pilot evaporator was designed and constructed to commercial grade based on a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> design. This pilot evaporator is able to operate under vacuum conditions (up to - 85 kPa gauge) in both shell and tube side so as to mimic the operation conditions in the dairy industries. The viscosity models in this thesis are predominately formulated based on the fresh and reconstituted medium heat-treated skim milk, unless otherwise stated. A comparison of viscosity models were made between the reconstituted and fresh skim milk. Significant differences were found and reported between the two types of milks. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC), a common method of quantifying the performance of an evaporator, was measured based on temperature difference between the heat transfer surface and the processed fluid (e. g. milk) and the energy transfer within the evaporator. Another 1 m electric-heated pilot evaporator was designed and built to facilitate the measurement at such temperatures and to have known power inputs which was not accessible in the steam-heated device. The influence of different operating conditions, such as varying heat flux, flow characteristics (e. g. Re number) and protein content, on the heat transfer coefficient is thoroughly investigated in this thesis. The study into the HTC on the product side found that the HTC measured from the evaporation of reconstituted skim milk is unresponsive to some of the operating conditions it was subjected to as compared to the fresh skim milk. Generally, HTC improves with greater Re number, heat flux and protein content (milk protein concentrate was added). Visual examination of the evaporation conditions within the evaporator also indicates that the amount of bubble formed during the evaporation process appears to increase with increasing flow rate, heat flux and protein content. During the formulation of the pilot evaporator model in this thesis, the viscosity models and heat transfer coefficients established in the current project were incorporated so as to model the steam-heated batch pilot evaporator. Several assumptions were introduced {{in order to create a}} working model. The pilot evaporator model has been verified against the actual experimental data and is proven to be accurate. This model is able to predict the solids content of the skim milk at any given time provided that the operating conditions are available. This model can also be applied onto a commercial falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> with minor modification to the calculation sequence. A scale-up version has been developed but due to commercial nature, it is not reported in this thesis. The research into the operation of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> has been seen to enhance the knowledge of the mechanisms and interactions between the process fluid and the evaporator.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is the characterisation of a model to describe the dynamics of a climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> over a wide operating range. The model should be sufficiently simple so that the calculation of control action is straight-forward. The hypothesis of this thesis is that such a model may be constructed to describe the dynamics of a climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> well. The first chapter introduces the topics of climbing film evaporation, two-phase flow and modelling and identification. The second chapter describes the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> used in this study. For this purpose, the evaporator was fully instrumented with temperature sensors, conductivity cells and flow-meters. The instrumentation was commissioned and calibrated. In the next chapter a distributed parameter model of the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> {{is derived from the}} one-dimensional homogeneous two-phase flow equations, the parameters of which were to be determined by identification. The next two chapters summarise the field of identification. The fourth chapter presents and develops identification techniques for lumped parameter models, and the fifth chapter describes and constructs identification methods for distributed parameter models. The methods described in the lumped parameter identification section were recursive, so that they could be used in real-time to track time-varying parameters – a feature that is useful in the design of self tuning regulators. These identification methods used a UD factorisation algorithm and were found to be robust for inappropriate choices of system dead-time. Accurate estimates of dead-time were obtained from either method. The distributed parameter identification methods investigated were optimisation schemes to minimise an output least square error criterion. Methods for solving the distributed parameter identification problem using the method of characteristics were investigated and developed. Identification using the method of characteristics is appropriate as the partial differential equations describing the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> are hyperbolic in nature. Chapter six presents the identification strategy adopted to model the evaporator using the techniques described and developed in chapters four and five. The experiments for the collection of data {{to be used in the}} various models are designed. A range of models of the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> were identified. The simplest models for the evaporator were global black-box linear models. Gain-scheduled linear models were identified to attempt compensation for system non-linearity. Finally the parameters of distributed parameter models for the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> were investigated. These models are presented and discussed in chapters seven, eight and nine respectively. The thesis is organised so that pages are numbered within chapters, with nomenclature and references listed at the end of each chapter. The paper entitled "Multi-input, multi-output identification of a pilot-plant climbing film evaporator" is based upon this work (Appendix VI). The paper has been accepted for presentation at the 12 th World Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control, Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, Darling Harbour, Sydney, Australia, 19 th- 23 rd July 1993...|$|R

The individual <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar cells are deposited one above the other in some regions {{in such a manner}} that an overlap region is formed from respective pairs of two individual <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar cells; a series connection of the two <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar cells forming the pair lies in this region. The <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar cell arrangement has a transition region, in which <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar cell applied to the first solar cell is transferred to a layer located beneath...|$|R
