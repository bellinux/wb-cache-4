60|$|Even to read of the marvellous {{works of}} {{embroidery}} that were fashioned in bygone ages is pleasant. Time {{has kept a}} few fragments of Greek embroidery of the fourth century B.C. for us. One is figured in M. Lefebure's book--a chain-stitch embroidery of yellow flax upon a mulberry- coloured worsted material, with graceful spirals and palmetto-patterns: and another, a tapestried cloth powdered with ducks, was reproduced in the Woman's World some months ago for an article by Mr. Alan Cole. {334a} Now and then we find in the tomb of some dead Egyptian a piece of delicate work. In the treasury at Ratisbon is preserved a specimen of Byzantine embroidery on which the Emperor Constantine is depicted riding on a white palfrey, and receiving homage from the East and West. Metz has a red silk cope wrought with great eagles, the gift of Charlemagne, and Bayeux the needle-wrought epic of Queen Matilda. But where is the great crocus-coloured robe, wrought for Athena, on which the gods fought against the giants? Where is the huge velarium that Nero stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by steeds? How one {{would like to see}} the curious table-napkins wrought for Heliogabalus, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; or the mortuary-cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; or the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, and were embroidered with 'lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that painters can copy from nature.' Charles of Orleans had a coat, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning 'Madame, je suis tout joyeux,' the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls. {334b} The room prepared in the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy was decorated with 'thirteen hundred and twenty-one papegauts (parrots) made in broidery and blazoned with the King's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the Queen's arms--the whole worked in fine gold.' Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her 'of black velvet embroidered with pearls and powdered with crescents and suns.' Its curtains were of damask, 'with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls,' and it stood in a room hung with rows of the Queen's devices in cut black velvet on cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold-embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment. The state-bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises and pearls, with verses from the Koran; its supports were of silver-gilt, beautifully chased and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. He had taken it from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mahomet had stood under it. The Duchess de la Ferte wore a dress of reddish-brown velvet, the skirt of which, adjusted in graceful folds, was held up by big butterflies made of Dresden china; the front was a <b>tablier</b> of cloth of silver, upon which was embroidered an orchestra of musicians arranged in a pyramidal group, consisting of a series of six ranks of performers, with beautiful instruments wrought in raised needle-work.

40|$|Motility {{is a basic}} {{feature of}} living microorganisms, and how it works is often {{determined}} by environmental cues. Recent efforts have focused on develop- ing artificial systems that can mimic microorganisms, and in particular their self-propulsion. Here, {{we report on the}} design and characterization of syn- thetic self-propelled particles that migrate upstream, known as positive rheo- taxis. This phenomenon results from a purely physical mechanism involving the interplay between the polarity of the particles and their alignment by a viscous torque. We show quantitative agreement between experimental data and a simple model of an overdamped Brownian pendulum. The model no- <b>tably</b> predicts the existence of a stagnation point in a diverging flow. We take advantage of this property to demonstrate that our active particles can sense and predictably organize in an imposed flow.

Contacts between particles are modelled using a DEM-like approach (Discrete Element Method), {{which allows for}} a more physical description, including roughness and friction. This work emphasizes the effect of friction between particles and its role on rheological properties, especially on normal stress differences. Friction is shown to no- <b>tably</b> increase viscosity and second normal stress difference |N 2 | and decrease |N 1 |, in better agreement with experiments. The hydrodynamic and contact contributions to the overall particle stress are particularly investigated. This shows {{that the effect of}} friction is mostly due to the additional contact stress since the hydrodynamic stress remains unaffected by friction. Simulation results are also compared with experiments, such as normal stresses or effective friction coefficient μ(Iv), and the agreement is improved when friction is accounted for. This suggests that friction is operative in actual suspensions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Description Logics (DLs) {{are used}} in Arti cial Intelligence to {{represent}} knowledge in terms of objects grouped into classes, and o er structuring mechanisms for both characterizing the relevant properties of classes in terms of binary relations, and establishing several interdependencies among classes. One of the main themes {{in the area of}} DLs has been to identify DLs that are both very expressive and decidable. This issue can be pro <b>tably</b> addressed by relying on a correspondence between DLs and propositional dynamic logics (PDLs). In this paper, we exploit the correspondence as a framework to investigate the decidability and the complexity ofapowerful DL, in which functional restrictions on both atomic roles and their inverse are expressible. We then show that such DL is suitable to represent n-ary relations, as needed in the applications of class-based formalisms to databases. The PDL that we use in this work is a proper extension of Converse Deterministic PDL, and its decidability and complexity is established contextually. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the emerging phenomenon of crowdsourced cartography {{in relation to}} ideas about the organisation of contemporary knowledge production in capitalist societies. Taking a philosophical perspective that views mapping as a processual, creative, productive act, constructed through citational, embodied, and contextual experiences, we examine how we might profi <b>tably</b> analyse collaborative crowdsourced projects like OpenStreetMap to better understand geographic knowledge production in a shifting political economy and sociotechnical landscape. We begin by characterising crowdsourcing practices in the wider context of Web 2. 0, which some commentators assert is rapidly becoming a new, dominant mode of knowledge production. We then contextualise Web 2. 0 knowledge production, drawing upon the ideas of sociologist George Ritzer, and his notion of ‘prosumption’, geographer Michael Goodchild’s idea of volunteerist ‘citizen scientists’, and economic commentator Nicholas Carr’s critique of the ‘ignorance of crowds’. We {{then go on to}} discuss the changing nature of cartography in the Web 2. 0 era with respect to authorship, ontology, representation, and temporality...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} {{a model of}} {{supermarket}} competition based upon John Suttons (1991) endogenous 8 ̆ 5 xed cost (EFC) framework. The relevance of the EFC framework to supermar-ket competition stems from the industrys surprisingly uniform competitive structure: irrespective {{of the size of}} the local market, a small number of 8 ̆ 5 rms (between 3 and 6) capture the majority of sales. As markets grow, local rivalry drives 8 ̆ 5 rms to expand their 8 ̆ 5 xed investments, limiting the number of 8 ̆ 5 rms that can pro 8 ̆ 5 <b>tably</b> enter even the largest markets. Although markets stay con-centrated, competition remains 8 ̆ 5 erce, reecting the inherently rivalrous nature of the underlying competitive mechanism.

40|$|Background: PDLIM 2 is {{essential}} for the termination of the inflammatory transcription factors NF-κB and STAT but is dispensable for the development of immune cells and immune tissues/organs. Currently, it remains unknown whether and how PDLIM 2 is involved in physiologic and pathogenic processes. Results: Here we report that naive PDLIM 2 deficient CD 4 + T cells were prone to differentiate into Th 1 and Th 17 cells. PDLIM 2 deficiency, however, had no obvious effect on lineage commitment towards Th 2 or Treg cells. No <b>tably,</b> PDLIM 2 deficient mice exhibited increased susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a Th 1 and/or Th 17 cell-mediated inflammatory disease model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Mechanistic studies further indicate that PDLIM 2 was required for restricting expression of Th 1 and Th 17 cytokines, which was in accordance with the role of PDLIM 2 in the termination of NF-κB and STAT activation. Conclusion: These findings suggest that PDLIM 2 is a key modulator of T-cell-mediated immune responses that may be targeted for the therapy of human autoimmune diseases. © 2012 Qu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of optimal dynamic labor {{contracts}} in which 8 ̆ 5 rms provide training to workers, but workers cannot credibly commit {{to stay with the}} 8 ̆ 5 rm.

40|$|Saline soils have salt levels {{high enough}} that either crop yields begin to suffer or {{cropping}} is impractical. Excessive salts injure plants by disrupting the uptake {{of water into}} roots and interfering with the uptake of competitive nutrients.

Preventing further encroachment of salinity and addressing remediation strategies are other steps. The weathering of geologic materials has given rise to our present soils, but also produces salts that impact crop growth and yield. Lack of leaching in certain landscapes has kept the salts from leaving. The pattern of saline soils across the state results from years of natural salt redistribution. However, land use practices and rainfall patterns can influence the spread and severity of saline soil.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} monadic second-order logic on strings M 2 L(Str) can pro <b>tably</b> {{be used as}} a {{description}} language for model-based analysis of software as wellashardware systems. It is therefore a good candidate formalism for hardware/software codesign. This logic conveniently combines two important features in a single formalism: It is both an abstract speci cation language and an e ective programming language. As a predicate logic it admits high-level behavioral design capture in which we focus on what is to be achieved rather than how this is done. Yet, in contrast to full higher-order logic, this expressiveness is not compromised by aloss of e ectiveness.

Technical properties were defi ned as the natural external characteristics that cause differences in the usability of a certain section of stem in the mechanical wood industry, saw milling in particular. On mineral soils, birch stems in mixed stands were slightly larger than those in pure birch stands. On peatlands, however, birch stems in pure stands were larger than those in mixed stands. The average stem form of silver birch was straighter than that of white birch. Small-sized log sections of white birch, as well as those of codominant silver birch, typically contain many dead knots.
