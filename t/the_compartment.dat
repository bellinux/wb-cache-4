5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors {{had yet to be}} installed, <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> bulkheads for electrical cables, ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even though most of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, had just returned from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. The task of raising Von der Tann was secured by Ernest Cox's salvage company. During preparation work, three workers were nearly killed when their oxy-acetylene cutters set off a major explosion. The blast tore holes in the still submerged vessel and allowed water into <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> that had been emptied with compressed air; {{by the time the}} men were rescued, <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> had refilled almost completely and the men were up to their necks. Nevertheless, the ship was successfully brought up on 7 December 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth by the Alloa Shipbreaking Company between 1931 and 1934.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a dual compartment neurofluidic system with inter-connecting microchannels to connect neurons from their respective compartments, {{placed on a}} planar microelectrode array (MEA). The design and development of <b>the</b> <b>compartmented</b> microfluidic device for neuronal cell culture, protocol for sustaining long-term cultures and neurite growth through microchannels in such a closed compartment device are presented. Using electrophysiological measurements of spontaneous network activity in <b>the</b> <b>compartments</b> and selective pharmacological manipulation of cells in one <b>compartment,</b> <b>the</b> biological origin of network activity and the fluidic isolation between <b>the</b> <b>compartments</b> are demonstrated. <b>The</b> connectivity between neuronal populations via the microchannels and the crossing-over of neurites are verified using transfection experiments and immunofluorescence staining. In addition to the neurite cross-over to <b>the</b> adjacent <b>compartment,</b> functional connectivity between cells in both <b>the</b> <b>compartments</b> is verified using cross-correlation based techniques. Bidirectional signal propagation between <b>the</b> <b>compartments</b> is demonstrated using functional connectivity maps. Cross-correlation analysis and connectivity maps demonstrate that the two neuronal populations are not only functionally connected within each compartment but also {{with each other and}} a well connected functional network was formed between <b>the</b> <b>compartments</b> despite <b>the</b> physical barrier introduced by the microchannels...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> doors. At 11.35am (11.20am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25pm (12.20pm on Sundays).|$|E

When he stood up to offer a woman his seat <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> door flew open, {{knocking}} him {{into the path of}} an oncoming train. Maurice Vincent became a pilot and served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he retired through illness in 1933. He died of colitis the following year, leaving a widow and small daughter.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> fascial <b>compartments</b> of <b>the</b> leg are <b>the</b> four fascial <b>compartments</b> that {{separate}} and contain {{the muscles of}} the lower leg (from the knee to <b>the</b> ankle). <b>The</b> <b>compartments</b> are divided by septa formed from <b>the</b> fascia. <b>The</b> <b>compartments</b> usually have nerve and blood supplies separate from their neighbours.

5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E
5|$|Sisko and Lieutenant Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) {{board the}} Enterprise but {{can find no}} trace of a bomb. They travel to K7, and scans {{indicate}} that the bomb is in the grain storage compartments. They enter the compartments and discover that the poisoned grain has all been eaten by tribbles, who are now all dead. Suddenly Captain Kirk opens <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> and is covered in falling tribbles. Dax and Sisko find the bomb before it can kill Kirk and the Defiant transports it into space where it explodes. The crew of the Defiant use the Bajoran Orb to travel {{back to the present}} time, and Sisko finishes explaining the situation to the Temporal Agents. The episode ends with Quark (Armin Shimerman) in his bar on Deep Space Nine's promenade, with numerous tribbles around him.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} groups of {{dissolved}} phase models: In parallel compartment models, several compartments with varying rates of gas absorption (half time), are considered to exist independently of each other, and the limiting condition is controlled by <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> that shows the worst case for a specific exposure profile. These compartments represent conceptual tissues and don't represent specific organic tissues. They merely represent the range of possibilities for the organic tissues. The second group uses serial compartments, which assumes that gas diffuses through one compartment before it reaches the next.|$|E

50|$|The main {{intravascular}} fluid in mammals is blood, a complex mixture with {{elements of a}} suspension (blood cells), colloid (globulins), and solutes (glucose and ions). The blood represents both <b>the</b> intracellular <b>compartment</b> (<b>the</b> fluid inside the blood cells) and <b>the</b> extracellular <b>compartment</b> (<b>the</b> blood plasma). The other {{intravascular fluid}} is lymph. It too represents both <b>the</b> intracellular <b>compartment</b> (<b>the</b> fluid inside its lymphocytes) and <b>the</b> extracellular <b>compartment</b> (<b>the</b> noncellular matrix of the lymph, which is roughly equivalent to serum). The average volume of plasma in the average (70 kg) male is approximately 3.5 liters. The volume of <b>the</b> intravascular <b>compartment</b> is regulated in part by hydrostatic pressure gradients, and by reabsorption by the kidneys.|$|R
30|$|TVM aims at {{suspension}} of <b>the</b> apical <b>compartment</b> {{by means of}} a bilateral sacrospinous ligament fixation. The success rate of a TVM has been reported to be 96 to 99  % for <b>the</b> apical <b>compartment</b> and 91  % for all <b>the</b> <b>compartments</b> [9, 10].|$|R
5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make {{a crack in the}} dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|As {{the train}} departs towards King's Cross, Rubeus Hagrid waves riders goodbye {{outside of the}} window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts {{can be seen in}} the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find {{themselves}} in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk on down the corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November, Vizeadmiral Prince Heinrich, who had {{replaced}} Hoffmann as the I Squadron commander, raised his flag aboard Kaiser Friedrich III; the ship held the role as squadron flagship {{for the next}} three years, interrupted only during the annual fleet exercises conducted in August and September, when Admiral Hans von Koester, the Generalinspekteur der Marine (Inspector-General of the Navy), commanded the fleet from Kaiser Wilhelm II. Through November, the ships of the squadron were occupied with individual training. On 17 November 1900, Kaiser Friedrich III was steaming to Kiel after conducting training exercises. Kaiser Wilhelm II attempted to pass Kaiser Friedrich III, so the latter stopped and allowed the former to pass to port. However, the order to resume steaming was given too quickly, and the ship accidentally rammed Kaiser Wilhelm II. Kaiser Friedrich III suffered minor damage to her bow, while her sister was slightly damaged in <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> that housed the steering engines. Repairs were completed within three days, without the need for either vessel to enter drydock. On 4 December, the ships began a winter training cruise, during which they stopped in Larvik, Norway, from 10 to 12 December. The squadron returned to Germany three days later.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Groundwater <b>compartment</b> {{receives}} Infiltration (hydrology) from <b>the</b> Land Surface <b>compartment</b> and transfers {{a portion}} of this inflow to <b>the</b> Transport <b>compartment.</b> This compartment is modeled using Aquifer objects. The connection to <b>the</b> Transport <b>compartment</b> can be either a static boundary or a dynamic depth in the channels. The links in <b>the</b> Transport <b>compartment</b> now also have seepage and evaporation.|$|R
50|$|Rodents {{typically}} {{spend more}} time in <b>the</b> dark <b>compartment</b> than in <b>the</b> light <b>compartment.</b> If rodents are injected with anxiolytic drugs, percentage of time spent in <b>the</b> light <b>compartment</b> will increase. Locomotion and rearing, which is when the rodent stands up on its hind legs and is a sign of exploration, in <b>the</b> dark <b>compartment</b> also increase. When injected with anxiogenic drugs, more time is spent in <b>the</b> dark <b>compartment.</b>|$|R
50|$|The LDB {{apparatus}} has two <b>compartments.</b> <b>The</b> light <b>compartment</b> is 2/3 {{of the box}} and is {{brightly lit}} and open. <b>The</b> dark <b>compartment</b> is 1/3 of the total box and is covered and dark. A door of 7 cm connects <b>the</b> two <b>compartments.</b>|$|R
5|$|One of the cruiser's early {{commanding}} officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, {{believed that}} the ship's single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller {{believed that the}} centralised system could be destroyed with a single hit, or the wiring linking <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.|$|E
5|$|The arms used in England were: Quarterly, I and IV, {{quarterly}} 1st and 4th Azure three fleurs de lys Or (for France), 2nd and 3rd Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant {{within a}} tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland, {{this was the}} first time that Ireland was included in the royal arms). The supporters became: dexter a lion rampant guardant Or imperially crowned and sinister the Scottish unicorn. The unicorn replaced the red dragon of Cadwaladr, which was introduced by the Tudors. The unicorn has remained in the royal arms of the two united realms. The English crest and motto was retained. <b>The</b> <b>compartment</b> often contained a branch of the Tudor rose, with shamrock and thistle engrafted on the same stem. The arms were frequently shown with James's personal motto, Beati pacifici.|$|E
5|$|The exosome is {{involved}} in the degradation and processing {{of a wide variety of}} RNA species. In the cytoplasm of cells, it {{is involved}} in the turn-over of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the nonsense mediated decay or non-stop decay pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the nucleus, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules. Finally, the nucleolus is <b>the</b> <b>compartment</b> where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several small nucleolar RNAs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> independent parallel <b>compartments</b> of <b>the</b> Haldanean models, {{in which all}} compartments are considered risk bearing, the Goldman model posits a relatively well perfused [...] "active" [...] or [...] "risk-bearing" [...] compartment in series with adjacent relatively poorly perfused [...] "reservoir" [...] or [...] "buffer" [...] compartments, which are not considered potential sites for bubble formation, but affect the probability of bubble formation in <b>the</b> active <b>compartment</b> by diffusive inert gas exchange with <b>the</b> active <b>compartment.</b> During compression, gas diffuses into <b>the</b> active <b>compartment</b> and through it into <b>the</b> buffer <b>compartments,</b> increasing <b>the</b> total amount of dissolved gas passing through <b>the</b> active <b>compartment.</b> During decompression, this buffered gas must pass through <b>the</b> active <b>compartment</b> again {{before it can be}} eliminated. If the gas loading of <b>the</b> buffer <b>compartments</b> is small, <b>the</b> added gas diffusion through <b>the</b> active <b>compartment</b> is slow. <b>The</b> interconnected models predict a reduction in gas washout rate with time during decompression compared with the rate predicted for <b>the</b> independent parallel <b>compartment</b> model used for comparison.|$|R
