2500|$|In February 1923, Freud {{detected}} a leukoplakia, a benign growth associated with heavy smoking, on his mouth. Freud initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, {{telling him that}} the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the dermatologist Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism [...] "a bad leukoplakia" [...] instead of the technical diagnosis epithelioma. Deutsch advised Freud <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a rhinologist whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled {{during and after the}} operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud that he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Identification of {{challenges}} associated with quitting and overcoming them may improve cessation outcomes. This study describes {{the development and}} initial validation of a scale for measuring challenges <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking.</b> Methods: The item pool was generated from empirical and theoretical literature and existing scales, expert opinion and interviews with smokers and ex-smokers. The questionnaire was administered to smokers and recent quitters who participated in a hospital-based smoking cessation trial. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to identify subscales in the questionnaire. Internal consistency, validity and robustness of the subscales were evaluated. Results: Of a total of 182 participants {{with a mean age}} of 55 years (SD 12. 8), 128 (70. 3 %) were current smokers and 54 (29. 7 %) ex-smokers. Factor analysis of the 21 -item questionnaire resulted in a 2 -factor solution representing items measuring intrinsic (9 items) and extrinsic (12 items) challenges. This structure was stable in various analyses and the 2 factors accounted for 50. 7 % of the total variance of the polychoric correlations between the items. Internal consistency (Cronbach's α) coefficients for the intrinsic and extrinsic subscales were 0. 86 and 0. 82, respectively. Compared with ex-smokers, current smokers had a higher mean score (±SD) for intrinsic (24. 0 ± 6. 4 vs 20. 5 ± 7. 4, p= 0. 002) and extrinsic subscales (22. 3 ± 7. 5 vs 18. 6 ± 6. 0, p= 0. 001). Conclusions: Initial evaluation suggests that the 21 -item challenges <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> scale is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used in research and clinical settings to assess challenges <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking...</b>|$|R

2500|$|By 1982, Newhart was {{interested}} in a new sitcom. After he had discussions with Barry Kemp and CBS, the show Newhart was created, in which Newhart played Vermont innkeeper and TV talk show host Dick Loudon. [...] Mary Frann was cast as his wife, Joanna. [...] Jennifer Holmes was originally cast as Leslie Vanderkellen, but left after former daytime soap star Julia Duffy joined the cast as Dick's inn maid and spoiled rich girl, Stephanie Vanderkellen. [...] Peter Scolari (who had {{been a fan of}} Newhart's since he was 17) was also cast as Dick's manipulative TV producer, Michael Harris, in six of the eight seasons. Character actor Tom Poston played the role of handyman George Utley, [...] earning three Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1984, 1986, and 1987. Like The Bob Newhart Show, Newhart was an immediate hit, and again, like the show before it, it was also nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards, but failed to win any. During the time Newhart was working on the show, in 1985, his smoking habit finally caught up to him, and he was taken to the emergency room for secondary polycythemia.

She earned a nomination for the 1966 Tony for Best Actress in a Musical for On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1965), a Broadway musical created for her by Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane. She starred as [...] "Daisy Gamble", a New Yorker who seeks out the help of a psychiatrist <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>smoking.</b> Under hypnosis, the apparently kooky, brash, and quirky character reveals unexpected hidden depths. During her hypnotic trances, she becomes fascinating to the psychiatrist as she reveals herself as a woman who has lived many past lives, one of them ending tragically. While critics were divided over the merits of the show, they praised Harris's performance. The show opened on October 14, 1965 at the Mark Hellinger Theater and ran for 280 performances, earning a total of three Tony nominations. Harris performed numbers from the show with John Cullum on The Bell Telephone Hour ("The Lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner", broadcast on February 27, 1966).

Surgical SpRs were less likely than medical SpRs to advise patients <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> discuss smoking-related health problems, discuss the benefits of quitting or advise nicotine replacement therapy. Few SpRs had been trained to counsel smokers and less than half felt that their input helped patients <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> CONCLUSION: Medical education is lacking in teaching students and junior doctors how <b>to</b> help patients <b>stop</b> <b>smoking...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to identify how midwives perceive providing <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> advice <b>to</b> pregnant smokers and how pregnant women who smoke perceive <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services. The overall aim was to find methods to improve the uptake of <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services by pregnant women. Three focus groups with midwives and ten semi-structured interviews with pregnant smokers were undertaken. The qualitative data was analysed using Grounded Theory. The perceptions of midwives regarding provision of advice were identified as barriers as well as facilitators and related to outcome of advice, the relationship with clients, personal experiences, attributes, perception of role, the impact of external factors and aspects related to pregnant smokers and pregnancy. Pregnant smokers’ perceived barriers and facilitators <b>to</b> approaching <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services were categorised into areas of smoking behaviour, advice from health professionals, <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services and negative perceptions of pregnant women who smoke. Midwives perceive a greater number of barriers than facilitators <b>to</b> providing <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> advice. Although many of these could be overcome by implementing effective mandatory training, other issues such as lack of time have major impacts on midwives’ abilities to promote health. Pregnant smokers tend to have negative expectations of <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> services but the experiences of those who have attended the service are positive. Raising awareness of <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> support for pregnant women is crucial in improving uptake of the service...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of 2 mg nicotine chewing-gum {{as an aid}} <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> was compared with a placebo containing 1 mg nicotine, but unbuffered, in a double-blind randomised trial. Of 58 subjects given the active gum, 27 (47 %) were not smoking at one-year follow-up compared with 12 (21 %) of the 58 subjects treated with placebo (p less than 0. 025). By the most stringent criterion of outcome, 18 (31 %) subjects in the active treatment group and eight (14 %) {{in the placebo group}} had not smoked at all from the start of treatment to follow-up at one year (p less than 0. 05). Subjects receiving the active gum experienced less severe withdrawal symptoms and rated their gum as more helpful than did the placebo group. Minor side effects were common but only gastric symptoms were more frequent with the active gum. Subjects receiving active gum used it for longer than those receiving placebo but most stopped using it within six months and only four (7 %) developed longer-term dependence. The number of gums used daily correlated significantly with pretreatment blood nicotine concentrations in the active treatment group and with pretreatment cigarette consumption in the placebo group. A lower pretreatment blood nicotine value was the best predictor of success at one year (p less than 0. 001) but there was no significant relation to cigarette consumption, sex, and social class. The results clearly confirm the usefulness of nicotine chewing-gum as an aid <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> and imply a definite role for nicotine in cigarette dependence and withdrawal. Successful use of the gum requires careful attention to subjects' expectations and clear instructions on how to use it...|$|R

MethodsWe compared 1, 181 successful quitters with 940 current smokers who made a recent attempt to quit but failed in the past 12 months using the fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We examined the relationship of sociodemographic, behavioral and environmental characteristics, comorbid conditions, and quitting methods to successful smoking cessation. ResultsOlder age, female, being married, having higher education, having a lower level of stress, having smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day, and one's own will for quitting have been identified as significant determinants of successful cessation. Frequency of alcohol consumption and trying numerous quitting methods was inversely related <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking.</b> ConclusionThis study suggests that cessation programs need to take a holistic approach and should consider these factors in setting up...|$|R
