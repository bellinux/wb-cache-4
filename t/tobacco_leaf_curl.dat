40|$|DNA β is a {{circular}} single-stranded satellite DNA associated with certain monopartite begomoviruses (family Geminiviridae) which causes economically important {{diseases such as}} cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease. DNA β contains a single gene, βC 1, which encodes a pathogenicity protein responsible for symptom production. Transient expression studies in Nicotiana tabacum using the β-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by a βC 1 promoter-deletion series of the DNA β associated with cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Multan virus identified a 68 nt region (between – 139 and – 207) which is important for βC 1 transcription. This 68 nt region contains a G-box (CACGTG) located 143 nt upstream of the βC 1 start codon. Mutation of the G-box resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} βC 1 promoter activity and DNA β replication efficiency. In addition, the G-box motif was found to bind specifically to a protein(s) in nuclear extracts prepared from <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> tissues. Our results indicate that interaction of the G-box motif with host nuclear factors is important for efficient gene expression and replication of DNA β. Omid Eini, S. A.

40|$|Background Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> {{disease in}} the Indian subcontinent is {{associated}} with several distinct begomoviruses that interact with a disease-specific DNA satellite named Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB). However, we have recently reported that Chili <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> betasatellite (ChLCB) is also occasionally found associated with the disease in Pakistan. The {{question as to whether}} ChLCB contributes to the development of disease symptoms such as <b>leaf</b> <b>curling</b> and enations remain to be answered. We have previously shown that the expression of βC 1 of CLCuMB develops all symptoms of cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease in Nicotiana benthamiana when expressed from PVX vector. Findings The role of ChLCB in the induction of typical disease symptoms was studied by its expression from PVX vector in N. benthamiana.

We have identified and characterized two distinct monopartite begomoviruses and associated beta satellite DNA causing <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease of radish (Raphanus sativus) in India. Results We demonstrate that RaLCD {{is caused by a}} complex of two Old World begomoviruses and their associated betasatellites. Radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus-Varanasi is identified as a new recombinant species, Radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus (RaLCV) sharing maximum nucleotide identity of 87. 7 % with Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Bangladesh virus-[Bangladesh: 2] (Accession number AF 188481) while the virus causing radish <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease-Pataudi is an isolate of Croton yellow vein mosaic virus-[India] (CYVMV-IN) (Accession number AJ 507777) sharing 95. 8 % nucleotide identity. Further, RDP analysis revealed that the RaLCV has a hybrid genome, a putative recombinant between Euphorbia <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus and Papaya <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> virus. Cloned DNA of either RaLCV or CYVMV induced mild <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> symptoms in radish plants. However, when these clones (RaLCV or CYVMV) were individually co-inoculated with their associated cloned DNA betasatellite, symptom severity and viral DNA levels were increased in radish plants and induced typical RaLCD symptoms. To further extend these studies, we carried out an investigation of the interaction of these radish-infecting begomoviruses and their associated satellite, with two tomato infecting begomoviruses (Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gujarat virus and Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> New Delhi virus). Both of the tomato-infecting begomoviruses showed a contrasting and differential interaction with DNA satellites, not only in the capacity to interact with these molecules but also in the modulation of symptom phenotypes by the satellites.

40|$|Monopartite begomoviruses {{and their}} {{associated}} satellites form unique disease complexes {{that have emerged}} as {{a serious threat to}} agriculture worldwide. It is well known that frequent recombination contributes to the diversification and evolution of geminiviruses. In this study, we identified a novel defective satellite molecule (RecSat) in association with <b>Tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Yunnan virus (TbLCYNV) in a naturally infected tobacco plant. Sequence analysis showed that Recsat comprises 754 nucleotides in size and is a chimera involving alphasatellite and betasatellite sequences, containing both betasatellite-conserved region and alphasatellite stem-loop structure. Recombination analysis revealed that RecSat has arisen from three independent recombination events likely involving Tomato yellow leaf curl China betasatellite, Ageratum yellow vein China betasatellite and Tobacco curly shoot alphasatellite. Co-inoculation of RecSat with TbLCYNV induced symptoms indistinguishable from those induced by TbLCYNV alone in Nicotiana benthamiana. Southern blot hybridization showed that RecSat could be trans-replicated stably in N. benthamiana plants by TbLCYNV, and impaired the accumulation of helper virus and co-inoculated alphasatellite.

No relationship was detected between any whitefly-transmitted and any leafhopper-transmitted virus. A similar pattern of relationships was found by spot hybridization experiments in which extracts from infected leaves were tested with probes for ACMV DNA- 1 or DNA- 2. Imperfect nucleotide sequence homologies were found between ACMV DNA- 1, which contains the particle protein gene, and the DNA of five other whitefly-transmitted viruses: bean golden mosaic, tomato golden mosaic, <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl,</b> tomato leaf curl and tomato yellow leaf curl, the last three of which are not sap-transmissible. Thus, relationships were established between sap-transmissible and sap non-transmissible g miniviruses. No homologies were d tected with a full-length probe for ACMV DNA- 2. Extracts from plants infected with three teafhopper- transmitted viruses (beet curly top, maize streak and wheat dwarf) did not react with probes for ACMV DNA- 1 or DNA- 2. Because each of the leafhopper-transmitted geminiviruses has a different vector species whereas the whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses all have the same vector, Bemisia tabaci, the genome homologies and antigenic relationships detected among members of the group could be explained if their coat proteins have a key role in transmission by vectors...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease (TLCD) {{is caused}} by begomoviruses in Geminiviridae, and {{infected}} plants exhibit leaf thickening, downward leaf curling, vein swelling as well as stunting symptoms. It {{is one of the}} economically important diseases in tropical and subtropical tobacco-growing areas. Seven monopartite begomoviruses have been identified causing TLCD in China. Findings: In this study, two begomoviruses were identified, characterized and polygenetically analyzed to be responsible for TLCD in Sichuan province, China. The complete genomes of two isolates SC 230 and SC 379 from diseased tobacco samples were cloned and sequenced to be 2738 nucleotides (nts) and 2748 nts in size, respectively. Sequence alignment indicated that SC 230 and SC 379 were most closely related to Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV-CN[CN:Sc 226 :Mal: 12]) and Papaya leaf curl China virus (PaLCuCNV-CN[CN:Gx 30 :Lyc: 03]), with a sequence identity of 99. 2 and 99. 2 %, respectively. The infection rate of TYLCCNV and PaLCuCNV was 100 and 34. 78 %, respectively and the co-infection rate was 34. 78 % in fields. Betasatellites of SC 230 and SC 379 share the highest sequence identity with Tomato yellow leaf curl China betasatellite (TYLCCNB-CN[CN:Sc 176 :Malva: 12]) and TYLCCNB-CN[CN:Yn 149 :Tom: 09], with a sequence identity of 95. 2 and 97. 2 % respectively. Sequence identity between betasatellites of SC 230 and SC 379 was 89. 6 %. And TYLCCNB was detected in all the samples. Conclusion: Co-infection of TYLCCNV and PaLCuCNV was identified in tobacco plants with typical symptoms of TLCD from Sichuan province in China, {{and this is the first}} report of PaLCuCNV infecting tobacco in China. TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB disease complex is widespread in tobacco-growing areas in Panzhihua city of Sichuan...|$|E
40|$|Begomoviruses are plant-infecting viruses, {{which are}} {{transmitted}} by the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci. They have a genome of single-stranded DNA {{that consists of}} either a single (monopartite) or two components (bipartite) with a component size of approximately 2. 8 kb. Many monopartite begomoviruses in the Old World {{have been found to}} be associated with betasatellite and alphasatellite molecules, which are about half the size of their helper begomovirus genome. Betasatellites have been shown to be necessary for inducing severe disease symptoms. In Cameroon, B. tabaci has been associated with suspected begomovirus infections in many crop and weed species. Despite their growing importance, only begomoviruses infecting cassava have been studied in Cameroon in any detail. Thus, there was a need for additional information on diversity and distribution of begomoviruses and satellites in vegetable crops and dictyledonous weeds, which likely serve as virus reservoirs. In field studies carried out in this study, a high incidence of okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease was found in Cameroon. Sequencing of viral genomes showed that the okra plants were infected by viruses of two previously known begomovirus species (Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira virus and Okra yellow crinkle virus) as well as a new recombinant begomovirus species (Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus). In addition, a betasatellite (Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira betasatellite) and two alphasatellites (Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Mali alphasatellite and Okra yellow crinkle Cameroon alphasatellite) were identified. Tomato plants with <b>leaf</b> <b>curling</b> were shown to contain isolates of a new begomovirus, Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus, and an alphasatellite, Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon alphasatellite (ToLCCMA). To study the potential begomovirus complexes infecting weeds, begomoviruses and satellites in plants of the weed Ageratum conyzoides with <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> symptoms were characterized. Sequence analyses showed that they were infected by isolates of a new begomovirus (Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon virus), two new betasatellites (Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Cameroon betasatellite and Ageratum <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Buea betasatellite), an alphasatellite (ToLCCMA) and two types of defective recombinants between a begomovirus and ToLCCMA. Putative recombinations were detected in begomovirus genomes for all three plant species studied, indicating that recombination is an important mechanism for their evolution. A close relationship between the begomoviruses infecting tomato and A. conyzoides, and the detection of the same alphasatellite in them support the idea that weeds are important reservoirs for begomoviruses and their satellites. This study has revealed a huge complexity of begomoviruses and DNA satellites previously largely unknown in West Africa and Central Africa. With this high diversity, recombination potential and transmission by B. tabaci, begomoviruses and their associated DNA satellites pose a serious threat to crop production in the region...|$|R
40|$|Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> disease (OLCD) {{is a major}} {{constraint}} on okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) production and is widespread in Africa. Using {{a large number of}} samples representative of the major growing regions in Burkina Faso (BF), we show that the disease is associated with a monopartite begomovirus and satellite DNA complexes. Twenty-three complete genomic sequences of Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira virus (CLCuGV) isolates associated with OLCD, sharing 95 to 99 % nucleotide identity, were cloned and sequenced. Six betasatellite and four alphasatellite (DNA- 1) molecules were also characterized. The six isolates of betasatellite associated with CLCuGV isolates correspond to Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira betasatellite (CLCuGB) (88 to 98 % nucleotide identity). One isolate of alphasatellite is a variant of Cotton <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Gezira alphasatellite (CLCuGA) (89 % nucleotide identity), whereas the three others isolates appear to correspond to a new species of alphasatellite (CLCuGA most similar sequence present 52 to 60 % nucleotide identity), provisionally named Okra <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Burkina Faso alphasatellite (OLCBFA). Recombination analysis of the viruses demonstrated the interspecies recombinant origin of all CLCuGV isolates, with parents being close to Hollyhock leaf crumple virus (AY 036009) and Tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Diana virus (AM 701765). Combined with the presence of satellites DNA, these results highlight the complexity of begomoviruses associated with OLCD. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) {{also known}} as high throughput sequencing is now fast and cheap enough to be {{considered part of the}} toolbox for investigating the unknown virus. Illumina Genome Analyzer is one of the developed next-generation sequencing platforms that produce a significant larger volume of sequence data. The short sequence reads generated from Illumina Genome Analyzer can be used to perform de novo assembly. Therefore, this study was conducted to perform de novo assembly of an unknown geminivirus using the sequence reads generated from Illumina Genome Analyzer. In this study, the de novo assembly was carried out using SOAPdenovo and it indicates that only one scaffold (C 11095) that mapped into the geminivirus genomes. After the scaffold output was obtained, the gene was predicted using GeneMark. hmm. There were 5 open reading frames (ORFs) predicted as gene. The function of each predicted gene was annotated using three different annotation tools, InterPro, Gene Ontology (GO) and UniProt. For example, from the InterPro result, the gene 1 encodes the geminivirus AL 3 coat protein, while the UniProt result shows that the gene 1 encodes the replication enhancement protein and the GO shows that the gene 1 was involved in the viral process (biological process). In this study, the predictive genes were compared with the geminivirus genomes using BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator). The BRIG image shows that the large sequence of the unknown geminivirus was missing between 1000 bp until 1300 bp. From the genes comparison result, it indicates the similarity between the unknown geminivirus and the geminivirus genomes where all the geminiviruses encode the coat protein and replication-associated protein. The differences between the unknown geminivirus and the geminivirus genomes were the unknown geminivirus encodes the replication enhancement protein (gene 1), the hypothetical protein (gene 3) and the glyoxylate carboligase (gene 5). The phylogenetic result shows that the geminiviruses can be classified into the East Asia (China, Taiwan, and Japan) and the Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam) viruses. The unknown geminivirus (candidate virus) was located in the Southeast Asia group. This phylogenetic tree indicates that the unknown geminivirus share common ancestor with <b>Tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> Indonesia virus C 1, V 2, V 1 genes for replication-associated protein, putative V 2 protein, coat protein, partial and complete cds. The results of the phylogenetic tree suggest that the unknown geminivirus could be a Southeast Asia strain and it could be attack tobacco plants.

40|$|Viruses of {{the family}} Geminiviridae are phytopathogens with {{circular}} single-stranded DNA genome encapsidated in characteristic geminate particles that are transmitted by insects. Economically the most important are the geminiviruses of the genus Begomovirus which are transmitted exclusively by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci that occur in both the Old World (OW) and New World (NW). Bipartite begomoviruses, with components known as DNA A and DNA B, are native to the NW. However, in the OW, the bipartite begomoviruses are out-numbered by the monopartite begomoviruses, with genomes consisting of a homolog of the DNA A component of the bipartite viruses. Many monopartite begomoviruses are associated with two classes of single-stranded DNA satellites, designated as alphasatellite and betasatellite. Betasatellites are, in many cases, essential for the helper begomovirus to infect, and induce typical disease symptoms in, the host from which they were isolated. For many begomovirus-betasatellite pairs the betasatellite encodes the major pathogenicity/symptom determinant of the complex. The study described here was designed to investigate the effects of mutation of selected begomovirus genes on infectivity, symptoms {{and the ability to}} maintain betasatellites. The coat protein (CP), V 2, C 2 and C 4 genes, the products of which have in previous studies of monopartite begomoviruses been implicated in virus movement and/or pathogenicity, of two betsatellite-associated monopartite begomoviruses, Pedilanthus leaf curl virus (PedLCV) and Cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus (CLCuKoV) were mutated. Mutant viruses were inoculated to Nicotiana benthamiana in both the presence and absence of the cognate betasatellites, <b>Tobacco</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>curl</b> betasatellite (TbLCB) and Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB), respectively. Mutation of the CP abolished infectivity of monopartite begomoviruses. The mutation could be complemented by transient expression of the CP at the point of inoculation-albeit without inducing symptoms. These results are consistent with previous studies, and suggest that the protein is required for virus spread/movement in plants. Also the results show {{for the first time that}} the CP is important for the maintenance of betasatellites. Mutation of the V 2 genes of PedLCV and CLCuKoV lead to reduced and asymptomatic infections. Betasatellite fully restored the infectivity of CLCuKoV and partially restored the infectivity of PedLCV, although for CLCuKoV infections were asymptomatic whereas PedLCV infections exhibited very mild symptoms. These findings, for the most part, agree with earlier studies indicating that the V 2 is a pathogenicity determinant, has a role in virus movement and V 2 plays a part in the maintenance of betasatellites by monopartite begomoviruses. Mutation of the C 2 genes of both monopartite begomoviruses resulted in reduced and asymptomatic infections. Co-inoculation with betasatellite resulted in a greater number of plants in which virus spread systemically, but for the CLCuKoV/CLCuMB combination, viral DNA levels were higher than for mutant in the absence of the betasatellite. These findings agree with earlier studies, indicating that C 2 is not essential for infectivity but affects symptom expression, and are consistent with C 2 being a suppressor of post-transcriptional gene silencing, as well as showing that C 2 plays a part in the maintenance of betasatellites. The results for the mutation of the C 4 for the two viruses differed. For PedLCV mutation of C 4 resulted in significantly reduced infectivity. For plants inoculated with TbLCB and the C 4 mutant, fewer plants ultimately showed systemic movement of the betasatellite. For CLCuKoV mutation of the C 4 had no discernible effect on infectivity of the virus or the maintenance of the betasatellite by the virus. The effects on symptoms are consistent with earlier results indicating that the C 4 of monopartite begomoviruses plays a part in symptoms induced by the virus. Betasatellites are increasingly being identified in the field with bipartite begomoviruses. It was therefore of interest to examine the requirements for betasatellite maintenance by a bipartite virus such as Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV). For the majority of bipartite begomoviruses, including ToLCNDV, both components are essential for symptomatic infection. As for the monopartite viruses, four mutants (of the CP, AV 2, AC 2 and AC 4 genes encoded on DNA A) of ToLCNDV were produced. In the presence of the DNA B none of the mutations affected infectivity or symptoms. The betasatellite was not efficiently maintained by ToLCNDV (both in the presence and absence of the DNA B) but mutations of the AC 2 and AC 4 abolished the ability of the virus to maintain the satellite, indicating that these proteins are important in maintenance of the satellite by the virus. The earlier finding that betasatellites can complement DNA B functions of bipartite begomoviruses led to the suggestion that begomovirus movement is constrained by an RNAi-based resistance in plants. To investigate this hypothesis ToLCNDV DNA A was inoculated together with three well characterised suppressor proteins from heterologous RNA viruses. Transient expression of each of the three suppressors (the Tobacco etch virus [genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae] HC-Pro, the Cymbidium ringspot virus [genus Tombusvirus, family Tombusviridae] p 19 and the Turnip crinkle virus [genus Carmovirus, family Tombusviridae] coat protein) at the point of inoculation with ToLCNDV DNA A resulted in more plants in which systemic movement of the virus was evident. These findings support the contention that begomovirus movement is countered by a plant RNAi-based defence. In addition to being of academic interest, the studies described here were conducted in the belief that a better understanding of virus-satellite interactions could lead to novel means of reducing agricultural losses due to these pathogens; possibly identifying new targets for engineered resistance that interfere with virus-satellite interactions. Advances made in this regard are discussed...|$|E
