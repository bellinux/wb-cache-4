From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E

40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{examines}} the theoretical foundations of {{evaluation of the}} effectiveness of the state mechanism of response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security. Also the author defines the area of the methodological problems of the construction of scorecard of such evaluation. Comparative analysis of <b>the</b> approaches <b>to</b> evaluation of <b>the</b> effectiveness of the state mechanism of response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security, namely economic, social, legal, socially oriented, expert, pragmatic, allowed defining the last one as the most promising. Pragmatic approach is not confined only <b>to</b> distinction of <b>the</b> resulting and economical effectiveness, but also allows defining purposeful effectiveness of the public policy {{from the point of view}} of correspondence of its aims <b>to</b> <b>the</b> normative ideals and value standards, which are accepted by the certain society on the certain stage of its development. <b>The</b> author suggests <b>to</b> distinguish between general and current effectiveness of the functioning of the state mechanism of response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security. General effectiveness is a level of national interests protection in the military sphere. Current effectiveness is determined by the work efficiency of public authorities and bodies of state military administration, which consists in the development, adoption and organization of implementation of administrative decisions concerning state response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security. The proposed method for estimating the complex effectiveness provides a more precise tool for evaluation of the public authorities performance in the field of response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security, which greatly increases the practical significance of the results of this assessment...|$|R

5|$|The {{making of}} a kingship of Ireland, as kings from Flann to Brian Bóruma, Muircheartach Ua Briain and Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair (Turlough O'Connor) exercised, may owe as much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> raised by Feidlimid mac Crimthainn, of the Eóganachta of Cashel (Eóganachta Chaisil), King of Munster, as to the Viking raids on Ireland.|$|E

5|$|After a lahar {{demolished}} her home, Sánchez became pinned {{beneath the}} debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia.
