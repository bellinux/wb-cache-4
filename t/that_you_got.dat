A positive review came from Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine, who {{referred to the}} original version as Stefani's best [...] "Beastie Boy imitation over a '1 Thing' rip", and Sal Cinquemani, while reviewing the album, of Slant Magazine called it [...] "instantly contagious". Norman Mayers of Prefix Magazine praised Swizz Beatz for [...] "coming up with the most likely heir to the Hollaback crown, with the bumping chants and boasting raps".

Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters criticized the song's songwriting, calling it [...] "woefully thin, relying on tedious repetition." [...] John Murphy of musicOMH gave the single a mixed review, writing [...] "when the self-consciously wacky and kitsch side to her personality surfaces, as on the inane 'Now <b>That</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> It', the temptation is to dive for the 'off' switch".|$|E

500|$|However, Hazel Cills from Vice {{defended the}} singer's motives, stating: [...] "Although no musicians had the gail to hire actual Japanese women as props, Asian fetishism and {{appropriation}} was rampant in 80s rock", while referring to Stefani's major influence {{for the parent}} album's entirety.

In September 2006, during the Fashion Week, MTV News interviewed Swizz Beatz and he said to be working with Stefani as well, claiming: [...] "She's always taking it to the next level.

And I think we can all do better than this one." [...] Mickey Kaus, a journalist at Slate, speculated that the lack of mainstream coverage was motivated by a desire not to harm Elizabeth Edwards, who was fighting cancer at the time.
