40|$|A given binary {{resolution}} proof, {{represented as a}} binary tree, {{is said to be}} minimal if the resolutions cannot be reordered to generate an irregular proof. Minimality extends Tseitin's regularity restriction and still retains completeness. A linear time algorithm is introduced to decide whether a given proof is minimal. This algorithm can be used by a deduction system that avoids redundancy by retaining only minimal proofs, and thus lessens its reliance on subsumption, a more general but more expensive technique. Any irregular {{binary resolution}} tree is made smaller by an operation called surgery, which runs in time linear {{in the size of the}} <b>tree.</b> After <b>surgery</b> the result proved by the new tree is at least as general as the original result. Furthermore any non-minimal tree can be made irregular in linear time by an operation called splay. Thus a combination of splaying and surgery efficiently reduces a non-minimal tree to a minimal one.

40|$|AbstractA new methodology/data structure, {{the clause}} tree, is {{developed}} for automated reasoning based on resolution in first order logic. A clause tree T {{on a set}} S of clauses is a 4 -tuple 〈N, E, L, M〉, where N a set of nodes, divided into clause nodes and atom nodes, E {{is a set of}} edges, each of which joins a clause node to an atom node, L is a labeling of N ∪ E which assigns to each clause node a clause of S, to each atom node an instance of an atom of some clause of S, and to each edge either + or −. The edge joining a clause node to an atom node is labeled by the sign of the corresponding literal in the clause. A resolution is represented by unifying two atom nodes of different clause trees which represent complementary literals. The merge of two identical literals is represented by placing the path joining the two corresponding atom nodes into the set M of chosen merge paths. The tail of the merge path becomes a closed leaf, while the head remains an open leaf which can be resolved on. The clause cl(T) that T represents is the set of literals corresponding to the labels of the open leaves modified by the signs of the incident edges. The fundamental purpose of a clause tree T is to show that cl(T) can be derived from S using resolution. Loveland's model elimination ME, the selected literal procedure SL, and Shostak's graph construction procedure GC are explained in a unified manner using clause trees. The condition required for choosing a merge path whose head is not a leaf is given. This allows a clause tree to be built in one way (the build ordering) but justified as a proof in another (the proof ordering). The ordered clause set restriction and the foothold score restriction are explained using the operation on clause trees of merge path reversal. A new procedure called ALPOC, which combines ideas from ME, GC and Spencer's ordered clause set restriction (OC), to form a new procedure tighter than any of the top down procedures above, is developed and shown to be sound and complete. Another operation on clause <b>trees</b> called <b>surgery</b> is defined, and used to define a minimal clause tree. Any non-minimal clause tree can be reduced to a minimal clause <b>tree</b> using <b>surgery,</b> thereby showing that non-minimal clause trees are redundant. A sound procedure MinALPOC that produces only minimal clause trees is given. Mergeless clause trees are shown to be equivalent to each of input resolution, unit resolution and relative Horn sets, thereby giving short proofs of some known results. Many other new proof procedures using clause trees are discussed briefly, leaving many open questions...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of and therapy for cholangiocarcinomas still remains an interdisciplinary challenge. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes intra- and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas {{need to be}} distinguished. Multiple imaging tools such as sonography, multidetector computer tomography, magnetic resonance tomography as well as endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography for the diagnosis and localisation of these tumours are available. To date, surgical resection is the only curative treatment. At the time of diagnosis, most of the tumours are advanced. Therefore, {{only a small percentage}} of patients are suitable for curative surgery. Infiltration of the portal vein no longer constitutes a contraindication for surgery. Liver transplantation is not a reasonable option for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas but may be of advantage for perihilar Klatskin tumours. Severe cholangitis is the main cause of death of patients with obstructive cholangiocarcinomas. Drainage of the biliary <b>tree</b> system or <b>surgery</b> with construction of a biliary-digestive anastomosis is often necessary. If possible, a photodynamic therapy (PDT) should be performed in addition to biliary drainage. PDT has been shown to facilitate biliary drainage and to improve survival. The value of radiologist-assisted interventional procedures as well as percutaneous ablation and radiochemotherapy is not well established. In addition, so far, there is no standardised chemotherapy in a palliative situation established but there is some evidence for a benefit of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. For the best care and treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinomas an interdisciplinary approach is required and to achieve progress in the therapy patients should be included in prospective clinical trials to test new approache...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} oncological {{and functional}} {{results of the}} patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy for treatment of localized prostate cancer. Material and methods: In the period of 4 years, from 2007. to 2011. on two analyzed urological departments there have been 32 patients who underwent surgical treatment for treatment of localized prostate carcinoma. All of the patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. Patient age was in range from 57 to 70 years of age, with average value of 63 years of age. Gleason score values were: GS 8 - 2 patients, GS 7 - 6 patients, GS 6 - 10 patients, GS 5 - 9 patients, GS 3 - 4 patients GS 10 - 1 patient. Duration of the surgery was {{in the range of}} 55 to 95 minutes with the average blood loss between 220 and 640 ml. Fifty percent of the patients did not required blood transfusion. Results: After radical retropubic prostatectomy all patients are continent. Average urinary catheter removal time was 12 days after surgery. Postoperative surgical wound healing was prolonged for 4 patients. One patient had stenosis of urethrovesical anastomosis with was resolved with urethral dilatation. Control PSA values for 29 patients <b>tree</b> months after <b>surgery</b> was under 0, 2 ng/ml.

By removing the decayed and unsound wood {{from the tree}} and then filling the wound with cementitious material and well-placed anchor ties, the tree could effectively be reinforced.
