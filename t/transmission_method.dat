25|$|On January 1, 1979, Star Channel {{became a}} nationally {{distributed}} service {{after it was}} uplinked to satellite, becoming the third premium service to be distributed nationally through such a <b>transmission</b> <b>method</b> (after HBO, which was uplinked to satellite in September 1975, and Showtime, which was uplinked in March 1978). In April of that year, it began to share channel and transponder space with Warner-Amex's newly launched children's network, Nickelodeon (an outgrowth of the company's former Pinwheel programming service); this resulted in the latter service switching to an encrypted signal during the regularly scheduled network transition at 10:00p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on weekdays and 8:00p.m. on weekends; Star Channel originally signed off at 4:00a.m. Eastern and Pacific, three hours before the transponder space reverted to use by Nickelodeon.|$|E
25|$|Amidst an {{atmosphere}} of deep distrust, a post-election controversy rapidly developed regarding the means of transmitting results to CENI. Seeking to establish a reliable <b>transmission</b> <b>method,</b> a delegation from the European Union had met with Gnassingbé on 3 March and obtained his last-minute agreement to use the VSAT satellite system to transmit the results directly from each polling station. CENI accepted {{the use of the}} satellite system alongside text messaging and faxing. However, following the vote, Taffa Tabiou said on 5 March that the VSAT machines had failed and that it would therefore be necessary for all 35 electoral district directors to bring physical proof of the results to Lomé. That was unacceptable to the UFC, which said that results not transmitted through VSAT could not be trusted; it claimed that the machines had not failed but were simply switched off by the government.|$|E

A review of recent studies published on light reflection and light <b>transmission</b> <b>methods</b> used in NAPL migration is summarized and presented in this paper.

25|$|Members of a {{relatively}} new virus family, the astroviridae, astroviruses are now recognised {{as a cause of}} gastroenteritis in children, whose immune systems are underdeveloped, and elderly adults, whose immune systems are generally somewhat compromised. Presence of viral particles in fecal matter and in epithelial intestinal cells indicate that the virus replicates in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. The main symptoms are diarrhoea, followed by nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise and abdominal pain. Some research {{studies have shown that the}} incubation period of the disease is approximately three to four days. Astrovirus infection is not usually a severe situation and only in some rare cases leads to dehydration. The severity and variation in symptoms correlates with the region the case develops in. This could be due to climatic factors influencing the life cycle or <b>transmission</b> <b>method</b> for that particular strain of Astrovirus. Malnutrition and immunodeficiency tend to exasperate the condition, leading to more severe cases or secondary conditions that could require hospital care. Otherwise, infected people do not need hospitalization because symptoms will reduce by themselves, after 2 to 4 days.|$|E
500|$|In digital {{television}} broadcasting, {{there are three}} competing standards {{that are likely to}} be adopted worldwide. These are the ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use MPEG-2 for video compression. ATSC uses Dolby Digital AC-3 for audio compression, ISDB uses Advanced Audio Coding (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2. The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the Digital Audio Broadcasting standard (also known as the Eureka 147 standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt HD Radio. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a <b>transmission</b> <b>method</b> known as in-band on-channel transmission that allows digital information to [...] "piggyback" [...] on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1920s {{the first}} {{continuous}} sources of high frequency radio waves were developed: [...] the Barkhausen-Kurz tube, the first oscillator which could produce power at UHF frequencies; and the split-anode magnetron {{which by the}} 1930s had generated radio waves at up to 10GHz. [...] These made possible the first systematic research on microwaves in the 1930s. It was discovered that transmission lines used to carry lower frequency radio waves, parallel line and coaxial cable, had excessive power losses at microwave frequencies, creating {{a need for a}} new <b>transmission</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The BBC, which {{ultimately}} broadcast high-definition television on Freeview in the DVB-T2 format adopted in 2009, initially considered an alternative method utilising spare capacity {{at night to}} allow the download of high definition programmes for later replay. In addition the BBC's Research and Development team invented a <b>transmission</b> <b>method</b> that doubles the effective bandwidth that could currently be delivered by each multiplex using [...] "spatial multiplexing". While conventional analogue and digital terrestrial television signals are transmitted either vertically or horizontally polarised (providing protection against interference from other distant signals which may be transmitted on the same frequency, but will usually be planned to use the opposite polarisation), the proposed technique would have involved using the same frequency to transmit two different signals at once, one vertically and one horizontally polarised. A special receiving aerial, containing both vertically and horizontally polarised elements, could receive both signals simultaneously and feed these to a suitable set top box, but would require new transmitters and receiving equipment and aerials; the technique was ultimately not adopted.|$|E

30|$|This paper proposes two cyclostationarity-inducing <b>transmission</b> <b>methods</b> {{that enable}} the {{receiver}} to distinguish among different systems that use a common orthogonal frequency division multiplexing- (OFDM-) based air interface. Specifically, the OFDM signal is configured before transmission such that its cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF) has peaks at certain preselected cycle frequencies. The first proposed method inserts a specific preamble where only a selected subset of subcarriers is used for transmission. The second proposed method dedicates a few subcarriers in the OFDM frame to transmit specific signals that are designed so that the whole frame exhibits cyclostationarity at preselected cycle frequencies. The detection probabilities for the proposed cyclostationarity-inducing <b>transmission</b> <b>methods</b> are evaluated based on computer simulation when optimum and suboptimum detectors are used at the receiver.|$|R
