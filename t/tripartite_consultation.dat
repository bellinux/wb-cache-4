50|$|The <b>Tripartite</b> <b>Consultation</b> (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976, officially the Convention {{concerning}} {{tripartite consultations}} {{to promote the}} implementation of international labour standards is an International Labour Organization Convention, which governs the process for implementation of measures regarding ILO conferences. It requires <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> before ratification, implementing legislation or denouncement of conventions. As of June 2015, the convention had been ratified by 139 member states. The convention {{is also known as}} convention number 144 on the List of International Labour Organization Conventions.|$|E
5000|$|Countries {{are free}} to specify a minimum age for labour, {{with a minimum of}} 15 years. A {{declaration}} of 14 years is also possible when for a specified period of time. Laws may also permit light work for children aged 13-15 (not harming their health or school work). The minimum age of 18 years is specified for work which [...] "is likely to jeopardise the health, safety or morals of young persons". Definitions of the type of work and derogations are only possible after <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultations</b> (if such a system exists in the ratifying country).|$|R
40|$|From 1966, the Belgian State {{had become}} more and more {{involved}} in elaborating Belgian steel policy. This industry were poorly equipped to deal with the growing competition of the new steel producers in a period (1966 - 1975) marked by a strong growth in demand for steel followed by an unprecedented market collapse. It ‘s in this context that the first national institution for consultation and cooperation had been created in 1967. It was a rather original and innovative way to elaborate a more coordinated and cooperative steel policy in Belgium. Leaded by a major figure of the Belgian political and socio-economic « landerneau », André Oleffe, the CCPS had to managed the necessary sort out of the steel sector by the way of a <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultations</b> process between the governement, the sector’employers and trade unions. The challenge Andre Oleffe as chairman of the CCPS had to face was not the most easy one. While he played a central and very active role in this attempt to bring some order to the chaos of an industry more preoccupied with direct, short term profits than a long-term industrial policy, the institutional basis for tripartite cooperation had become inoperative from 1972. But the holding companies were {{become more and more}} dependent on it for obtaining State subsidies for their still firms. After several financial restructuring operations, a governement shareholder in the steel firms was gradually acquired from 1979...|$|R
50|$|The International Labour Organization is {{the only}} United Nations agency {{that is based on}} tripartism. It uses the discussions between the three groups in {{drafting}} of standards and conventions. Also for the implementation of ILO-standards in national law tripartite consultations on a national level are a requirement for those countries party to the <b>Tripartite</b> <b>Consultation</b> (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> {{mechanism}} of labor relations {{is a universal}} pattern in market economy countries to resolve the problem of labor relations and {{is also an important}} component in the adjustment {{mechanism of}} labor relations in China.

This paper studies and analyzes existing problems and improvement of the <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> mechanism in China and puts forward suggestions of the author. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{a system}} of <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation,</b> workers, employers, and the {{government}} work together to improve labor standards and protect workers’ rights. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has advocated for this system {{since its founding in}} 1919. China’s transition toward a market economy and World Trade Organization (WTO) accession calls for a new labor relations consultation mechanism, which is more market‐oriented, globalized, diversified, and flexible. In this context, China implemented its own form of tripartite consulta‐ tion in 2001, with the founding of the State Labor Relations Tripartite   Consultation Conference.   The tripartite system in China has been widely adopted and has been an innovative development in Chinese labor relations. However, many argue that it does not meet the standards of the ILO tripartite system. Indeed, China’s <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> mechanism differs from that advocated by the ILO. The <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> mechanism in China lacks neutrality, enforceability of consultation outcomes, trade union independence and workers’ representation. Nonetheless, the tripartite mechanism currently utilized in Chinese labor relations is a first step toward a more authentic tripartite   consultation mechanism by ILO standards. This is an important development in Chinese labor relations. As the beginning of social dialogue, the Chinese tripartite mechanism has the potential to impact both informal systems and the way labor law is structured...|$|E
40|$|Responding to {{internal}} market and social pressures that centre on the inadequate protection accorded to workers' rights, China's government has begun constructing a tripartite industrial relations regime. As this process matures, {{it is to}} be expected that it will {{have a significant impact on}} those business enterprises that elect to invest in China in order to capture the profits to be made by labour exploitation and may well change the national origin of China’s investment inflow. This paper examines the emerging <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> mechanisms that are being established by the government, trade unions and employers' organisations and explores three research questions relating to the viability of tripartism in China. It is concluded that, despite many constraints and limitations, the nascent system of <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> is becoming an integral part of China's industrial relations regime, and that gradually the tripartite mechanisms will enhance the representativeness of the social partners and further respect for the rights of labour in China...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Industrial {{relations}} in China and Viet Nam {{are on the}} way to divergence. The official industrial relations actors in China have attempted ‘institutional cloning ’ of key elements of modern industrial relations such as <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> and collective bargaining within the political limit imposed by the Party-state. This attempt of preemptive corporatism has so far failed to address the rising tide of various forms of labour disputes while yielding some positive results of gradual strengthening of official trade unions at the workplace. Industrial {{relations in}} Viet Nam are characterized by more vibrant associational dynamism at national and provincial levels, which is obvious in the co-existence of cooperation and competition between and within the industrial relations actors. Workers in Viet Nam display greater degree of spontaneous solidarity in the form of well coordinated ‘wildcat strikes’, which are accommodated by the government and the official trade unions at higher level...|$|E
40|$|Human {{resources}} and skills {{are becoming increasingly}} important to economic development. In {{the context of the}} economic downturn, challenges such as high youth unemployment call for a collaborative approach between local employment officials, educational institutions and wider social and economic partners. But do local labour market offices have sufficient flexibility in the implementation of their policies and programmes to contribute effectively to local strategies? If local labour market offices are to be given more flexibility, how can this be reconciled with the need for accountability and the achievement of national policy goals? The Belgium case study for the Building Flexibility and Accountability into Local Employment Services project explores the level of local accountability and flexibility within labour market policy in Flanders, focusing in particular on the Flemish Public Employment Service (VDAB), municipalities and the regional <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> platforms SERRs and RESOCs. This report is one of four country reports, with the other participating countries being Canada, Denmark and the Netherlands. A synthesis report is also available (see Working Paper 2011 / 10). ...|$|E
30|$|In CEE {{there were}} {{attempts}} at coordination before the recession in some countries. In Romania {{the termination of}} national, cross-sector agreements has weakened coordination across sectors, especially now wage bargaining has moved to the company level and most employees are no longer covered by collective bargaining arrangements. Slovenia had been the exception among the post-communist countries with a rather highly organized system of industrial relations (Bohle and Greskovits 2012) {{and it has been}} “the only post-communist society where social pacts have been concluded systematically since the mid- 1990 s and have also been influential … (Stanojević and Krašovec 2011 : 232)”. However, during the recession this ended and with fewer sectoral and no cross-sectoral agreement on wages, there is much less coordination than in the past. In Hungary, until 2011, employers and trade unions, although very divided and fragmented, issued a joint recommendation for wage increases {{within the framework of the}} now abolished <b>tripartite</b> <b>consultation</b> body. Since 2011 the government issues its own recommendations, but it is unclear whether these are followed. In Slovakia, countering the weakening of sectoral bargaining, the existing informal coordination across sectors was in 2013 augmented by the establishment of a formal bi-partite social dialogue arrangement for industry. Elsewhere in CEE, for instance in the Czech Republic where the government froze the statutory minimum wage for several years after 2008, the minimum wages is used as a tool to send messages to wage bargainers.|$|E
