500|$|Merrill Barr of Forbes {{felt the}} purpose of the {{crossover}} was to establish the back-stories of Legends characters Vandal Savage, Hawkman and Hawkgirl who are not a natural fit with Arrow and The Flash. He described them as [...] "comic-book shows in the truest sense of the term" [...] because they rely completely on [...] "their source material," [...] and are at their best when they embrace this [...] "without reservation". Barr was fascinated at how intertwined the crossover is, but saw it as [...] "more than just a Legends of Tomorrow set-up". In his opinion: [...] "The heart of Flash and edge of Arrow gel perfectly <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> create something wholly unique that the folks across the way at Disney have never really been interested in trying." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the United States Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, and two former Navy SEALS, Glen Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods. On September 16, Rice appeared on CBS's political TV show Face the Nation and ABC's <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>to</b> state that the attack was a direct result of a [...] "heinous and offensive video", and was spontaneous, not preplanned. She added (on a different subject), [...] "e've decimated al-Qaeda." [...] Although Rice said that the attack [...] "began spontaneously" [...] as the result of an anti-Islamic video, Patrick F. Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management, had said prior to her interview that he believed the assault was planned, and other sources, including Libyan President Mohammed Magariaf, had expressed the view that the attack was pre-planned and that there was an al-Qaeda link.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{rejection}} of the proposed bailout of the United States financial system and resulting market fluctuation all over the world, including the Toronto Stock Exchange, Jack Layton called for Harper to call a special meeting for federal party leaders to discuss the potential effects of the U.S economic crisis on Canadians, suggestion the afternoon of October 1, since all leaders would be in Ottawa for the first Leaders' Debate that night. A spokesman for Harper later reported that Harper would not call such a meeting, and to save discussion for the Leader's Debate, as [...] " [...] will have an opportunity later <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> debate— not behind closed doors but in front of all Canadians— the issues at stake not [...] for our economy but for our country". Harper later announced that he would ask for the 12 minutes on the economy scheduled for the Leader's Debate to be extended to an hour, citing that the financial crisis affecting the U.S. [...] "has deepened since the debate format was finalized", a change which would require agreement from the other parties in the debate to be approved. The NDP released a statement soon after that they supported the move, while public response has been concerned that other topics such as the environment would not end up with enough time to cover the issue. All the leaders supported the idea, and the opening and closing statements were dropped and the allotted time for the economy extended to 30 minutes without affecting the other topics.|$|E

2500|$|On both 23 May and 30 May after Friday prayers, tens of {{thousands}} of demonstrators rallied in various cities including Tripoli and Benghazi in support of Gen. Haftar and his campaign against Islamist militias and also in support of Haftar's calls to suspend parliament. In Benghazi, thousands of pro-Haftar demonstrators gathered outside Tibesti Hotel and in the city's Tahreer Square, as well as others in the city of Bayda further east. [...] "No to militias, Libya will not become another Afghanistan" [...] and [...] "Yes to the army, yes to the police", their banners read. Meanwhile, crowds in Tripoli's Martyr's Square chanted against the parliament and in support of a national army and police force to replace the militias that run rampant in the country. They sang the national anthem as they waved the flag and carried banners that read [...] "Yes to Dignity". They called for an official response to the militias. [...] "Libya is in trouble, we want police, we want army", they chanted. While some Libyans don't back Haftar and don't want military rule, they support what he is doing. The protest, dubbed the [...] "Friday of Dignity", took its name from the offensive launched by Haftar, one week ago in the eastern city of Benghazi. The demonstrations were some of the largest the country has seen since the uprising three years ago and were the first since then to be held simultaneously in cities across Libya, which put more pressure on the embattled Islamist-led parliament to offer concessions. The interim government issued a statement in support of Friday’s protests and reasserted its proposal <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> suspend parliament. [...] "The participation of tens {{of thousands}} [...] requires all to answer {{to the demands of the}} people who represent legitimacy that can't be ignored", the statement said.|$|E
2500|$|The {{comment was}} in {{reference}} to Grey's Anatomy star Isaiah Washington's use of the epithet and his subsequent mandatory [...] "psychological assessment" [...] imposed by ABC executives. It was widely interpreted as meaning that Coulter had called Edwards a [...] "faggot," [...] but Coulter argued {{that she did not}} actually do so, while simultaneously indicating she would not have been wrong to say it. Edwards responded on his web site by characterizing Coulter's words as [...] "un-American and indefensible," [...] and asking readers to help him [...] "raise $100,000 in 'Coulter Cash' <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> keep this campaign charging ahead and fight back against the politics of bigotry." [...] He also called her a [...] "she-devil," [...] adding, [...] "I should not have name-called. But the truth is—forget the names—people like Ann Coulter, they engage in hateful language." [...] Coulter's words also drew condemnation from many prominent Republicans and Democrats, as well as groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Three advertisers (Verizon, Sallie Mae and Netbank) also pulled their advertisements from Coulter's web site, and several newspapers dropped her column. Coulter responded in an e-mail to the New York Times, [...] "C’mon, it was a joke. I would never insult gays by suggesting that they are like John Edwards. That would be mean." [...] On March 5, 2007, she appeared on Hannity and Colmes and said, [...] "Faggot isn't offensive to gays; {{it has nothing to do}} with gays. It's a schoolyard taunt meaning 'wuss.'" [...] Gay rights advocates were not convinced. [...] "Ann Coulter's use of this anti-gay slur is vile and unacceptable," [...] said Neil G. Giuliano, president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, [...] "and the applause from her audience is an important reminder that Coulter's ugly brand of bigotry is at the root of the discriminatory policies being promoted at this gathering." [...] A spokesman for Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, called Coulter's comments [...] "wildly inappropriate." ...|$|E

Oh, but I must rise, so there is no more to be said; and so morrow, sirrahs both.--Night. I dined to-day with the Secretary, who has engaged me for every Sunday; and I was an hour with him this morning deep in politics, where I told him the {{objections}} of the October Club, and he answered all except one, that no inquiries are made into past mismanagement. But indeed I believe they are not yet able to make any: the late Ministry were too cunning in their rogueries, and fenced themselves with an Act of general pardon. I believe Mr. Harley must be Lord Treasurer; yet he makes one difficulty which is hard to answer: he must be made a lord, and his estate is not large enough, and he is too generous to make it larger; and if the Ministry should change soon by any accident, he will be left in the suds. Another difficulty is, that if he be made a peer, they will want him prodigiously in the House of Commons, of which he is the great mover, and after him the Secretary, and hardly any else of weight. Two shillings more to-day for coach and chair. I shall be ruined.|$|E

I intended to dine with Lord Treasurer; but going to see Colonel Disney, who lives with General Withers,(28) I liked the General's little dinner so well, that I stayed and took share of it, and did not go to Lord Treasurer till six, where I found Dr. Sacheverell, who told us that the bookseller had given him 100 pounds for his sermon,(29) preached last Sunday, and intended to print 30,000: I believe he will be confoundedly bit, and will hardly sell above half.

'It's {{really very}} annoying, this letter from Selah,' Herbert Le Breton murmured to himself, as he {{carefully}} burnt the compromising document, envelope and all, with a fusee from his oriental silver pocket match-case. 'I had hoped the thing {{had all been}} forgotten by this time, after her long silence, and my last two judiciously chilly letters--a sort of slow refrigerating process for poor shivering naked little Cupid. But here, just {{at the very moment}} when I fancied the affair had quite blown over, comes this most objectionable letter, telling me that Selah has actually betaken herself to London to meet me; and what makes it more annoying still, I wanted to go up myself <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>to</b> dine at home with Ethel Faucit. Mother's plan about Ethel Faucit is exceedingly commendable; a girl with eight hundred a year, cultivated tastes, and no father or other encumbrances dragging after her. I always said I should like to marry a poor orphan. A very desirable young woman to annex in every way! And now, here's Selah Briggs--ugh! how could I ever have gone and entangled myself in my foolish days with a young woman burdened by such a cognomen!--here's Selah Briggs must needs run away from Hastings, and try to hunt me up on her own account in London. If I dared, I wouldn't go up to see her at all, and would let the thing die a natural death of inanition--sine Cerere et Baccho, and so forth--(I'm afraid, poor girl, she'll be more likely to find Bacchus than Ceres if she sticks in London); but the plain fact is, I don't dare--that's the long and the short of it. If I did, Selah'd be tracking me to earth here in Oxford, and a nice mess that'd make of it! She doesn't know my name, to be sure; but as soon as she called at college and found nobody of the name of Walters was known there, she'd lie in wait for me about the gates, as sure as my name's Herbert Le Breton, and sooner or later she'd take it out of me, one way or the other. Selah has as many devils in her as the Gergesene who dwelt among the tombs, I'll be sworn to it; and if she's provoked, she'll let them all loose in a legion to crush me. I'd better see her and have it out quietly, once for all, than try to shirk it here in Oxford and let myself in at the end for the worse condemnation.' ...|$|E
