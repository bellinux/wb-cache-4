Correlation techniques and multiple regression models, one for shore-based <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> and one for afloat-based <b>test</b> <b>equipment.</b> are used to address the primary question asked in thi thesis: Can we measure the effect of Engineering and Technical Services on the throughput rate of aviation depot level repairable items serviced by automatic <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> (ATE) ? The analysis concludes {{that the effect of}} Engineering and Technical Services can be demonstrated both in the case of shorebased test benches, and ship-based test benches, although the results are not strong enough to base general conclusions. The study also demonstrated that the techniques of correlation and multiple regression were useful in indicating other relationships. Further research is recommended to more conclusively assess the effect of tech reps in the maintenance arena. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
