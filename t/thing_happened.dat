5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1988, the band started rehearsing material for a new album with producer André Jacquemin, who had worked on all the Monty Python’s records. The album Take a Bite was published by GWR in October 1988 and follows in the steps of Nightmare at Maple Cross, presenting powerful and melodic metal songs, tinged with the humour typical of the band. To promote the album, Girlschool did a UK tour with Gary Glitter, followed by a North American tour. In 1989, they travelled across Europe with Dio and to the Soviet Union with Black Sabbath, {{till the end of}} the year. After their return from Russia, GWR did not renew their contract and the band practically broke up. Musical tastes were changing worldwide in favour of grunge and more extreme metal genres, compelling most acts originated from the new wave of British heavy metal to disband or to reduce their activities, and the same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> to Girlschool.|$|E

5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on Wednesday 23 May at Worcestershire's New Road ground in Worcester, but no play was possible due to bad weather, and so the match {{was moved to the}} following day. The same <b>thing</b> <b>happened</b> in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to be playing. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset, and chose to bat first. The Somerset captain himself opened the batting, alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's West Indian bowler, Vanburn Holder, bowled the first over. Holder bowled seven deliveries—six denoted a normal over, but he had to bowl one extra due to a no ball—all to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots, and declared Somerset's innings complete {{at the end of the}} over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no ball, and Worcestershire only needed to score two to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod were the batsmen. Colin Dredge bowled the first over for Somerset, and Turner scored one run from it. Keith Jennings bowled the second over, and Turner scored another single from the fourth delivery to grant Worcestershire the victory.|$|E
