25|$|Organizers {{released}} a statement about {{the purpose of the}} demonstration: The Women's March on Washington, Portland is aligned with the mission of the national march, which is a national movement to unify and empower everyone who stands for women's rights, human rights, immigrant rights, civil liberties, and social justice for all. This is a non-partisan, permitted and peaceful event where we march in solidarity with our partners and children for the protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families — recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are the strength of our country. Oregon and Greater Portland NOW and Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette are <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> several sponsors and allies.|$|E
500|$|On July 19, Roberts sent {{a similar}} pair of coins to Secretary of the Treasury George Cortelyou, noting that Saint-Gaudens's {{use of a}} smooth finish to the design, rather than the sharp die work {{characteristic}} of the Liberty gold pieces, might encourage counterfeiting. [...] Roberts communicated these concerns to Saint-Gaudens, who requested casts of the dies used to strike the new pieces, which were sent to his house in Cornish, New Hampshire on July 28. [...] Saint-Gaudens died there of cancer on August 3, 1907, and Roosevelt wrote to his widow Augusta, [...] "I count {{it as one of}} the privileges of my administration to have had him make <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> coins".|$|E

In his 1966 book Mormon Doctrine, LDS theologian (and, later, apostle) Bruce R. McConkie wrote that [...] "From time to time, accounts of various supposed visions, revelations, and prophecies are spread forth by and among the Latter-day Saints, who should know better than to believe or spread such false information. One of these false and deceptive documents that has cropped up again and again for over a century is the so-called White Horse Prophecy." ...|$|E

500|$|Walker became {{involved}} in a civil rights lawsuit in 1884 after a roller-skating rink in Steubenville denied entry to Walker and his friend, Hannibal Lyons. [...] The Cleveland Gazette, an African-American weekly newspaper, described the circumstances as follows:Steubenville, like many other places, is suffering now from the roller skate craze. [...] There are now three in full blast and prospects for more. [...] Discrimination on account of color never was carried on in Steubenville until these strangers starting rinks here issued the edict [...] "No Negroes need apply except for positions of menials." [...] On the 16th there was an opening night at the South Side Rink, and <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> young men of gentlemanly deportment and honest reputation applied for admission. [...] The proprietor of the rink flatly told them, [...] "You are colored and you can't skate." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Operation Mongoose was ended, the Kennedy Administration {{made some}} {{attempts}} to mend {{relations with the}} Cuban government. As a number of documents released by the National Security Archive reveal, this happened fairly soon after the project ended. One document {{comes in the form}} of an options paper from a Latin American specialist about how to fix relations. The document begins by suggesting that, through the CIA's attempts to off Castro and topple the government, they had [...] "been looking seriously only at one side of the coin" [...] and that they could try the reverse side and try [...] "quietly enticing Castro over to us." [...] The document goes on to push for further studies into how exactly they would go about improving relations. The document also states the two possible outcomes that would come along with a better relationship with Cuba. The document states, [...] "In the short run, we would probably be able to neutralize at least <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> main worries about Castro: the reintroduction of offensive missiles and Cuban subversion. In the long run, we would be able to work on eliminating Castro at our leisure and from a good vantage point.", the effort to mend the relationships would be framed heavily by the negative relations formed due to Operation Mongoose.|$|E

As soon as it was concluded of, all the rum that was in the Towns was all staved and spilled, belonging both to Indians and white people, which in quantity consisted of about forty gallons, that was thrown in the street, and we have appointed four men to stave all the rum or strong liquors that is brought to the Towns hereafter, either by Indians or white men, during the four years. We would be glad if our brothers would send strict orders that we might prevent the rum coming to the hunting cabins or to the neighboring towns. We have sent wampum to the French, to the Five Nations, to the Delaware...to tell them not to bring any rum to our towns, for we want none...so we would be glad if our brothers would inform the traders not bring any for we are sorry, after they have brought it a great way, for them to have it broke, and when they're once warned they will take care." ...|$|E
