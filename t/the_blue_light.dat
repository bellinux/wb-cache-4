5|$|The {{front of}} the console {{features}} an illuminated slot-loading optical media drive which accepts only 12cm Wii Optical Discs and 8cm Nintendo GameCube Game Discs. (Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) <b>The</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on, and pulses when new data is received through WiiConnect24. After the update (including System Menu 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. Two USB ports are located at its rear. An SD-card slot is located behind the cover on the {{front of the}} console.|$|E

25|$|Colorless {{fluorescent}} dyes that emit {{blue light}} under UV are added as optical brighteners to paper and fabrics. <b>The</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> emitted by these agents counteracts yellow tints {{that may be}} present and causes the colors and whites to appear whiter or more brightly colored.|$|E
40|$|Red {{warning lights}} {{delineate}} the runway approach with additional <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> juxtaposed with <b>the</b> red lights {{such that the}} red lights are chromatically balanced. The red/blue point light sources result in the phenomenon that the red lights appear in front of <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> with about one and one-half times the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>blue.</b> To a pilot observing these lights along a glide path, those red lights directly below appear to be nearer than <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>lights.</b> For those lights farther away seen in perspective at oblique angles, the red lights {{appear to be in}} a position closer to the pilot and hence appear to be above <b>the</b> corresponding <b>blue</b> <b>lights.</b> This produces a very pronounced three dimensional effect referred to as chromostereopsis which provides valuable visual cues to enable the pilot to perceive his actual position above the ground and the actual distance to the runway...|$|R

50|$|The use of {{flashing}} lights and sirens is colloquially known as blues and twos {{which refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> and <b>the</b> two-tone siren once commonplace (although most sirens now use a range of tones). In <b>the</b> UK, only <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> are used to denote emergency vehicles (although other colours may {{also be used as}} sidelights, stop indicators, etc.). A call-out requiring the use of lights and sirens is often colloquially known as a <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> run.|$|R
25|$|In 1877, two prospectors, Hank Smith and William Curry, {{discovered}} {{silver in}} present-day Silverado Canyon. Several mines immediately sprang {{up in the}} area, the largest of which was known as <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Light</b> Mine. During this period, the town of Silverado rose at the confluence of Silverado Creek and Santiago Creek and the boom continued for over three years. Although {{the height of the}} mining was in the three or four years following the discovery of silver, smaller-scale mining continued for decades after the initial boom had ended. The last commercial operations at <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Light</b> Mine ceased in the 1940s. The mine has continued to issue small amounts of toxic tailings, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury, remediation for which the Trabuco Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest began toxic cleanup in 2008.|$|E
25|$|White {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) became {{available in the}} mid-1990s as LED lamps, in which blue light emitted from the semiconductor strikes phosphors deposited on the tiny chip. The combination of <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the phosphors produces a net emission of white light.|$|E
25|$|The band {{formed around}} 1998 as a jazz fusion group with {{experimental}} tendencies. The founding members were Ryan Chindlund on drums, Robert Salihar on bass guitar and vocals, and Aaron Allietta on keyboards. Dan Haggerty and Scotty Kattenbraker were soon added as guitarists. The first album From <b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Light</b> House (1998) showcases this particular incarnation.|$|E

25|$|The predatory deep-sea dragonfish Malacosteus niger, the {{closely related}} Aristostomias genus and the species Pachystomias microdon {{are capable of}} {{harnessing}} <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> emitted from their own bioluminescence to generate red biofluorescence from suborbital photophores. This red fluorescence is invisible to other animals, which allows these dragonfish extra light at dark ocean depths without attracting or signaling predators.|$|E

Zhang remembered when he shot his 1993 hit Beijing Bastards with Dou Wei, Wong as Dou's girlfriend would visit the set every day. Japanese director Shunji Iwai had {{explained that the}} titular pop-star character of his 2001 film All About Lily Chou-Chou was conceived after attending a Faye Wong concert. Wong's name was also mentioned in the 2003 Japanese film <b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Light</b> {{as one of the}} protagonist's favourites.|$|E
25|$|Fullerenes are {{sparingly}} soluble in aromatic solvents such as toluene and carbon disulfide, but insoluble in water. Solutions of pure C60 {{have a deep}} purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for this color change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of molecular levels responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> transmittance and causing the purple to brown color change.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} {{series of the}} show, the opening {{sequence}} consisted of a police car, a Rover SD1, racing down a street with its siren wailing and its blue flashing light on. The car would screech to a stop, and the camera would zoom in on <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light.</b> Various clips were then shown from the series {{of the characters in}} action, often chasing suspects. This sequence kept the first version of [...] "Overkill", and also used the same ending credits from series one. This sequence was also used in the third series.|$|E
500|$|It is {{customary}} to fly flags from sunrise until sunset, {{unless they}} are directly illuminated. [...] At {{the beginning of each}} day, the cross-shaped [...] "masthead" [...] atop the center field scoreboard displays the American flag at the top, and three strands of flags bearing the colors and nicknames of each of the National League clubs, one strand per Division in order of that day's standings. Immediately after the game, one of the strands of flags is lowered, and either the W or the L-lettered flag is raised in its place. The W-lettered flag is raised on the left field side of the board, above <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> that also indicates a win. The L-lettered flag is raised on the right field side of the board, above the white light that indicates a loss. Once the Win or Loss Flag has been raised, the other flags are lowered and also stowed away inside the scoreboard.|$|E
