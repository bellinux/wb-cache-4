5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was {{obscured}} by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith. The tower began to become <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books were kept in the tower.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} the {{congregation}} was not unified. However, {{as there were}} only about 50 Jews in Jackson in 1868, the community was <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> two synagogues. Conflicts arose between the older German Jewish members and post-American Civil War Jewish immigrants from Poland, particularly over synagogue ritual. The synagogue followed the Orthodox nusach Ashkenaz, but some members wanted to adopt Isaac Mayer Wise's reformist Minhag America Prayer-Book.|$|E

5|$|George IV came to {{the throne}} in 1820 {{intending}} to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and influence as the ruler of an increasingly powerful Britain. George's previous houses, Carlton House and the Brighton Pavilion were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> grand court events, even after expensive extensions. George expanded the Royal Lodge in the castle park whilst he was Prince Regent, and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself once he became king.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Adolf Hitler {{decided to}} expand the Reich Chancellery (Reichskanzlei), which he {{considered}} <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> his needs. On 21 July 1935, Leonhard Gall submitted plans for a large reception hall (that {{could also be used}} as a ballroom) to be built onto the old Chancellery. The drawings were unique because of the large cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to a bunker which later became known as the Vorbunker.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the Suffolk {{was often}} criticised for its poor feet, having hooves that were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> its body mass.

5|$|The main {{hospital}} in Ashford is William Harvey Hospital, in nearby Willesborough. It {{is named after}} William Harvey, the doctor who discovered the blood circulatory system. The hospital was built because the government decided the old hospital would be <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> demand as Ashford grew, and looked for a 30-acre site that could have a hospital built on a budget of £7–8million. Work started on building the {{hospital in}} 1973 and it was commissioned in 1977, opening in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E

5|$|Four {{decades after}} its construction, Union Station was proving <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> {{its role as}} the {{principal}} railroad hub of Berkshire County. In 1908 local residents began agitating for a larger station, and William H. MacInnis made it a platform of his mayoral candidacy. In 1910 MacInnis appointed a three-man committee (one {{a director of the}} B) to lobby the railroad authorities to replace Union Station. Financial constraints at first hampered their efforts. but in April 1912 the B agreed to support the project. In 1913, the NYNH acquired the former Burbank Hotel property and began constructing the second Union Station.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to build}} a new stadium in Malmö {{originated}} in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö IP to be <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> major events. However, the city council could not agree where to build the new stadium, and the matter was dropped for the time being. It was not until Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup that the question resurfaced. The location of the stadium was a main subject of discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, while others thought that the stadium should be located in central Malmö, near the neighbourhood of Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954.|$|E

5|$|Recently, free {{electron}} lasers {{have been developed}} for use in X-ray crystallography. These are the brightest X-ray sources currently available; with the X-rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The intensity of the source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual diffraction images must be collected {{in order to get a}} complete data-set. This method, serial femtosecond crystallography, has been used in solving the structure of a number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources.|$|E
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|St Gwenllwyfo's Church is a 19th-century parish church {{near the}} village of Dulas, in Anglesey, north Wales. It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also {{dedicated}} to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and had become <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>for</b> its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed £936 towards the total cost of £1,417, rather than near the area where many of the parishioners lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married into the family that owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained glass that had once belonged to a Flemish monastery.|$|E
