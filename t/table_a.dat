5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} 2001–02 season in good form and a win against Liverpool in December 2001 – having {{gone down to}} ten men in the first half, helped them move second in the <b>table.</b> <b>A</b> draw against Southampton on 2 February 2002 started a run of 13 {{consecutive}} league wins – a new record, beginning against Everton. Arsenal won the league away to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 8 May 2002; the winning goal was scored by Sylvain Wiltord in the second half. The result meant the team were unbeaten away from home all season, and in scoring four goals against Everton on the final day, became {{the first team to}} score in every league match they played. Arsenal completed the double, having beaten Chelsea 2–0 in the 2002 FA Cup Final.|$|E

Both Arsenal and Manchester United went into the final two games of the league season on the same number of points, but the latter's defeat to Leeds United all but ended their chances of retaining the title.|$|E

Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E

On {{the left side of the}} <b>table,</b> <b>a</b> goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by the symbols of the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E

5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to <b>table</b> <b>a</b> response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E
5|$|Inmates {{are allowed}} to receive their families, partners, or friends privately twice a week for two hours. Individual rooms {{containing}} a sofa, sink, and cupboard with sheets, towels, and condoms are available for single-person visits. For those with families, a larger room with toys and baby-changing facilities is available. Inmates are checked after visits, and if illegal items are found, prisoners can lose their rights to private visits. This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits from family members and stay with them for 24 hours. The house has a small kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room with a dining <b>table,</b> <b>a</b> sofa, and a television, {{as well as an}} outdoor play area with toys. Foreigners are not allowed and inmates have to complete a child-development education program to have 24-hour-long visits. During visits, staff make regular checks on the prisoners and their families.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed {{the chance to go}} top of the <b>table.</b> <b>A</b> brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat in the league and extended a barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and kept up the pressure on the challengers.|$|E

5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water <b>table</b> <b>a</b> wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|E
5|$|Wetherall's {{start to}} the 2001–02 season was {{hampered}} by a groin injury and his first full game of the campaign came on 14 September 2001 when he scored in a 5–1 Division One victory over Gillingham, which put Bradford second in the <b>table.</b> <b>A</b> groin injury again kept Wetherall {{out of the side}} for nearly five months, during which time he was linked with moves back to the Premier League at either Southampton or Manchester City, but he opted to stay at Valley Parade. He returned from injury for a reserve game in March after four months out with just over two months of the season left. He returned to the side against Burnley in a game noted for Paul Gascoigne's debut for Burnley, and scored in his next game as Bradford eased any relegation worries by defeating Crewe Alexandra 2–0. He played in the club's final seven games and was named club captain for the following season after Stuart McCall left the club.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{resigned}} as manager in February 1950 {{and was replaced}} in April with Dick Duckworth, a former York player. York were forced to apply for re-election to retain {{their place in the}} Football League for the first time, after finishing bottom of the Third Division North in 1949–50. They did not have to enter the ballot because the Football League was to be extended to 92 clubs for 1950–51. Despite York's senior team's troubles, the reserve team scored over 100 goals to finish sixth in the Midland League, and won the North Riding Senior Cup for the first time after beating Middlesbrough 3–0 at Ayresome Park in the final. York's fortunes improved in 1950–51; they ranked 17th in the league and reached the FA Cup third round {{for the first time since}} 1946, when they were beaten 2–0 by First Division team Bolton Wanderers at Burnden Park. York's best post-war season to date came in 1951–52, as they finished in 10th place and set a home record of 16 wins, four draws and three defeats. York chased promotion in 1952–53, and by late January 1953 they were third in the table. They finished in fourth place with 53 points; both new club records in the Football League. During this season, Duckworth was reluctantly released from his contract in October 1952 to take charge at Stockport County. His successor, the former Grimsby Town manager Charlie Spencer, died in February 1953. Sheffield United's assistant manager Jimmy McCormick was appointed in June 1953, and by late December York were bottom of the <b>table.</b> <b>A</b> win in the last match of 1953–54 meant they finished in 22nd place, and avoided having to apply for re-election. Sessions {{resigned as}} chairman in November 1953 and was succeeded by Hugh Kitchin.|$|E
