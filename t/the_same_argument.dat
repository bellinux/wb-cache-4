5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love {{intentionally}} {{presents a}} moral dilemma to viewers. By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> as that presented by Comus, {{that it is}} rational for the viewer to succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson counts Þorgerðr and Irpa as {{examples}} of guardian goddesses in Germanic paganism, and compares their roles {{to that of the}} dísir and valkyries. Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of Hålogaland, it would explain Þorgerðr's last name ("bride of Helgi") and that, subsequently, she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn. Substantially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> has been advanced by McKinnell. Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age, that the idea of a guardian goddess welcoming kings was essentially an aristocratic concept, and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries welcoming dead kings into the after life, using the poem Hákonarmál as an example.|$|E

5|$|Logan's retrial {{began in}} June 2007, with the {{prosecution}} unable to use Logan's confession to present its case for conviction, for the judiciary had ruled {{that it had been}} obtained with impropriety. In the retrial, the prosecution used <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> it had used in the original trial back in 2003, arguing that Logan's insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances. The state's prosecution argued that Logan himself was solely responsible for any deficiencies in his mental health, saying that they were brought about through his consumption of illegal narcotics, such as cocaine and marijuana, two illegal controlled substances which he had used {{on the day of the}} murders. Ultimately, the first attempt at a retrial ended in June 2007 with a mistrial after jurors couldn't come to a verdict after ten hours of deliberations. On July 1, 2007, Logan's attorney died after being involved in an automobile collision on Route 10 in Glen Burnie, further complicating matters. However, a few months later, Logan was subsequently convicted again after pleading guilty and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment on October 24, 2007, with credit for the five years he had already served, much to the disappointment of the victims' surviving family members, who felt he deserved a lifelong imprisonment for his crime.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> applies when {{hardware}} of {{this type}} uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor.

Unlike de Broglie, Lunn went on to formulate the differential equation now known as the Schrödinger equation, and solve for its energy eigenvalues for the hydrogen atom. Unfortunately the paper was rejected by the Physical Review, as recounted by Kamen.|$|E

25|$|Any preordered set (P, ≤) forms a small category, {{where the}} objects are {{the members of}} P, the morphisms are arrows {{pointing}} from x to y when x ≤ y. Between any two objects there can be at most one morphism. The existence of identity morphisms and the composability of the morphisms are guaranteed by the reflexivity and the transitivity of the preorder. By <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument,</b> any partially ordered set and any equivalence relation {{can be seen as}} a small category.

25|$|Duthie's {{arguments}} were never fully accepted at the time, as critics tended {{to look on}} {{the relationship between the two}} plays as an either-or situation; A Shrew is either a reported text or an early draft. In more recent scholarship, however, the possibility that a text could be both has been shown to be critically viable. For example, in his 2003 Oxford Shakespeare edition of 2 Henry VI, Roger Warren makes <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> for The First Part of the Contention. Randall Martin reaches the same conclusion regarding The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of Yorke in his 2001 Oxford Shakespeare edition of 3 Henry VI. This lends support to the theory that A Shrew could be both a reported text and an early draft.|$|E
25|$|Thus we {{have the}} President of the Reorganized Church and son of Joseph Smith admitting, as well as apologizing for the rash {{statements}} {{of his father and}} other leaders in the old church, and then we have Joseph F. Smith of the Utah church using about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> to excuse the language and murderous conduct of the Danites in Utah. All we care to say is reply to both of these descendants of the original prophet and organizer of the Danite Band is, that when the leading members and officers of the church for many years teach and practice, by threats and murders, ascribed to the Danite Band, then we believe the public is justified in denouncing such language and conduct, and affirming it to be the doctrine of the church.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> for {{unification}} {{could be}} made for Latin and Cyrillic -- the American English encoding system known as ASCII never encoded the Cyrillic А (U+0410) differently from the Latin A (U+0041) -- {{but we know that}} ASCII was never intended to display both Latin and Cyrillic in the same document. Similarly, Korean encoding standards never had the aim of displaying Korean and Japanese and Chinese and Cyrillic and Ethiopian all within a single document. Almost all of the variants that the PRC developed or standardized got unique codepoints owing simply to the fortune of the Simplified Chinese transition carrying through into the computing age. This privilege however, seems to apply inconsistently. While most simplifications performed in Japan and mainland China with codepoints in national standards, including characters simplified differently in each country, did make it into Unicode as unique codepoints.|$|E
25|$|Now {{consider}} an 8-fold rotation, and the displacement vectors between adjacent {{points of the}} polygon. If a displacement exists between any two lattice points, then that same displacement is repeated everywhere in the lattice. So collect all the edge displacements to begin at a single lattice point. The edge vectors become radial vectors, and their 8-fold symmetry implies a regular octagon of lattice points around the collection point. But this is impossible, because the new octagon is about 80% {{as large as the}} original. The significance of the shrinking is that it is unlimited. The same construction can be repeated with the new octagon, and again and again until the distance between lattice points is as small as we like; thus no discrete lattice can have 8-fold symmetry. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> applies to any k-fold rotation, for k greater than 6.|$|E
25|$|Tacitus, and {{the theory}} which Bruni based on him, played {{a vital role in}} the {{spirited}} debate between the republicans of Florence and the proponents of monarchy and aristocracy elsewhere. Guarino da Verona, in 1435, used the literary flowering of Augustus's erawhich included Livy, Horace, Virgil, and Senecato argue against Bruni's contention; Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini countered with the argument that all the authors had been born during the waning years of the Roman Republic. Pier Candido Decembrio, a Milanese courtier, addressed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> to Bruni in the following year, which Bruni did not bother to rebut, the best counterargument having been made already. The rule of Cosimo de Medici, however, saw the end of these political readings of Tacitus, though his works were now readily available in the public library of Florence. Instead, scholars such as Leone Battista Alberti and Flavio Biondo used him in academic works on the history and architecture of 1st century Rome. His laconic style and bleak outlook remained unpopular.|$|E

25|$|While at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz {{represented}} Pfizer in {{a lawsuit}} brought {{by a group of}} public hospitals and community health centers who accused the drug manufacturer of overcharging. The Supreme Court eventually threw the case out. Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award. Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award. Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case. Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired thirty days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won on a second appeal using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leaving aside any {{question}} as {{to the reality of}} supernatural events as such, the primary doubts about the historicity of Juan Diego (and the Guadalupe event itself) arise from the silence of those major sources who would be expected to have mentioned him, including, in particular, Bishop Juan de Zumárraga and the earliest ecclesiastical historians who reported the spread of the Catholic faith among the Indians in the early decades after the capture of Tenochtítlan in 1521. Despite references in near-contemporary sources which do attest a mid-16th-century Marian cult attached to a miraculous image of the Virgin at a shrine at Tepeyac under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and despite the weight of oral tradition concerning Juan Diego and the apparitions (which, at the most, spans less than four generations before being reduced to writing), the fundamental objection of this silence of core 16th-century sources remains a perplexing feature {{of the history of the}} cult which has, nevertheless, continued to grow outside Mexico and the Americas. The first writer to address this problem of the silence of the sources was Francisco de Florencia in chapter 12 of his book Estrella de el norte de Mexico (see previous section). However, it was not until 1794 that the argument from silence was presented to the public in detail by someone – Juan Bautista Muñoz – who clearly did not believe in the historicity of Juan Diego or of the apparitions. Substantially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>argument</b> was publicized in updated form at the end of the 19th and 20th centuries in reaction to renewed steps taken by the ecclesiastical authorities to defend and promote the cult through the coronation of the Virgin in 1895 and the beatification of Juan Diego in 1990.|$|E
