5000|$|Squalamine ( [...] ) is an aminosterol {{compound}} with potent {{broad spectrum}} antimicrobial activity {{discovered in the}} tissues of the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) by {{a team led by}} Michael Zasloff. [...] Zasloff searched the tissues of the dogfish for compounds that might help explain the hardiness of this animal to infection, despite its [...] "primitive" [...] immune system. Using techniques that Zasloff's team had developed to isolate and identify antimicrobial peptides from animal tissues, the team extracted and characterized a novel bile acid-like compound containing a polyamine never before seen in nature. The compound was called [...] "squalamine", based on its source (Squalus acanthias) and its chemical structure (a sterol linked to a polyamine). Further analyses of larger quantities of dogfish liver extracts revealed squalamine to be the most abundant member of a larger aminosterol family comprising at least 12 related compounds. One of these, [...] "MSI-1436" [...] or <b>trodusquemine,</b> although structurally similar to squalamine (it carries a spermine rather than a spermidine) and also quite potent as an anti-infective, exhibits a profoundly different pharmacology in vertebrates, causing weight loss and adipose tissue mobilization.|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 3, 20 -Amino- and polyaminosteroid analogues of squalamine and <b>trodusquemine</b> were synthesized {{involving a}} stereoselective titanium reductive amination reaction in high chemical yields in numerous cases. These derivatives were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial properties against references and clinical bacterial strains exhibiting minimum inhibitory concentrations of 2. 5 - 40 mu g/mL. The {{mechanism of action}} of these derivatives was determined using bioluminescence for ATP efflux measurements and fluorescence methods for membrane depolarization assays...|$|E
40|$|The protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase PTP 1 B is {{a negative}} regulator of insulin and leptin signaling, and a highly validated therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity. Conventional approaches to drug development have produced potent and specific PTP 1 B inhibitors, but these inhibitors lack oral bioavailability, which limits their potential for drug development. Here we report that DPM- 1001, an analogue of the specific PTP 1 B inhibitor <b>trodusquemine</b> (MSI- 1436), is a potent, specific and orally bioavailable inhibitor of PTP 1 B. DPM- 1001 also chelates copper, which enhanced its potency as a PTP 1 B inhibitor. DPM- 1001 displayed anti-diabetic properties that were associated with enhanced signaling through insulin and leptin receptors in animal models of diet-induced obesity. Therefore, DPM- 1001 represents a proof of concept for {{a new approach to}} therapeutic intervention in diabetes and obesity. Although the PTPs have been considered undruggable, {{the findings of this study}} suggest that allosteric PTP inhibitors may help reinvigorate drug development efforts that focus on this important family of signal transducing enzymes...|$|E

One corollary challenge becomes identifying these activity-dependent regulatory proteins and the underlying mechanisms associated with neuronal functions. By using biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches in combination with genetic and pharmacological manipulation, I report that LIM domain only 4 (LMO 4) is a key regulator of calcium induced calcium release (CICR) and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) in the hippocampus and amygdala, respectively. Neuronal ablation of LMO 4 in the glutamatergic neurons (LMO 4 KO) was associated with reduced promoter activity, mRNA, and protein expression of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR 2), suggesting the involvement of LMO 4 in the transcriptional regulation. CICR function in LMO 4 KO mice was severely compromised, reflected by inefficient CICR-mediated electrophysiological responses including afterhyperpolarization, calcium rise from internal stores and glutamate release probability. These changes were accompanied with impaired hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) and hippocampal-dependent spatial learning ability. LMO 4 was also shown to exert a cytoplasmic regulation as an endogenous inhibitor for PTP 1 B that accounts for tyrosine dephosphorylation of mGluR 5 in the amygdala. LMO 4 KO mice had elevated PTP 1 B activity and decreased mGluR endocannabinoid signaling, resulting in a profound anxiety phenotype. The potential clinical value of PTP 1 B/LMO 4 is promising, given that intra-amygdala injection of the PTP 1 B inhibitor <b>Trodusquemine</b> or a PTP 1 B shRNA alleviated anxiety by restoring eCB signal in LMO 4 KO mice. Thus this study identified PTP 1 B as a potential therapeutic target for anxiety, besides the previous findings of its association with obesity and diabetes. Moreover, this PTP 1 B-mediated anxiety may be a general mechanism during chronic stress. Collectively, these findings identify that LMO 4 plays an essential role for non-genomic and genomic regulation in central neurons, providing a mechanism for LMO 4 to modulate a wide range of neuronal functions and behavior...|$|E
