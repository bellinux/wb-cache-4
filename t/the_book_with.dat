5|$|Author Graham Hancock, in {{his book}} Fingerprints of the Gods, {{interpreted}} Coe's remarks in Breaking the Maya Code as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm. Filmmaker Roland Emmerich later credited <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> inspiring his 2009 disaster film 2012.|$|E
5|$|The show's monologues are sourced {{largely from}} Beckerman's book. The Ephrons wove {{together}} {{a collection of}} stories adapted from <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> recollections of friends, including Rosie O'Donnell. One of the monologues that became a highlight of the original production was based on Nora Ephron's 2006 best-seller I Feel Bad About My Neck.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{textbook}} {{was at once}} well received, being admired both by zoologists and naturalists {{and among}} allied soldiers. Many officers carried a copy of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> them in the field. Since the war it has {{formed the basis for}} experimental investigation of camouflage, while its breadth of coverage and accuracy have ensured that it remains frequently cited in scientific papers.|$|E

5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} the surreal scenery and strange {{human and animal}} characters of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the novel}} draws from Fleming's {{personal}} experiences: the opening of <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>with</b> Bond's arrival at New York's Idlewild Airport was inspired by Fleming's own journeys in 1941 and 1953, and the warehouse at which Leiter is attacked by a shark {{was based on a}} similar building Fleming and his wife had visited in St. Petersburg, Florida on their recent journey. He also used his experiences on his two journeys on the Silver Meteor as background for the route taken by Bond and Solitaire.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 2014, Perry {{released}} his autobiography Rocks: My Life in and Out of Aerosmith, co-written by David Ritz. Perry promoted <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> a book-signing tour {{that took him}} to 14 locations across the United States {{in the month of}} October. On February 26, 2015, Aerosmith premiered the film Aerosmith Rocks Donington in 300 movie theaters across North America; the concert video is from the band's 2014 performance at Download Festival at Donington Park in Leicestershire, England. The video was released on DVD/Blu-ray on September 4, 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The {{feature film}} {{adaptation}} of <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> also entitled Souvenir of Canada, is a humorous and candid portrait of Coupland who is filmed while creating his art installation [...] "Canada House". The film {{has a much}} larger biographical focus than <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> <b>with</b> interviews with both Coupland’s parents, family, and friends. The film also addresses the most revealing and touching biographical moments from <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> <b>with</b> actors playing <b>the</b> part of Coupland as a youth and his father as a youth.|$|R
50|$|The series, {{consisting}} of 45 books, {{was published in}} the 1990s. There were spin off products, like board games, and special edition books about fun things to do when bored, and a <b>book</b> filled <b>with</b> advice from Allison. Each book featured an introduction to each girl on the first page, a phone conversation between two or more girls, a poll on the readers opinions about <b>the</b> <b>books,</b> and <b>the</b> earlier ones featured all <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>with</b> a quick summary.

5|$|Rasmussen {{considered}} in a 2005 paper whether the revised taxonomy of <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>with</b> its many species splits, had significant conservation implications, but {{felt that the}} effect on species richness in South Asia was limited, and would have only a moderate conservation impact, {{increasing the number of}} potentially threatened species in the region from 6% of the total avifauna to about 7%.|$|E
5|$|Sanderson was {{originally}} working to {{a target of}} 200,000 words, later 250,000 words and by April 2008 up to 400,000 words. By the end of October 2008 the 400,000 estimate was still in effect. Sanderson later estimated the final length of A Memory of Light {{to be at least}} 750,000 words. Information emerged on the Internet pertaining to <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>with</b> a draft cover suggesting it was to be split into volumes. On March 30, 2009, Tor Books confirmed A Memory of Light was to be split into three volumes, the first of which, The Gathering Storm, would be released on November 3, 2009. This date was later changed to October 27, 2009, a week earlier than planned.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle {{outlined}} the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman {{used in his}} study of schizophrenia. He co-wrote <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting, taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia, and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range.|$|E
25|$|The Enquiry into Plants was {{originally}} ten books, of which nine survive. The work is arranged {{into a system}} whereby plants are classified according to their modes of generation, their localities, their sizes, and according to their practical uses such as foods, juices, herbs, etc. <b>The</b> first <b>book</b> deals <b>with</b> <b>the</b> parts of plants; <b>the</b> second <b>book</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reproduction of plants and the times and manner of sowing; the third, fourth, and fifth books are devoted to trees, their types, their locations, and their practical applications; <b>the</b> sixth <b>book</b> deals <b>with</b> shrubs and spiny plants; <b>the</b> seventh <b>book</b> deals <b>with</b> herbs; <b>the</b> eighth <b>book</b> deals <b>with</b> plants that produce edible seeds; and <b>the</b> ninth <b>book</b> deals <b>with</b> plants that produce useful juices, gums, resins, etc.|$|R

5|$|She {{had enjoyed}} {{developing}} <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> Warne, and, on July 2, sent him {{the remainder of}} the book, expressing her regret that its production was over. On July 25, proofs sent to her from the publisher showed spottiness that may have been caused by the summer heat affecting the chemicals used in the engraving process; the plates were re-engraved in September.|$|E
5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> practical animal-related issues.|$|E
5|$|The book {{expanded}} {{steadily in}} length, until by 1907 it reached 74 chapters and over 2000 pages. Nearly two million copies were sold by 1868, {{and it remains}} in print (as of 2016). Between 1875 and 1914 {{it was probably the}} most often consulted cookery book. Mrs Beeton has been compared on the strength of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> modern domestic goddesses like Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith.|$|E

5|$|The white {{supremacist}} scientist Robert Wilson Shufeldt reviewed Animal Coloration in Science in 1892, praising it as a concise and useful {{summary of the}} subject. He admires Macmillan Publishers' handling of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. He quotes Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a few new ideas. He recommends the book to all working American naturalists.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's golf partner, John Blackwell, (a {{cousin to}} Blanche Blackwell) {{was also a}} cousin by {{marriage}} to Ernő Goldfinger and disliked him: it was Blackwell who reminded Fleming of the name. Fleming also disliked what Goldfinger was doing destroying Victorian buildings, replacing them with the architect's modernist designs, particularly a terrace at Goldfinger's own residence at 2 Willow Road. Goldfinger threatened to sue Fleming {{over the use of}} the name and, in retaliation, Fleming threatened to add an erratum slip to the book changing the name from Goldfinger to Goldprick and explaining why; the matter was settled out of court after the publishers, Jonathan Cape, agreed to ensure the name Auric was always used in conjunction with Goldfinger. Fleming's golfing friend John Blackwell then became the heroin smuggler at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>with</b> a sister who was a heroin addict.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>with</b> one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Rowling and MEP Emma Nicholson {{founded the}} Children's High Level Group (now Lumos). In January 2006, Rowling went to Bucharest to {{highlight}} the use of caged beds in mental institutions for children. To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for £1.95million by on-line bookseller Amazon.com on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction. Rowling gave away the remaining six copies {{to those who have}} a close connection with the Harry Potter books. In 2008, Rowling agreed to publish <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> the proceeds going to Lumos. On 1 June 2010 (International Children's Day), Lumos launched an annual initiative – Light a Birthday Candle for Lumos. In November 2013, Rowling handed over all earnings from the sale of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, totalling nearly £19 million.|$|E
5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable to do anything but read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Since its publication, {{some have}} viewed <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>with</b> skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages {{regarded}} the book {{simply as a}} romance or fable, due largely to the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as 'barbarians' who appeared to belong to 'some other world'. Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention the Great Wall of China, {{and in particular the}} difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority however have since been identified). Many have questioned if he had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, if he had appropriated the accounts of his father and uncle or other travelers, and some doubted if he even reached China, or that if he did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).|$|E
