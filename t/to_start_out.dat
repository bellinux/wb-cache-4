5|$|Despite his eagerness <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> again, Amundsen {{waited until}} mid-October {{and the first}} hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E
5|$|The Griffin {{family first}} {{appeared}} on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998. Family Guy was originally planned <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought {{that that was the}} place to create a prime-time animation show. Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful. Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.|$|E

25|$|Sheep were {{introduced}} to the area in 1894, of which the Métis tended small herds. Growth, however, was slow for ranchers. Limited markets and a lack of transportation infrastructure in southwestern Saskatchewan forced ranchers <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> small. Bonneau, Sr. and his three sons began ranching in 1886 with only four horses and four cattle, but by 1900, Bonneau, Sr. had a herd of 400 head of cattle and 400 head of horses. After opening a cheese factory in 1888, Jean-Louis Légaré maintained the largest ranching operation in the area for a time. The ranching operation of Bonneau, Sr.'s son, Pascal Bonneau, Jr., became even bigger. By 1900 Bonneau, Jr. had a herd of 5,000 to 6,000 head.|$|E
25|$|He argued infants were {{engaging}} {{in an act}} of assimilation when they sucked on everything in their reach. He claimed infants transform all objects into an object to be sucked. The children were assimilating the objects to conform to their own mental structures. Piaget then made the assumption that whenever one transforms the world to meet individual needs or conceptions, one is, in a way, assimilating it. Piaget also observed his children not only assimilating objects to fit their needs, but also modifying some of their mental structures {{to meet the demands of}} the environment. This is the second division of adaptation known as accommodation. <b>To</b> <b>start</b> <b>out,</b> the infants only engaged in primarily reflex actions such as sucking, but not long after, they would pick up objects and put them in their mouths. When they do this, they modify their reflex response to accommodate the external objects into reflex actions. Because the two are often in conflict, they provide the impetus for intellectual development. The constant need to balance the two triggers intellectual growth.|$|E

According to Baker, she had been offered numerous leading parts in feature films before that point, but chose to debut in a supporting role in Giant because she was [...] "insecure" [...] and [...] "wanted <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> a little less 'profile. Giant was largely filmed {{in the small town}} of Marfa, Texas, in 1955; Baker recalled her experience on set, saying that [...] James Dean and she were both enamored of Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor while filming.|$|E

[...] The following year, the band released an EP titled 1.22.03.Acoustic (2004), which features [...] "Harder to Breathe" [...] in an acoustic version. In 2005, Maroon 5 released a live album, Live – Friday the 13th, which features the song performed live.|$|E
500|$|Pre-release {{reviews of}} the miniseries were largely {{positive}}. Zack Smith of Newsarama gave the miniseries a largely positive review and called it [...] "fan service writ large, one that will prove immensely satisfying for long-term fans of the series". He applauded the way the string of episodes managed <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> with self-contained stories and move into a dense and emotional backstory. Tonally, Smith described the miniseries as possessing [...] "the feel of an old-school post-apocalyptic SF sagaa journey through a devastated-but-wondrous world, {{with a sense of}} danger and mystery detached from the Land of Ooo." [...] Smith's only complaint was that [...] "there's enough rich emotional material once the voyagers reach their destination that it feels like more time could be spent there". Matthew Jacobson of The Spectrum wrote that [...] "the story is masterful and imaginative" [...] and that [...] "if Islands is a litmus test, then the final season should be one heck of an adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|Two more relief {{parties were}} mustered to {{evacuate}} any adults who {{might still be}} alive. [...] Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month since the third relief had left Truckee Lake, the alcalde near Sutter's Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners' belongings. [...] The belongings would be sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On {{their way back to}} Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said that he put a blanket around her and told her <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> in the morning, but she died during the night.|$|E

500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, {{but we wanted to}} make sure that when it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
500|$|In April 1859, sledge parties set {{out from}} Fox to search on King William Island. On 5 May, the party led by Royal Navy Lieutenant William Hobson found a {{document}} in a cairn left by Crozier and Fitzjames. It contained two messages. The first, dated 28 May 1847, said that Erebus and Terror had wintered in the ice off the northwest coast of King William Island and had wintered earlier at Beechey Island after circumnavigating Cornwallis Island. [...] "Sir John Franklin commanding the Expedition. All well," [...] the message said. The second message, written {{in the margins of}} that same sheet of paper, was much more ominous. Dated 25 April 1848, it reported that Erebus and Terror had been trapped in the ice {{for a year and a}} half and that the crew had abandoned the ships on 22 April. Twenty-fourofficers and crew had died, including Franklin on 11 June 1847, just two weeks after the date of the first note. Crozier was commanding the expedition, and the 105survivors planned <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> the next day, heading south towards the Back River. This note contains significant errors; most notably, the date of the expedition's winter camp at Beechey Island is incorrectly given as 1846–47 rather than 1845–46.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to {{his newly}} formed label. Early into the album production, {{in a meeting}} where Borchetta and Swift {{discussed}} potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, [...] "That's your first single." [...] She responded, [...] "Well. That's how that works then." [...] Prior to that event, Swift {{did not believe that}} the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song [...] "is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. I {{think one of the most}} powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> on, because a lot of people can relate to wanting something you can't have." [...] When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was [...] "cool" [...] and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.|$|E

500|$|Steven Moffat {{contacted}} Chris Chibnall, {{asking him}} to return to writing for Doctor Who. Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode [...] "42" [...] as well as episodes of the spin-off series Torchwood. Moffat and executive producer Piers Wenger gave him the brief of Silurians, a drill, and that it was a two-parter. The Silurians were villains who had previously appeared in the 1970 serial Doctor Who and the Silurians and the 1984 serial Warriors of the Deep. For research, Chibnall read the original novel Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters and watched the original serial, noting the freedom writer Malcolm Hulke took with the novel in things he could not have done in the television format. Chibnall wanted there to be a large Silurian city in contrast to the small human village on the surface. Knowing that the Silurians were not as popular and recurring as other villains, Moffat instructed Chibnall to bring the creatures to a new audience, and Chibnall decided <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> with knowing nothing about them and then introducing them in [...] "the most exciting and scary way possible for people who've never seen them before". Chibnall also considered bringing back the Silurians' amphibious cousins the Sea Devils, but decided that doing two races of monster was much tougher and the story was [...] "so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want".|$|E
500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times opined, [...] "Those cues also hold out {{the promise that}} the coming season will once again pivot {{the story on the}} workplace. It’s where Mad Men started and where it was best. A fresh start at the rat race is just what the series needs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Goldman felt that it start of the season on a strong note, writing, [...] "It's a clever beat <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>out</b> with, leading into a strong premiere that quickly drops us into what can be described as Mad Men 2.0." [...] Praise was also directed to the musical selection of the episode, which Goldman described as excellent. In concurrence, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade, praising the character development of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. Expressing that she had more confidence, Phipps said of Peggy: [...] " [...] the person who's changed most notably over the last year. She drinks at work like the boys and [...] goes into a Don-like trance as she searches for inspiration. She bosses Joey around and tells him when he’s gone too far. And she’s not afraid to get creative to sell ham and wants credit for her idea, even if it encounters a minor disaster along the way. Most significantly, she’s standing up to Don at every turn now. He bullies her in front of her fiancé but hears about it later. And she provides a devastating mixture of admiration and chiding when she reminds Don that everyone at SCDP is there because of him and out of a desire to make him happy." [...] Similarly, James Poniewozik of Time praised the performance of Elisabeth Moss, exclaiming that [...] "she has come a long way." ...|$|E
