50|$|The {{cartridge}} can {{filter out}} anything {{down to about}} 5 to 10 micrometres in size. In most areas cartridge filters are less expensive than diatomaceous earth filters but cost more than sand filters. However cartridge filters are more popular because of the minimal maintenance involved. In some cases it may be sufficient <b>to</b> simply <b>hose</b> <b>off</b> the cartridge filter a few times during swimming season to keep them working properly. Others may need to soak the filters in detergent or replace them. In any case, maintenance takes {{only a few minutes}} to the filtration system operational.|$|R
50|$|Hose clamps are {{typically}} limited to moderate pressures, {{such as those}} found in automotive and home applications. At high pressures, especially with large hose sizes, the clamp {{would have to be}} unwieldy to be able to withstand the forces expanding it without allowing the <b>hose</b> <b>to</b> slide <b>off</b> the barb or a leak to form. For these high pressure applications, compression fittings, thick crimp fittings, or other designs are normally used.|$|R
50|$|Nozzles are {{attached}} to the pump via flexible <b>hoses,</b> allowing them <b>to</b> be placed into the vehicle's filling inlet. The <b>hoses</b> are robust <b>to</b> survive heavy wear and tear, including exposure to weather and being driven over, and are often attached using heavy spring or coil arrangements to provide additional strength. A breakaway valve is also fitted <b>to</b> the <b>hose</b> <b>to</b> allow the nozzle and <b>hose</b> <b>to</b> break <b>off</b> and fuel flow to be stopped in the case a vehicle drives off with the nozzle still in the filler, although this is largely prevented today by the point-of-sale systems not allowing payment for fuel until the nozzle is returned to its petrol pump holder.|$|R
2500|$|The Tompkins Square Dog Run was {{the first}} dog run in New York City. [...] It opened in 1990 {{as part of a}} {{large-scale}} renovation of the dilapidated park. [...] It recently underwent a $450,000 renovation, much of which was funded by the New York City government and fund-raising by dog run patrons. [...] It now includes a surface of crushed stone , three swimming pools, a tree deck, and bath areas and <b>hoses</b> <b>to</b> spray <b>off</b> one's pet.|$|R
50|$|The Children's Crusade was a march by {{hundreds}} of school students in Birmingham, Alabama, May 2-5, 1963, during the Civil Rights Movement's Birmingham campaign. Initiated and organized by Rev. James Bevel, {{the purpose of the}} march was to walk downtown to talk to the mayor about segregation in their city. Many children left their schools and were arrested, set free, and then arrested again the next day. The marches were stopped by the head of police, Bull Connor, who brought fire <b>hoses</b> <b>to</b> ward <b>off</b> the children, and set police dogs after the children. This event compelled President John F. Kennedy to publicly support federal civil rights legislation, and eventually led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.|$|R
5000|$|A {{post-mortem}} {{was conducted}} on Hatab. It determined that he died from a broken hyoid bone, a very small bone, near the larynx. [...] Hernandez had been ordered to haul Hatab by his neck, when he dragged him to where he could be <b>hosed</b> <b>off.</b> General James Mattis dropped all charges against Hernandez.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} process resembles {{the process for}} applying paint. To ensure adhesion, the surface to be rendered is initially <b>hosed</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> ensure it is free of any dirt and loose particles. Old paint or old render is scraped away. The surface is roughened to improve adhesion. For large areas, vertical battens are fixed to the wall every 1 to 1.5 meters, to keep the render flat and even.|$|R
50|$|On May 26, 2009, at 11:07 am, about 14 tons {{of ammonia}} leaked from a bulk tank {{carrying}} about 15 tons. The ammonia was being {{transferred from the}} bulk tank to a smaller tank on a truck; however, a hose from the truck caught a valve from the tank and pulled several <b>hoses</b> <b>off</b> it, resulting in the spill. Ammonia, which is used as fertilizer, is poisonous and flammable.|$|R
50|$|Major Clarke Paulus ordered Corporal Christian Hernandez to haul Hatab over {{to where}} he could be <b>hosed</b> <b>off.</b> He was then to strip Hatab naked, burn his clothes, and tie him to a stake, and leave him outside, so he wouldn't foul the clothes of other prisoners. Hatab was left naked out in the desert, limp and {{incapacitated}} in the blazing sun. At midnight it was noticed Hatab was dead.|$|R

50|$|Field Trip Fiasco {{is about}} Zoey {{and her friends}} taking {{a field trip to}} a park. The player {{controls}} Zoey by using the D-pad or touch screen to walk or run. The player runs around Pacific Coast Academy completing fetch quests. They involve delivering things to people or collecting objects scattered around the school before time runs out. After finishing a fetch quest, the player plays a mini-game involving <b>hosing</b> <b>off</b> cars or picking up Frisbees. Zoey researches around the national park, talks to the camping club about Native Americans, goes to the library to learn about the park and takes a quiz about a national park.|$|R
50|$|Horses can be bathed {{by being}} wet {{down with a}} garden hose or by being sponged off with water from a bucket. Horses do not require bathing and many horses live their entire lives without a bath. However, horses are often <b>hosed</b> <b>off</b> with water after a heavy workout {{as part of the}} cooling down process, and are often given baths prior to a horse show to remove every {{possible}} speck of dirt. They must be trained to accept bathing, as a hose and running water are unfamiliar objects and initially may frighten a horse. A hose is usually used for bathing. Start near the legs, being careful <b>to</b> point the <b>hose</b> at a downward angle. When spraying the body, be sure <b>to</b> angle the <b>hose</b> so that water doesn't hit the horse in the face. Either horse or human shampoo may be safely used on a horse, if thoroughly rinsed out, and cream rinses or hair conditioners, similar to those used by humans, are often used on show horses. Too-frequent shampooing can strip the hair coat of natural oils and cause it to dry out. Though horses in heavy work, such as racehorses, may be rinsed off after their daily workout, it is generally not advisable to shampoo a horse more than once a week, even in the show season. A well-groomed, clean horse can be kept clean by wearing a horse blanket or horse sheet.|$|R
50|$|Avoid dry {{cleaning}} Olefin as many dry-cleaning solvents can swell the fibers. Since Olefin dries quickly, line drying and low tumble drying {{with little or}} no heat is the recommended method of drying. Since Olefin is not absorbent, waterborne stains do not present a problem. However, oily stains are difficult to remove. Most such stains can be removed with lukewarm water and detergent, but bleach can also be used. Olefin fiber has a low melting point (around 225 to 335 °F, depending on the polymer's grade) so items should be ironed at a very low temperature, if at all. Items such as outdoor carpets and other fabrics can be <b>hosed</b> <b>off.</b> Olefin is easy to recycle.|$|R
5000|$|Rawicz was {{transferred}} to an immense fortress prison in Kharkov, Ukraine, where he became the personal project of a huge, muscular - and inventively sadistic - NKVD major known as [...] "The Bull." [...] "He ran his interrogation sessions like an eminent surgeon, always showing off his skill before a changing crowd of junior officers," [...] reflected Rawicz. [...] "His methods were despicably ingenious."One of The Bull's preferred methods of breaking his subjects' will was to insert them in a kishka. No provision was made for the inmates' bodily functions and the kishkas were never cleaned. Each day, Rawicz would be hauled out of his tiny cell, <b>hosed</b> <b>off,</b> and sent <b>to</b> The Bull for interrogation and torture.|$|R
5000|$|Years later, Washbrook {{recalled}} {{that he had}} addressed Gene Evans as [...] "Dad" [...] even off the set to make the screen role seem more authentic. He recalled the camaraderie of the cast and production staff. Washbrook said that he visited other sets and found none as friendly as that of My Friend Flicka. Washbrook remembered Evans having once sprayed the staff with a water hose {{on a hot day}} to ease tensions. He kept the <b>hose</b> <b>off</b> the actors, however, because of their makeup. Washbrook said that the series ended so quickly because Anita Louise, wife of 20th Century Fox executive Buddy Adler, decided to quit. The decision was made to halt the series rather than continue with the adjustments which would have been required without Louise in the cast.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantages}} are its flexibility, low heat production, {{and ability to}} machine hard and brittle materials. Its flexibility owes from its ability <b>to</b> use <b>hoses</b> <b>to</b> transport the gas and abrasive to {{any part of the}} workpiece.|$|R
5000|$|A {{gladhand}} connector or gladhand coupler is an interlocking <b>hose</b> coupling fitted <b>to</b> <b>hoses</b> supplying {{pressurized air}} from a tractor unit to air brakes on a semi-trailer, {{or from a}} locomotive to railway air brakes on railroad cars. Gladhand connectors resemble a pair of [...] "hands shaking" [...] when interlocked, hence the name.|$|R

50|$|Laboratory glassware, such as Buchner flasks and Liebig condensers, {{may have}} tubular glass tips serving as hose {{connectors}} with several ridged hose barbs around the diameter near the tip. This is {{so that the}} tips can have {{the end of a}} rubber or plastic tube mounted over them to connect the glassware to another system such as a vacuum, water supply, or drain. A special clip may be placed over the end of the flexible tube surrounding the connector tip <b>to</b> prevent the <b>hose</b> from slipping <b>off</b> the connector.|$|R
50|$|A train departing Durango {{generally}} {{takes about}} one hour between the crew arriving {{and the train}} departing. Brakemen inspect the train for cleanliness and required tools for the day, including a flagging kit and marker lamps for {{the rear of the}} train. The conductor will sign in his crew and obtain passenger lists and track reports to deliver to his crew. The engineer and fireman will inspect the locomotive and prepare it for the day's trip, making sure all machinery is lubricated and in proper condition, and no last minute repairs are needed. The fireman will ensure proper coal and water is in the tender, and make sure lubricating oil is on supply and that automatic lubrication is working properly; he will also clean the cab and <b>hose</b> <b>off</b> the engine and tender of ash and dust.|$|R
50|$|Booth {{initially}} did {{not attempt}} to sell his machine, but rather sold cleaning services. The vans of the British Vacuum Cleaner Company (BVCC) were bright red; uniformed operators would haul <b>hose</b> <b>off</b> the van and route it through the windows of a building to reach all the rooms inside. Booth was harassed by complaints about the noise of his vacuum machines and was even fined for frightening horses. Gaining the royal seal of approval, Booth's motorized vacuum cleaner was used to clean the carpets of Westminster Abbey prior to Edward VII's coronation in 1901. The device was used by the Royal Navy to improve the level of sanitation in the naval barracks. It was also used in businesses such as theatres and shops, although the device was too large to be feasibly used as a domestic appliance.|$|R

50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects {{flexible}} <b>hose</b> or tubing <b>to</b> pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which {{mates with}} female threads. The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube—a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a flexible hose. An adjustable worm drive screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, <b>to</b> keep the <b>hose</b> from slipping <b>off</b> the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|R
