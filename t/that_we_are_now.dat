25|$|The {{discovery}} of CMB is landmark {{evidence of the}} Big Bang origin of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons, these newly conceived atoms could not absorb the thermal radiation, and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the recombination epoch, and the event shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space rather than constantly being scattered by electrons and protons in plasma {{is referred to as}} photon decoupling. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck's relation). This {{is the source of the}} alternative term relic radiation. The surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.|$|E

2500|$|The then Minister for Justice, Frances Fitzgerald, {{stated that}} [...] "the {{discovery}} is an infinitely sad reminder of an Ireland {{that was a}} very harsh, harsh place for women and their babies" [...] and that [...] "it shows the tortured relationship the State and church had with pregnant women - it is a tragedy <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> facing in its entirety." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to PolitiFact, {{private health}} {{insurance}} companies already ration healthcare by income, by denying health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions and by caps on health insurance payments. Rationing exists now, {{and will continue to}} exist with or without healthcare reform. David Leonhardt also wrote in the New York Times in June 2009 that rationing is a part of economic reality: [...] "The choice isn’t between rationing and not rationing. It’s between rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to healthcare than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it’s hard to argue <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> rationing very rationally." ...|$|E

5000|$|Nocera's {{contention}} notwithstanding, {{at least}} one executive at Fannie Mae had an entirely different viewpoint, stating in an interview: Everybody understood <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> buying loans <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would have previously rejected, and that the models <b>were</b> telling us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> charging way too little, but our mandate was to stay relevant and to serve low-income borrowers.

2500|$|In October 2010, Merkel told {{a meeting}} of younger members of her {{conservative}} Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at Potsdam that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had [...] "utterly failed", stating that: [...] "The concept <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> living side by side and are happy about it" [...] does not work and [...] "we feel attached to the Christian concept of mankind, that is what defines us. Anyone who doesn't accept {{that is in the}} wrong place here." [...] She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values. This has added to a growing debate within Germany on the levels of immigration, its effect on Germany {{and the degree to which}} Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society.|$|E
2500|$|Lange's {{government}} was re-elected at the August 1987 general election, {{the first time}} a Labour government had won a second term since 1938. The government increased its share of the popular vote, although this may have been due to less vote splitting. Lange toured the country throughout the campaign and faced, for the first time, protests against his government, especially in provincial areas. Unusually, Labour did not produce a manifesto for the election, primarily due to disagreement between Douglas and Lange over the direction the government would take if re-elected. Lange sought to focus on social services in the second term, and declared in his victory speech, [...] "I'm proud <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> in the next three years, going to seal those [...] gains, in health and education and social welfare progress." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 20 April - During some {{traditional}} Easter celebrations of the Burning of Judas, some anti-government protesters burned effigies of President Maduro {{and other government}} officials saying they betrayed the Venezuelan people just as Judas Iscariot had betrayed Jesus. Protesters marched to {{the headquarters of the}} United Nations Program for Development called the [...] "Resurrection of Democracy" [...] where Maria Corina Machado explained that [...] "The whole world understands <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> fighting for democracy and giving freedom. The whole world condemns the blow given to parliament in these times when it prevents me from entering" [...] and Antonio Ledezma said that, [...] "It's not enough to pray, {{you have to go out}} and fight to achieve the resurrection of democracy. The historic alliance of workers and students is at the forefront of this struggle for a better country". Residents of Carabobo protested with banners and flags for social improvements and denounced shortages effecting them. Clashes occurred between protesters and the National Guard.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his tenure}} on the court, Voelker wrote over 100 opinions, both {{majority}} opinions and dissents. In 1958, he authored {{what was the}} originally the dissent in the case People v. Hildabridle. That case centered around a nudist colony near Battle Creek. Local police on their own initiative investigated the colony even though local residents had not lodged any complaints. One officer swore out a warrant used to arrest the colony members. Chief Justice John R. Dethmers wrote the original majority opinion to uphold the convictions of the nudists. In the dissent, Voelker proclaimed [...] "the entire search-and-arrest process 'indecent—indeed the one big indecency we find in this whole case .... It seems <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> prepared to burn down the house of constitutional safeguards in order to roast a few nudists. I will have none of it." [...] In {{an example of the}} humor used in his opinions, in noting the proclivities of the nudist, [...] "if eccentricity were a crime, then all of us were felons." [...] This dissenting opinion was so convincing that it swayed Justice George Clifton Edwards, Jr., one of those in the majority, to change sides, converting the dissent to a majority. On Voelker's request, his opinion was published unaltered, starting with the words [...] "I dissent", an anomaly in published majority opinions of the court. In 1962, political scientist S. Sidney Ulmer noted that Voelker was the second-most influential member of the court in his short tenure.|$|E
2500|$|McKenna saw the universe, in {{relation}} to Novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as [...] "the transcendental object at the end of time." [...] When describing this model of the universe he stated that: [...] "The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will roll {{down the side of the}} bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> very, very close to the attractor." [...] Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a [...] "concrescence", a [...] "tightening 'gyre'" [...] with everything flowing together. Speculating that [...] "when the laws of physics are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the monad, able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into physis as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into 'hyperspace', but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination." ...|$|E
