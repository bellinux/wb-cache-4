With {{a total of three}} levels of {{blocking}} (for the register file, for the L1 cache, and for the L2 cache), the code will minimize the required bandwidth at each level of the memory hierarchy. Unfortunately, the extra levels of blocking will incur still more loop overhead, which for some problem sizes on some hardware may be more time consuming than any shortcomings in the hardware's ability <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> <b>data</b> from the L2 cache.|$|E

Although later interfaces were able <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> <b>data</b> at the required speed, many drives now write in a 'zoned constant linear velocity'. This means that the drive has to temporarily suspend the write operation while it changes speed and then recommence it once the new speed is attained.

50|$|The {{file system}} itself is {{implemented}} {{entirely in the}} Linux userspace. The primary reason TiVo devised such a system is because they needed a way to store large continuous sections of data easily {{in a manner that}} lent itself well to streaming that data directly to the media decoders in the TiVo devices, without being CPU dependent. Thus, the CPU has very little involvement in playback and recording functionality, simply directing the encoder/decoder chips <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> <b>data</b> directly to the drives via direct memory access while mapping sections of virtual memory onto the drive. The main CPU then orchestrates the entire affair. The result of this is that data stored on the MFS media region is not formatted into normal files, as such, but is a direct data stream that is indexed by the database sections in the MFS application region.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple and {{effective}} algorithm for ray tracing iso-surfaces of time varying data sets. Each time step is partitioned into separate ranges of potentional iso-surface values. This creates {{a large number of}} relatively small files. Out-of-core rendering is implemented by reading for each time step the relevant iso-surface file, which contains its own spatial subdivision as well as the volumetric data. Since any of these data partitions is smaller than a single time step, the I/O bottleneck is overcome. Our method capitalizes on the ability of modern architectures <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> <b>data</b> off disk without interference of the operating system. Additionally, only a fraction of a time-step is held in memory at any moment during the visualization, which significantly reduces the required amount of internal memory...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Discovering {{interesting}} patterns or substructures in data streams is {{an important}} challenge in data mining. Clustering algorithms are very often applied to identify single substructures although {{they are designed to}} partition a data set. Another problem of clustering algorithms is that most of them are not designed for data streams. This paper discusses a recently introduced procedure that deals with both problems. The procedure explores ideas from cluster analysis, but was designed to identify single clusters without the necessity to partition the whole data set into clusters. The new extended version of the algorithm is an incremental clustering approach applicable <b>to</b> <b>stream</b> <b>data.</b> It identifies new clusters formed by the incoming data and updates the data space partition. Clustering of artificial and real data sets illustrates the abilities of the proposed method. 1...|$|E
