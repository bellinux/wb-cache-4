His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E
5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall. One all of the bricks change color, the player moves to the next level. Some bricks are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the wall ends the game.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, {{the tower}} was scaled by 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey {{resident}} Justin Casquejo, {{who entered the}} site <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> a fence. He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges. He allegedly dressed like a construction worker, sneaked in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower’s 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways {{to get to the}} 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted {{out of the water}} by ground personnel.|$|E

5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the dome. While Homer climbs {{to the top of the}} dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E
5|$|While {{some parts}} of the book were inventions, she also made use of real-life incidents. The opening chapter of The Danger Tree {{describes}} the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper. The incident was based on fact: Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart's eight-year-old boy was killed when he picked up a stick bomb while on a desert picnic in January 1943. Just as described in the novel, his grief-stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> his cheek. Manning had long been resentful at the Smarts' failure to include her and Reggie in their artistic circle in Cairo. However, the scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning's friends, who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning's very different Lady Hooper. Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication, Manning's publisher received a solicitor's letter written on behalf of the Smart family, objecting to the scene and requiring {{that there should be no}} further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes. Manning ignored both requests. She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor, writer and poet Stephen Haggard, whom she had known in Jerusalem. Like Pratt, Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine, but in Haggard's case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman, rather than unrequited homosexual love. After years of complaints about her publisher Heinemann, Manning moved to Weidenfeld & Nicolson, and remained with them until the end of her life. The Danger Tree was a considerable critical success, and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize, the Yorkshire Post selected it as their Best Novel of 1977. This award followed her 1976 appointment to the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Will and Cal {{attempt to}} rescue Chester {{before he is}} sent to the deeps on the 'Miner's Train', but the Styx arrive and they are forced to leave Chester behind. During the botched escape attempt, it is {{revealed}} that Rebecca, Will's adoptive sister, is actually a Styx implanted in his family to monitor him. The boys head through a series of tunnels to the Eternal City, and old stone city, estimated by Will to be from Roman times, where the air is filled with deadly bio-toxins. They avoid the Styx soldiers, who patrol the city with their vicious stalker attack dogs, and eventually emerge {{on the bank of the}} Thames. Will makes for his home in Highfield, but there Will's health deteriorates, so Cal helps him to his Auntie Jean's flat where he recovers. Soon they return underground to find Will's adoptive father, and attempt to rescue Chester once again. They encounter another Styx patrol, and Uncle Tam kills a member of the Styx, whom he calls Crawfly, but is mortally wounded in the fight, and the strong willed Uncle Tam chooses to stay behind to give the boys time to escape. With the help of Imago Freebone, a member of Uncle Tam's gang, Will and Cal escape to a small hiding place halfway between the Colony and the Eternal City. There, they rest and mourn for Uncle Tam; and are told by Imago that Chester's train to the deeps will pass directly under their hiding spot shortly. They jump down into the train <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the floor of the hiding spot, and find Chester. Together they ride down to the Deeps. In the book's epilogue, Rebecca kills Imago, who was hiding on the surface, by poison.|$|E
