50|$|The Oakeley {{quarries}} were avid {{users of}} technology, {{allowing them to}} reduce their costs and increase their production. In 1856 they began to light the quarry using piped gas. A large steam-driven cutting mill was opened around 1860. Nathaniel Mathew, the owner of Middle Quarry pioneered the use of mechanical slate dressing tools at his mill. Mathew invented a slate <b>dressing</b> <b>machine</b> that carries his name.|$|R

50|$|During this period, another {{test case}} {{had been brought}} against the company in 1879. Again, the issue {{concerned}} whether the undertaking was a mine or a quarry, but in this instance, which related to the assessment of profits, it was deemed to be a quarry. In 1882, the quarry employed over 500 men, and slates were produced in three mills, two of which were powered by water wheels and one by a steam engine. The mills contained around 50 rock saws and 50 <b>dressing</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Holgate tower {{windmill}} {{was built}} in 1770 of brickstones by its first owner and miller George Waud. He, his son and grandson ran the mill until 1851, and a dwelling-house was erected around the same time. The mill was originally fitted with five Roller Reefing sails although these were later replaced by Double Patent sails. In 1841, the mill was described as having three pairs of French Burr millstones, two <b>dressing</b> <b>machines</b> and five Patent sails. A fourth pair of stones had been added by 1858.|$|R

[...] This mill is reputed to have been sold and transferred to Epperstone. A windmill site is shown on the First Series Ordnance Survey map (...) [...]|$|R
50|$|Graig Ddu Quarry (sometimes {{known as}} Craig Ddu) (loc. SH724454) is a disused slate quarry in North Wales, {{originally}} opened as Manod Quarry in about 1800, but developed as Graig Ddu in the 1840s. Although output {{was only about}} 3000 tons a year (3140 tons in 1882), it reputedly has 36 saw tables and {{the same number of}} <b>dressing</b> <b>machines</b> on site. As with others in the area, the quarry suffered from a lack of water, resulting in the siting of the mill some distance away, at a lower level.|$|R
50|$|The tower has {{a height}} of 60 feet (18.2m) {{to the top of}} the {{brickwork}} and an overall height of 71 feet (21.6m) to the ridge of the cap. The cap is a Norfolk boat shaped type which had an 8 bladed fan and a gallery. The sails consisted of four double shuttered sails, each with 9 bays, controlled by a 9 feet (2.75m) diameter brake wheel. They powered 3 pairs of French burr stones, 2 flour mills, a cylinder and a jumper. 3 <b>dressing</b> <b>machines</b> and an oat crusher could also be also be driven.|$|R

50|$|John Bradshaw {{was born}} in 1827 in Hobart. His father was William Bradshaw who was the brother of Thomas Jillett. In 1859 he married Maria Bacon who {{was born in}} England and had arrived as a free settler with her parents Martha and Denis Bacon in 1833. It seems that before buying the mill in 1863 from his uncle Thomas Jillett, John managed it for him as he advertised for a stoker for the mill in 1854. After he bought the {{property}} he made some notable improvements. In 1870 he bought a silk <b>dressing</b> <b>machine.</b> In 1873 he installed a Boddington mill stone and a very descriptive account of this was given in the newspaper.|$|R
50|$|Great Gransden {{boasts the}} oldest post mill in England. It was {{constructed}} around 1612 {{and has two}} storeys, with a flour <b>dressing</b> <b>machine,</b> inscribed 1774, on the second floor. The mill last worked around 1890, and {{was given to the}} county council in 1950.In 1957 the post mill was classisfied as an ancient monument, following this, a restoration project was completed in 1984. The mill still possesses the internal workings and retains its sails. It is available to view internally by arrangement. A local legend tells that in 1867 a book of black magic entitled An Infidel's Bible was hidden in the mill, causing it to stop working. When the book was removed, the mill at once began to work again.|$|R
50|$|They {{arrived at}} Spangereid at Lindesnes in Norway, where they stayed {{for the night}} in the house of the peasants Áke and Grima. Áke {{believed}} the harp contained valuable items and told his wife Grima. Grima then convinced him to murder Heimer as he was sleeping. However, when they broke the harp open, they discovered a little girl, whom they raised as their own, calling her Kráka ("Crow"). In order to hide her beauty - the accepted sign of her noble origins - they rubbed her in <b>tar</b> and <b>dressed</b> her in a long hood.|$|R
50|$|Thrown silk is twisted single filament. There {{is a lot}} {{of waste}} from {{processing}} and damaged cocoons. Silk is expensive and ways were found to recover the waste. The waste was cut into fibres 25-50mm long and then these were spun like worsted or cotton using a throstle. This was 'short Silk'. Such a short thread produced a silk with an inferior lustre. In 1836 Gibson and Campbell patented a 'Long Silk' machine for spinning staples up to 250mm. Carding and combing (known as dressing) remained a problem until Lister invented the self-acting <b>dressing</b> <b>machine</b> in 1877. Spun silk is softer than thrown silk and easily blended with other fibres. Silk spinning became an important industry in Congleton: taking place in Stonehouse Green and Brooks Mill, Forge Mill and Bath Vale. Brocklehursts continued long silk spinning in Macclesfield until the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Benton invented many of {{the most}} {{important}} type founding technologies of the day, including a mould (1882), self spacing type (1883), a punch cutter (1885), combination fractions (1895), a type <b>dressing</b> <b>machine</b> (1901), a matrix and punch-cutting machine (1906), and automatic type-caster (1907), and a lining device for engraving matrices of shaded letters (1913). One of his most famous inventions was the Benton Pantograph, an engraving machine which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design. [...] (Mathematically, these are cases of affine transformation, which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including PostScript.) The technology allowed metal type to be designed on large plan drawings and then cut at the desired size, rather than being hand-engraved at the desired size.|$|R

50|$|The {{steam engine}} {{was located in}} a brick {{building}} built against the north-east side of the windmill, and drove two pairs of millstones, a centrifugal governor, and a sack hoist. The steam driven millstones were located on 2 levels and driven by a 2+1/2 in square shaft of 50 ft length, those on the upper floor being driven by a cast-iron bevel wheel with wooden cog inserts. It was also able to work various <b>dressing</b> <b>machines</b> in the windmill, but not the wind driven stones. There is some difference over the exact type of engine, it being variously described as a grasshopper engine built by Napiers, and a Cornish boiler by Davey Paxman & Co. Both sources agree that the engine had formerly been used in a Thames steamboat. The steam engine itself was removed in 1940 and taken to South West Essex Technical College in Walthamstow, while the building and remaining contents were removed in 1960 {{with two of the}} millstones remaining at the windmill entrance.|$|R

50|$|The main mill was steam powered, {{and above}} it, a single acting table incline {{was used to}} connect {{to a number of}} {{chambers}} which had been created below the original Pant Mawr workings. The levels were numbered downwards, in a continuation of the numbering scheme adopted by Moelwyn and Pant Mawr, and the mill was on level 18. The building was quite large, and housed at least three saw tables and three <b>dressing</b> <b>machines,</b> although there was room for several more. Beside the mill is a large Lancashire boiler, which was used to store water. A second mill was built near to the exit tunnel in the 1890s, and was designated as level 22. Its purpose may have been to serve lower levels, as the quarry extended down the hillside, or it may have been to process output from the Cefn-y-braich quarry. This consisted of two open terraces, which employed about 20 men between 1877 and 1883. It was subsequently absorbed into the Fron-Boeth operation, and the terraces became levels 19 and 20 in the Fron-Boeth numbering scheme.|$|R
50|$|The {{next major}} advance was in 1860, when the Great Moelwyn Slate Company Ltd. was founded and paid £9,890 {{to buy the}} quarry from Thomas Cooper Smith. Chambers were {{excavated}} underground, but as there was no reliable source of water to provide power, the mill was built at {{some distance from the}} workings, and at a lower level, so that a 40 by 4 ft waterwheel could be fed from Llyn Stwlan. This drove six sawing tables and seven <b>dressing</b> <b>machines.</b> Three barrack buildings were erected, and whereas at most quarries, these were provided for the workers, at Moelwyn they were occupied by whole families, who lived there, rather than lodged there during the working week. The children had to make an arduous treck along the cart road to Tanygrisiau to attend school. The slate quarries were known as places of learning and culture, with barracks at many quarries including reading rooms or libraries, which were regularly updated with Welsh language newspapers and magazines produced by the non-conformist denominational churches. Even in its remote location, Moelwyn was no exception, as basic literacy classes were taking place there in the 1860s when it was visited by Lord Palmerston.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Croesor Tramway, slate was carried by horse and cart to Penrhyndeudraeth station on the Ffestiniog Railway. In order to improve the journey, a long {{straight}} road, which now forms part of the A4085, was built south from Garreg by the quarry company. When the Croesor Tramway opened in 1864, a long incline was built from the quarry to the valley floor, and carriage by railway reduced transport costs from 7s 10.5d (39p) per ton to 2s 6.5d (12.5p). The mill was constructed in the early 1860s, and was powered by a 28 ft diameter water wheel which drove about 12 slate saws. In 1866, the mill was extended, to provide another 12 or 14 saws. Power came from another water wheel, constructed underground, and fed by the tailrace of the first wheel. It was 39 ft in diameter, and backup power was provided by a [...] steam engine. The shafting for the machinery was under the floor, as was a tramway for trucks to remove the cutting waste. A sale notice dating from 1874 indicated that in addition to sawing tables, there were also planing tables, slate <b>dressing</b> <b>machines,</b> two [...] steam locomotives and stables. The locomotives were 0-4-0 vertical boilered tank engines with vertical cylinders, manufactured by De Winton of Caernarfon. One of them was later sold to the Coedmadoc Slate Company of Nantlle.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to achieve the surface finish of 10 nm on a 40 mm {{diameter}} disc of chrome-molybdenum-vanadium alloyed steel (H 13) by using precision grinding process with electrolytic in-process <b>dressing.</b> The <b>machine</b> tool utilized was Tetraform-C, its unique tetrahedral frame offered higher structural stability. A cup grinding wheel with iron bonded CBN abrasive grit of 76 microns average size with 50 % concentration was used. The statistical methods were employed to determine the optimal combination of input parameters to achieve the required response. The main effect of feed rate {{was found to be}} more significant than the depth of cut and lower levels of these factors produced better surface finish. The developed regression model based on the relationships between process variables was used to predict factor levels to achieve the required process response...|$|R
