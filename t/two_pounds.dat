5|$|The gongs weigh roughly from <b>two</b> <b>pounds</b> {{to three}} pounds each, and have {{dimensions}} of 6 to 10inches for their diameters and 3 to 5inches for their height. Traditionally {{they were made}} from bronze but due to the disruption and loss of trade routes between the islands of Borneo and Mindanao during World War II, resulting in loss of access to necessary metal ores, and the subsequent post-war use of scrap metal, brass gongs with shorter decaying tones are now commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{released}} a combined, semi-portable Genesis/Sega CD unit called the Genesis CDX (marketed as the Multi-Mega in Europe). This unit retailed at $399.95 in the U.S. (roughly $100 {{more than the}} individual Genesis and Sega CD units put together, since the Sega CD dropped its price to $229 half a year before), and was bundled with Sonic CD, Sega Classics Arcade Collection, and the Sega CD version of Ecco the Dolphin. The CDX features a small LCD screen that, when the unit is used to play audio CDs, displays the current track being played. With this feature and the system's lightweight build (weighing <b>two</b> <b>pounds),</b> Sega marketed it in part as a portable CD player.|$|E

5|$|In the unreformed House of Commons to {{be either}} a {{candidate}} or an elector for a county seat, a man had to own (not rent) freehold property valued for the land tax at <b>two</b> <b>pounds</b> a year (women could neither vote nor stand for election). This {{was known as the}} 40/- freehold. The franchise for borough seats varied enormously. Originally in Peterborough the dean and chapter had claimed the franchise and held that only residents of Minster Precincts were burgesses. By the interregnum, the city was one of 37 boroughs in which suffrage was restricted to those paying scot and lot, a form of municipal taxation. In 1800 there were 2,000 registered voters in Northamptonshire and 400 in Peterborough. By 1835 this was 576, or about one per cent of the population. Bribery was general until the introduction of the secret ballot under the Ballot Act 1872. Votes were cast by spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings, erected on the Market Place (now Cathedral Square).|$|E

The ship canal has been reopened for use by pleasure craft, {{and there have been}} attempts to reopen the Newry Canal, which have not yet been successful. The towpath has become part of a long distance footpath and also part of the National Cycle Network. Some restoration has taken place, and the canal has become a haven for wildlife. Parts of it are also used for coarse fishing.|$|E

25|$|The canal is {{referred}} to as 'a vital missing link' by the Barnsley, Dearne & Dove Canals Trust.
