40|$|Abstract — Severe energy {{constraints}} {{and hence the}} low <b>power</b> communication requirements amplify {{the significance of the}} energy efficient and preferably cross-layer error control mecha-nisms in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In this paper, a cross-layer methodology for the analysis of error control schemes in WSNs is presented such that the effects of multi-hop routing and the broadcast nature of the wireless channel are investigated. More specifically, the cross-layer effects of routing, medium access and physical layers are considered. This analysis enables a comprehensive comparison of forward error correction (FEC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ) in WSNs. FEC schemes improve the error resiliency compared to ARQ. In a multi-hop network, this improvement can be exploited by reducing the <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> (<b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> control) or by constructing longer hops (hop length extension), which can b...|$|R
40|$|In Wireless Sensor Networks, sensed {{data are}} {{reported}} to the sink by the available nodes in the communication range. The sensed data should be reported to the sink with the frequency expected by the sink. In {{order to have a}} communication between source and sink, Link based routing is used. Link based routing aims to achieve an energy efficient and reliable routing path. This mechanism considers the status (current energy level in terms of Joules) of each node, link condition (number of transmissions that the Cluster Head (CH) and the Gateway (GW) candidates conducts) and the <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> (<b>power</b> required for transmission in terms of Joules). A metric called Predicted Transmission Count (PTX) for each node is calculated using its status, link condition and <b>transmit</b> <b>power.</b> The node which has highest PTX will have the highest priority and it will be the potential candidate to act as CH or GW. Thus the selection of proper CH or GW reduces the energy consumption, and the network lifetime is increased. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a multicell network where an amplify-and-forward relay is deployed in each cell {{to help the}} base station (BS) serve its cell-edge user. We assume that each relay scavenges energy from all received radio signals to process and forward the information data from the BS to the corresponding user. For this, a <b>power</b> splitter and a wireless energy harvester are implemented in the relay. Our aim is to minimize the total <b>power</b> consumption in the network while guaranteeing minimum data throughput for each user. To this end, we develop a resource management scheme that jointly optimizes three parameters, namely, BS <b>transmit</b> <b>powers,</b> <b>power</b> splitting factors for energy harvesting and information processing at the relays, and relay <b>transmit</b> <b>powers.</b> As the formulated problem is highly nonconvex, we devise a successive convex approximation algorithm based on difference-of-convex-functions (DC) programming. The proposed iterative algorithm transforms the nonconvex problem into a sequence of convex problems, {{each of which is}} solved efficiently in each iteration. We prove that this path-following algorithm converges to an optimal solution that satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the original nonconvex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization solution substantially improves the network performance...|$|R
