40|$|We {{present a}} study of the main bulk {{properties}} (susceptibility, magnetization, resistivity and specific heat) of CePt_ 3 B_(1 -x) Si-x, an alloying system that crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric lattice, and derive the magnetic phase diagram. The materials at the end point of the alloying series have previously been studied, with CePt_ 3 B established as a material with two different magnetic phases at low temperatures (antiferromagnetic below T_N = 7. 8 K, weakly ferromagnetic below T_C ~ 5 K), while CePt 3 Si is a heavy fermion superconductor (T_c = 0. 75 K) coexisting with antiferromagnetism (T_N = 2. 2 K). From our experiments we conclude that the magnetic phase diagram is divided into two regions. In the region of low Si content (up to x ~ 0. 7) the material properties resemble those <b>of</b> <b>CePt</b> 3 B. Upon increasing the Si concentration further the magnetic ground state continuously transforms into that <b>of</b> <b>CePt</b> 3 Si. In essence, we argue that CePt_ 3 B can be understood as a low pressure variant <b>of</b> <b>CePt</b> 3 Si. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} and treatment conditions of FeCl 3 - and AlCl 3 -coagulated municipal sewage sludge from chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) using anaerobic digestion (AD) {{and the structure}} of microbial community were investigated. The results based on 297 measurements under different operational conditions demonstrate good average AD performance <b>of</b> <b>CEPT</b> sludge, that is, percent volatile solid reduction of 58 %, specific biogas production (or biogas yield) of 0. 92 m 3 /kg volatile solids (VS) destroyed, and methane content of 65. 4 %. FeCl 3 dosing, organic loading rate, temperature, and hydraulic retention time all significantly affected AD performance. FeCl 3 dosing greatly improved specific methane production (methane yield) by 38 – 54 % and significantly reduced hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) content in biogas (from up to 13, 250 to < 200 ppm), contributing to higher methane recovery and simplified biogas cleaning for power generation. Metagenomic analysis suggested that anaerobic digesters <b>of</b> both <b>CEPT</b> sludge and combined primary and secondary sludge were dominated by Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Thermotogae, and Chloroflexi. However, Methanomicrobia methanogens were better enriched in the anaerobic digesters <b>of</b> <b>CEPT</b> sludge than in the combined sludge. Further, different sources <b>of</b> <b>CEPT</b> sludge with various chemical properties nurtured shared and unique microbial community composition. Combined, this study supports AD as an efficient technology for CEPT sludge treatment and poses first insights into the microbial community structure...|$|R

40|$|The surface {{termination}} <b>of</b> <b>CePt</b> 5 /Pt(111) {{is determined}} experimentally by LEED-IV. In accordance with recent theoretical predictions, a dense Pt terminated surface is being found.

This finding provides a natural explanation for the remarkable inertness <b>of</b> the <b>CePt</b> 5 intermetallic.
