25|$|These systems had {{two primary}} {{problems}} {{in terms of}} accuracy. The first {{was that there were}} several steps that had to be carried out in sequence in order to set up the bombsight correctly, and there was limited time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this during the bomb run. As a result, the accuracy of the wind measurement was always limited, and errors in setting the equipment or making the calculations were common. The second problem was that the sight was attached to the aircraft, and thus moved about during maneuvers, during which time the bombsight would not point at the target. As the aircraft had to maneuver {{in order to make the}} proper approach, this limited the time allowed to accurately make corrections. This combination of issues demanded a long bomb run.|$|E

I've missed out on what was a huge goal for me to accomplish in this short period of time, but still the desire I had previous to this, it's still there." [...] Essentially saying that his (relatively) slow times in the 100 and 200 meters were the result of too short a period to train and prepare, Thorpe announced he will continue training, setting as his (new) goal qualifying for the World Championships in 2013.|$|E

I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E

As Jack gets more and more drunk, he reveals that he still has various fantasies about his wife from grabbing one of her breasts to her getting various terminal diseases with him by her bedside. Eventually, he picks up a prostitute (Rachel Dratch), and the two interrupt Tracy and Angie's Valentine's Day at the Soho Grand Hotel. Angie, upset that their Valentine's Day is ruined, demands that Tracy get rid of Jack and the prostitute, so he calls Liz for help. Liz gets Jack and the drunk prostitute out of the hotel, and Liz tells Jack that his relationship with his wife is sick and presents him with a scenario of [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill", all with his wife, causing Jack to say that he wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the three but promises Liz that he will get over his wife, and the two leave the prostitute in the street. The next day, Jack and Bianca sign the divorce papers, and Bianca begs Jack not to sell the Arby's that he had gotten in their settlement. He promises not to do so, but will let the place shut down and become desolate. The two argue, and the sexual tension between the two escalate, until Bianca tears herself away from Jack and leaves.|$|E
500|$|Raising {{a family}} {{is not an easy}} task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back to school}} while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the shooter}} wishes to improve {{accuracy}} and precision, wishes to increase range or wishes <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these things, {{the accuracy of}} [...] "estimates" [...] of external factors must improve accordingly. At extreme ranges, extremely accurate [...] "estimates" [...] are required {{and even with the}} most accurate estimates, hitting the target becomes subject to uncontrollable factors. For example, a rifle capable of firing a 1/2 MOA (approximately 1/2" [...] center to center of the two holes furthest apart) 5-round group (often referred to as [...] "grouping") at 100 yards will fire a theoretical 12.5 group at 2500 yards. Unless the group is centered perfectly on the target at 100 yards, the 2500- yard group will be centered 25 times the off-center error at 100 yards. This example ignores all other factors and assumes [...] "perfect" [...] no-wind shooting conditions and identical muzzle velocities and ballistic performance for each shot.|$|E

[...] His stage persona {{has also been}} compared to Moon. Sound engineer Neill King, who worked with Green Day on Dookie, noted that Tré Cool shares Moon's [...] "wild animal approach" [...] to playing drums, and explained that the band encountered difficulties while recording [...] "Basket Case" [...] due to his unpredictable style: [...] "It's not that Tré wasn’t a good drummer, {{but in terms of}} his performances we wanted the best of the best...So, although we wanted him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his wild fills and crazy drumming, we couldn’t just let him go. He’d drift in and out of time, which is terrific live, but which was unacceptable on radio at that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1980, {{production}} on the pilot episode began on several fronts. [...] Rod Lord of Pearce Animation Studios directed a 50-second pilot, hand-animated, giving a 'computer graphic' feel to the Babel Fish speech {{of the first}} episode. Douglas Adams and Alan J.W. Bell were both pleased with the animation, and Lord was given the go-ahead <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the animation for Episode 1, and subsequently the complete TV series. Narration for the first episode was recorded by Peter Jones in March 1980. The filming of two green-skinned aliens reacting to Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters was done on 8 May 1980. Further filming of crowd reactions to the Vogons, location filming of Arthur's house and a scene in a pub were done between 11 and 16 May 1980. Scenes aboard the Vogon ship were recorded on 7 June 1980, in the BBC's TC1 studio. The final edit of the pilot episode was completed on 2 July 1980, and it was premiered for a test audience three days later (5 July 1980). Further test screenings were held in August 1980. Based on successful test screenings, the cast was reassembled to complete the six episodes of the series in September 1980. Production continued through the autumn, with filming and recording occurring out of order. Recording and production of the final episode continued into January 1981.|$|E
