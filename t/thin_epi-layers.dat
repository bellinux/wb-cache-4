40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} producing high-efficiency GaAs solar cells with high power-to-weight ratios by organic metallic chemical vapor deposition (OM-CVD) growth of <b>thin</b> <b>epi-layers</b> on suitable substrates. An AM 1 conversion efficiency of 18 % (14 % AM 0), or 17 % (13 % AM 0) with a 5 % grid coverage is achieved for a single-crystal GaAs n(+) /p cell grown by OM-CVD on a Ge wafer. Thin GaAs epi-layers OM-CVD grown can be fabricated with good crystallographic quality using a Si-substrate on which a thin Ge epi-interlayer is first deposited by CVD from GeH 4 and processed for improved surface morpholog...|$|E

An attractive solution to lower the cost while maintaining high efficiencies is to design multijunctions on cheaper substrates such as silicon. Different routes {{have been taken to}} cope with lattice mismatch issues between Si and III-Vs: epitaxial growth of GaAs on Si with or without buffer layers or non-epitaxial techniques such as mechanical stacking. A novel approach has been recently presented consisting in direct epitaxial growth of thin Si or SiGe layers on GaAs by low temperature PECVD, where the high crystal quality reported opens a new way for making III-V/Si tandem solar cells. Yet, due to the low deposition rate, the epi-Si layers are still rather thin (~ 10 Î¼m), and though they are assumed to be of high quality, some defects might be still present at the interface or in the bulk. These critical aspects still have to be carefully investigated to evaluate the potential benefits of this novel concept. Here, numerical simulation has definitely a role to play. Therefore, we propose to simulate these novel structures using TCAD tools and to estimate the defect density inside the <b>thin</b> <b>epi-layer</b> based on experimental inputs. Realistic efficiencies achievable by this novel concept will thus be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to produce alternative substrate technologies for GaN-based LEDs by developing an ALD interlayer of Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } on sacrificial substrates such as ZnO and Si. A sacrificial substrate is used for device growth that can easily be removed using a wet chemical etchant leaving only the <b>thin</b> GaN <b>epi-layer.</b> After substrate removal, the GaN LED chip can then be mounted in several different ways to a metal heat sink/reflector and light extraction techniques can then {{be applied to the}} chip and compared for performance. Success in this work will lead to high efficiency LED devices with a simple low cost fabrication method and high product yield as stated by DOE goals for its solid state lighting portfolio...|$|R
