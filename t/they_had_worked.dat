5|$|Caglione and Drexler were {{recommended}} for the prosthetic makeup designs by Canonero, with whom <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> on The Cotton Club (1984). The rogues gallery makeup designs were directly taken from Gould's drawings, {{with the exception}} of Al Pacino (Big Boy Caprice), who improvised his own designs, ignoring the rather overweight character of the strip. His makeup took 3.5 hours to apply.|$|E
5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> in the 1906 Tour de France. The revised points system would be kept in this form until 1911, only to be changed {{a little bit in}} 1912 before being {{replaced}} by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.|$|E

5|$|The devotion that Beatrice showed to {{her mother}} was {{acknowledged}} in the Queen's letters and journals, but her constant need for Beatrice grew stronger. The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown, died at Balmoral. Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support. Unlike her siblings, Beatrice had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other's company; indeed, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> together {{to carry out the}} Queen's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Now {{settled into}} Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers {{began looking for}} a {{suitable}} producer. One person in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded in contrast to individuals <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> with in the past even though Rubin previously turned down the band's offer to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak who would die of a heroin overdose a year later. Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone that they felt confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 1949, Oppenheimer {{testified before}} the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he {{admitted}} that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s. He testified that some of his students, including David Bohm, Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz, Philip Morrison, Bernard Peters and Joseph Weinberg, had been Communists at the time <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> with him at Berkeley. Frank Oppenheimer and his wife Jackie {{testified before the}} HUAC and admitted that they had been members of the Communist Party. Frank was subsequently fired from his University of Minnesota position. Unable to find work in physics for many years, he became instead a cattle rancher in Colorado. He later taught high school physics and was the founder of the San Francisco Exploratorium.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by KID, with direction by Takumi Nakazawa, planning and scenario writing by Kotaro Uchikoshi, character design by Yuu Takigawa, and music by Takeshi Abo. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi were appointed to their respective positions as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> on the previous game in the Infinity series, , which had been well received. As Ever 17 was to be released on consoles, it was required to be finished {{two months before the}} planned August release, meaning that after the scenario's completion in May, there was only time for debugging until late June. Uchikoshi and Nakazawa described this as a tight development schedule, and said that the game was only possible through the staff working very hard, and a lot of things being worked on at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} by Erwin Gutawa, {{who had previously}} collaborated with Chrisye on five albums. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, {{he said that he}} felt guilty as he had never written anything for Chrisye in the time <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> together; he had intended to make a new song with Chrisye's voice since soon after the latter's death. The lyrics were written by Gutawa's daughter, Gita, who was asked by her father to write as if Chrisye were singing about having died, but his songs living on. Gita, who also sang at the concert, felt she owed something to Chrisye as her first stage performance was at his 2003 Dekade concert.|$|E
5|$|This came on {{the heels}} of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, {{including}} David Bohm, Ross Lomanitz and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely associated with them. Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as a laborer. Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in Colorado. Their reputations were rehabilitated in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Invasion of the Vorticons was {{the only}} game {{developed}} by Ideas from the Deep, and was based on programmer John Carmack's creation of adaptive tile refresh, a technique that allowed IBM-compatible general-purpose computers to replicate the smooth scrolling of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game's success caused designer Tom Hall, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, and artist Adrian Carmack to found id Software. Their obligations to Softdisk, where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> during development of the game, {{led to the creation}} of Keen Dreams as a prototype for the second trilogy of episodes. The final episode was split off during development into a stand-alone retail title, and plans for a third trilogy were cancelled after the success of Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and development focus on 3D first-person shooters such as Doom (1993). The final Keen game ten years later had oversight but little development work from id.|$|E
5|$|The troupe hired {{several of}} the people <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> with on Brain Candy, {{including}} Craig Northey and director Kelly Makin. They shot the series in North Bay, along with locations in Mattawa and Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, which allowed them to access federal and provincial funding incentives for economic development in Northern Ontario. For example, the courtroom scenes were filmed in North Bay's Trinity United Church and the graveyard site was filmed on Mattawa's Explorer's Point. McKinney has claimed in interviews that the red vest worn by Death {{was found in a}} storehouse of old CBC props and costumes, and was previously worn by Bob Homme in The Friendly Giant. While drafting the script, cast member Scott Thompson was diagnosed with stage one non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He began chemotherapy sessions shortly before the August – September 2009 shooting dates and started four weeks of radiation treatment once shooting wrapped.|$|E
