Via their negative surface charges, anionic magnetic nanoparticles adsorb non-specifically to the EPC plasma membrane, thereby triggering efficient spontaneous endocytosis.

Labeled cells continue to differentiate in vitro and to form tubular structures in Matrigel (an in vitro model of neovascularization). <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> <b>followed</b> in situ by using high-resolution MRI.

40|$|Purpose: Collaboration {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} more common strategy when developing care sectors while, coincidentally, experience and research show that collaboration development may be problematic in itself. This study aims to achieve better understanding of collaboration processes. Method: A local project that aimed at {{improving the quality of}} healthcare and social care by developing the co-operation between organizations took place in Sweden, and by using participatory action research, PAR, <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> <b>followed</b> between 2004 and 2008. Material was gathered through participant observation from the perspective of patients, relatives, staff, managers and politicians. A descriptive narrative was compiled and a hermeneutic interpretation was performed. Results: Initially, the development of collaboration was impeded due to lack of communication between the participants from various levels within the organizations. With the support of PAR, communication arenas were arranged to handle social interaction as well as different perspectives and conflicts, which led to improved collaboration within the organizations as well as between the care organizations. Conclusion: Development of collaboration between organizations reflects how collaboration within one organization works. Collaboration is a social and interpersonal phenomenon, and readily available communication arenas are crucial for its development...|$|E
40|$|In this experiment, we {{explored}} {{the potential of}} secretory lysosomes of hematopoietic cells to act as vehicles for immunomodulatory protein delivery at an inflammation site. We investigated whether exogenous soluble TNF-receptor 1 (sTNFR 1) could be expressed in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells and become targeted for storage and secretion during granulopoietic differentiation. An sTNFR 1 construct with a transmembrane domain (tm) and a cytosol sorting signal (Y) taken from CD 63, was retrovirally transduced to lineage-negative murine hematopoietic bone marrow stem/progenitor cells. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> <b>followed</b> by cytokine-driven granulopoietic maturation. The sTNFR 1 -tm-Y {{was found to be}} synthesized in precursor cells and to persist in mature granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Immunofluorescence-localization studies showed a granule pattern of sTNFR 1 -tm-Y in both precursor and mature granulocytes and secretion to phagosomes after ingestion of bacteria. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed co-localization between the sTNFR 1 -tm-Y and the primary (azurophil) granule marker myeloperoxidase. Collectively, our results demonstrated granule targeting, storage, and secretion of exogenous sTNFR 1 -tm-Y constitutively expressed during normal granulopoietic differentiation. These findings support the concept of using storage organelles of circulating hematopoietic cells as vehicles for targeting sites of inflammation with immunoregulatory agents...|$|E
