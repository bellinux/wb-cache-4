40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to explore interior design students’ understanding of <b>their</b> <b>design</b> thinking, and to investigate how they view digital technology’s role in these activities. The research questions are: 1. How do interior design students conceptualize interior design as a discipline? 2. How do these students conceptualize <b>their</b> <b>design</b> process? 3. What value do students place on the “process book” 1 as a representation of <b>their</b> <b>design</b> breadth and depth in a given project? 4. How do students view computer technology’s role in <b>their</b> <b>design</b> thinking and <b>their</b> <b>design</b> products? Participants viewed interior design as {{more sensitive to the}} human condition than architecture. AutoCAD was one software package that was used both in the process and the end product, but other more common software programs (word processors, spreadsheets) were only minimally utilized. Hypermedia and databases were not mentioned by any participants as tools in <b>their</b> <b>design</b> processes...|$|R

5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Lyricist Howard Ashman first {{pitched the}} idea, and the {{screenplay}} went through three drafts before then-Disney Studios president Jeffrey Katzenberg agreed to its production. The animators based <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> {{on the work}} of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, and computers were used for both finishing the artwork and creating some animated elements. The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Tim Rice, who took over after Ashman's death.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Arthur Max led the film's design staff. His art {{team were}} tasked with deconstructing {{the art and}} visuals of Alien, and reverse-designing them for the chronologically earlier setting of Prometheus.

Giger, and designers Ron Cobb and Chris Foss, including <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> for that film which Scott had been unable to develop at the time.|$|E

5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in {{certain areas of the}} major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} skyscrapers reflected these debates: the Railway Exchange, the Peoples Gas and the Illinois Continental and Commercial Bank Buildings {{were each}} substantial, quarter-block wide palazzo cubes of common height, their facades divided into a classical tripartite design, and sporting classical columns and other features. Despite the apparent uniformity of design, individual buildings varied considerably in the detail of <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> in effort {{to express their}} particular identities, the Peoples Gas Building using texture and the Railway Exchange Building white terracotta, for example.|$|E
5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> on their own calculations.|$|E

5|$|After his {{military}} service, he founded a firm with Eldar Sharon (until 1964) and Alfred Neumann (until 1966). The physical {{and economic conditions}} in Israel at the time, allowed them to complete {{a fair number of}} works in a relatively brief period of time, which brought international attention. Their joint works include the Mediterranean Sea Club in Achzib (1960–1961), Dubiner House (1963), the Chaim Laskov Officer Training School (1963–1967) Bahad 1, the main officer training school of the Israel Defense Forces, just later the synagogue (1969–1971) at the same academy, and the Bat Yam city hall (1963–1969). <b>Their</b> <b>designs</b> shared aspects in common with the metabolist movement, borrowing metaphoric shapes from nature for use in planning morphological structures. The modularity of these works, such as the Dubiner House, provided an architectural precedent for the Habitat 67 project by Moshe Safdie.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
5|$|During the Classical and Romantic {{periods of}} music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, {{a great deal}} of musical {{instruments}} capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, {{breaking}} the previous unity of the regional designs. The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in <b>their</b> <b>designs.</b> One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that the curved surfaces of the new keeps helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes faced {{competition}} for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and Lord Gifford, two London financiers. They appointed as their agent Edward Arthur Maund, who had served with Sir Charles Warren in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885, {{towards the end of}} this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with his own eyes. He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to Lord Knutsford, the British Colonial Secretary, seeking his approval for <b>their</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) {{was hired}} for the film, having {{previously}} worked on Alien 3. ADI founders Tom Woodruff, Jr. and Alec Gillis also had {{experience working with}} Stan Winston on Aliens. ADI based <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> and modifications of the Alien creatures on the film's script, which included the creatures having pointed tails for swimming, making their head domes and chins more pointed, and establishing them to appear more vicious using techniques of camera angles and shot duration. After receiving the director's approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models.|$|E

5|$|The Admiral-class battlecruisers were {{intended}} as improved {{versions of the}} s, but were recast as battlecruisers after Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, saw no real need for more battleships. A number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to {{the bulk of the}} Grand Fleet's battlecruisers so the design was revised to counter these. The class was going to consist of , Anson, Howe, and Rodney—all names of famous Admirals—but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher-priority merchantmen and escort vessels. <b>Their</b> <b>designs</b> were updated to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland, but the Admiralty eventually decided that it was better to begin again with a clean-slate design so they were cancelled in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Mello was created, along with Near, {{to break the}} endless cycle of confrontations between the detective L and Light Yagami, {{the man behind the}} persona Kira. Both Mello and Near were designed after L, and were initially envisioned as twins and sons of L. Ultimately, this idea was dropped, with <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> switched compared to the original concept. He is voiced in the Japanese anime series by Nozomu Sasaki and in the English adaptation by David Hurwitz. Merchandise has been created for the character, including plush dolls and action figures. Mello has received mixed commentary by manga and anime publications.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of memorials produced {{a lot of}} business in all the countries involved in the war. In Britain and Australia, stone masons provided large quantities of mass-produced design, often advertising through catalogues, while professional architects acquired the bulk of the specialised commissions for war memorials, making use of their professional organisations. Professional sculptors argued that their work was superior and more appropriate than that of architects, but they received far fewer commissions. British stone masons provided cheap products through catalogues. In France, funeral directors played a large part in the business of producing designs, producing catalogues of <b>their</b> <b>designs</b> for local communities to choose from. In the US, there was sufficient interest that a specialist magazine, Monumental News, was created to support the trade in war memorials.|$|E
