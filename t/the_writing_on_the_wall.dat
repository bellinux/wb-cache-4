25|$|The {{political}} novel, <b>The</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> an anti-war {{novel and}} roman à clef {{based on a}} possible John McCain presidency in 2008, warns against war with Iran by portraying a worst-case scenario of its outcomes. In it, author Hannes Artens portrays a global depression {{as a result of}} the oil price shooting past $140 per barrel and depicts the falsity of thinking that limited aerial strikes on Iran will end the problem. The story shows them eventually leading to a ground invasion and a military draft in the United States. The book ends with the Iran war escalating into a conflagration seizing the entire Middle East and ultimately culminates in a nuclear showdown between Pakistan and India after an Islamist coup in Pakistan.|$|E

500|$|In 1906, Pilcher {{had also}} {{published}} an anonymous invasion novel, <b>The</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> which described a German invasion of Britain; The war he theorised was an invasion by Germany {{followed by a}} rapid collapse of the British forces, particularly the volunteers, which he saw as unfit for purpose; he advocated a form of conscription and a mandatory reserve system to strengthen the Army. The Spectator was dismissive, comparing the novel unfavourably to The Invasion of 1910 ("many useful hints are given as to practical lessons... the general plot entirely destroys any value it might otherwise possess") and noting that the suggestions were [...] "highly typical", {{but that it was}} counterproductive to simply malign the Army and encourage the country to adopt German military policies.

500|$|Ver Huell started scheming {{with his}} French patrons behind {{the back of}} Schimmelpenninck and feeding {{negative}} information about the Pensionary that {{found its way into}} the French press.

The Dutch Secretaries of State and the Staatsraad could read <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> They were faced with Hobson's choice: either a complete extinguishing of the national identity in the form of annexation to the Empire, or the lesser evil of a new kingdom under one of Napoleon's relatives. A Groot Besogne (Grand Commission) was formed to conduct the unequal negotiations with the Emperor. The latter, however, refused to speak with the Commission, and only communicated to them through the intermediary of Ver Huell. Talleyrand had meanwhile drafted a [...] "Treaty" [...] which contained the conditions under which the crown of [...] "Holland" [...] was to be offered to Louis: no union of the crowns; no conscription; a possible commercial treaty with France; and the basic freedoms of the Netherlands (linguistic, religious, judicial) were to be maintained; while the civil list was fixed at the [...] "modest sum" [...] of 1.5 million guilders. The constitution of the Pensionary was actually to be maintained with a few minor alterations (the title of raadpensionaris changed to that of King; and the size of the Staatsraad and the legislative corps nearly doubled).|$|E

For example, in Paulo Coelho's novel The Witch of Portobello, the main character, Sherine Khalil, {{is described as a}} Transylvanian orphan with a Romani mother, in an effort to add to the character's exotic mystique. The so-called Transylvanian trilogy of historical novels by Miklos Banffy, <b>The</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> is an extended treatment of the 19th- and early 20th-century social and political history of the country.
