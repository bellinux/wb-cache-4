5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} <b>trachea</b> may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the <b>trachea)</b> is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the <b>trachea,</b> it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the <b>trachea</b> or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the <b>trachea</b> away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the <b>trachea,</b> leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E

25|$|There are {{characteristics}} that {{are particularly important}} for the terrestrial lifestyle of arachnids, such as internal respiratory surfaces {{in the form of}} <b>tracheae,</b> or modification of the book gill into a book lung, an internal series of vascular lamellae used for gas exchange with the air. While the <b>tracheae</b> are often individual systems of tubes, similar to those in insects, ricinuleids, pseudoscorpions, and some spiders possess sieve <b>tracheae,</b> in which several tubes arise in a bundle from a small chamber connected to the spiracle.

Chimeric <b>tracheas</b> {{were used to}} examine whether donor-type antigen-presenting cells are important {{in the development of}} obliterative airway disease. To separate the contributions of CD 4 + and CD 8 + direct pathways, we transplanted <b>tracheas</b> from knockout mice lacking major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II antigens. Methods: Chimeric <b>tracheas</b> were created via bone marrow transplantation in fully MHC-mismatched combinations. <b>Tracheas</b> from naive B 6, autologously reconstituted B 6, chimeric B 6 bearing recipient-type C 3 H antigen-presenting cells, MHC class I knockout B 6 (B 6 I–), MHC class II knockout B 6 (B 6 II–), or C 3 H mice were transplanted into C 3 H recipients. The <b>tracheas</b> were harvested at days 14 and 28. Results: At day 28, isografts showed no occlusion, normal respiratory epithelium, and minimal infiltrates. Naive or autologously reconstituted B 6, B 6 I–, and B 6 II– <b>tracheas</b> showed minimal occlusion at day 14 but contained intraepithelial infiltrates. By day 28, the naive or autologously reconstituted B 6 <b>tracheas</b> had occlusion of 69. 5 % ± 11. 6 % (mean ± standard error of the mean), and in comparison, B 6 I– and B 6 II– <b>tracheas</b> had occlusions of 53. 0 % ± 16. 3 % and 52. 2 % ± 15. 9 %, respectively (P =. 20,. 19). In chimeric B 6 <b>tracheas,</b> minimal occlusion was seen at day 14 and remained 33. 6 % ± 16. 2 % (P =. 039) at day 28. Subtle epithelial changes and minimal infiltrates were seen. Conclusions: Obliterative airway disease appears to involve donor-type antigen-presenting cells and {{develops in}} the absence of either MHC class I or II antigens. These findings suggest that either CD 8 + or CD 4 + direct allorecognition is important in the development of obliterative airway disease. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 120 : 1070 - 7...|$|R
40|$|Like most araneomorph spiders, jumping spiders {{possess a}} double {{respiratory}} system consisting of book lungs and tube <b>tracheae.</b> The book lungs {{are the most}} important for gas exchange in many species and cope alone with the oxygen demands. The <b>tracheae</b> are often only poorly developed and are presumed to be of little importance in overall gas exchange (Anderson, 1970; Anderson and Prestwich, 1982; Strazny and Perry, 1984). In contrast, several species, e. g. the diurnal jumping spiders, have both book lungs and <b>tracheae</b> that are well developed (Schmitz and Perry, 2000), but nothing is known about the gas-exchange potential of the <b>tracheae</b> in comparison with that of the lungs. In Salticus scenicus, the tracheal system consists of four thick tube <b>tracheae</b> that originate from the atrium of the spiracle and that branch into secondary <b>tracheae.</b> These run parallel, without further branching, tapering slightly as they go. Some of the secondary <b>tracheae</b> end in the opisthosoma while others extend as bundles into the prosoma. Most <b>tracheae</b> end in the haemolymph; only the gut and the nervous system are penetrated in both the pro- and opisthosoma (Schmitz and Perry, 2000). One way of describing the gas-exchange potential of a respiratory organ is to evaluate its morphological diffusing capacity. Quantitative morphological data on spider lungs have been obtained by counting the number of lung lamellae or interlamellar spaces and multiplying by the area of an average lamella (Anderson and Prestwich, 1980). Morphological diffusing capacities cannot, however, be calculated using this method. Only in Tegenaria spp. has the morphological diffusing capacity of the lungs been evaluated using stereological methods (Strazny and Perry, 1984). In addition, {{there is a lack of}} quantitative data on the surface areas, diffusion barriers and diffusing capacities of tracheal systems in spiders. Thus, evaluation of the functional morphology of <b>tracheae,</b> which initially involves identifying where gas exchange occurs, has been restricted to descriptive and speculative accounts.

5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the <b>trachea.</b> Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The <b>trachea</b> is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and <b>trachea,</b> which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E

40|$|During the {{evolution}} of the araneomorph spiders, the second pair of book-lungs was completely reduced or was replaced by <b>tracheae.</b> In some spider families, <b>tracheae</b> are well-developed systems and often reach into the prosoma.

As one explanation, it was hypothesized that well-tracheated spiders have greater aerobic capabilities than the other spider families (Levi, 1967, 1976; Anderson, 1970). For testing this hypothesis, comparative investigations of wolf and jumping spiders have been made (Prestwich, 1983 a,b; Schmitz, 2004). Spiders of these two families have similar life styles and, additionally, they possess well-developed lungs with similar diffusing capacities (Schmitz and Perry, 2001, 2002).

50|$|Sometimes, book lungs can be absent, and gas {{exchange}} is {{performed by the}} thin walls inside the cavity instead, with their surface area increased by branching into the body as thin tubes called <b>tracheae.</b> The <b>tracheae</b> possibly have evolved directly from the book lungs because, in some spiders, the <b>tracheae</b> have {{a small number of}} greatly elongated chambers. Many arachnids, such as mites and harvestmen (Opiliones), have no traces of book lungs and breathe through <b>tracheae</b> or through their body surfaces only.

5|$|The <b>trachea</b> and bronchi {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The <b>trachea</b> is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two bronchi at a ridge called the carina. The <b>trachea</b> is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front and sides of the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The bronchi split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that supply air to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical <b>trachea</b> at the thoracic inlet, an opening at the top of the thoracic cavity. Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, the rib cage, the thoracic spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E

5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the airway is patent so that the patient can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the <b>trachea</b> may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper <b>trachea</b> is injured, an incision can be made in the <b>trachea</b> (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the <b>trachea</b> is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the <b>trachea</b> and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E
