In these realizations, the group algebra is identified with the ambient space, and the group elements with the coordinates of the ambient space. It is an obvious consequence of the definition that every pr-ary affine-invariant code of length pm, with p prime, can be realized as an ideal of the group algebra Fpr[(Fpm,+) ], where (Fpm,+) is the underlying additive group of the field Fpm with pm elements. In this paper we describe all <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>code</b> structures of an affine-invariant code of length pm in terms of a family of maps from Fpm to the group of automorphisms of (Fpm,+).

If G {{is a group of}} permutation matrices, the set Gx is called a “permutation code”. For permutation codes a ’stack algorithm ’ decoder exists that, in the presence of low noise, produces the maximum-likelihood estimate of the transmitted vector by using far fewer computations than the standard decoder. In this paper a new concept of equivalence of codes of different dimensions is presented which is weaker than the usual definition of equivalent codes. We show that every group code is (weakly) equivalent to a permutation code and we discuss the minimal degree of this permutation code...|$|E

When n is a prime p, we present a carefully chosen representation which reduces the number of distinct inner products further to ^(n- 1) /_m, where m is the number of rows in the matrix. The resulting frames have superior performance to many earlier frame constructions and, in some cases, yield frames with optimally low coherence. We further expand a connection between frames and difference sets noted first in [2] to find bounds on the coherence when ^(n- 1) /_m = 2 and 3...|$|E

Two-level <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> over <b>the</b> class of generalized quaternion groups, Q(2 m) m {{greater than or}} equal to 3, are constructed using a binary code and a code over Z(2 m- 1), the ring of integers module 2 (m- 1), as component codes and a mapping f from Z(2) X Z(2 m- 1) to Q 2 m. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the component codes is derived which will give <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> over Q(2 m). Given the generator matrices of the component codes, the computational effort involved in checking the necessary and sufficient conditions is discussed. Starting from a four- dimensional signal set matched to Q(2 m), it is shown that the Euclidean space <b>codes</b> obtained from <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> over Q(2 m) have Euclidean distance profiles which are independent of the coset representative selection involved in f. A closed-form expression for the minimum Euclidean distance of <b>the</b> resulting <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> over Q(2 m) is obtained in terms of the Euclidean distances of the component codes.

40|$|Error-correcting {{encoding}} is {{a mathematical}} {{manipulation of the}} information against transmission errors over noisy communications channels. One class of error-correcting codes is the so-called group codes. Presently, there are many good binary group codes which are abelian. A group code is a family of bi-infinite sequences produced by a finite state machine (FSM) homomorphic encoder defined on the extension of two finite groups. As a set of sequences, a group code is a dynamical system and {{it is known that}} well-behaved dynamical systems must be necessarily controllable. Thus, a good group code must be controllable. In this paper, we work with group codes defined over nonabelian groups. This necessity on the encoder is because {{it has been shown that}} the capacity of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using abelian group codes is upper bounded by the capacity of the same channel using phase shift keying (PSK) modulation eventually with different energies per symbol. We will show that when the trellis section group is nonabelian and the input group of the encoder is a cyclic group with, elements, prime, then <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>code</b> produced by the encoder is noncontrollable...|$|E
