A total of twenty-six 225 -g ingots and ten 2. 5 to 12 kg ingots of various compositions in the Fe-Si-Mn-Ni-C system were prepared. All ingots contained from 5 to 11 w/o silicon and drew their corrosion resistance primarily from this component. The composition ranges of the remaining major alloying elements were (in w/o) 0 - 24 Mn, 0 - 35 Ni, and 0. 08 to 0. 95 C.

40|$|Chromium alloyed {{sintered}} steels offer considerable potential {{with regard}} to mechanical properties both in the as sintered and heat treated state. The main problem, esp. when using prealloyed steel powders, is oxygen at the sintering contacts that can both originate from the starting powders or be introduced during sintering, e. g. by using impure atmospheres. Here it is shown that oxide layers in the interparticle contacts inhibit formation of sufficiently strong sintering necks which adversely affects the mechanical properties, in particular the impact energy. Removal of the oxide layers is obtained primarily by carbothermic reduction through admixed graphite, the temperatures necessary for Cr alloy steels being markedly higher than in <b>the</b> case of <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> High temperature sintering is particularly beneficial here, resulting in more thorough deoxidation and {{in a much better}} property profile.

30|$|Spray arc is {{required}} for thicker section than short arc. It is very suitable when a high deposition rate is needed and when deep penetration {{is required}} for welding of massive base materials that can tolerate high heat input. The large weld pool makes vertical or overhead position welding difficult, especially in <b>the</b> case of <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> and stainless steels. For joining steels, the transition current can be varied more than when welding aluminium alloys. A spray arc {{can be used with}} almost all common alloys containing aluminium and also nickel alloys, copper alloys, stainless <b>steels,</b> magnesium, and <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Robert and Messler 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). Despite the advantages of conventional spray arc, odd arc instabilities and disordered metal transfer have restricted its adoption. In spray arc mode, the current and voltage are almost steady, which leads to random droplet size and frequency (Hutt and Lucas 1982). Therefore, high fume, spatter, and heat input are generated. As a result of insufficient control, the weld quality can be adversely affected. It {{should also be noted that}} the argon-based shielding gas used to achieve spray arc is more expensive than CO 2. In view of these drawbacks, spray arc is unsuitable for aluminium, structural steel, coated steel, and high-strength steels.|$|R
40|$|As {{reported}} to ORNL, concomitant {{with the introduction}} of different deicing and anti-icing compounds, there was an increase in the brake failure rate of tractor-trailer trucks. A forensic evaluation of a failed brake system was performed. Optical and scanning electron microscopic evaluation showed corrosion to be mostly confined to the brake table/lining interface. The corrosion is non-uniform as is to be expected for <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> in chloride environments. This initial analysis found no evidence for the chlorides of calcium and magnesium, which are the newly introduced deicing and antiicing compounds and are less soluble in water than the identified chlorides of sodium and potassium, in the scale. The result could be as a result of non-exposure of the examined brake table to calcium and magnesium chloride. The mechanisms for the increased failure rate are postulated as being an increased rate of corrosion due to positive shifts in the corrosion potential, and an increased amount of corrosion due to an increased ''time of wetness'' that results from the presence of hygroscopic salts. Laboratory scale evaluation of <b>the</b> corrosion of <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> in simulated deicing and anti-icing solutions need to be performed to determine corrosion rates and morphological development of corrosion product, to compare laboratory data to in-service data, and to rank economically feasible replacement materials for low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> In addition, the mechanical behavior of the lining attached to the brake shoe table needs to be assessed.

40|$|Distortion is a {{potential}} problem with all welded fabrications. To a large extent, industrial control of weld induced distortion is achieved by reliance on past experience, simple empirical formulae or rectification procedures. Rectification can be costly, whilst in large complex structures, empirical formulae are rarely applicable. Classical approaches to the modelling of welding distortion and residual stress, whilst accurate, have not been readily useable within industry. The time and cost associated with running such models appear to be the main reasons contributing to this situation. Nevertheless, the use of computer simulative techniques has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of welded fabrications by allowing for predictions to be made long before a single weld bead is put down on the workshop floor. Therefore, computer models that are aimed at predicting welding phenomena not only need to be accurate, but must also be affordable and capable of making predictions within industrial time frames {{if they are to be}} used by fabricators. This paper presents one such strategy. The Shrinkage Volume Method is a linear elastic finite-element modelling technique that has been developed to predict post-weld distortion. By assuming that the linear thermal contraction of a nominal shrinkage volume is the main driving force for distortion, the need to determine the transient temperature field and microstructural changes is eliminated. In so doing, the model solution times are reduced significantly and the use of linear elastic finite-element methods permits large, highly complex welded structures to be modelled within a reasonable time frame. Verification of the modelled results was carried out by an experimental program that investigated <b>the</b> distortion of <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> plates having differing vee-butt preparations. The initial models, which had assumed the edge preparation to be representative of the overall shrinkage volume, were in reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined distortion values. Further improvements to these results were made by using a thermal model to define better the effective weld shrinkage volume. A. Bachorski, M. J. Painter, A. J. Smailes, M. A. Waha...|$|R

40|$|Fine grained {{advanced}} steels exhibit favourable {{mechanical properties}} for applications requiring high strength, ductility and impact toughness. These properties {{result from a}} microstructure containing a fine distribution of several phases including ferrite, austenite, martensite and bainite. The bainite phase {{is in the form}} of fine lamellas of ferrite and carbon-enriched austenite which due to proper control of the chemical composition is lacking the nanometre scaled carbides associated with traditional bainite. The mechanisms of bainite phase transformations in steels have been debated since the naming of bainite in 1934, and range from diffusion-controlled (reconstructive) to diffusionless (displacive). Interest in the manufacture and application of fine grained advanced multiphase steels can be dated back to the 1970 s, and it has been intensified after the turn of the century with the industrial production and application of such steels. The structure and mechanical properties of fine grained advanced steels produced using novel thermal treatments are described. The results of in-situ x-ray diffraction studies of the austenite to bainite transformation process provide information about the effect of carbon redistribution on the formation of transformation products. Transformation microstructures created by various thermal treatments are characterised using optical and scanning electron microscopy, which reveal the presence of martensite, bainite (in various forms), ferrite and retained austenite. Microstructural control is found to be possible by quenching the steels from the austenite phase to temperatures below the start temperature of martensite formation (determined by steel composition). The quenching is followed by isothermal treatment for varying times at temperatures related to the formation of transformation products (bainite in particular). This combined heat treatment also increases the rate of phase transformation in comparison with isothermal treatments. Thus multiphase microstructures are produced, which are found to possess favourable mechanical properties, in particular tensile strength, toughness and wear resistance. In press hardening of 0. 26 wt-carbon steels, by using the combined heat treatment described, the yield strength was found to be comparable to existing materials and the ductility was found to be higher. Welding tests of medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> with control of the post weld time temperature cycle in accordance with the combined heat treatment process minimized the risk of brittle phase formation in the weld as well as the heat affected zone. In addition the wear resistance in sliding as well as in rolling-sliding was shown to be better for austempered medium <b>carbon</b> high-silicon <b>steels</b> with fine grained ferritic austenitic microstructure in comparison with conventional steels. The presented work can be regarded as a contribution to the current world-wide effort to develop the 3 rd generation advanced high-strength steels, which are expected to be a substantial part of the structural steel market before the end of the present decade. The switch to such steels in a large number of applications in manufacturing of transport vehicles and other products, will be comparable with <b>the</b> switch from <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> to HSLA steels in the seventies and eighties.

A schedule {{known to}} produce strain-induced ferrite was {{used with the}} strain interrupted for increasing intervals of time {{to determine the effect}} of an isothermal hold on the final microstructure. Microscopy and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) were used to analyse the changes that occurred in the partially transformed microstructure during the hold and the subsequent applied strain. The strain-induced ferrite coarsened during the hold and this coarsened ferrite was refined during the second deformation. These results were compared to those obtained for a different <b>plain</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> deformed in single pass rolling close to the Ar 3 temperature. <br /...|$|R
