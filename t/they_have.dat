5|$|A women's rugby {{team was}} founded in 2000, and plays in Division II in the Potomac Rugby Union (PRU). <b>They</b> <b>have</b> won the PRU {{championship}} four consecutive times from 2006 to 2009. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> also {{been invited to the}} Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union tournament three times, and were runners-up in 2006-07.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt by Marge {{to win the}} money on the game show Jeopardy!, the Simpsons arrive home to find {{everyone}} in Springfield gathered on their lawn and Marge thinks <b>they</b> <b>have</b> forgiven them. However, while that is the case, they steal all of their belongings in order to cover the $15,000 debt. In the end, the family playfully fight over a tattered washcloth, the only thing <b>they</b> <b>have</b> left.|$|E
60|$|But {{that which}} was worst of all, was, that they were almost starved for want of provisions, besides the {{fatigues}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> undergone; their bread and flesh was quite gone, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not an ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days; the only relief <b>they</b> <b>had,</b> was, their water was not all spent, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> about half a barrel of flour left; <b>they</b> <b>had</b> sugar enough; some succades or sweetmeats <b>they</b> <b>had</b> at first, but they were devoured; and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seven casks of rum.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> {{seen the}} crowd, heard the uproar; and, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been hurriedly started toward home by their {{attendant}} Dick, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> encountered Steele stalking by.|$|R
60|$|He {{found himself}} {{thinking}} of Hank as {{of a friend}} who had died. What times <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>had!</b> How smoothly <b>they</b> <b>had</b> got on together! He could not recall a single occasion on which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fallen out, from the time when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fought as boys at the prep. school and cemented their friendship the next day. After that there had been periods when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> parted, sometimes for more than a year, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> always come together again and picked up the threads as neatly as if there had been no gap in their intimacy.|$|R
5|$|Although {{they are}} native to North America and eastern Asia, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> adapted well to {{countries}} in which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been introduced, including Argentina and New Zealand. Their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been introduced.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} fungi, little {{information}} {{is available on the}} threat of extinction for Russulaceae species, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been assessed in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List. However, national lists contain some species of Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula, indicating that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> small populations and are endangered, e.g. in Great Britain, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have small}} rounded ears {{so as to}} {{minimise}} heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans <b>they</b> <b>have</b> colour vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an excellent sense of smell, better {{than that of the}} dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> found food before.|$|E
5000|$|At Esculea Agrotecnica Salesiana, {{teams had}} to find the feeding station. There, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to fill up bags of animal food. With horse, teams had to {{transport}} the food to Avenida Estancia La Figura, where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to weigh in the food. If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> less than 50 kg of food, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{to go back and}} fill up. If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> more than 50 kg, they would receive their next clue.|$|R
60|$|And Ronald! ah, Ronald! Yes, indeed! <b>They</b> <b>had</b> met. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> spoken.|$|R

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of the}} head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
5|$|Cystadenocarcinomas {{account for}} 1% of {{pancreatic}} cancers, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a better prognosis {{than the other}} exocrine types.|$|E
5|$|Elders, queens, and kits must be fed before {{apprentices}} and warriors. Unless <b>they</b> <b>have</b> permission, apprentices may not eat until <b>they</b> <b>have</b> hunted to {{feed the}} elders. If any warrior or apprentice is sick or injured, they may eat while the elders, queens, and kits are eating.|$|E

60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> {{never seen}} one another. Guido had never seen Isolde, Isolde had never seen Guido. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> never heard one another speak. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> never been together. They did not know one another.|$|R
60|$|As a rule {{their bodies}} were unburied, and so they demanded sepulture; or <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{committed}} a wrong, and wished to make restitution; or <b>they</b> <b>had</b> left debts which they were anxious to pay; or <b>they</b> <b>had</b> advice, or warnings, or threats to communicate; or <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been murdered, and were determined to bring their assassins to the gibbet.|$|R

5|$|Grebes {{are small}} to medium-large diving birds that breed on fresh water. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> lobed toes and are {{excellent}} swimmers and divers. However, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> their feet placed far {{back on the}} body, making them quite ungainly on land.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} day, about noon, Captain Bonneville {{came upon a}} deserted camp of his people, from which <b>they</b> <b>had,</b> evidently, turned back; but he could find no signs to indicate why <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done so; whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> met with misfortune, or molestation, or in what direction <b>they</b> <b>had</b> gone. He was now, more than ever, perplexed.|$|R
6000|$|Yes, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{walked along}} the cliffs. Yes, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> entered Colonel Dabney's grounds. Yes, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seen the notice-boards (at this point Beetle {{sputtered}} hysterically). For what purpose <b>had</b> <b>they</b> entered Colonel Dabney's grounds?

60|$|Then holder after holder rose, {{and spoke}} rough Danish common sense. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> come hither to win England. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> found it won already. Let them take what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> got from Peterborough, and go.|$|R

60|$|It {{was three}} weeks after <b>they</b> <b>had</b> left Kirensk before they struck the Angara, near Karanchinskoe. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> traversed a distance, as the crow flies, of some eight hundred miles since leaving Kara, but by the route <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{travelled}} {{it was at least}} half as far again, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been little over ten weeks on the journey.

60|$|And they cawed and cawed, and {{boasted of}} all the clever things <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done; how many lambs' eyes <b>they</b> <b>had</b> picked out, and how many dead {{bullocks}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> eaten, and how many young grouse <b>they</b> <b>had</b> swallowed whole, and how many grouse-eggs <b>they</b> <b>had</b> flown away with, stuck {{on the point of}} their bills, which is the hoodie-crow's particularly clever feat, of which he is as proud as a gipsy is of doing the hokany-baro; and what that is, I won't tell you.|$|R
