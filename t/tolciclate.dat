40|$|The thiocarbamate antimycotics {{tolnaftate}} and <b>tolciclate</b> blocked sterol biosynthesis in fungal {{cells and}} cell extracts, with accumulation of squalene. This point of action {{was confirmed by}} the direct inhibition of microsomal squalene epoxidase from Candida albicans. There was no inhibition of other steps in ergosterol biosynthesis. In whole Candida cells, ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition was not complete at drug concentrations up to 100 mg/liter, whereas full inhibition occurred in a cell-free test system. Rat liver cell-free cholesterol biosynthesis was much less sensitive to the drugs. The biochemical action of tolnaftate and <b>tolciclate</b> is thus {{similar to that of}} the allylamine antimycotics naftifine and terbinafine...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of antifungal and antiseptic agents were evaluated against dermatophytes isolated from patients with tinea pedis. The antifungals studied were: ciclopirox olamine, cetoconazole, <b>tolciclate</b> and terbinafine, and the antiseptics were: povidine iodine (PVPI), propolis, Fungol®, Andriodermol®, and boric acid. The {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) or the minimal dilution concentration (MDC) was determined by an agar dilution method using modified yeast nitrogen agar base, and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) or minimum fungicidal dilution (MFD) was determined with subcultures on Sabouraud dextrose agar. All drugs studied were active against the dermatophytes at lower concentrations than those used in products and/or pharmaceutical preparations for topical use. Some antifungal agents, mainly terbinafine and <b>tolciclate,</b> presented higher efficacy than the other drugs, with lower MICs and MFCs values. It was concluded {{that the use of}} these antiseptic drugs represent an excellent alternative for the topical treatment of tinea pedis. For the treatment of severe cases these are the antifungal agents of choice...|$|E

A atividade in vitro de antifúngicos e anti-sépticos foram avaliadas frente a dermatófitos isolados de pacientes com tinea pedis. Os antifúngicos estudados foram: ciclopirox olamine, cetoconazol, tolciclato e terbinafina, e os anti-sépticos foram: iodo povidine (PVPI), própolis, Fungol®, Andriodermol®e ácido bórico. A concentração inibitória mínima (CIM) ou a diluição inibitória mínima (DIM) foi determinada pelo método de diluição em ágar utilizando "yeast nitrogen" base modificado, e a concentração fungicida mínima (CFM) ou diluição fungicida mínima (DFM) foi determinada por subcultura em Saboraud dextrose ágar. Todas as drogas estudadas foram ativas frente aos dermatófitos em concentrações menores do que as utilizadas em produtos e/ou preparações farmacêuticas para uso tópico. Alguns antifúngicos, principalmente a terbinafina e o tolciclato, foram mais eficazes do que outras drogas estudadas, apresentando CIMs e CFMs mais baixos. Concluíu-se que os anti-sépticos representam uma ótima alternativa para tratamento tópico de vários casos de tinea pedis sendo, entretanto, os antifúngicos reservados para formas severas de tinea...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between sterol biosynthesis inhibition, membrane integrity, and cell growth inhibition in Candida albicans was examined for five squalene epoxidase inhibitors. The compounds were the thiocarbamates tolnaftate and <b>tolciclate</b> and the allylamines naftifine, terbinafine, and SDZ 87 - 469. All compounds inhibited sterol biosynthesis, with the concentrations {{that caused a}} 50 % decrease in the total sterol-to-squalene ratio ranging from {{less than or equal}} to 0. 01 microM for terbinafine and SDZ 87 - 469 to 500 microM for tolnaftate. At 100 microM, the compounds also caused up to a 30 % release of intracellular [14 C]aminoisobutyric acid. With terbinafine and SD 2 87 - 469, aminoisobutyric acid release further increased in cells grown at concentrations that inhibited ergosterol biosynthesis. It is suggested that inhibition of ergosterol synthesis may render the C. albicans membrane susceptible to further damage, including direct damage from squalene epoxidase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antifungal}} susceptibilities of six clinical Trichophyton rubrum isolates obtained sequentially {{from a single}} onychomycosis patient who failed oral terbinafine therapy (250 mg/day for 24 weeks) were determined by broth microdilution and macrodilution methodologies. Strain relatedness was examined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses. Data obtained from both broth micro- and macrodilution assays were in agreement and revealed that the six clinical isolates had greatly reduced susceptibilities to terbinafine. The MICs of terbinafine for these strains were > 4 μg/ml, whereas they were 128 μg/ml, whereas they were 0. 0002 μg/ml for the reference strain. The MIC of terbinafine for the baseline strain (cultured at the initial screening visit and before therapy was started) was already 4, 000 -fold higher than normal, suggesting {{that this is a}} case of primary resistance to terbinafine. The results obtained by the broth macrodilution procedure revealed that the terbinafine MICs and MFCs for sequential isolates apparently increased during the course of therapy. RAPD analyses did not reveal any differences between the isolates. The terbinafine-resistant isolates exhibited normal susceptibilities to clinically available antimycotics including itraconazole, fluconazole, and griseofulvin. However, these isolates were fully cross resistant to several other known squalene epoxidase inhibitors, including naftifine, butenafine, tolnaftate, and <b>tolciclate,</b> suggesting a target-specific mechanism of resistance. This is the first confirmed report of terbinafine resistance in dermatophytes...|$|E
40|$|Piritetrate (M- 732), a new topical {{antifungal}} agent belonging chemically to the thiocarbamates, was demonstrated {{to possess a}} potent selective antidermatophytic activity. In terms of its MICs in susceptibility testing, mainly done by using Sabouraud dextrose agar plates, piritetrate exhibited several- to 10 -fold-stronger antidermatophytic activity than tolnaftate, a reference thiocarbamate. Furthermore, piritetrate was found to show a broader antifungal spectrum than tolnaftate; relatively many species and strains of dematiaceous fungi, dimorphic fungi, and some other filamentous fungi {{as well as a}} few strains of Cryptococcus neoformans were fairly susceptible to piritetrate, while almost all the tested species and strains were resistant to tolnaftate. All the tested species of the genus Candida were, however, resistant to both compounds. Variables which can influence antimicrobial activity caused few changes in the MICs of either compound against Trichophyton mentagrophytes; however, an increase in the inoculum size resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} MICs. The antidermatophytic activities of piritetrate and tolnaftate were fungistatic but not fungicidal. Piritetrate also exhibited a more potent in vitro anti-T. mentagrophytes activity than clotrimazole or <b>tolciclate.</b> Piritetrate and tolnaftate had no antibacterial activity. The in vivo activity of topically administered piritetrate against experimental dermal infection of guinea pigs with T. mentagrophytes was more effective than that of tolnaftate both mycologically and clinically. Piritetrate manifested no acute toxicity in laboratory animals when administered even in large quantities by the oral, intraperitoneal, and topical routes...|$|E
40|$|Squalene {{epoxidase}} (SE) is {{the primary}} target of the allylamine antimycotic agents terbinafine and naftifine and also of the thiocarbamates. Although all of these drugs are employed primarily in dermatological therapy, SE from dermatophyte fungi has not been previously investigated. We report here the biochemical characterization of SE activity from Trichophyton rubrum {{and the effects of}} terbinafine and other inhibitors. Microsomal SE activity from T. rubrum was not dependent on soluble cytoplasmic factors but had an absolute requirement for NADPH or NADH and was stimulated by flavin adenine dinucleotide. Kinetic analyses revealed that under optimal conditions the Km for squalene was 13 microM and its Vmax was 0. 71 nmol/h/mg of protein. Terbinafine was the most potent inhibitor tested, with a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 15. 8 nM. This inhibition was noncompetitive with regard to the substrate squalene. A structure-activity relationship study with some analogs of terbinafine indicated that the tertiary amino structure of terbinafine was crucial for its high potency, as well as the tert-alkyl side chain. Naftifine had a lower potency (IC 50, 114. 6 nM) than terbinafine. Inhibition was also demonstrated by the thiocarbamates <b>tolciclate</b> (IC 50, 28. 0 nM) and tolnaftate (IC 50, 51. 5 nM). Interestingly, the morpholine amorolfine also displayed a weak but significant effect (IC 50, 30 microM). T. rubrum SE was only slightly more sensitive (approximately twofold) to terbinafine inhibition than was the Candida albicans enzyme. Therefore, this difference cannot fully explain the much higher susceptibility (> or = 100 -fold) of dermatophytes than of yeasts to this drug. The sensitivity to terbinafine of ergosterol biosynthesis in whole cells of T. rubrum (IC 50, 1. 5 nM) is 10 -fold higher than that of SE activity, suggesting that the drug accumulates in the fungus...|$|E
