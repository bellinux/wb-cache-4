PLA and PBSA have been getting more interest due to their biodegradable property. PLA is a hard and transparent polymer with the additional of PBSA or copolyester can increase the flexibility, processability and thermal properties of the compound. The PLA biodegradable process needs water to be hydrolyzed and composed while PBSA can be hydrolyzed and biodegraded faster. In this study, PLA and PBSA were blended at 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, 60 : 40, 50 : 50 and 0 : 100. The blends polymer produced from extrusion process and compressed for characterize.

The necessary {{properties of the}} <b>textile</b> <b>package</b> are obtained by means of proper selection {{of the structure of}} the package and physical properties of each individual textile layer. The research of wearing comfort is focused on analysis of air permeability, thermal resistance and the resistance and absorption of water vapour.

During the experimental investigation the thermal and water vapour resistance of the <b>textile</b> <b>packages</b> consisting of different combinations of layers made of different materials have been compared. The finite element computational model has been developed for the analysis of heat transfer through the <b>textile</b> <b>package</b> caused by heat conduction and advection due to ventilation air flow.

Many studies have {{been focused on the}} fabrication of superhydrophobic/hydrophobic surfaces using natural materials. In this paper, superhydrophobic/hydrophobic surfaces were formed by an amphiphilic natural protein, zein, using electrospinning. Water contact angle (WCA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the hydrophobicity and surface morphology of the electrospun structures. The highest WCA of the zein electrospun surfaces could reach 155. 5 ¡Ó 1. 4 ¢X. To further understand the mechanism of superhydrophobic surface formation from amphiphiles using electrospinning, a synthetic amphiphilic polymer was selected, and also, a method similar to electrospinning, spray drying, was tried. The electrospun amphiphilic polymer surface showed a high hydrophobicity with a WCA of 141. 4 ¡Ó 0. 7 ¢X. WCA of the spray-dried zein surface could reach 125. 3 ¡Ó 2. 1 ¢X. The secondary structures of the zein in the electrospun film and cast-dried film were studied using ATR-FTIR, showing that £helix to £]-sheet transformation happened during the solvent evaporation in the cast drying process but not in the electrospinning process.

40|$|The {{content of}} {{dibutylphthalate}} (DBP) and di- (2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in samples of packages used for packaging meat productsand the phthalate migration from packaging materials to meat products were studied. Five samples of <b>textile</b> <b>packaging</b> intended for cooked meat production were analysed as well asthe final product which was filled into packages. Subsequently an analysis {{was carried out}} (after 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of storage) of the finished meat products stored {{over the course of}} their intended shelf life at ambient temperature of 4 °C. Determination of phthalates was conducted by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with UV detection at a wavelength of 224 nm on the Zorbax Eclipse C 8 column. The content of phthalates in the final product was below the limit of quantification. According to the Regulation of the Commission (EU) No. 10 / 2011, the specific migration limit of products intended for food contact is 1. 5 mg. kg - 1 of food simulant for DEHP and  0. 3 mg. kg - 1 for DBP. After filling and the first day of storage of the meat product, four package samples release the said phthalates to an extent that it exceeded the limits of the Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10 / 2011. Already after the seventh day of storage, all samples (with the exception of sample 2 for DBP) exceeded SMLs. Monitoring of each phthalate migration in individual samples during storage (for 28 days) produced a rising tendency.   In sample 1, DBP increased from 0. 40 to 3. 37 mg. kg - 1, while DEHP from 0. 58 to 14. 66 mg. kg - 1.

For this purpose polyurethane block copolymer containing soft segment such as polycaprolactone glycol (number-average molecular weight 3000, PCL 3000), PCL 3000 -polypropylene glycol (number-average molecular weight 3000, PPG 3000), PCL 3000 -polytetramethylene glycol (number-average molecular weight 2900, PTMG 2900), PPG 3000 -PTMG 2900, were synthesized using a two-step or three-step synthesis process. All the SPUs were modified with the hydrophilic segment, i. e. diol-terminated poly(ethylene oxide) (number-average molecular weight 3400, PEG 3400). Fourier-transform infrared, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis were used to characterize the polyurethanes. The mass transfer properties were measured by equilibrium sorption and water vapor permeability measurements. Mixed blocks loosen the inter-chain interaction due to phase mixing which decreases the crystallization of the soft segment in the resulting SPU. The crystallinity of mixed polyol block SPU increases when both polyols are crystallizable in the pure state. Highest loss tan value was observed for the sample containing PTMG 2900 -PPG 3000 mixed soft segment due to their flexible and phase mixed structure which increases the chain mobility; this sample performed best among all four SPUs in equilibrium water sorption as well as water vapor permeability owing to their loose and nearly amorphous structure.
