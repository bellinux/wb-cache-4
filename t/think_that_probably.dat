[...] Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley, Jr.. Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.

We <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>probably</b> the frequency with which myocarditis is responsible for electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities in athletes has so far been underestimated, and that caution must be employed when interpreting minor segmental wall motion abnormalities on resting and exercise echocardiograms in trained subjects as being due to athlete's hart, especially when they present with repolarization changes...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{programming}} language {{widely used in}} education when learning the object-oriented is Java. While this language has proven as being good for industry, some drawbacks make it less appropriate for education. We the authors <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>probably</b> better languages can be designed exclusively for education, as, Pascal was designed for lecturing in structured programming. This would allow students to concentrate in the important issues of object-oriented programming. In this article, an ongoing research project held in the Computer Science departament of the University of Vigo is described. It currently consists of a virtual machine, an assembler, and a macroassembler, although, in the near future, a true programming language will be developed for it, as long as an integrated development environment. The simplicty of the prototype-based model of object orientation, the drammatic decrease in complexity for programs due to the direct support of persistence, and all facilities naturally provided by the feature of multiplatform support makes it the ideal tool for learning, allowing the educator to stress on the actually important issues of object oriented programming. 1...|$|E

Judy has described the background, her family background and early background in detail, so we will begin with the second question, which asks for her to select the experiences that were most important in her intellectual development. Judy, what were the early adult experiences? Which ones were important to you? I thought it was early, but I guess it’s early adult. Rosenblith: I <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>probably,</b> the most important early adult experiences were: being denied candidacy for the Ph.
