25|$|Within {{minutes of}} Duggan's second {{telephone}} call to her, his mother contacted the British emergency services and was advised {{to call her}} local police station in Colindale, Barnet. She <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> believed her son was in danger. They transferred her to the London Metropolitan Police at Scotland Yard, but when she explained he had become involved with Nouvelle Solidarité {{they had no idea}} what she meant.|$|E
25|$|Two detectives from RHD interrogated her {{the next}} month, July 2010. She <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> was {{concerned}} that events leading to Lazarus's arrest {{in which she was}} involved had been portrayed differently in the media than she recalled them, putting the department in a more favorable light. Nuttall as well, she recalled, had been placed in an equally difficult position, since he told her that Lazarus may have learned that they had reopened the investigation despite the precautions he and Barba had taken.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{know those}} chaps,” said Homer Opper. “They stayed here one night last summer. But they cut up so the {{boarders}} didn’t like it, so my wife <b>told</b> <b>’em</b> <b>she</b> didn’t have {{no room for}} ’em, an’ they left. They ought to be locked up.” ...|$|R
60|$|Her own gentle voice {{speaking}} {{from the other}} end of the room, which was a very long one, <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> was on the sofa. Mrs. Norris began scolding.|$|R
60|$|Alarmed by {{the words}} and the urgent manner of his neighbour, Jim and his wife slipped on a few clothes and came down. Jane at once <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what <b>she</b> had heard.|$|R
25|$|Once {{while serving}} as a doctor for the Peace Corps, a {{volunteer}} became seriously ill, and a doctor diagnosed malaria. The volunteer's condition progressively worsened, and Jemison {{was sure it was}} meningitis with life-threatening complications that could not be treated in Sierra Leone. Jemison called for an Air Force hospital plane based in Germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of $80,000. The embassy questioned whether Jemison had the authority to give such an order, but she <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> did not need anyone's permission for a medical decision. By the time the plane reached Germany with Jemison and the volunteer on board, she had been up with the patient for 56 hours. The patient survived.|$|E
500|$|Parsons {{agreed to}} move his {{daughter}} to Aldrich's house for further testing on 22January, but when that morning Penn and a man of [...] "veracity and fortune" [...] called on Parsons and asked for Elizabeth, the clerk <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> was not there and refused to reveal her whereabouts. [...] Parsons had spoken with friends and was apparently worried that Kent had been busy with his own investigations. [...] Instead, he allowed Elizabeth to be moved that night to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where another séance was held. [...] Nothing was reported until about 6am, when three scratches were heard, apparently while the girl was asleep. [...] The approximately 20-strong audience complained that the affair was a deception. [...] Once Elizabeth woke she began to cry, and once reassured that she was safe admitted that she was afraid for her father, [...] "who must needs be ruined and undone, if their matter should be {{supposed to be an}} imposture." [...] She also admitted that although she had appeared to be asleep, she was in fact fully aware of the conversation going on around her.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, Ladies' Home Journal posted {{an article}} on its website that said that Abdul <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> stayed at the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California for three days the {{previous}} year to recover from physical dependence on prescription pain medications. The medications, prescribed due to injuries and her RSD diagnosis, included a pain patch, nerve medication, and a muscle relaxant. According to the article, Abdul said the medications made her [...] "get weird" [...] at times and that she suffered from physical withdrawal symptoms during her recovery.|$|E

60|$|Two {{more days}} went by, {{and there were}} still no signs of her, though the {{telegraph}} <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> had left Southampton Docks at the appointed time and date. By this time, people in Madeira could talk of nothing else.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{introduced}} them to Victory, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> was queen of England. They thought, at first, that I was joking. But when I had recounted my adventures and {{they realized that}} I was in earnest, they believed me.|$|R
2500|$|After {{some time}} in the custody of the Iraqi army {{regiment}} that had captured her, [...] Lynch was taken to a hospital in Nasiriya. [...] Iraqi hospital staff, including doctors Harith Al-Houssona and Anmar Uday, said they shielded Lynch from Iraqi military and government agents who were using the hospital as a base of military operations. US forces were tipped off as to Lynch's whereabouts by an Iraqi, who <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> had been tortured and injured but was still alive. The Iraqi was described as a 32-year-old lawyer, initially described only as [...] "Mohammed" [...] and later identified as Mohammed Odeh al Rehaief. In light of Mohammed's role in Lynch's rescue, he and his family were granted refugee status by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Ed Sheeran {{has spoken}} about his support her Sandé and her music, {{saying that she}} has {{spent a lot of}} time on the record and that it could be as big as Adele's second album, 21, which has sold over 27 million records worldwide. Sandé {{revealed}} that she wanted to bring poetry back into music, as it has been lost. The songs which are currently being released are for the [...] "moment" [...] as they make us feel good and we can dance to them, Sandé said. She said that Our Version of Events will see poetry lyrics, as she intends to bring them back into fashion. She said; Great songwriters come along quite rarely, but when I listen to Tracy Chapman or Joni Mitchell, these are people who pay attention to the lyric and are precise about it. I feel that has been put second to having a cool producer or whether the kids will like it. She said that the music industry is hard to get into, but once you are in, it is very loyal. In the recording studio, Syco Music heard some of Sandé's songs which they wanted, but she refused and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> wanted to keep them for her own album. They later asked her to write for some of their artists, and Leona Lewis went into the studio with her and Naughty Boy to record for a couple of weeks, and she said that her and Lewis had a lot in common. She also said that Lewis has a phenomenal voice and she was lovely.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial was}} {{politically}} motivated. Cauchon, although {{a native of}} France, {{had served in the}} English government since 1418, and he was therefore hostile to a woman who had worked for the opposing side. The same was true of the other tribunal members. Ascribing a diabolic origin to her victories would be an effective way to ruin her reputation and bolster the morale of English troops. Thus the decision to involve the Inquisition, which did not initiate the trial and in fact showed a reluctance throughout its duration. Seventy charges were brought against her, including accusations of heresy and dressing as a male (i.e., wearing soldiers' clothing and armor). Eyewitnesses later said that Joan had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> was wearing this clothing and keeping it [...] "firmly laced and tied together" [...] because the tunic could be tied to the long boots to keep her guards from pulling her clothing off during their occasional attempts to rape her. Joan was first condemned to life imprisonment and the deputy-inquisitor, Jean Le Maitre (whom the eyewitness said only attended because of threats from the English) obtained from her assurances of relinquishing her male clothes. However, after four days, during which she was said to have been subjected to attempted rape by English soldiers, she put her soldier's clothing back on because (according to the eyewitnesses) she needed protection against rape. Cauchon declared her a relapsed heretic, and she was burned at the stake two days later on 30 May 1431.|$|E
60|$|Flora {{laughed at}} their story, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> {{suspected}} that the old gentleman was in the right; and she laid plans for having Harry to teach them yachting at Ryde, while Harry declared he would {{have nothing to do}} with such trumpery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what?" [...] <b>she</b> asked. She knew; {{she felt}} {{sure that she}} knew; and yet she could not refrain from the question.|$|R
60|$|A stout figure, {{hitherto}} unperceived, {{rose from}} {{a corner and}} came silently toward them--Mrs. Breitmann. <b>She</b> beckoned to <b>them,</b> and they followed her into a room on the same floor, where <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what <b>she</b> knew, heedless of the tears coursing ceaselessly down her cheeks.|$|R
60|$|Patricia never <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> was {{pleading}} so {{hard for}} the boy. It would only pain her cousins and make them think she was disloyal to their interests; but she lost no opportunity when with her Aunt Jane of praising Kenneth and proving his ability, and finally she seemed to win her point.|$|E
60|$|Ursula {{went home}} to Beldover faint, dim, closed up. She could {{scarcely}} speak or notice. It was as if her energy were frozen. Her people asked her what was the matter. She <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> had broken off the engagement with Skrebensky. They looked blank and angry. But she could not feel any more.|$|E
60|$|She {{went into}} the lodge, and asked the woodman and his wife to take her into their service. They were not willing at first; but she <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> would ask no wages, and would give them diamonds, and pearls, and silk stuffs, and gold thread {{whenever}} they wished for them, and then they agreed to let her stay.|$|E
60|$|The brig, however, {{showed no}} {{inclination}} {{to await the}} attack. Some shots had been hastily fired when the lugger's first gun <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> was now an enemy, and she at once put down her helm and made off before the wind, which was now very light.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This night? Have you a night, then? They disbelieved me when I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of mine.' <b>She</b> {{leaned back}} and laughed, always slowly. 'Aren't doctors stu-upid? They don't know.' ...|$|R
50|$|Later on, Maria asks Cesare for his help. She {{is dying}} in a hospital, but cannot tell her parents, because, some time earlier, <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> was married. So, in the last hours of her life, Cesare marries Maria, and then calls for her family to be with her.|$|R
60|$|As a rule, Rachel hated kissing. She could seldom be prevailed upon to kiss {{even her}} uncles--who knew it and liked to tease her for kisses until they aggravated her so terribly that she <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> couldn't bear men. But now she {{promptly}} {{put her arms}} about this strange man's neck {{and gave him a}} hearty smack.|$|E
60|$|She rigged the boys' vessels, {{and covered}} their balls, {{and made them}} {{beautiful}} flags and banners out of her pieces of coloured silk. She advised {{them to have a}} flag-staff {{out at the end of}} the mole, as they generally have on all fortifications and national works. She <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> would make them a handsome flag for the purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{wonder they}} {{imagined}} I killed her!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "She accuses me. But she never meant what they imagined she meant. Why, that evidence could hang me!... Allie <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> saw Larry do it. And it's common knowledge now--I've heard it here.... What, then, had Allie to forgive--to forgive with eyes that will haunt {{me to my}} grave?" ...|$|E
60|$|The decisive {{word had}} been spoken: {{there was no}} doubt {{concerning}} the end willed by each: there only remained the way of arriving at it, and Catherine determined to take the straightest possible.

500|$|Following her husband's death, Fields began {{a career}} as a {{television}} sound editor working on such shows as Death Valley Days and the children's programs Sky King and Fury.

50|$|According to Smith's lawyer, Jose Justiniano, Suzette's family {{contacted}} him on March 12, 2009 {{and asked}} for a meeting with him and the other lawyer who is also representing Smith.

6000|$|She dashed {{away the}} tears, and proudly entered the lecture-hall, and ascended the tribune like a goddess, amid the shouts of her audience.... What did she care for them?

And {{at that point we}} will take the lecture up. ...............|$|E
60|$|Well, Amy talked big, {{but very}} free and familiar, <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> had no pride in her good fortune (and {{that was true}} enough, for, to give Amy her due, she was far from it, and was as good-humoured a {{creature}} as ever lived); {{that she was the}} same as ever; and that she always loved this boy, and was resolved to do something extraordinary for him.|$|E
60|$|After conversing awhile in {{undertones}} as if {{they had}} no real right there at all, Cornelia <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>she</b> would call their sister, if an old gentleman who had been to see her were gone again. Cornelia then ran away, and Sol and Dan stood aloof, till they had seen the old gentleman alluded to go to the door and drive off, shortly after which Ethelberta ran down to meet them.|$|E
5000|$|During this time, Signy was amongst {{her crying}} maidens, asking {{them if they}} were willing to follow her {{wherever}} she would go. Crying, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> would die with the only man she had embraced in life. Then <b>she</b> asked <b>them</b> to set her chamber on fire as soon as the watchman signalled the execution. They all vowed to die with her.|$|R
500|$|The {{album cover}} is a {{painting}} by Betty Swanwick titled The Dream. Swanwick had designed posters for London Transport between the 1930s and 1950s. The original painting did not feature a lawn mower; the band had Swanwick add it later as an allusion to the song [...] "I Know What I Like" [...] as Swanwick <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> had {{not enough time to}} paint a new picture for their cover.|$|R
50|$|The {{policeman}} {{and social}} worker {{find it hard}} to believe her story, especially since lamang lupa are just part of folklore. Besides, Shiela never <b>told</b> <b>them</b> how <b>she</b> survived. As the policeman starts to tell her how she'll be facing murder charges, Shiela screams in pain. She collapses on the floor and dies. The policeman notices something moving in Shiela's stomach, from which a lamang lupa bursts out of.|$|R
