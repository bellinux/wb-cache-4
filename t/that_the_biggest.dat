5|$|Due to a tight budget, Larkin {{was unable}} to hire an {{orchestra}} to perform the music; all the instruments in the soundtrack aside from Larkin's own trumpet playing are sampled instruments. Larkin {{used a variety of}} synthesizers, samplers, and computers to create the score, working at his home studio and Cyan's offices. Larkin found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> challenge with the score was finishing it on time for the game to ship. The soundtrack was released in CD format on October 25, 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.|$|E

The first was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix might be too provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.|$|E

5|$|Although {{effects from}} Igor were {{observed}} in Bermuda for several days, relatively little rain fell, with the highest amount being 3.19in (81mm). Winds {{proved to be the}} most significant factor; sustained winds reached 91mph (146km/h) and gusts peaked at 117mph (188km/h) at an unofficial AWOS station on St. David's Lighthouse. Additionally, a storm surge of 1.75ft (0.53m) took place in St. George's, this combined with tides to produce a storm tide of over 4ft (1.22m). As the storm arrived, the island's airport was shut down earlier than originally planned due to the threat of tornadoes. Against initial fears, Igor left relatively little damage across Bermuda. The most significant impact was from downed trees and powerlines which cut power to 27,500residents. A few emergency rescues had to be made during the storm but no injuries took place. The causeway-bridge connecting St. George’s Islands to the main island of Bermuda sustained minor damage, leaving one lane closed for several days. Waves over 15ft (4.6m) battered the coast, breaking several ships from their moorings and tossing them into rocks. Officials in Bermuda stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> loss from Igor would be lessened tourism revenue following a mass exodus prior to the hurricane's arrival. Throughout the islands, damage from the storm was less than $500,000.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E

25|$|One such {{position}} is Obama's stance on health care. Obama has repeatedly {{said that he}} wants to see that every American has the option of having affordable health care as good as every U. S. Senator has. He has proposed a major overhaul of the nation’s health care system, aimed at covering the nearly 45 million uninsured Americans, reducing premium costs for everyone else, and breaking what he asserted was “the stranglehold” <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> drug and insurance companies have on the health care market.|$|E
25|$|Under Sir John Fisher, {{who served}} as First Sea Lord from 1904 to 1910, the Royal Navy {{underwent}} a period of revolutionary change. Since the autumn of 1902, Fisher had viewed Germany as Britain's principal naval enemy, and so he redistributed the Fleet such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> and most powerful ships were situated for battle against the Germans. The Home Fleet was renamed the Channel Fleet and ordered {{to remain in the}} proximity of the English Channel, while the former Channel Fleet, based at Gibraltar, was redesignated the Atlantic Fleet. Four battleships transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet and five from China enlarged the Channel Fleet to 17 battleships, while the eight battleships of the Atlantic Fleet could move north toward the British Isles or east into the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

25|$|Another {{concern is}} the rate of uninsured people in the US. In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being {{conducted}} a survey {{and found that the}} uninsured rate is going down. 13 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> drop in the uninsured rate (3 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year.|$|E

Azubuike was named to the 2005 SEC All-Tournament Team after averaging 18.0 points in three contests. During his time with the organization, Azubuike helped the Wildcats to earn two Southeastern Conference titles, two SEC Tournament titles, and two NCAA Elite Eight appearances. Azubuike averaged 10.0 points and 3.7 rebounds in 97 career games at the University of Kentucky, shooting a 48.5% field goal average for his college career.

There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has an idea and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, he cuts the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.|$|E
