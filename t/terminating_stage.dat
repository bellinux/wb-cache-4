40|$|Coagulation process {{proceeds}} on cultured human mesangial cells via {{expression of}} factor V. BackgroundIn a previous clinicopathological study, we observed mesangial factor V expression {{accompanied by the}} intact form of cross-linked fibrin deposition in the active type of IgA nephropathy. The conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by factor Xa is potently accelerated more than 104 -fold {{by the presence of}} factor V, which is a membrane-bound cofactor. Another membrane-bound cofactor, tissue factor, is known to play an initiating role in the coagulation cascade and to be synthesized in mesangial cells (MCs) by the stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). However, the synthesis of factor V, which plays on the <b>terminating</b> <b>stage</b> of prothrombin activation, has not been reported previously in MCs by in vitro study. Our current study tested the coagulation process via expression of factor V by the stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, in cultured human MCs. MethodsTo evaluate factor V protein expression, immunoperoxidase staining with densitometric evaluation and Western blot analysis were conducted after stimulation of TNF-α. To test factor V activity, stimulated MCs were incubated in combination with factor Xa, prothrombin, fibrinogen and factor XIII, and fibrin production on MCs was assessed after immunoperoxidase staining on the cell surface. In a blocking test using an antibody against factor V, suppression of fibrin production was evaluated to clarify the role of factor V activity. For the evaluation of factor V mRNA expression in cultured human MCs, in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis were performed. ResultsFactor V protein expression in MCs after TNF-α stimulation increased both time- and dose-dependently. As a marker of factor V activity with exogenous factor Xa, fibrin production on TNF-α–stimulated MCs was increased in a time-dependent manner and was inhibited by the addition of anti-factor V antibody. Factor V mRNA was identified in MCs by in situ hybridization and showed an increase after stimulation with TNF-α on Northern blot analysis. ConclusionsOur data suggest that the coagulation process proceeds on MCs as the result of increased expression of endogenous factor V activity on its cell surface in cooperation with exogenous factor Xa...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{changes in}} the UK {{insurance}} broking market {{in recent years have}} forced insurance brokers to ask: How can we retain our clients? What is the nature of our relationship with our clients? What are the key components in these relationships? How should we manage such relationships? Existing theories in the relationship marketing domain do not provide an answer to these questions. This research aims to form a framework reflecting the nature of broker-client relationship as a development process with key components influencing the quality of relationship attached to each stage of the process. Hence three research objectives are derived: 1) Form a development stage framework reflecting the nature of broker-client relationship; 2) Identify key components influencing relationship quality in each stages of the relationship; and 3) Discuss the model’s implication towards marketing practice. In this research the author takes an interpretivism-constructivist position, by bracketing the author’s value in the interview process, the interviewer (author) constructs the “reality” jointly with the interviewees (broker account executives). The qualitative approach is adopted so that the nature and meaning of broker-client relationships can be investigated in-depth. An abduction analytical approach is taken, which sits between induction and deduction, closer to an inductive perspective. The following data analysis process is then followed: organize data, immerse into data, generate categories and codes, coding data, generate themes, generate frameworks, and search for deviant cases and alternative understandings. Through the analysis of 5 in-depth qualitative interviews, the author reaches the following conclusions: A relationship typically has four stages: initiating, growing, maintaining and terminating. However, a relationship may not necessarily have all four stages, nor might it follow the same sequence. The key components affecting relationship quality in each stage of a relationship varies. In the initiating stage, the most critical components are trustworthiness, professionalism and communication. In the growing stage, they are trustworthiness, commitment, professionalism and calculative trust. In the maintaining stage, the most critical components are heuristic trust, communication, dependence, satisfaction and interaction and in the <b>terminating</b> <b>stage,</b> they are trustworthiness, professionalism and communication. The cost of maintaining a relationship increases whilst the relationship becomes closer. Customer’s expectation in a “too close” relationship can be excessively high. From the broker’s perspective, a balance must be maintained between both the total costs (the cost to the company plus social costs to the broker himself/herself) and the total benefits (benefit to the company and the broker himself/herself). The “tipping point” for the broker (the sole agent of the broker company) is the moment when such total costs overweigh total benefits. The above conclusion has three managerial implications for UK insurance brokers: 1) A relationship can be lost at any development stage of a relationship hence broker needs to be prepared to cope with such relationship. 2) Different strategy must be adopted for different stages of relationship. 3) Avoid the pitfalls of being “too close” in a relationship to keep relationship marketing efforts cost effective...|$|E

40|$|Metal cutting is a {{very common}} {{operation}} in the manufacturing industry. Drilling and other hole-making operations perhaps account for 50 % of all metal cutting, according to some investigations. All metal cutting including drilling always produces burrs, as a by-product. Actually burrs are nothing but uncut metal {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the operations. Yet, despite burr's omnipresence in drilling, comparatively, very little energy has been spent on this aspect, by way of research. Drilling burrs {{is a very}} common problem in the Swedish metal cutting industry. The problematic burrs in the industry are removed by the various deburring processes available. Deburring is both time consuming and costly. Sometimes, the cost of deburring is unacceptably high. This research project was started at the behest of the Swedish heavy engineering industry, facing such deburring problems. The main idea behind the project is, if burrs cannot be avoided, it should be possible to minimize their size. With this in mind, an extensive survey of the existing literature was carried out. Literature on all aspects of the burr problem was reviewed and analyzed. Process of burr formation was studied. Various theoretical and empirical models for the prediction of burr properties were analyzed. A comparative study of the various burr formation mechanisms and the burr prediction models was carried out. Based on simple parameter analysis, a simpler version of one of the burr prediction models was arrived at. Experimental and other results on the influence of process parameters on the size of burrs were analysed and reviewed. A comparative study of these investigations was also conducted. There are a number of techniques for reducing burr sizes. These techniques were studied, analysed and reviewed. It may be concluded from this extensive litterature survey and the comparitive study of the various investigations, that most of the reported works are rather limited in the range of parameter variables. Results of the effect of process variables on burr height and thickness are sometimes of contradictory nature, rather than being complimentary in nature. Most of the authors have studied either burr height or thickness, thereby limiting the usefulness of the results. Agreement between theoretical models and the corresponding experimental results are often of a qualitative nature. The number of parameters affecting burr properties is rather too many. Nevertheless, the following conclusions were drawn from the study. The most important parameter affecting the burr size is feedrate. Reducing the feedrate at the starting and the <b>terminating</b> <b>stages</b> of the drilling process, reduces the burr size significantly. Among the drill geometry parameters, helix angle, point angle and the chisel edge (length and angle) are the most important ones. A significant reduction in burr height and thickness should be possible by a correct selection of the feedrate, helix angle and point angle. If feedrate can be varied both up and down by some sort of adaptive control system, it may be possible to decrease both the burr size, and simultaneously increase the productivity. These conclusions also point to a need of further comprehensive research in these areas...|$|R

A new quantitative analysis model has been developed to incorporate time-dependent light scattering by a rough surface, and a time-dependent vertical growth rate during growth on a rough surface, into the virtual interface model that has previously been applied to multilayer structures with optically smooth surfaces and interfaces. It is shown that the vertical growth rate increases as the surface roughness decreases in the early stage of high-temperature GaN growth, reaching a limiting value when the surface becomes optically smooth. The time dependence of growth rate is correlated with microscopic crystal growth mechanisms on the rough surface, which involve mass transport on the facets and/or mass exchange between the growing surface and gas-phase ambient.

[...] The rectangular room was decorated with themes from Lohengrin and Parzival. [...] Its longer side is terminated by a gallery that is crowned by a tribune, modelled after the Wartburg. [...] The eastern narrow side is <b>terminated</b> by a <b>stage</b> that is structured by arcades and known as the Sängerlaube. [...] The Hall of the Singers was never designed for court festivities of the reclusive king. [...] Rather, like the Throne Hall it served as a walkable monument in which the culture of knights and courtly love of the Middle Ages was represented. [...] The first performance in this hall took place in 1933: A concert commemorating the 50th anniversary of Richard Wagner's death.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a parallel algorithm for the nonlinear optics problem of gravitational lensing. The method is a “ray-tracing” method which studies the statistical {{properties of the}} image population associated with a gravitational lens. A parallel computer is needed because the spatial resolution requirements of the problem make the program too large to run on conventional machines. The program is implemented on the Mark III hypercube to take maximum advantage of this machine’s 128 Mbytes of memory. The concurrent implementation uses a scattered domain decomposition and the CrOS III communications routines. The communications in the problem are so irregular that no completely satisfactory implementation was made {{in terms of the}} execution time of the program: the maximum speed-up relative to a sequential implementation is a factor of 4 on a 32 node machine. However, the goal of efficiently using all of the Mark III’s memory was achieved, and the execution time was not the limiting factor in the problem. If the crystal router were used, the implementation would be much more efficient. Development of the program was <b>terminated</b> at this <b>stage,</b> however, because we were able to extract the physics of interest without the more sophisticated communications routines...|$|R
