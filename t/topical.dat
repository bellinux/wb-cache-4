5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of <b>topical</b> benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a <b>topical</b> retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and <b>topical</b> retinoid, or <b>topical</b> retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a <b>topical</b> antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Frequently used <b>topical</b> retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the <b>topical</b> retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive <b>topical</b> retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other <b>topical</b> products.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>topical</b> antivirals are {{effective}} for herpes labialis, including acyclovir, penciclovir, and docosanol.|$|E
5|$|Another mercury compound, {{merbromin}} (Mercurochrome), is a <b>topical</b> antiseptic {{used for}} minor cuts and scrapes {{that is still}} in use in some countries.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as <b>topical</b> erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than <b>topical</b> antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than <b>topical</b> applications. <b>Topical</b> and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E

5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. <b>Topical</b> fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of <b>topical</b> fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} infections {{are related to}} intercourse, taking {{antibiotics}} afterwards may be useful. In post-menopausal women, <b>topical</b> vaginal estrogen {{has been found to}} reduce recurrence. As opposed to <b>topical</b> creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics. Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection. A number of vaccines are in development as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>topical</b> {{treatments}} for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause is critical, as <b>topical</b> measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is <b>topical</b> agents rather than systemic medication, with <b>topical</b> corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} aloe vera is of use in treating wounds or burns. There is no {{good evidence}} that <b>topical</b> application of aloe vera is effective for treating genital herpes or psoriasis. A 2014 Cochrane review found no strong evidence {{for the value of}} <b>topical</b> application of aloe vera to treat or prevent phlebitis caused by intravenous infusion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Topical</b> tick {{medicines}} may be {{toxic to}} animals and humans. The synthetic pyrethroid insecticide Phenothrin {{in combination with}} the hormone analogue methoprene was a popular <b>topical</b> flea and tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult ticks, while methoprene kills eggs. However, some products have been withdrawn, while others are known to cause adverse reactions.|$|E
5|$|Anaesthesia: Anaesthesia is {{supplied}} by some piercers, {{particularly in the}} United Kingdom and Europe. The anaesthesia may be <b>topical</b> or injected. Piercers and other non-medical personnel are not legally permitted to administer anaesthetics in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{as early}} as 1865 in San Francisco, Coolbrith held {{literary}} meetings at her home, hosting readings of poetry, and <b>topical</b> discussions, {{in the tradition of}} European salons. She helped writers such as Gelett Burgess and Laura Redden Searing gain wider notice.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is {{available}} as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and <b>topical</b> use (The exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not {{available as a}} generic in the USA).|$|E
5|$|DAAS {{are known}} for their aggressive, provocative style; their habit of {{involving}} audience members and their tendency to attack <b>topical</b> and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy.|$|E
5|$|Drug-induced {{psoriasis}} {{may occur}} with beta blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering drugs, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (<b>topical</b> steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Forging {{banknotes}} was a <b>topical</b> crime at the time, {{while the}} idea of villains using superstition to hide their lair was a common trope, one that Hergé had used previously in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} used for herbal remedies, with {{well-established}} emollient and astringent properties. Mullein remedies are especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in <b>topical</b> applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant has also been used to make dyes and torches.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line <b>topical</b> antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. <b>Topical</b> dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the <b>topical</b> antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes.|$|E
5|$|Recommended therapies for {{first-line}} use in acne vulgaris treatment include <b>topical</b> retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and <b>topical</b> or oral antibiotics. Procedures such {{as light}} therapy and laser therapy {{are not considered}} to be first-line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role due to their high cost and limited evidence of efficacy. Medications for acne work by targeting the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; improvement in the appearance of acne is typically expected between six and eight weeks after starting therapy.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and <b>topical</b> analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. <b>Topical</b> creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|<b>Topical</b> {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. <b>Topical</b> and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Topical</b> {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other <b>topical</b> antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the <b>topical</b> use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
5|$|<b>Topical</b> {{preparations}} of zinc {{include those}} {{used on the}} skin, often {{in the form of}} zinc oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against sunburn in the summer and windburn in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (perineum) with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper rash.|$|E

5|$|After {{the riot}} in Chicago and the {{subsequent}} trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to <b>topical</b> songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, <b>topical</b> retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of <b>topical</b> retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the <b>topical</b> retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to insert a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not be}} as effective. <b>Topical</b> medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|At {{least ten}} editions or {{translations}} {{of the book}} appeared before Raspe's death in 1794. Translations of the book into French, Spanish, and German were published in 1786. The text reached the United States in 1805, expanded to include American <b>topical</b> satire by an anonymous Federalist writer, probably Thomas Green Fessenden.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{primarily}} to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. <b>Topical</b> application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E
5|$|Evidence is {{insufficient}} to support use {{of many of these}} compounds, including echinacea, eleuthero, L-lysine, zinc, monolaurin bee products, and aloe vera. While a number of small studies show possible benefit from monolaurin, L-lysine, aspirin, lemon balm, <b>topical</b> zinc, or licorice root cream in treatment, these preliminary studies have not been confirmed by higher-quality randomized controlled studies.|$|E
5|$|Hamm {{acknowledged}} {{science fiction}} was a niche genre {{when the original}} film was made, and that it used science fiction to make <b>topical</b> issues more approachable. Hamm had the same feelings for this remake. Originally, Hamm's character was French and named Michel. Although he is interested in math and science, Hamm found his technical dialogue difficult and had to film his lines repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the parody of King Leopold II, Méliès's scenario for the film features another <b>topical</b> element: the scene with the tar wagon {{is based on the}} experiments of Ernest Guglielminetti, who spread tar over {{a small part of the}} gravel road to Monaco. This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, <b>topical,</b> transdermal, parenteral, rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak but they may reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E
