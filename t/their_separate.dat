They take menial jobs: Kurt works in a slaughterhouse as a supervisor, for instance; and the narrator translates German manuals in a factory. A fifth member, Tereza, befriends the narrator even as {{it becomes clear that}} she is acting partly on Pjele's orders.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1871, the {{impresario}} John Hollingshead commissioned Sullivan to {{work with}} W. S. Gilbert to create the burlesque-style comic opera Thespis for the Gaiety Theatre. Played as a Christmas entertainment, it ran through to Easter 1872, a good run for such a piece. After Thespis, Gilbert and Sullivan went <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late 1874 and early 1875.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} 15-month probes, {{conducted}} by the U.S. Army inspector general's office and Seoul's Defense Ministry, interrogators interviewed or obtained statements from some 200 U.S. veterans and 75 Koreans. The Army researchers reviewed 1 million pages of U.S. archival documents. The final weeks were marked by press reports from Seoul of sharp disputes between the U.S. and Korean teams. On January 11, 2001, the two governments issued <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> reports.|$|E

5|$|After Shinzaemon dies, Shinrokurō wanders {{through the}} carnage. He meets the hunter Koyata, {{who has made}} a miraculous {{recovery}} after being stabbed in the neck by Naritsugu. The two then make <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ways out of the town. An epilogue states that the Shogun and his government covered up what really occurred, announcing that Naritsugu died of illness on the journey back to his lands. Twenty-three years later, the Tokugawa Shogunate would be overthrown with the Meiji Restoration.|$|E

40|$|Canon 702 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, apparently, embodies two {{ambivalent}} norms. The {{first paragraph}} enunciates that a religious who is legitimately {{separated from his}} or her institute cannot make any claim for services rendered while he or {{she was a member of}} the institute. The second paragraph urges religious institutes to show equity and evangelical charity towards <b>their</b> <b>separated</b> members. Separation, therefore, engenders practical consequences to a former member as well as to the religious institute. Our study presents an overview of the Church's teaching on religious life, particularly in the light of the Second Vatican Council, in order to explain the rationale behind the principles established in canon 702. The issue of charitable subsidy to ex-religious as legislated in the 1917 Code and the role of the dowry of religious women that was meant to help ex-religious in the past are considered. The evolution of canon 702 and the concepts of "equity" and "evangelical charity" are discussed. This is followed by an analysis of the practical application of canon 702, § 2 by some institutes in Europe and North America. Since our study focuses on institutes in Nigeria, we directed our attention on the application of canon 702, § 2 by the institutes in Nigeria. Our study reveals that while some of the institutes in Nigeria offer some assistance to <b>their</b> <b>separated</b> members, others do not. While some take certain factors into consideration, others simply give a uniform assistance to all separating members. Religious institutes in Nigeria do not have enough funds to extend reasonable assistance to <b>their</b> <b>separated</b> members. Consequently, former members of religious institutes in Nigeria encounter more problems than their counterparts in Europe and North America. Their problems are compounded by the peculiar socio-cultural expectations that are not experienced by their counterparts elsewhere. Our study concludes by making several important suggestions that are aimed at enabling institutes in Nigeria to extend equitable and charitable assistance to <b>their</b> <b>separated</b> members in accord with the peculiar situation in Nigeria...|$|R
5|$|After a {{difficult}} {{leg of the}} tour in Japan, where {{some members of the}} band had difficulty obtaining heroin, Thin Lizzy played their final UK concert before their break-up at the Reading Festival on 28 August 1983, which was eventually released in 1992 as their BBC Radio One Live in Concert album. The last concert came in Nuremberg on 4 September, at the Monsters of Rock festival, after which the band members went <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ways.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing the}} title, Edge and Mysterio went <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ways {{to focus on}} their singles careers. Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match on January 19, 2003, where he had three {{eliminations}} before getting eliminated by Chris Jericho. Edge then teamed up with Chris Benoit, facing Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Charlie Haas, and Shelton Benjamin) {{in a series of}} singles and tag team matches. Prior to No Way Out, Edge suffered a legitimate neck injury, rendering him unable to compete in his scheduled match. At the event on February 23, Edge was written off television through a backstage attack. He then underwent surgery with Dr. Lloyd Youngblood and was sidelined for over a year.|$|E

5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave.

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1999, Weezer had once again gone <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from {{contact with the outside}} world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, {{under its}} {{conductor}} Wilhelm Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall. These, and later concerts {{by the same}} orchestra in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the comparatively poor standards of London orchestras. Both the BBC and Sir Thomas Beecham had ambitions to bring London's orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between the BBC and Beecham, they went <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ways; the BBC established the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult, and Beecham, together with Malcolm Sargent, founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Hill was {{interview}}ed by Ultrasport.

5|$|International {{airports}} have {{commercial relationships}} with and {{provide services to}} airlines and passengers from around the world. Many also serve as hubs, or places where non-direct flights may land and passengers may switch planes, while others serve primarily direct point-to-point flights.

An airport specializing in point-to-point transit can have international and domestic terminals, each in <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> building equipped with separate baggage handling facilities.

5|$|Since {{real time}} conversations are impossible, the humans send {{sections}} of the expedition's library. After reading an astronomy article, a cheela realizes that the supernova half a million human years ago created both their races. Many cheela generations later, {{but only a few}} hours for humans, cheelas develop gravity manipulation. A few generations later, a cheela spacecraft visits the human one. Although they still need extreme gravity fields to survive, the cheela can now control them precisely enough for both races to see each other face-to-face in safety. The cheela have decided that transferring their technologies, now far advanced of humans', would stunt humanity's development. However the cheela leave clues in several challenging locations, before going <b>their</b> <b>separate</b> ways.|$|E
