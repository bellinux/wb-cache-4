5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing {{with one of}} the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.|$|E

25|$|A perfect crystal is one {{in which}} the {{internal}} lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three (not usually orthogonal) axes. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For substances that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and graphite for carbon, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of chemical degeneracy. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at T=0 even though each is perfectly ordered.|$|E

500|$|Millett disputed diagnoses and labels like manic {{depression}} (bipolar disorder) and schizophrenia, {{which she}} claimed are placed upon people who exhibit socially unacceptable behavior. [...] "Many healthy people, she said, are 'driven to mental illness' by society's disapproval {{and by the}} 'authoritarian institution of psychiatry.' She attributed her own depression to her diagnosis, {{and not the other}} way around, writing, [...] "When you have been told that your mind is unsound, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of despair that takes over". Millett documented her experiences in the book The Loony Bin Trip (1990).|$|E
500|$|Millett's {{involvement}} with psychiatry {{caused her to}} attempt suicide several times due to both damaging physical and emotional effects {{but also because of}} the slanderous nature of psychiatric labeling that effected her reputation and threatened her very existence in the world. She believed that her depression was due to grief and feeling broken. She said, [...] "When you have been told that your mind is unsound, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of despair that takes over..." [...] In The Loony Bin Trip, Millett wrote that she dreaded her depressed periods: ...|$|E
500|$|A bird-beaked {{member of}} the Green Lantern Corps who teaches Hal Jordan how to use his cosmic powers. Rush stated he was not {{initially}} familiar with Green Lantern but {{was drawn to the}} part after seeing the concept art explaining, [...] "When I got the offer for it I said, ‘Haven’t they made that film?’ They said, ‘No, it’s a completely computer-generated character.’ I saw the artwork and I said, I would love to be that guy. Because I had voiced an owl in [...] and I’d voiced a pelican in Finding Nemo and I thought I could really improve on that now by being half-bird, half-fish, part lizard. You don’t get to do that in a live-action film." [...] Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure, [...] "You could say that I’ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as [...] Walsingham, and [...] Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan, and I was sort of mentoring King George VI in The King's Speech. But I can’t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London. They’re all very different people to me, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of theme I suppose".|$|E

2500|$|Ivorian hip hop {{became a}} {{mainstream}} {{part of the}} popular music of Côte d'Ivoire {{beginning in the late}} 1990s, and has been fused with many of the country's native styles, such as zouglou. Some time later, the scene gained more publicity with the rise of a publicly feuding pair of crew leaders, Stezo of the Flotte Imperiale and Almighty of the Ministère Authentik. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of gangsta rap-influenced Ivorian hip hop called rap dogba, inspired by Angelo & les Dogbas.

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, however, {{had a more}} {{positive}} response to the film and awarded it {{three out of four}} stars, writing, [...] "That the movie works is because of the considerable production qualities and the charisma of the actors, who bring more interest to the characters than they deserve. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of direct, unadorned conviction to the acting of Clive Owen and the others; raised on Shakespeare, trained for swordfights, with an idea of Arthurian legend in their heads since childhood, they don't seem out of time and place like the cast of Troy.

2500|$|The Archbishop of Cologne's {{forces were}} wiped out {{by the forces of}} the count of Berg who were {{supported}} by citizens and farmers of Cologne and Düsseldorf, paving the way for Düsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of Düsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschläger) represents the story and every year the Düsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and Düsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.|$|E

2500|$|These traits come to {{the fore}} in Hi, Mom!s [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{sequence}}. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of Brechtian distanciation: [...] "First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In Hi, Mom! for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching {{at the same time that}} you are emotionally involved with it." ...|$|E

Yung said about her character: [...] "Jinx wants to fight and she has an objective, and she’s fiery [...] Whoever is in her way is not a problem to her, she’s so focused and she just wants to get straight to the point. And with Snake Eyes, he’s such a strong inspiration for Jinx. We trained in the same dojo and he’s become an icon, he’s a role model. He’s Snake Eyes, he’s the coolest, he’s the best, and Jinx wants to compete with him, you know? In the test that they have in the beginning she wants to win and she wants to prove that she wants to be better, or at least as good as him. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of a brother and sister relationship that we tried to instill during the film." ...|$|E

Summers {{resigned}} as Harvard's president {{in the wake of}} a no-confidence vote by Harvard faculty, which resulted in large part from Summers's conflict with Cornel West, financial conflict of interest questions regarding his relationship with Andrei Shleifer, and a 2005 speech in which he suggested that the under-representation of women in science and engineering could be due to a [...] "different availability of aptitude at the high end", and less to patterns of discrimination and socialization. Remarking upon political correctness in institutions of higher education, Summers said in 2016, [...] "There is a great deal of absurd political correctness. Now, I’m somebody who believes very strongly in diversity, who resists racism in all of its many incarnations, who thinks that there is a great deal that’s unjust in American society that needs to be combated, but it seems to be that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of creeping totalitarianism in terms of what kind of ideas are acceptable and are debatable on college campuses." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Rediff listed {{her as the}} ninth-greatest Indian actress of all time, noting, [...] "It's {{hard not}} to be bowled over by Rekha's longevity, or her ability to reinvent herself... the actress took on a man's job and did it stunningly well, holding her own against all the top actors and being remembered despite them." [...] Filmfare {{described}} her acting style, writing, [...] "...when it comes to style, sexiness or sheer onscreen presence, she's unparalleled... a fierce, raw, flinty performer with unbridled honesty. Her acting isn't gimmicky." [...] Critic Khalid Mohamed commends her technical control: [...] "She knows how to give and to what degree. She has all that {{it takes to be a}} director. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of vulnerability in her control. She explores when she is acting." [...] Shyam Benegal, who directed her in two movies, believes she is [...] "a director's actress". M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune wrote, [...] "Rekha's flowering as an actress post Ghar and Khubsoorat climaxed in [...] Umrao Jaan. As a tragic courtesan she gave a performance of consummate artistry, adopting a much-admired huskiness and despondency of tone. Rekha communicated much with a delicately raised eyebrow. In 2010, Filmfare included two of her performances—from Khubsoorat (1980) and Umrao Jaan (1981)—in their list of [...] "80 Iconic Performances". Her work in the latter was included on Forbes Indias list of [...] "25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema".|$|E
