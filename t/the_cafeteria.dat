He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E

New parking areas were planned and St. Mary's Hall was to be demolished.|$|E

5|$|Power outages {{began in}} some neighborhoods at 6:30p.m. AST (2230 UTC) August 16, over 12hours {{before the storm}} arrived, and quickly spread over the entire island. The night saw heavy rains, 4cm (1.58inches) at Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 80knots (90mph, 145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and fell through {{the roof of the}} emergency room. A section of <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> also lost its roof, but no one was injured in either incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Stargate Command (SGC) base was {{supposed}} to match the real Cheyenne Mountain complex as much as possible. The set had to be twice as high for shooting as the 22 feet tall Stargate prop, but one of Hudolin's original plans of a three-level SGC set was rejected {{in favor of a}} two-level set. The gateroom was the biggest room on set and could be redesigned for other scenes. Two multi-purpose rooms were frequently redecorated into the infirmary, Daniel's lab, <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> or the gym. The SGC set and all other sets from the pilot episode were constructed within six weeks in January and February 1997, incorporating some original set pieces from the feature film.|$|E
5|$|While {{meeting in}} <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> {{the study group}} reveal their plans for Christmas. Some are {{spending}} time away, disappointing Abed (Danny Pudi), who had wished to spend the holidays with the group, even renting the critically reviled Inspector Spacetime holiday special to watch with them. Their conversation is interrupted by a performance by the obnoxious Greendale glee club. Midway through, Chang (Ken Jeong) stops them with a cease and desist order from ASCAP—tipped off by Jeff (Joel McHale)—for performing copyrighted music without permission. The glee club members suffer a nervous breakdown and are taken to the hospital.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Winger, a disbarred lawyer, has {{enrolled}} at Greendale Community College {{as a condition}} for getting his license back. His plan is to use his friendship with Dr. Ian Duncan to obtain test answers. In <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> Jeff meets the attractive Britta, and (in an attempt to get closer to her) convinces her to join his non-existent Spanish study group. As the study group convenes, Jeff pretends the other members simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited Abed to join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave, and then gets called to the football field by Dr. Duncan. The professor makes a futile attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience, and eventually agrees to provide the answers. Jeff returns to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce and Annie. Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to focus}} on {{research}} problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. He read the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and attempted unsuccessfully {{to use them to}} formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> bombs {{failed to}} explode, Harris and Klebold convened {{and walked toward}} the school. Both armed, they {{climbed to the top of}} the outdoor west {{entrance}} steps, placing them on a level with the athletic fields west of the building and the library inside the west entrance, directly above <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria.</b> From this vantage point, the cafeteria's west entrance was located at the bottom of the staircase, next to the senior parking lot.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} whether the selection of products in <b>the</b> school <b>cafeterias</b> in Uppsala county high schools' comply with NFA's (National Food Administration) recommendations. Furthermore, the intention was to examine pupils´ eating habits {{before and during the}} school day, and their views on the school cafeteria´s selection of products. To investigate this, an inventory of school cafeterias in six high schools in Uppsala County, and a survey among 60 pupils were carried out. The results showed that the NFA's recommendations not always were followed. The survey showed that there were healthy products in <b>the</b> <b>cafeterias</b> but unhealthy products nevertheless constituted {{a large part of the}} selection. Majority of the pupils reported that they used <b>the</b> school <b>cafeteria</b> on a weekly basis and that they mainly bought candy, cakes, sweetened drinks and sandwiches. Most pupils reported they ate breakfast more than 5 times per week, and that they ate lunch at school 3 - 5 times per week. Majority of students reported they never replaced the school lunch with products of the school cafeteria´s selection. Most of the pupils thought that the selection of <b>the</b> school <b>cafeterias</b> satisfied their needs. If the pupils would be able to change something in the selection of <b>the</b> school <b>cafeterias</b> <b>the</b> majority desired more healthy products. Good eating habits are established in childhood and adolescence and are important for the public health. Young people spend much of their daily lives at school. The school plays an important role in creating conditions for young people to choose good and healthy eating habits. This survey shows that the selection of <b>the</b> school <b>cafeterias</b> has importance to young people's choice of healthy eating...|$|R

25|$|Lanier's campus {{has been}} {{expanded}} numerous times {{since it was}} first built. The most notable expansion was {{the addition of the}} area of the building housing <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> and gymnasium. This expansion has resulted in some quirks in the building that are still visible today, most notably a door leading to stairs to the basement that is only half-exposed above the floor of the hallway. These stairs are no longer in service, though the door can be opened even though it's blocked by the hallway floor. Students aren't allowed to open the door and/or go down those stairs. Prior to this expansion, <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria</b> was located where the library is today, on the third floor. A dumbwaiter, located where the elevator is today, carried food to <b>the</b> <b>cafeteria.</b>|$|E
