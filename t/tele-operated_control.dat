40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Mojave Desert field test {{results of an}} improved planetary rover visual motion estimation technique for the Autonomous, Intelligent, and Robust Guidance, Navigation, and Control for Planetary Rovers (AIR-GNC). The main improvements include: optimal use of different features from stereo-pair images as visual landmarks, {{and the use of}} VME-based feedback to close the path tracking loop. As well, a long-range and wide FOV active 3 D sensor was used to extract long-range fixed landmarks for enabling visual motion estimation observability, and thus improving the accuracy of the VME. The field test, conducted in relevant Mars-like terrains, under dramatically changing weather and lighting conditions, shows good localization accuracy on average. Moreover, the MDA developed Enhanced IMU-corrected odometry was reliable and had good accuracy in all test locations including in loose sand dunes. These results are based on data collected during 7. 3 km of traverses, under both fully autonomous and <b>tele-operated</b> <b>control.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePerforming a {{robotized}} telemedicine act via specific networks brings forth two issues. One is {{transparency in}} order to enable the operator, e. g. the medical ultrasound specialist, to safely and precisely perform bilateral tele-operation tasks despite the long time delays inherent to the chosen communication link. To counter these effects, two strategies are combined to improve at the operator site the rendering of the interactions of the remote robotic systems with its environment (i. e. the patient), and {{the control of the}} robot's orientation. The first approach is {{the development of a new}} control architecture based on an internal model providing an anticipated value of the distant environment stiffness for any time delays; it is complemented by the development of a graphic user interface (GUI) which provides the expert with the relative position of the haptic probe and the robot's end effector for a better <b>tele-operated</b> <b>control.</b> These combined strategies provide the expert with an improved interactive tool for a tele-diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUltrasound experts, who {{are few and}} {{not always}} on hand when needed, have now the tool and the {{possibility}} to examine patients from a distance, and thus perform a complete diagnosis without {{being in the same}} geographical position with the patient. This is possible thanks to a telemedicine system aiming to provide the possibility to examine a remote patient using a <b>tele-operated</b> <b>controlled</b> robot. In the frame of this project, different validations have been performed to show the technical performances of the teleoperated chain and the repercussions on the clinical aspect. The clinical validation is the crucial part for the validation of the overall concept of tele-echography. Thus, various specialities were investigated all throughout the project life, with the participation of different medical experts from several countries, namely France, Spain and Cyprus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, it mainly {{researches}} control arithmetic of electro-hydraulic servo system. In a <b>tele-operated</b> master-slave <b>control</b> system, a Fuzzy PD {{control strategy}} is adapted. In {{order to obtain}} real time track control to system and improve dynamic and static characteristic of system, three control parameters of PD are optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA). Experimental results are shown that the sense of force is produced on the joy stick and the operator is able to feel sensitively the reaction forces. Secondly, the novel control strategy and optimization fuzzy PD arithmetic has good track precision and improves master-slave track characteristic of displacement and force feedback characteristic. At the same time, it has rather strong self-adaptability and anti-jamming capability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicromanipulation {{systems have}} {{recently}} been receiving increased attention. Tele-operated or automated micromanipulation is a challenging task due {{to the need for}} high-frequency position or force feedback to guarantee stability. In addition, the integration of sensors within micromanipulation platforms is complex. Vision is a commonly used solution for sensing; unfortunately the update rate of the frame-based acquisition process of current available cameras can not ensure [...] at reasonable costs [...] stable automated or <b>tele-operated</b> <b>control</b> at the microscale level, where low inertia produces highly unreachable dynamic phenomena. This paper presents a novel vision-based microrobotic system combining both an asynchronous Address Event Representation (AER) silicon retina and a conventional frame-based camera. Unlike frame-based cameras, recent artificial retinas transmit their outputs as a continuous stream of asynchronous temporal events, {{in a manner similar to}} the output cells of a biological retina, enabling high update rates. This paper introduces an Event-based Iterative Closest Point algorithm to track a microgripper's position at a frequency of 4 kHz. The temporal precision of the asynchronous silicon retina is used to provide a haptic feedback to assist users during manipulation tasks, whereas the frame-based camera is used to retrieve the position of the object that must be manipulated. This paper presents the results of an experiment on tele-operating a sphere of diameter around 50 m using a piezo-electric gripper in a pick-and-place task...|$|E
40|$|The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) Telerobot Testbed is an {{integrated}} robotic testbed used to develop, implement, {{and evaluate the}} performance of advanced concepts in autonomous, tele-autonomous, and <b>tele-operated</b> <b>control</b> of robotic manipulators. Using the Telerobot Testbed, researchers demonstrated several of the capabilities and technological advances in the control and integration of robotic systems which have been under development at JPL for several years. In particular, the Telerobot Testbed was recently employed to perform a near completely automated, end-to-end, satellite grapple and repair sequence. The task of integrating existing {{as well as new}} concepts in robot control into the Telerobot Testbed has been a very difficult and timely one. Now that researchers have completed the first major milestone (i. e., the end-to-end demonstration) it is important to reflect back upon experiences and to collect the knowledge that has been gained so that improvements can be made to the existing system. It is also believed that the experiences are of value to the others in the robotics community. Therefore, the primary objective here will be to use the Telerobot Testbed as a case study to identify real problems and technological gaps which exist in the areas of robotics and in particular systems integration. Such problems have surely hindered the development of what could be reasonably called an intelligent robot. In addition to identifying such problems, researchers briefly discuss what approaches have been taken to resolve them or, in several cases, to circumvent them until better approaches can be developed...|$|E
40|$|Parallel to {{the efforts}} to develop fully {{autonomous}} robots, it is increasingly being realized that there are applications where {{it is essential to}} have a fully controlled robot and "feel" its operating conditions, i. e. telepresence. This trend {{is a result of the}} increasing efforts to address tasks where humans can perform significantly better but, due to associated hazards, distance, physical limitations and other causes, only robots can be employed to perform these tasks. Such robots need to be assisted by a human that remotely controls the operation. To address the goal of operating robots as human surrogates, the authors launched a study of mechanisms that provide mechanical feedback. For this purpose, electrorheological fluids (ERF) are being investigated for the potential application as miniature haptic devices. This family of electroactive fluids has the property of changing the viscosity during electrical stimulation. Consequently, ERF can be used to produce force feedback haptic devices for <b>tele-operated</b> <b>control</b> of medical and space robotic systems. Forces applied at the robot end-effector due to a compliant environment are reflected to the user using an ERF device where a change in the system viscosity will occur proportionally to the transmitted force. Analytical model and control algorithms are being developed taking into account the non-linearities of these type of devices. This paper will describe the concept and the developed mechanism of ERF based force feedback. The test process and the physical properties of this device will be described and the results of preliminary tests will be presented...|$|E

Since the tele-operated system uses a camera, it was decided that the automated system would also use a simple type of machine vision in its guidance...|$|R
40|$|Service robots are robots {{that are}} {{intended}} to perform tasks normally done by humans in {{an environment in which}} humans work as well. However, they are neither required to accomplish these tasks {{in the same way as}} humans nor need to look like a human being. A <b>tele-operated</b> robot is <b>controlled</b> from a distance (near or far) by a human operator. The human operator can control the robot either by joysticks or by instructions. This paper describes the design and experiment results of a tele-operated service robot, ROSE (Remotely Operated SErvice robot) [1]. ROSE was developed to perform home-care tasks. Experiments with ROSE have shown this is feasible. ROSE was controlled from a distance (8 km) by care givers to perform small tasks for elderly. The design of ROSE can be used to develop service robots for other domains, e. g. to perform security tasks, building maintenance and construction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) {{and their}} cooperative systems including Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and a Base Station (BS), which were primarily {{designed for the}} 1 st US-Asian Demonstration and Assessment on Micro-Aerial and Unmanned Ground Vehicle Technology (MAV 08). The MAVs are of coaxial design, which imparts mechanical stability both outdoor and indoor while obeying a 30 cm size constraint. They have carbon fibre frames for weight reduction allowing microcontrollers and various sensors to be mounted on-board for <b>tele-operated</b> and waypoint <b>control.</b> The UGVs are similarly equipped to perform their own search and tracking mission but also to support the MAVs by relaying data between the MAVs and the BS when {{they are out of}} direct range. The BS monitors the vehicles and their environment and navigates them autonomously or with humans in the loop through the developed GUI. The ability of the MAV in flight was demonstrated by showing continuous hovering. The efficacy of the overall system was validated by autonomously controlling two UGVs for cooperative search. 139 1...|$|R
5000|$|Dean Kamen, Founder of FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), {{created the}} worlds leading high school {{robotics}} competition in 1992. FIRST provides a varsity-like competitive forum that inspires in young people, {{their schools and}} communities in an appreciation of science and technology. This robotics competition is a multinational competition that teams professionals and young people to solve an engineering design problem in an intense and competitive way. In 2007 (after 15th FRC season), there were over 130,000 students and 37,000 adult mentors {{from around the world}} involved in at least one of FIRSTs competitions. In 2011(the 20th FRC season, FIRST had over 294,000 students, 26,900 teams, 24,300 robots, 51,000 mentors/coaches, 50,000 other Volunteers (e.g. events Volunteers, Operational and Affiliate Partners) and nearly $15 million in college scholarships. FIRST encourages teams to find adults from outside of the school environment who can pass on their knowledge as mentors. There are thousands of scholarships available to students who participate. The FLL robots are entirely autonomous; the FTC competition involves separate autonomous and driver control matches; and the FRC competition involves an initial autonomous period (10 or 15 seconds) followed by <b>tele-operated</b> driver <b>control.</b> On August 14, 2011, ABC aired a special on FIRST called [...] "i.am FIRST: Science is Rock and Roll" [...] that featured many famous musical artists such as The Black Eyed Peas and Willow Smith. will.i.am himself was the executive producer of the special. The program placed a special focus on the FIRST Robotics competition, even though it included segments on the FIRST Tech Challenge, FIRST Lego League, and Junior FIRST Lego League. Kealakehe Robotics was one of the teams at the event for the ABC piece.|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported a non-invasive, transperineal, urodynamic technique using Doppler ultrasonography. Recently, {{we developed a}} new <b>tele-operating</b> system to <b>control</b> the robotic arm of the ultrasound probe that has a pressure-regulating function and a touch-panel that allows the operator to monitor the exact position of the probe. From January 2008 to April 2010, 61 cases were examined using this system. Among them, 41 cases were examined by 2 experienced doctors and 20 cases were examined by 5 inexperienced nurses. We then compared the success rate of taking images sufficient for analyzing the velocity parameters and preparation time for setup between these two groups. In 45 out of 61 cases, whose examinations were successfully carried out, the velocity-flow parameters were compared between 19 cases with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and 26 without BOO. Satisfactory images were obtained in 32 cases (78 %) by doctors and in 13 cases (65 %) by nurses. The preparation time was 9. 8 seconds for doctors and 13. 2 seconds for nurses, with no statistical difference. The functional cross-sectional area in the prostatic urethra (A 1) was significantly smaller in the BOO(+) group (0. 056 ?) compared to the BOO(-) group (0. 360 ?). The velocity ratio (VR) was significantly higher in the BOO(+) group (1. 89) than in the BOO(-) group (0. 41). In conclusion, the newly developed tele-operating system has {{made it easier for}} an inexperienced examiner to obtain velocity parameters using Doppler ultrasound urodynamic measurement...|$|R
