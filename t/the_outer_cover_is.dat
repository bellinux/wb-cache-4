50|$|Volumes 1 to 8 were C-60 (60 minute) tapes, {{with a cover}} {{price of}} ₤1.00. The {{remaining}} volumes, including The Noise Collective, were C-90 with a cover price of ₤1.50. Volumes 1 to 9 used a fold-out insert (shown at the right), while volume 10 had a cardboard insert separate from the track list and contacts sheet. Starting with volume 11 (and including The Noise Collective), <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> <b>was</b> a cardboard sleeve wrapped around the plastic jewel case.|$|R
2500|$|Vinyl records can be warped by heat, {{improper}} storage, {{exposure to}} sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap {{on the album}} cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for {{it was part of}} the art of turntable and tonearm design. [...] "Wow" [...] (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> cardboard <b>cover</b> so that the opening <b>was</b> entirely within <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover,</b> <b>was</b> said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.|$|R
50|$|In April 1920, <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} and by June {{the ship was}} finished. On 19 July, the ship emerged from its shed for its first flight. The ship was damaged on the trial flight as the ship had not been properly ballasted, and the lifting gas heated causing the ship to rise too fast. The result was extensive buckling of the framework. The ship was returned to its shed to be repaired, which took until January 1921. After further test flights the airship flew to the airship station at Howden, East Yorkshire in February where it was used for training the United States personnel who would crew the R38 (ZR-2). The US Navy made 4 flights in the ship totalling some 8 hours 45 minutes between 26 March 1921 and 1 June 1921.|$|R
50|$|The {{guillotine}} {{cutting process}} dulls the blade over time, requiring {{that it be}} resharpened. Coated paper such as slick magazine paper dulls the blade more quickly than plain book paper, due to the kaolinite clay coating. Additionally, removing the binding of an entire hardcover book causes excessive wear due to cutting through the cover's stiff backing material. Instead <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> can <b>be</b> removed and only interior pages need be cut.|$|R
40|$|A {{thruster}} nozzle {{sealing system}} and apparatus is provided for protection of spacecraft thruster motors. The system includes a sealing plug, a sealing plug insertion tool, an <b>outer</b> <b>cover,</b> an <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> attachment, and a ferry flight attachment. The sealing plug prevents moisture {{from entering the}} thruster engine so as to prevent valve failure. The attachments are interchangeably connectable with the sealing plug. The ferry flight attachment is used during air transportation of the spacecraft, and <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> attachment <b>is</b> used during storage and service of <b>the</b> spacecraft. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> provides protection to the thruster nozzle from mechanical damage...|$|R
50|$|Also {{included}} in the Box Set was a comic book by Mr. Monster creator Michael T. Gilbert (with four uncredited pages by Sean Wyett, who also illustrated Danzig for the back cover of the Misfits' Legacy of Brutality), and a 32-page booklet of photographs and reprinted lyrics to Discs One and Three. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> box <b>cover</b> <b>was</b> painted by Martin Emond, who had done artwork for several other products from singer Glenn Danzig's post-Samhain band, Danzig.|$|R

50|$|The elastic rope {{first used}} in bungee jumping, and still {{used by many}} {{commercial}} operators, is factory-produced braided shock cord. This special bungee cord consists of many latex strands enclosed in a tough <b>outer</b> <b>cover.</b> <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> may <b>be</b> applied when the latex is pre-stressed, so that the cord's resistance to extension is already significant at the cord's natural length. This gives a harder, sharper bounce. The braided cover also provides significant durability benefits. Other operators, including A. J. Hackett and most southern-hemisphere operators, use unbraided cords with exposed latex strands. These give a softer, longer bounce and can be home-produced.|$|R
25|$|Octagonal tombs {{were never}} used for emperors, but were {{commonly}} employed for burial of high-ranking noblemen such as Asif Khan. The {{floor of the}} platform on which the tomb stands was built with Sang-e Abri, or red limestone, while <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> walls <b>were</b> <b>covered</b> with red sandstone.|$|R
50|$|Franck Monnier {{and others}} believe the pyramid {{not to have}} {{collapsed}} until the New Kingdom, {{but there are a}} number of facts contradicting this theory. The Meidum Pyramid seems never to have been completed. Beginning with Sneferu and to the 12th dynasty all pyramids had a valley temple, which is missing at Meidum. The mortuary temple, which was found under the rubble at the base of the pyramid, apparently never was finished. Walls were only partly polished. Two Steles inside, usually bearing the names of the pharaoh, are missing inscriptions. The burial chamber inside the pyramid itself is uncompleted, with raw walls and wooden supports still in place which are usually removed after construction. Affiliated mastabas were never used or completed and none of the usual burials have been found. Finally, the first examinations of the Meidum Pyramid found everything below the surface of the rubble mound fully intact. Stones from <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> <b>were</b> stolen only after they were exposed by the excavations. This makes a catastrophic collapse more probable than a gradual one. The collapse of this pyramid during the reign of Sneferu is the likely reason for the change from 54 to 43 degrees of his second pyramid at Dahshur, the Bent Pyramid.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was built}} to a Russian Revival design by Yevgeny Yermakov between 1905 and 1912. The {{building}} is pentacupolar, with the massive black central dome and the four tent-like domes on the corners, as well as low galleries which run continuously around <b>the</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> walls <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> with a mazy web of tracery.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>outer</b> circuit <b>was</b> <b>covered,</b> as a lean-to, {{all round}} his inner, apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty two angles {{to the top}} posts of the inner house, being about twenty feet distant; {{so that there was}} a space like a walk within <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> wicker wall, and without the inner, near twenty feet wide.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 September 1980, {{the band}} recorded, pressed and {{distributed}} {{a new album}} (Toots Live) to the record shops all {{in the space of}} 24 hours in an attempt to make the Guinness Book of World Records. A live concert was recorded on reels of 2-inch, 24-track analog tape, then rushed by van to sound engineers. After a running order was determined, the record label was quickly designed and sent to the printers. The album masters, labels and <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>covers</b> <b>were</b> then separately sped to the Gedmel factory near Leicester, and the finished product was assembled and delivered to Coventry, where the band was playing the next day, successfully meeting the 24-hour deadline. Due to record label oversight, the achievement was not successfully registered with the Guinness Book of World Records. Island Records' Rob Bell was quoted as saying, [...] "Unfortunately, the record {{was not included in the}} Guinness book, because they required prior notification that the event was going to take place, and no one at Island had informed them of the project!" [...] The record for [...] "fastest album release" [...] was not officially held in the Guinness Book of World Records until 28 years later when Vollgas Kompanie claimed the honor in 2008 for recording and releasing their album [...] "Live" [...] in 24 hours - matching the time interval in which Toots and the Maytals recorded, pressed and distributedToots Live in 1980.|$|R
50|$|In appearance, N. anomala {{resembles a}} cockle or limpet {{with a low}} conical, oval shell up to fifteen millimetres long. The upper valve is the only part visible as the lower valve is {{cemented}} to the rock beneath. The shell surface is smooth, white, buff or pale grey and has fine concentric lines. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> surface <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> by a thin brown periostracum.|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} isolated {{location of}} this crater serves to highlight its well-formed shape. Bullialdus {{has a high}} outer rim that is circular but observers have noted a slightly polygonal appearance. The inner walls are terraced and contain many signs of landslips. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> s <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> in a wide ejecta blanket that highlights a radial pattern of low ridges and valleys.|$|R
50|$|The Colonnade is a marble-clad {{structure}} {{surrounded by}} an esplanade, itself surrounded by marble-clad parapets. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> side <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> with 19 high relief sculptures by National Artist Napoleon Abueva, and alternates depictions of the war with 18 bronze insignia of USAFFE Division units by Talleres de Maximo Vicente, Leonides Valdez, and Angel Sampra and Sons. Each bronze insignia has a flagstaff for the flags of each division.|$|R
50|$|Cleavage tops {{incorporate}} {{a pair of}} breast prostheses in a one-piece skin coloured garment {{that is designed to}} provide the illusion of natural cleavage. Such garments have the disadvantage of having a visible top edge at the neck, which requires the wearing of a choker or similar necklace to hide the top edge of the garment. The edges of the breast prostheses are often distinguishable through <b>the</b> thin <b>outer</b> <b>cover.</b> They <b>are</b> usually made from either latex or silicone and most often are made to measure. These prosthetics are marketed to people who cross-dress.|$|R
500|$|M. rugustus – {{the type}} oospecies, these eggs {{are found in}} Nanxiong and Jiangxi in south China; it is also common in the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia and the Manrakskaya Svita in Kazakhstan. It ranges in size from [...] long by [...] across. Its eggshell is [...] thick, about 1/4 {{of which is the}} mammillary layer. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> surface <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> with {{irregular}} chains of nodes (ramotuberculate ornamentation) around <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> center of <b>the</b> egg, transitioning to a more pitted, netlike pattern (sagenotuberculate) at the ends.|$|R
40|$|Tension-Leg Platforms (TLPs) are {{commonly}} preferred offshore structures for the deep-water oil exploration. Their reduced {{response to the}} encountered waves is achieved by their compliancy. This innovative structural design dampens the vertical motion (heave) of the platform but the large horizontal movements (surge, sway and yaw motion) cause inconvenience to the people on board, though the platform remains stable for the operational sea state. Coastal and offshore structures are constructed with the protective perforated layers mainly to reduce the direct impact caused by the waves. Present study highlights the detailed experimental investigations carried out on the scaled model of the TLP with the perforated members under regular waves. Based on the experimental investigations, it is seen {{that there is a}} significant reduction in the dynamic response of the TLP with the perforated columns. Encompassing column members with <b>the</b> perforated <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> <b>is</b> seen as one of the effective method of retrofitting offshore structures to improve their serviceability...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> <b>was</b> also giving {{cause for}} concern. An {{inspection}} by Michael Rope and J. W. W. Dyer, {{head of the}} Fabric Section at Cardington, undertaken on 20 January 1930 revealed serious deterioration of the fabric {{on the top of}} the airship in areas where rainwater had accumulated, and a decision was made to add reinforcement bands along the whole length of the envelope. Further tests undertaken by Rope had shown that its strength had deteriorated alarmingly. The original specified strength for the <b>cover</b> <b>was</b> a breaking strain of 700 lb per foot run (10 kN/m): the actual strength of samples was at best 85 lb (1.24 kN/m). The calculated load at a speed of 76 mph was 143 lb per foot run (2.09 kN/m). A further inspection of the cover on 2 June found many small tears had developed. [...] An immediate decision was taken to replace the pre-doped cover with a new <b>cover</b> which would <b>be</b> doped after fitting. This would take place following the flights which had been planned for June with the purpose of displaying R101 to the public at the Hendon Air Show. For these flights the <b>cover</b> would <b>be</b> further reinforced. Confirmation of the poor state of the cover came on the morning of 23 June when R101 was walked out of the shed. It had been at the mast for less than an hour in a moderate wind when an alarming rippling movement was observed and shortly afterwards, a 140 ft tear appeared on the right-hand side of the airship. It was decided to repair these at the mast and to add more strengthening bands. This was done by the end of the day but the next day a second, shorter, split occurred. This was dealt with in the same way, and it was decided that if the reinforcing bands were added to the repaired area the scheduled appearance at the RAF pageant at Hendon could be made.|$|R

40|$|The egg case of {{the spider}} A. amoena is {{composed}} of multiple layers of silk, including a frame of yellow silk, an <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> with layers of gray-green, pale brown, and white silk, and an inner cover of brown silk. SEM shows <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> threads consist of six large diameter (4. 8 – 6. 8 µm) cylindrical gland monofilaments with numerous smaller diameter (0. 26 – 0. 76 µm) fibers. The number of small-diameter fibers varies with layer; it is high in outer layers and decreases in inner layers. Small diameter fibers are absent from the inner cover, which consisted entirely of fibers made with six strands of large diameter (5. 2 µm) cylindrical gland monofilaments. The chemical makeup (mole fraction of alanine, serine, and glycine) of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> strands <b>is</b> intermediate between that of inner cover silk and aciniform gland silk. These observations support Matthew's (2002) hypothesis that the small diameter fibers are produced by the aciniform glands. Spiders appear to use relatively few gland silks in varying combinations to achieve different physical, chemical (e. g. color, diameter, amino acid composition) and functional (mechanical properties, resistance, etc) characteristics in different layers of the egg case providing protections for eggs or spiderlings [Acta Zoologica Sinica 54 (5) : 918 – 927, 2008]...|$|R
40|$|The Cascaded Variable Conductance Heat Pipe Experiment, {{which was}} {{developed}} by Michael Grote of McDonnell Douglas Electronic Systems Company, was located in Tray F- 9 of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), where it received atomic oxygen almost normal to its surface. The majority of the tray <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> by aluminized Kapton polyimide multilayer insulation (MLI), which showed substantial changes from atomic oxygen erosion. Most of the outermost Kapton layer of the MLI and the polyester scrim cloth under it were lost, and there was evidence of contaminant deposition which discolored {{the edges of the}} MLI blanket. Micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MM/OD) hits caused small rips in the MLI layers, and in some cases left cloudy areas where the vapor plume caused by a hit condensed on the next layer. The MLI was bent gradually through 90 deg at the edges to enclose the experiment, and the Kapton that survived along the curved portion showed the effects of atomic oxygen erosion at oblique angles. In spite of space environment effects over the period of the LDEF mission, the MLI blanket remained functional. The results of the analysis of LDEF MLI were used in developing the standard MLI blanket for Space Station Work Package- 2 (WP- 2). This blanket is expected to last 30 years when exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment constituents of atomic oxygen and MM/OD, which are the most damaging to MLI materials. The WP- 2 standard blanket consists of an <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> made from Beta-cloth glass fiber fabric which is aluminized on the interior surface, and an inner cover of 0. 076 -mm (0. 003 -in) double-side-aluminized perforated Kapton. The inner reflector layers are 0. 0076 -mm (0. 0003 -in) double-side aluminized, perforated Kapton separated by layers of Dacron polyester fabric. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> <b>cover</b> <b>was</b> selected to be resistant to the LEO environment and durable enough to survive in orbit for 30 years. This paper describes the analyses of the LDEF MLI results, and how these results contributed to the selection of the WP- 2 MLI blanket materials and configuration...|$|R

40|$|Earlier work in {{northeast}} Greenland has suggested a limited {{advance of the}} Greenland Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).
