5|$|Ponsford {{began his}} working {{life at the}} State Savings Bank. On his return from England in 1926, the bank advised him <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> {{tolerate}} so much leave for cricket in the future. Ponsford received a lucrative offer to play for Blackpool Cricket Club, which he was inclined to accept. This news was received with dismay by Australian fans, who had earlier seen players such as Ted McDonald leave Australia and accept contracts in the professional English leagues. To keep Ponsford in Melbourne, The Herald—a local newspaper—employed him {{on the basis that}} he would remain available for all representative cricket. The new role included writing articles for the paper.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E

He alluded to the intention of its founders to ensure the university was [...] "comprehensive," [...] embracing the post-graduate departments including law, theology, medicine, etc. and the original founders ideas <b>that</b> although <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be established immediately, they would eventually [...] "as funds shall be provided for the purpose." ...|$|R

25|$|Rabbi Akiva (or {{some say}} Rabban Johanan ben Zakai) never {{said in the}} house of study {{that it was time to}} stop studying, except on the eve of Passover and the eve of the Yom Kippur. On the eve of Passover, it was because of the {{children}}, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> fall asleep, and on the eve of the Day of Atonement, it was so that they should feed their children before the fast.|$|E
25|$|Qadis (Judges) were {{appointed}} at all administrative levels {{for the administration}} of justice. The Qadis were chosen for their integrity and learning in Islamic law. High salaries were fixed for the Qadis {{so that there was}} no temptation to bribery. Wealthy men and men of high social status {{were appointed}} as Qadis so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have the temptation to take bribes, or be influenced by the social position of any body. The Qadis were not allowed to engage in trade. Judges were appointed in sufficient number, and there was no district which did not have a Qadi.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland {{the highest}} of these was the feis at Teamhair na Rí (Tara), which was held every third Samhain. This was a {{gathering}} of the leading men of the whole island – kings, lords, chieftains, druids, judges etc. Below this was the óenach (modern spelling: aonach). These were regional or provincial gatherings open to everyone. Examples include that held at Tailtin each Lughnasadh, and that held at Uisneach each Bealtaine. The main purpose of these gatherings was to promulgate and reaffirm the laws – they were read aloud in public <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be forgotten, and any changes in them carefully explained to those present.|$|E

25|$|The two pose as {{a married}} couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work {{feelings}} can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max {{an invitation to the}} party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car {{in the middle of a}} desert sandstorm, knowing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> survive. However, the mission goes well and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in Hampstead, and have a baby girl named Anna.|$|E
25|$|The Matrix had {{a strong}} effect on action film-making in Hollywood. The film's {{incorporation}} of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of The Matrix created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in X-Men (2000) and Charlie's Angels (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on Daredevil (2003). The Matrixs Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise have had.|$|E
500|$|This {{recruiting}} of cantors was {{not without}} controversy: Cantor Cuper (also known as Kupfer), the head cantor of the Great Synagogue, considered it [...] "impious" [...] that cantors should perform in a secular setting, to crowds where both sexes mingled freely, keeping people up late so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be on time for morning prayers.|$|E

50|$|The state Republicans {{held their}} {{convention}} in early September and the sentiment {{of the delegates}} heading into the convention was to mount an all-out attempt on the state offices. Led by Thomas E. Miller and other notable black leaders, <b>they</b> reasoned <b>that</b> although <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> win, it would maintain the cohesion and organization of the state party. However, {{as in the previous}} gubernatorial election, the party leaders stressed the futility of launching a statewide campaign. Nevertheless, a special committee was created to discuss the issue.|$|R
5000|$|In , Hymenaeus is {{included}} in the [...] "some" [...] who had put away faith and a good conscience and who had made shipwreck concerning faith. The apostle adds that he had delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> learn <b>not</b> to blaspheme. Some have viewed this statement as similar to 1 Corinthians 5:5, where Paul commands the church to expel a member engaging in sexual immorality, in the hopes that his spirit would eventually be saved {{as a result of this}} discipline.|$|R
500|$|... "Irreplaceable JP" [...] {{was written}} for Chrisette Michele. Production team Stargate and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo had written for Beyoncé's second album B'Day, but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have gone in the {{direction}} they did on the song. The tune did not suit Beyoncé's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, {{although it was not}} based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought it sounded like country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R western music song instead.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) becomes {{engaged to}} her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who {{strongly}} believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion. When {{the rest of}} the office thinks so as well, they must {{decide whether or not to}} tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons—not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does not think it is anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to have, before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is sorely tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but ends up smiling sweetly and wishing Angela [...] "a very happy wedding".|$|E
500|$|In her {{analysis}} of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents {{the voice of the}} children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them [...] "that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, [...] "there is a strong suggestion <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> tell her." [...] She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, [...] "the kidsand not only those in the story, but those who read ithave vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences." [...] For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated {{by the fact that the}} Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as Lenin." ...|$|E
60|$|As to {{the first}} of these, I knew the captain could not stay in town above a week, but that his ship being already full of goods, and fallen down the river, he must soon follow, so I {{contrived}} to carry my husband somewhere {{out of town for}} a few days, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be sure <b>not</b> to meet.|$|R

However, he told them that he should report their assurances to the Turkish authorities, who would, when they had a ship of war available, doubtless send down and inquire into the whole circumstances, an intimation which caused them considerable alarm, as they had no doubt that, if no worse befell them, they would be made to pay heavy fines.|$|R
5000|$|So pernicious {{were these}} teachings of {{incipient}} Gnosticism in the Christian church that, according to Paul, they quickly spread [...] "like gangrene." [...] The {{denial of the}} future resurrection of the body involved also the denial of the bodily resurrection of Christ, and even {{the fact of the}} incarnation. The way in which Paul dealt with those who taught such deadly error was by resorting to the same extreme measures as he had employed {{in the case of the}} immoral person at Corinth: he [...] "delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> learn <b>not</b> to blaspheme".|$|R
500|$|Several factors converged to make {{possible}} a twenty-cent piece in the 1870s. [...] The first was a shortage of small change in the far West, where base-metal coins did not circulate. Government payments in silver and gold had been suspended during the economic chaos caused by the civil war—coins containing precious metal were hoarded except on the Pacific Coast, and did not pass at face value in trade. Although the base-metal nickel was not widely accepted in the far West, the silver half dime had been struck in increasing numbers at the San Francisco Mint until the silver coin, which did not circulate in the East, was abolished by Congress in 1873. A shortage of small change resulted, especially as half dimes {{were used in the}} jewelry trade; customers complained they could not get full change for an item costing ten cents for which they paid with a quarter. Prices in the West were sometimes in bits (12 cents, based on the old Spanish colonial real, although those pieces no longer circulated), adding to the change problem. Numismatist David Lange states that a shipment of nickels out West could have solved everything, but <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been accepted due to the prejudice against money which did not contain precious metal.|$|E

Heleringer told his bride <b>that</b> while <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> become wealthy, life would never be dull.

C1R had not organised accommodation before their artist announcement, as is typically the case, and refused to attend the meeting of Heads of Delegation. By announcing their artist just before the deadline for entry submission to the contest and not booking a hotel, it was speculated that C1R had not intended to go due to audiences booing Russian artists in previous contests.|$|R

60|$|These Mexicans {{had evidently}} {{been at the}} well some time. Their horses being in the corral meant that grazing had been done by day. Gale {{revolved}} questions in mind.

Were they waiting for more members of their gang? That was very probable. With Gale, however, the most important consideration was how to get his horse to water.

He thought it best {{to go back to}} where he had left his horse and not make any decisive move until daylight.|$|R
