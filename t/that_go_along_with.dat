He came up with different methods for exploring densities, weight, and even gravity. Along with those methods, Biruni {{went so far as to}} describe instruments <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> each of those areas as well. Although he never entirely focuses just on physics in any of his books, the study of physics is present throughout many of his various works. Biruni also came up with different hypotheses about heat and light.|$|E
25|$|David Ervine was the {{youngest}} of five children born to Walter and Elizabeth Ervine, and raised in a Protestant working-class area of east Belfast between the Albertbridge and Newtownards roads. His household was not loyalist at all, his father Walter described himself as a socialist, had no time for Ian Paisley and didn't attend church. When Ervine joined the Orange Order aged 18, he said he was the first member of his family to ever be a member. His membership however didn't last long. Like many in his situation, he grew up closely identifying with his community and absorbed the Ulster Unionism ideals and opinions <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> this identity. He left Orangefield High School at 14, and at the age of 19 Ervine joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), believing this to {{be the only way to}} ensure the defence of the Protestant community after the events of Bloody Friday. A neighbour of Ervine's who was a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) William Irvine, had died in one of the bomb blasts on Bloody Friday.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} year of life, infants are unable to {{communicate}} with language. Instead, infants communicate with gestures. This phenomenon is known as prelinguistic gestures, which are nonverbal ways that infants communicate that also had a plan backed with the gesture. Examples of these could be pointing at an object, tugging on the shirt of a parent to get the parent's attention, etc. Harding, 1983, devised the major criteria that come along with the behavior of prelinguistic gestures and their intent to communicate. There are three major criteria <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> a prelinguistic gesture: waiting, persistence, and ultimately, development of alternative plans. This process usually occurs around 8 months of age, where an appropriate scenario may be of a child tugging on the shirt of a parent to wait for the attention of the parent who would then notice the infant, which causes the infant to point to something they desire. This would describe the first two criteria. The development of alternative plans may arise if the parent does not acknowledge what the infant wants, the infant may entertain itself to satisfy the previous desire.|$|E

500|$|After {{years of}} development, {{a feature film}} {{adaptation}} of The Green Hornet was handled by Rogen and Goldberg, with a theatrical release in January 2011. Rogen chose to do a re-imagining of the title character. He was {{executive producer of the}} movie and also cast himself as the main character. Rogen later admitted to having been overwhelmed by handling its $120million budget. [...] "It's insane. But it's not so much the specific amount of money that's stressful, it's all the things <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> making a movie of that size." [...] The actor also went on a strict weight-loss diet to play the slim crime fighter. The Green Hornet was a critical disappointment; Adam Graham of the Detroit News called it [...] "a big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie" [...] and the Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz found its story to have fallen apart. Nonetheless it still opened at number one at the box office, making $33million in its opening weekend before going on to gross more than $225million.|$|E

But he likes the box office prizes <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> his pop satires, so he makes dishonest movies like this one".

The essays focus on events, paired with food, that occurred throughout Angelou's life, from Angelou's childhood in Stamps, Arkansas, to her adolescence and young adulthood spent with her mother Vivian Baxter, to her career, which brought her fame. She impresses a prospective employer with Southern food; he tells her, [...] "If you can write half as good as you can cook, you are going to be famous".

60|$|Let me {{say with}} plainness, I who {{am no longer}} in a public character, that if by a fair, by an indulgent, by a gentlemanly {{behaviour}} to our representatives, we do not give confidence to their minds, and a liberal scope to their understandings; {{if we do not}} permit our members to act upon a VERY enlarged view of things; we shall at length infallibly degrade our national representation into a confused and scuffling bustle of local agency. When the popular member is narrowed in his ideas, and rendered timid in his proceedings, the service of the crown will be the sole nursery of statesmen. Among the frolics of the court, it may at length take that of attending to its business. Then the monopoly of mental power will be added to the power of all other kinds it possesses.

60|$|So Mrs. Sharp had {{to procure}} new clothes, {{to replace the}} linen cap, flowered frock, and leathern boots; and now, strange to say, little Caterina, who had {{suffered}} many unconscious evils in her existence of thirty moons, first began to know conscious troubles. 'Ignorance,' says Ajax, 'is a painless evil;' so, I should think, is dirt, considering the merry faces <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> it. At any rate, cleanliness is sometimes a painful good, as any one can vouch who has had his face washed the wrong way, by a pitiless hand with a gold ring on the third finger. If you, reader, have not known that initiatory anguish, it is idle to expect that you will form any approximate conception of what Caterina endured under Mrs. Sharp's new dispensation of soap-and-water. Happily, this purgatory came presently to be associated in her tiny brain with a passage straightway to a seat of bliss--the sofa in Lady Cheverel's sitting-room, where there were toys to be broken, a ride was to be had on Sir Christopher's knee, and a spaniel of resigned temper was prepared to undergo small tortures without flinching.|$|E
