The ameer of <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat is appointed for life by a central consultative council (shura) and elders of the <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat. The first ameer was Maulana (cleric) Muhammad Ilyas Kandhalawi, later succeeded by his son Maulana (cleric) Muhammad Yusuf Kandhalawi and then by Maulana (cleric) Inaam ul Hasan. After the demise of Moulana (cleric) Inaamul Hasan, a Shura (committee) was formed, who would consult and make decisions. This was to continue with senior members of the group so as to safeguard the effort of <b>tabligh</b> for the future.|$|E

5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{has also}} been criticized within Islamic circles and the major {{opposition}} in the Indian subcontinent comes from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on da'wa tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in <b>Tabligh.</b> They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of <b>Tabligh</b> and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.|$|E
5|$|An annual {{gathering}} of followers, called ijtema, is summoned at {{headquarters of the}} respective countries. A typical ijtema continues {{for three days and}} ends with an exceptionally long prayer. These gatherings are considered moments of intense blessings by <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat members and are known to attract members in excess of 2million in some countries. The oldest ijtema of the World started in Bhopal, capital city of Madhya Pradesh, India. It attracts people from all over World. Almost 2 million people gather for this annual gathering. The largest of such annual gatherings is held in Bangladesh. The Bengali gathering, called Bishwa Ijtema (World Gathering), converges followers from around the World in Tongi near Dhaka, Bangladesh, with an attendance exceeding 3million people. The second largest <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat gathering takes place in Raiwind, Pakistan which was attended by approximately 1.5million people in 2004. In 2011 Pakistan divided the Ijtema into two parts and total 1 million People attended each of the two Ijtema.|$|E
5|$|During {{their stay}} in mosques, these jamaats conduct a daily gasht, which {{involves}} visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably {{with the help}} of a guide. They invite people to attend the Maghrib prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in <b>tabligh</b> for self reformation and the propagation of Islam. Also the regular activities like eating, sleeping etc. are also carried out in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the assumed}} role of these jamaat members cycle {{in a way}} that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat members, this is {{generally}} referred to as khidmat which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements. The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's mashwara. The markaz keeps records of each jamaat and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual jamaats that voluntarily undertake preaching missions. Members of a jamaat, ideally, pay expenses themselves so as to avoid financial dependence on anyone.|$|E
5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to <b>tabligh.</b> The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|It {{keeps its}} {{distance}} from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly {{to avoid the}} disputes which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum). The emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.|$|E

500|$|... largest islamic movement, <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat {{encourages}} its {{followers to}} follow the pattern of spending [...] "three nights a month (Seh Roza),40continuous days a year (Chilla), and ultimately 120days {{at least once in}} their lives engaged in <b>tabligh</b> missions". During the course of these tours, members are generally seen dressed in simple, white, loose-clothing, carrying sleeping bags on their backs. These members use mosques as their base during this travel but particular mosques, due to more frequent tablighiyat activities, have come to be specifically associated with this organisation. These mosques generally hold the periodic, smaller scale convocations for neighbourhood members.|$|E
500|$|Like Salafists, <b>Tabligh</b> seek a [...] "separation {{in their}} daily life from the `impious` society that {{surrounded}} them". The only objective of <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat, overtly stated in most sermons, is that Muslims adopt and invite for the Islamic lifestyle, exemplified by Muhammad, in its perfection. This involves a detailed orthopraxy: [...] "followers must dress like the Prophet, sleep as he did on the ground, on one's right side"; enter bathrooms leading with the left foot, but put pants on leading with the right foot; do not use a fork when eating, instead use your index finger, middle finger and thumb; men shave their upper lips, but let their beards grow; their pants or robes should be above the ankle [...] "because the prophet said letting clothes drag {{on the ground is}} a sign of arrogance".|$|E
500|$|The {{teachings of}} <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat are {{expressed}} in [...] "Six Principles" [...] (Kalimah, Salat, Ilm, Ikraam-e-Muslim, Ikhlas-e-Niyyat, Dawat-o-Tableegh). Tablighi Jamaat believes that Muslims are {{in a constant state}} of spiritual Jihad in the sense of fight against evil, the weapon of choice is Dawah (proselytization) and that battles are won or lost in the [...] "hearts of men." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{its early}} days and in South Asia, the <b>Tabligh</b> {{movement}} aimed {{to return to}} orthodoxy and [...] "purify" [...] the Muslim religio-cultural identity of heterodox or [...] "borderline" [...] Muslims who still practised customs and religious rites connected with Hinduism. Especially to counteract the efforts of Hindu proselytising movements who targeted these often recently converts from Hinduism.|$|E
500|$|Many critics, {{especially}} those from Hizb ut-Tahrir and Jamaat-e-Islami, criticize <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, {{could have been}} helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticize the <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in [...] South Asia such as the introduction of an Islamic constitution in Pakistan (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969–1971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement (1977). The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states {{that it is only}} by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of Ayub Khan (1960s) and Indira Gandhi (1975–77), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.|$|E

500|$|They {{insist that}} the best way of {{learning}} is teaching and encouraging others, with the books prescribed by Tabligi Jamaat Movement in the light of Quran and Hadith stories of Prophets, Sahaba (Companions of Prophet) and Awlia Allah ("Friends of Allah"). [...] Even though there are publications associated with the movement, particularly by Zakariya Kandahalwi, the emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication. A collection of books, usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by <b>Tabligh</b> Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (Hayatus Sahabah, Fazail-e-Amaal, Fazail-e-Sadqaat and Muntakhab Ahadith).|$|E
