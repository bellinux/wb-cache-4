5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and <b>tossing</b> it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, <b>tossing</b> his head and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E

5|$|In 975, {{not long}} after the death of King Edgar, Oslac was banished from England. No reason is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles report of his expulsion. Version C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{describes}} the events thus:The valiant Oslac was driven from the country, over the <b>tossing</b> waves, the gannet's bath, the tumult of the waters, the homeland of the whale; a grey-haired man, wise and skilled in speech, he was bereft of his lands The historian Richard Fletcher guesses that Oslac's downfall may have been the result of opposing the succession of Edward the Martyr.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hosting the Renaissance fair, the grounds are {{opened to the}} public for a number of other events. Tours of the mansion and wine tastings are available throughout the year. Each June, the site is used for the Celtic Fling and Highland Games. The Fling features traditional and modern Celtic music, food, crafts, demonstrations and competitions, and a feis is also held. The Highland Games are officially sanctioned by the Mid-Atlantic Scottish Athletics Association, and include standard events such as caber <b>tossing</b> and hammer throwing.|$|E

40|$|In {{this student}} project {{it was to}} be {{experimentally}} figured out how fair a fair coin behaves. To achieve this, fair coin <b>tosses</b> with a different number of maximum coin <b>tosses</b> were simulated and it was analyzed how often chains of given lengths of ones/zeros (assumed to be heads/tails) appear and how much more often zeros appear per experiment compared to ones. This maximum number was - 10 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 100 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 1. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 10. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 100. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 1. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 10. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 100. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 1. 000. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 10. 000. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment Except for the last three, all experiments were repeated 1. 000 times. The 100. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment was repeated 100 times, the 1. 000. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment was repeated 10 times and the 10. 000. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment was NOT repeated. For these one/zero chain distributions the fitting parameters were determined, assuming a geometrical distribution. The experiments with up to 100. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment were repeated with an UNFAIR coin, using a Maxwell Boltzmann statistic for the distribution of coin <b>tosses.</b> [...] In the data-folder these experiments are divided into the normal distributed and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed coin <b>toss</b> experiments. These two folders contain the folders with the data for the different maximum number of coin <b>tosses</b> per experiment. Each of these folders contains two subfolders which contain the distributions of the respective chains of ones or zeros (heads or tails). In this folder (NOT the subfolders!) in addition can be found: - a file with the fitting parameters for each heads/tails-chain-distribution, - a file with an analysis of these fitting parameters, - a file in which it is analyzed how much more often zero {{was the result of the}} <b>toss</b> (for one experiment) - a file with an analysis of that, - and two files in which the chain-distributions are summed up. The result for each coin <b>toss</b> in each experiment were NOT saved.

These extremely agile and wary animals can run at speeds of up to , waving their tails and <b>tossing</b> their heads. An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E

25|$|For example, in {{a series}} of coin <b>tosses,</b> a {{perfectly}} ordered system would be one in which either every <b>toss</b> comes up heads or every <b>toss</b> comes up tails. This means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin <b>tosses,</b> there is only one set of <b>toss</b> outcomes possible: the set in which 100% of <b>tosses</b> come up the same. On the other hand, there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems, where some fraction are heads and the rest tails. A disordered system can be 90% heads and 10% tails, or it could be 98% heads and 2% tails, et cetera. As the number of coin <b>tosses</b> increases, the number of possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases. For {{a very large number of}} coin <b>tosses,</b> the combinations to ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominates and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes extremely unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy.|$|R
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} a Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Christian, and Chris Jericho. The match saw all three wrestlers take the advantage over one another. A spot in the match included Jericho applying the Walls of Jericho on Cena, but he released the move and performed a springboard dropkick on Christian, after Christian got up on the ring apron. Late in the match, Jericho reversed an Unprettier attempt by Christian by <b>tossing</b> Christian directly to Cena. Cena performed an FU on Christian and pinned Christian to retain the WWE title.|$|E

Petey Williams faced Chris Sabin in the second match. A-1 interfered during the encounter by distracting the referee and <b>tossing</b> Williams a hockey stick, which Williams used to hit Sabin across the stomach. He then performed his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver, forcing Sabin's head into the mat and winning the match at 11 minutes and 45 seconds.|$|E

5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by <b>tossing</b> in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn <b>tossing</b> the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E

5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to <b>tossing</b> a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, {{gambling}} is a theme, {{with not only}} golf {{as part of the}} novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond <b>tossing</b> a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English.|$|E
