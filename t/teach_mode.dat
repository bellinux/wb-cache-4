50|$|Programming errors {{represent}} a serious safety consideration, particularly in large industrial robots. The power {{and size of}} industrial robots mean {{they are capable of}} inflicting severe injury if programmed incorrectly or used in an unsafe manner. Due to the mass and high-speeds of industrial robots, it is always unsafe for a human to remain in the work area of the robot during automatic operation. The system can begin motion at unexpected times and a human will be unable to react quickly enough in many situations, even if prepared to do so. Thus, even if the software is free of programming errors, great care must be taken to make an industrial robot safe for human workers or human interaction, such as loading or unloading parts, clearing a part jam, or performing maintenance. The ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999 American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems - Safety Requirements (revision of ANSI/RIA R15.06-1992) book from the Robotic Industries Association is the accepted standard on robot safety. This includes guidelines for both the design of industrial robots, and the implementation or integration and use of industrial robots on the factory floor. Numerous safety concepts such as safety controllers, maximum speed during a <b>teach</b> <b>mode,</b> and use of physical barriers are covered.|$|E

The path generated in the <b>teach</b> <b>mode</b> and path correction in real-time using path error detecting in the playback mode are demonstrated. The vision-based image database is generated as the given path representation in the teaching procedure. The algorithm of an online image positioning is performed for path following. Advanced sensory capability is employed to provide environment perception. A unique omni directional vision (omni-vision) system is used for localization and navigation. The omni directional vision involves an extremely wide-angle lens, which has the feature that a dynamic omni-vision image is processed in real time to respond the widest view during the movement. The beacon guidance is realized by observing locations of points derived from over-head features such as predefined light arrays in a building. The navigation approach is based upon the omni-vision characteristics. A group of ultrasonic sensors is employed for obstacle avoidance...|$|E

In order to test a new learning approach that can bestow intelligence on a system, based upon human (tutor)  robot (student) interaction, we are working jointly to design an intelligent system architecture, based on the KASER (Knowledge Amplification by Structural Expert Randomization), and plan to implement the methodology on an aerial vehicle (a helicopter), which will execute several maneuvers such as basic hovering, steep approach, confined area approach, and basic altitude flying. The software to perform these maneuvers will be developed using two methods (<b>teach</b> <b>mode</b> with a human-in-the-loop) and classical control.

The difference between facilitator espoused <b>teaching</b> <b>mode</b> and learner perception of facilitator <b>teaching</b> <b>mode</b> was also explored. The Principles of Adult Learning Scale (PALS) was used to measure facilitator teaching mode; the Adapted Principles of Adult Learning Scale (APALS) was used to measure learner perception of facilitator teaching mode; and the Teaching Perspectives Inventory (TPI) was used to measure facilitator teaching perspective. The sample was 34 facilitators in colleges/universities and public/corporate training organizations and their 286 learners. Facilitator variables examined were age, gender, race, occupational field, professional preparation, years teaching experience, and program taught. Facilitators were designated as non-collaborative, but were found to be slightly more collaborative than other groups of instructors and teachers from past studies. There was moderate agreement between facilitator espoused and learner perceived <b>teaching</b> <b>mode,</b> yet learners rated facilitators lower on collaborative <b>teaching</b> <b>mode</b> than facilitators rated themselves.
