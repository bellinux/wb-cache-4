5|$|Another legend, {{generally}} told in Indian folk tales, {{states that}} Aruna, the charioteer of the sun-god Surya, once became {{a woman named}} Aruni and entered an assembly of celestial nymphs, where no man except Indra was allowed. Indra {{fell in love with}} Aruni and fathered a son named Vali. The next day, at Surya's request, Aruna again assumed female form, and Surya fathered a son, Sugriva. Both children were given to Ahalya for rearing, but Gautama cursed them, causing them to turn into monkeys, as he did not like them. In the Thai version of the Ramayana, the Ramakien, Vali and Sugriva are described as Ahalya's children from her liaisons with Indra and Surya. Although Ahalya initially passes them off as sons of Gautama, her daughter by Gautama– Anjani– reveals her mother's secret to her father. He consequently drives the brothers away and curses them to become monkeys. Enraged, Ahalya curses Anjani <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> a monkey too. Anjani bears Hanuman, the monkey-god and helper of Rama. Similar tales are also found in the Malay adaptation, Hikayat Seri Rama, and Punjabi and Gujarati folk tales. However, Anjani is cursed by Gautama in these versions, generally for aiding Indra and Ahalya in concealing the secret.|$|E

5|$|Director Darren Aronofsky {{sought to}} produce The Fountain {{after the release}} of Requiem for a Dream in 2000. In April 2001, he entered {{negotiations}} with Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow to direct the then-untitled film with actor Brad Pitt in the lead role. Requiem for a Dream was screened for Pitt, and the preliminary script for The Fountain persuaded the actor to join the project. Aronofsky prepared for production by traveling with a crew to Central America to consult with Mayan experts and to explore the Mexican ruins of Palenque. The group also visited Tikal, a jungle location featured in the 1977 film Star Wars. In addition to the trip, the films Aguirre, the Wrath of God and The Holy Mountain were screened for the crew to inspire it in designing a rainforest set for The Fountain. In June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join Aronofsky's project. Aronofsky, who wanted the film's actual title to be a secret, gave the project the working title of The Last Man. Production was postponed to improve the script and to wait for Blanchett, pregnant when she joined, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> her child in December 2001.

Pitt left the project seven weeks before the first day of shooting, halting production. In February 2004, Warner Bros. resurrected it on a $35 million budget with Hugh Jackman in the lead role. In August, actress Rachel Weisz filled the vacancy left by Blanchett. The Fountain was released on November 22, 2006, a day before the American Thanksgiving holiday; ultimately it grossed $15,978,422 in theaters worldwide. Audiences and critics were divided in their responses to it.|$|E
5|$|Matt {{returns to}} Genoa City with a reconstructed face, rapes Sharon once more, and is {{eventually}} captured. When Sharon ends up pregnant, {{it is unknown}} who the father is: Nick or Matt. An argument with Nick causes Sharon <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> a stillborn daughter, which is revealed to be Nick's following her death. Nick and Sharon's marriage weakens further when they both cheat on each other once more, Nick with Grace and Sharon with the Newman stableman Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan). Nick tries to forgive her, but when he witnesses Sharon and Victor kissing, things become harder to mend than ever. Sharon later runs away from town, depressed. When she returns, Nick accepts her and they reunite. However, a man named Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby) who physically abused her (after {{having an affair with}} her) followed Sharon to Genoa City, wanting to bed her again. Eventually, Cameron's schemes are foiled and Sharon and Nick return to their normal life at last. In 2005, a fourteen-year-old rebellious Cassie is killed in a car accident. Nick closes off his emotions and cheats on Sharon with his Newman Enterprises work friend Phyllis Summers. Phyllis ends up pregnant, with Jack or Nick as possible fathers. The original DNA test to determine the child's paternity returns inconclusive, but the thought of losing another child leads Nick into lying, and claiming that he is Summer's father. Nick and Sharon divorce after an eleven-year marriage and he marries Phyllis instead. Their daughter, Summer Newman, is born. Sharon also moves on with her life, marrying Jack, which makes Nick feel uncomfortable. In 2007, Nick's flight on the Newman jet crashes and a body is never recovered; he is presumed dead, devastating his family and Sharon.|$|E
