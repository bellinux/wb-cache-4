50|$|Haidate, <b>thigh</b> <b>guards</b> which {{tied around}} the waist and covered the thighs. These were made from cloth with small bamboo and or leather plates of various size and shape, usually {{connected}} to each other by chain armour (kusari) and sewn to the cloth.|$|R
50|$|In Japan mail {{is called}} kusari which means chain. When the word kusari {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with an armoured item it usually means that mail makes up the majority of the armour composition. An example of this would be kusari gusoku which means chain armour. Kusari jackets, hoods, gloves, vests, shin, shoulder, <b>thigh</b> <b>guards,</b> and other armoured clothing were produced, even kusari tabi socks.|$|R
5000|$|Chest armor was {{commonly}} {{made from}} karuta (karuta tatami dou). Karuta jackets (karuta katabira) were also made. Various {{other parts of}} armor were made from karuta including <b>thigh</b> <b>guards</b> (karuta haidate), shoulder guards (karuta sode) and karuta hoods (karuta zukin). Karuta armor was worn by all classes of samurai, even the foot soldiers (ashigaru). High quality armor was more elaborate and ornate, while the lower quality sets of armor were plain but offered basic protection.|$|R
5000|$|Kikko {{were used}} in the {{construction}} of traditional Japanese armour, suneate (greaves) and tate-eri (shoulder pads) often incorporated kikko in their design. Haidate (<b>thigh</b> <b>guards)</b> and kote ( [...] sleeves) could also be partially or completely armoured with kikko. Lightweight portable folding armour (kikko tatami gusoku) would have a kikko tatami dō" [...] (folding breastplate), and auxiliary armour items such as wakibiki, manchira, and manju no wa could be armoured with kikko. Kabuto (helmets) could have a neck guard (shikoro) made with kikko plates sewn to a cloth backing.|$|R
40|$|A thigh {{contusion}} is {{a common}} sports related injury that can result in disability and time away from activity. Thigh pads can be worn to help reduce injury occurrence and severity. To evaluate the relative effectiveness of protective <b>guards</b> a <b>thigh</b> model is required. This study utilised data generated from impacts on human volunteers and cadaver material to select a surrogate soft tissue component for a thigh model. This component was attached to a stainless steel beam that represented the femur. The model was instrumented with an internal transducer to measure local peak force. This parameter provided {{a measure of the}} impact force attenuation of protective equipment. Initial tests were conducted on cricket thigh pads. The thigh model can be used to assess the relative effectiveness of <b>thigh</b> <b>guards</b> and has the potential to determine whether the ideally sought lightweight low bulk pads offer similar protection as other bulkier pads. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of sports {{medicine}} is to allow safe early return to competition after an injury. To permit this, it is often necessary to devise some sort of protective splint. Protective splints used in contact sports must serve the following purposes (11 provide e adequate protection to the mjured part and thus prevent further injury; (2) allow the injured player to participate safely and effectively, (3) protect the opposing players agamst injury from the splmt; and (4) satisfy the game officials that the above criteria are met within the rules governing the particular sport. Prohibited equipment in collegiate football includes: &dquo; (1) sole leather or other hard or unyieldmg substances on the hand, wrist, forearm, or elbow of any players, no matter how covered or padded, and (2) sole leather or other hard unyielding substances in <b>thigh</b> <b>guards,</b> shin guards, knee or other braces, unless such article is covered on both sides and all of its edge...|$|R

5000|$|The Japanese {{had more}} {{varieties}} of mail {{than all the}} rest of the world put together. [...] Kusari was used in samurai armour at least from the time of the Mongol invasions (1270s) but particularly from the Nanboku-chō period (1336-1392). Kusari was typically made with rings that were much smaller than their European counterparts, and patches of kusari were used to link together plates and to drape over vulnerable areas such as the underarm. Most common parts of samurai armour could be made with kusari as the main armour defense as well as many types of garments including jackets, hoods, gloves, vests, shin, shoulder, <b>thigh</b> <b>guards,</b> even kusari tabi socks. Kusari gusoku (chain armour) was commonly used during the Edo period 1603 to 1868 as a stand-alone defense. According to George Cameron Stone, [...] "Entire suits of mail kusari gusoku were worn on occasions, sometimes under the ordinary clothing".During most of the Edo period, traditional armour was for the most part relegated to ceremonial use and as a display of wealth, power, class and rank, while lightweight portable armour and armoured clothing such as tatami armour and kusari karabira were still in use. While large battles were a thing of the past, revolts, peasant uprisings, clan conflicts, individual duels, assassination attempts etc. ensured that samurai still needed some kind of armour protection. Edo period samurai police officers (machi-kata doshin) wore kusari garments for protection when making an arrest, and Ian Bottomley in his book Arms and Armor of the Samurai: The History of Weaponry in Ancient Japan shows a picture of a kusari armour and mentions kusari katabira (chain jackets) with detachable arms being worn by samurai police officials during the Edo period. The end of the samurai era in the 1860s, along with the 1876 ban on wearing swords in public, marked the end of any practical use for mail and other armour in Japan. Japan turned to a conscription army and uniforms replaced armour.|$|R
50|$|On October 17, 2010 a {{mountain}} goat attacked and killed Robert H. Boardman. Boardman had been hiking {{with his wife}} and friends, when an aggressive mountain goat approached. Boardman told the rest of his party to move down the trail while he tried to scare the goat away. His companions heard a loud yell and when they investigated the found Boardman on the ground with the aggressive goat nearby. Boardman had been gored in the <b>thigh.</b> A coast <b>guard</b> helicopter transported Boardman to Olympic Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased.|$|R
50|$|Ratnik protects almost 90% of a soldier's body. The {{main body}} armour (Standard vest) is GOST R 50744-95 Level V rated, weighs 7.5 kg (with the Assault variant {{weighing}} up to 15 kg). The main body armour fully protects from 7.62×39mm rounds from assault rifles, and 7.62×54mmR from sniper rifles, including the increased penetration of hardened rounds, and can survive hits from repeated shots in these calibres conducted at close range. The {{weight of the}} full Ratnik infantry system with the special thigh and shoulder bulletproof shields is 19-20 kg. Basic Ratnik gear (for engineers and medics) weighs 15 kg (without <b>thigh</b> and shoulder <b>guards).</b>|$|R
50|$|A goaltender is {{required}} to wear certain protective gear. Every goaltender must wear gloves, a chest protector, a helmet and a throat guard. They optionally wear padded undergarments and a mouth guard, although mouth guards are required in youth levels through high school, as to minimize the amount of concussions and head-related injuries. In women's lacrosse, <b>thigh</b> pads, shin <b>guards</b> and elbow pads are common. Women's lacrosse prohibits jewelry, except for religious purposes. In men's lacrosse, a protective groin cup {{is required}} for all players. Goaltenders also have a larger crosse (the head of a lacrosse stick) than the other players. This {{makes it easier to}} save shots. The downside is that it can be harder to cradle and pass the ball to another player/teammate.|$|R
500|$|Football is a full-contact sport, and {{injuries}} are relatively common. Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players. To {{try to prevent}} injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment. At a minimum players must wear a football helmet {{and a set of}} shoulder pads, but individual leagues may require additional padding such as <b>thigh</b> pads and <b>guards,</b> knee pads, chest protectors, and mouthguards. Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities. The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Repeated concussions can increase a person's risk in later life for chronic traumatic encephalopathy and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits; USA Football's [...] "Heads Up Football" [...] program is aiming to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, the proper way to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact. However, a study in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Heads Up Football was ineffective; the same study noted that more extensive reforms implemented by Pop Warner Little Scholars and its member teams were effective in significantly reducing concussion rates.|$|R
