5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew what she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
25|$|The ships {{carrying}} the filles du roi would travel up the St. Lawrence River, stopping first at Québec, then at Trois-Rivières, and lastly at Montréal. Because the prettiest of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> have the easiest time finding a husband, {{many of the}} immigrants settled in Québec, the first port of call.|$|E
60|$|Patsy and Beth were {{curious to}} know what <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> do with her windfall, but Mildred proved noncommittal.|$|R
60|$|He {{had made}} {{allowances}} for her, but <b>the</b> ideal <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> {{have had no}} need of allowances. <b>The</b> ideal <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> be plucky, cheerfully valiant, a fighter. She would not admit the existence of hard luck.|$|R
60|$|He fancied for {{a moment}} that <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> have retreated. She, however, looked at him quietly, though {{something}} in her manner checked Alton's outstretched hand.|$|R
25|$|Gallati has {{suggested}} that the placement of the two oldest girls, {{at the edge of a}} darkened and ambiguous entryway, is symbolic of their maturation into an unknown future. Several art historians have interpreted the painting as revealing Sargent's psychosexual thoughts. In the succeeding years, none of <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> marry, and the two oldest suffered emotional disturbances in maturity.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{the girls}} resumed their Girls of Grace activities, {{and began working}} with Michael Passons, {{formerly}} of Avalon, who began to tour with them. On one-off dates, <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> have acoustic segments where Dana and Michael would be featured on guitar and piano, respectively, along with vocals from the girls. Heather also {{gave birth to her}} third child in 2006. The girls launched the 2006 Winter Wonderland Tour with special guest Scott Krippayne.|$|E
25|$|The rise of cuteness in Japanese culture {{emerged in}} the 1970s {{as part of a}} new style of writing. Many teenage girls began to write {{laterally}} using mechanical pencils. These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional Japanese writing that varied in thickness and was vertical. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> also write in big, round characters and they added little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, emoticon faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet.|$|E

25|$|Inside the van, <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> {{typically}} be overpowered, bound {{hand and}} foot, gagged, and driven to locations {{deep within the}} San Gabriel Mountains, {{where they would be}} sexually assaulted by both men, then usually killed by strangulation with a wire coat hanger, although two of the victims had had ice picks driven into their ears before being strangled. Norris admitted to bludgeoning their youngest victim, Jacqueline Leah Lamp, about the head with a sledgehammer as Bittaker strangled her, and admitted to repeatedly striking Shirley Ledford upon the elbow with a sledgehammer before strangling her to death. The bottles of acid found at Bittaker's motel, Norris stated, were intended for use upon the next victim they abducted.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{financial}} ruin {{with the}} tour promoters threatening to sue him, Oakey {{had less than}} a week to put a new band together. In an unplanned move Oakey went to a Sheffield city centre discothèque called The Crazy Daisy (since demolished) and recruited two totally unknown teenage girls he saw dancing there: Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall into the band. As luck would have it, they were already fans of The Human League and recognised Oakey. He now calls this the best decision of his career, as <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> be critical in the band's further success, and Sulley and Catherall are now Oakey's business partners in the present day band.|$|E
25|$|The Girls of Grace {{album was}} {{released}} on August 20, 2002, and the first conference took place in October in Lakeland, Florida. To start things up on Friday night, <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> give a high-energy concert. On Saturday, there were many speakers, such as Susie Shellenberger of BRIO Magazine, Nancy Alcorn of Mercy Ministries of America. They addressed topics such as self-esteem, sex, family issues, friendships and relationships with God. There were also musical guests. On the first series of conferences, Joy Williams helped provide music. Out of Eden {{was there for the}} 2003 and 2004 conferences. The Katinas also played in a few select 2004 conferences while Jaime Jamgochian and M.O.C. provided music and worship in 2005 and 2006.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} Paul {{wondered}} if it was a joint conception of the two schoolgirls. But, on reflection, he was persuaded that Yerba would commit herself to no accomplice--of her own sex. She might have dominated <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> and <b>would</b> make her a firm partisan, while <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> be convinced of it herself, and believe herself a free agent. He had had such experience with men himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, Judith was {{the name}} the Delawares mentioned, though it was {{pronounced}} after a fashion of their own. From their discourse, I do not think <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> much please my fancy." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the lyrics}} of [...] "KKK Bitch," [...] Ice-T {{describes}} a sexual encounter {{with a woman who}} he soon learns is the daughter of the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The lyrics go on to describe a scenario in which members of Body Count [...] "crash" [...] a Klan meeting to [...] "get buck wild with the white freaks". Ice-T makes humorous reference to [...] " [...] in love with Tipper Gore's two 12-year-old nieces", and ponders the possibility of the Grand Wizard coming after him [...] "when his grandson's named little Ice-T." [...] In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that [...] "'KKK Bitch' was ironic because the sentiments were true. We'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the South and <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> always come backstage and tell us how their brothers and fathers didn't like black folks. [...] We knew that 'KKK Bitch' would totally piss off the Ku Klux Klan. There's humor in the song, but it fucks with them. It's on a punk tip." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{comeback}} {{was confirmed}} when Girls Aloud's official website posted on 9 October a countdown {{that would last}} until 19 October, when <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> make a special announcement. It was speculated that they would make an appearance on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, where bandmate Kimberley Walsh joined as a contestant. However, on 15 October, the surprise, a single titled [...] "Something New", leaked online in full. The official radio premiere of the song was then brought forward to the following day, with Girls Aloud posting on their website, [...] "It's here! The finished version of Something New will be played on radio from midday and will also be on YouTube to listen in full." [...] "Something New" [...] was released on 16 November 2012 by Polydor Records through digital download, serving as the official Children in Need 2012 single. When asked about how she felt with the group being back together and the reception from the public, Walsh said, [...] "I'm kind of flattered people actually care if we come back or not. I think we are all quite proud that we made enough of an impact {{to be able to}} a comeback." ...|$|E
500|$|Trimmer also {{founded and}} oversaw charity schools in her neighborhood. She {{directed}} promising students from her Sunday schools, which met {{only once a}} week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in her journal, these schools seemed to her to [...] "afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy". While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier. Trimmer criticized the rote learning {{that went on in}} traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions. She wrote in her journal, [...] "my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures". Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.|$|E
60|$|Again that {{telltale}} flush mantled the man's cheek. He cursed himself inwardly for {{his lack}} of self-control. <b>The</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> have his whole secret out of him in another half-hour if he were not more careful.|$|R
60|$|Yes; {{the woman}} had another daughter, and, to tell the truth, {{it was she who}} owned the tree. Just let the steward go home again and <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> fetch <b>the</b> apple in a little while.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick, {{you stay}} with Dora!" [...] cried Tom. [...] "Come on, Sam!" [...] And off the two {{brothers}} sped at top speed, leaving Dick and Dora to follow as rapidly as the strength of <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> permit.|$|R
500|$|Scant {{details are}} {{known about the}} early history of the Dumas Brothel; however, two early {{boarders}} of the house listed their occupations as [...] "gambler" [...] and [...] "saloon man" [...] in census records. By 1900 the brothel was occupied by Madam Grace McGinnis, her servant, a Chinese cook and four prostitutes. The cost of sex in the brothel {{at the turn of the}} 20th century was fifty cents, with the working girls receiving about 40 percent of that amount. [...] Despite the size of the brothel, by 1902 Madame McGinnis had only five working girls and a musician under her employment. In 1903 the Dumas and businesses like it in Butte's red light district were unusually lucrative ventures. These businesses were frequented by miners from the local Anaconda Copper Mining Company. That year, traffic grew to a point where the Dumas's operations had to be expanded, building [...] "cribs" [...] (tiny cubicles where the girls worked) in the basement of the house. There were several ways potential clients could access the brothel. A back door of the Dumas opened into Pleasant Alley, near South Wyoming Street, which was the busiest section of Butte's red light area. The basement cribs could also be accessed by a staircase from the front sidewalk. Even though the Dumas operated 24 hours a day with several girls taking three shifts, by 1910 there were only two women reported to actually be living there. Instead the prostitutes lived in other parts of Pleasant Alley, and commuted to the brothel for their shifts. In Butte, the activities of the city's prostitutes were generally restricted to Galena and Mercury Street. From the windows of their street-facing cribs, <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> attract prospective clients in varying states of undress. The Butte Miner, a local newspaper, explained how the girls did this: ...|$|E
2500|$|The celebration would {{traditionally}} {{be accompanied}} by declarations in verse, in which a young man would climb {{on the roof of}} a building in the village, beat on a tin pan and announce which girls were to be doused along with how many wagon-loads of sand, how much water and how much soap would be used on each girl. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> also respond in verse, announcing that there was someone who would save her. For instance, ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 October 1997, a camp {{site was}} set up by the father of Nichole Collins at White Rock, near Bega, for his teenage {{daughter}} to invite friends over for the coming Labour Day long weekend. The camp site was located [...] from the Collins' home. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> regularly call at the house while camping to change clothing, shower and eat. Collins' father regularly called at the camp site to check on the children and did so on the day the girls disappeared. About 9pm on 5 October 1997, Collins, wearing her high school jacket, and her younger friend Barry, left a group of friends at the camp site and walked off for a nearby party.|$|E
50|$|Eight Premiership and Championship {{football}} players {{took part in}} a head-to-head tournament playing Pro Evolution Soccer. Alternately, it featured a dancing contest with five glamour models. <b>The</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> usually wear clothing that was not suitable to dance in and compete at Dance Dance Revolution or DDR for short. Before and after <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> danced, Dominik <b>would</b> often flirt with them, only to be shot down every time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lyrics to}} the Beatles song, [...] "She Came in Through the Bathroom Window" [...] (1969), say, [...] "She {{came in through}} the {{bathroom}} window, protected by her silver spoon," [...] meaning <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> have no trouble being naughty.|$|R
60|$|The old hag began now to {{long for}} the water, and said that <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> be running about with the gold piece all over the plain, so she asked her son {{to go and get}} her a drop of water.|$|R
2500|$|There's a word {{we used to}} use in Jamaica called 'streggae'. If a girl {{is walking}} and the guys {{look at her and}} say 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. [...] Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.|$|E
2500|$|The anime series, {{directed}} by Takayuki Inagaki {{who has worked}} on Desert Punk and Indian Summer, has an abundance of fanservice and panty shots that have been heavily criticized from reviewers in manga and anime, who have compared the show to panty-ridden series such as Najica Blitz Tactics and Agent Aika. Lumbard was disgusted by the fanservice of weird sexual imagery around Yukari, and lowered his overall opinion of the second anime series because of it. Høgset wrote that the series was like Shuffle! with more fanservice with [...] "average 'all the girls dotes on the guy' stupidity". Deb Aoki found the fanservice in the manga to be a bit unwholesome and cheesy, but underneath were teen themes about friendship, loyalty, and courage. Reception on the characters' fanservice has been acknowledged by Ikeda. In the bonus comics at the end of Season II, Volume 6, Ikeda responds to a fan letter that criticizes that the Newspaper Club girls artwork in the manga is not as moe as in the anime by having them go over aspects of moe that has already incorporated such as cat ears, knee socks, large breasts, twin tails, long bangs, as well as what <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> look like when drawn with large eyes, distinguishing accessories and speech inflections. When asked in an interview about the fewer panty shots compared to other shōnen manga; Ikeda replied that he favors showing less as it would be more erotic and intriguing.|$|E
2500|$|The Spice Girls {{were fully}} {{involved}} {{in the writing of}} all the songs. Halliwell in particular was clearly a fund of ideas for songs, arriving at sessions with her book of jottings, notes and miscellaneous scribblings which often produced the starting point of a lyric or a song title or just an agenda for the day's work. Watkins commented, [...] "Geri [...] would come up with the concept for a song. Typically, she'd sing one line and <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> pick up on it or we'd pick up on it and construct around it and then Mel C [...] and Emma [...] would be very active. They'd really like to sit and sing melodies and go off and come up with little sections." [...] They [...] "conceptualised" [...] and sang bits of melody and wrote the lyrics. But in musical terms it was not a partnership of equals. Rowe commented: [...] "We had to kind of steer it. It was very different for different tracks really. Some of them were when we were all jamming in the room. We'd just put up some drum sounds and start making things up. On other tracks me and Richard [...] would prepare something beforehand and play it to them. We'd have some lyrics and make them write the second verse." [...] The Spice Girls introduced two key innovations that have had a lasting impact on the way which modern pop acts go about their creative business. Firstly they introduced the idea of songwriting identity. This was a familiar concept in rock bands like Queen or the Sex Pistols, but not in the world of [...] "manufactured pop", where the credits of songwriting would be divided out strictly in accordance with whoever had written the song. The Spice Girls recognised their solidarity as a group, which depended on maintaining parity in all departments, including the songwriting credits and the resulting royalties. They share the songwriting royalties on all the songs irrespective of what any member of the group had or had not contributed to any particular song. The second thing the Spice Girls established from the outset was a straight 50–50 split between them and their various songwriting collaborators. Here they anticipated one of the key developments in the pop industry since the 1990s, namely the increasing importance of publishing royalties as opposed to royalties payments made for the performance of the song on the record.|$|E

5000|$|Some woman said, 'You write {{all those}} macho things, but you can't write about women.' I said, 'I'm not scared of women. I could write about them if I wanted to.' So I {{got an idea}} for a story about this {{incident}} in a girls' shower room, and <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> be telekinetic. <b>The</b> other <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> pelt her with sanitary napkins when she got her period. The period would release the right hormones and she would rain down destruction on them… I did the shower scene, but I hated it and threw it away.|$|R
