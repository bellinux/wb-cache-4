40|$|Abstract—A {{majority}} of Internet service providers (ISPs) sup-port connectivity {{to the entire}} Internet by transiting their traffic via other providers. Although the <b>transit</b> <b>prices</b> per megabit per second (Mbps) decline steadily, the overall transit costs of these ISPs remain high or even increase due to the traffic growth. The discontent of the ISPs with the high transit costs has yielded no-table innovations such as peering, content distribution networks, multicast, and peer-to-peer localization. While the above solutions tackle the problem by reducing the transit traffic, this paper explores a novel approach that reduces the transit costs without altering the traffic. In the proposed Cooperative IP Transit (CIPT), multiple ISPs cooperate to jointly purchase Internet Protocol (IP) transit in bulk. The aggregate transit costs decrease due to the economies-of-scale effect of typical subadditive pricing as well as burstable billing: Not all ISPs transit their peak traffic during the same period. To distribute the aggregate savings among the CIPT partners, we propose Shapley-value sharing of the CIPT transit costs. Using public data about IP traffic and <b>transit</b> <b>prices,</b> we quantitatively evaluate CIPT and show that significant savings can be achieved, both in relative and absolute terms.

We analyze the behavior of providers on a specific scenario mainly by considering the simple but not simplistic case of one source and one destination.

The perspective of the game being repeated make cooperation possible while maintaining higher prices. We consider then the system under a distributed framework.

40|$|We analyze urban {{congestion}} management policies through numerical {{analysis of a}} simple model that: allows users to choose between car, bus or an outside option (biking); consider congestion interactions between cars and buses; and allow for optimization of frequency, vehicle size, spacing between stops and percentage of capacity to be dedicated to bus lanes. We compare resulting service levels, social welfare and consumer surplus {{for a number of}} different policies and find that: (i) dedicated bus lanes is a better stand-alone policy than transit subsidization or congestion pricing. The latter is marginally better than subsidization but has a negative impact in consumer surplus. (ii) Efficient transit subsidies are quite large since in many cases first-best <b>transit</b> <b>price</b> is negative; establishing dedicated bus lanes or implementing congestion pricing render subsidies unnecessary for high demand levels. (iii) Both subsidization and dedicated bus lanes would count with public support while congestion pricing would probably encounter opposition. (iv) Transit subsidies and/or congestion pricing do not induce large changes on optimal bus size, frequency, circulation speeds and spacing between stops in mixed-traffic conditions: dedicated bus lanes do. (v) In all cases analyzed, revenues from congestion pricing are enough to cover transit subsidies; the optimal percentage of capacity that should be devoted for bus traffic is around one third.

The proposed model reveals the interaction between ETIS and TTPS, and the potential benefit of the joint implementation. There are two classes of passengers: those equipped and those unequipped with ETIS. It is assumed that unequipped passengers make their travel choices according to stochastic dynamic user optimal principles, with equipped passengers having a lower perception variation of travel cost due to the availability of better information. A bi-level program is formulated to model the integrated effects on passengers' departure time choice behavior, route choice behavior, transit network performance, and transit operators' revenue.

40|$|Internet Service Providers (ISPs) must {{interconnect}} {{in order}} to realize the network externality benefits {{of being able to}} reach all users. Market power determines whether and how much one provider pays another for interconnection. Recently, anti-trust authorities have expressed concern about the potential abuse of market power with respect to network interconnection in the scope of the Internet. This paper develops models for understanding when, where and using what mechanisms, ISPs will choose to interconnect. By solving these models with the appropriate inputs one could observe the optimal interconnection strategies for ISPs and understand how the topology of the Internet might evolve. Analyses of the various sources of costs for interconnection are provided as parameters for these models.

30|$|Most {{interactions}} between ASes are local (unilateral {{in the case}} of provider selection and bilateral {{in the case of}} peering), decentralized and dynamic. These local connectivity decisions, however, can have a global impact on the economic viability of all ASes and the structure of the Internet. The Internet remains in a persistent state of flux, subject to changes in various exogenous factors, e.g., geographic expansion of ASes, new entrants in the connectivity market, removal of nodes from the network owing to bankruptcies, changes in technology, etc. How will the Internet change due to consolidation of content (Labovitz et al. 2010), large penetration of video streaming, falling <b>transit</b> <b>prices</b> (Internet <b>Transit</b> Prices: Historical and Projected 2010), expanding geographic footprint of content providers (Gill et al. 2008), cheap local availability of peering infrastructure at IXPs (Augustin et al. 2009)?

40|$|International audienceThe network {{neutrality}} debate originally {{stems from the}} growing traffic asymmetry between ISPs, questioning the established peering or transit agreements. That tendency is due to popular content providers connected to the network through a single ISP whose traffic is not charged by distant ISPs. We propose in this paper to review the economic transit agreements between ISPs {{in order to determine}} their best strategy. We define a model with two ISPs, each providing direct connectivity to a fixed proportion of the content and competing in terms of price for end users, who select their ISP based on the price per unit of available content. We analyze and compare thanks to game-theoretic tools three different situations: the case of peering between the ISPs, the case where ISPs do not share their traffic (exclusivity arrangements), and the case where they fix a transfer price per unit of volume. Our results suggest that a minimal regulation, consisting in letting ISPs choose <b>transit</b> <b>prices</b> but imposing peering in case no agreement is reached, leads to satisfying outcomes in terms of user welfare while still leaving some decision space to ISPs, hence answering a concern they have regarding regulation in the Internet market...|$|R
40|$|Transit {{scholars}} have long advocated {{the use of}} differentiated <b>transit</b> <b>pricing</b> to improve service efficiency and equity among riders. Using Metropolitan Vancouver as a case study, I examine the effects on transit revenues and equity measures of two strategies – distance-based and time-of-day pricing. The analysis uses an established transportation forecasting model, combined with survey data from TransLink and estimates of price elasticity of demand from the literature to predict change in demand due {{to change in the}} fare structure. Information from transit agencies in Washington, DC, and Toronto, Ontario provides insights into issues of implementation complexity and public and political acceptance of differentiated fare structures. The analysis reveals an improvement in terms of increase in trips and reduced fares for lower income, captive and transit-dependent riders, and for riders from certain municipalities, with distance-based pricing. With a time-of-day fare structure there is slight improvement for low-income riders, an increase in revenues, and a small shift of trips from peak to off-peak times.
