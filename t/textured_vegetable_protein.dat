25|$|Vegetarian chili (also {{known as}} chili sin carne, chili without meat, chili non carne, and chili sans carne) {{acquired}} wide {{popularity in the}} U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s {{with the rise of}} vegetarianism. It is also popular with those on a diet restricting the use of red meat. To make the chili vegetarian, the cook leaves out the meat or replaces it with a meat analogue, such as <b>textured</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein</b> or tofu, or a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes. These chilis nearly always include beans. Variants may contain corn, squash, mushrooms, or beets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Textured</b> or {{texturized}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein</b> (TVP), {{also known}} as textured soy protein (TSP), soy meat, or soya chunks is a defatted soy flour product, a by-product of extracting soybean oil. It is often used as a meat analogue or meat extender. It is quick to cook, with a protein content far greater than certain meats.|$|R
40|$|Chicken nuggets are {{commonly}} made with {{varying levels of}} <b>textured</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>proteins</b> such as soy and wheat, {{for their ability to}} bind water and their meat like conformation. This project compared textured wheat proteins and soy proteins at 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % in both emulsified and non-emulsified chicken nuggets. A total of 6, 048 chicken nuggets were evaluated in replications for batter breader pickup (%), par fry yield (%), cook loss (%), L*, a*, b* color value, texture profile analysis, and sensory analysis. Analysis was conducted for all four concentrations of wheat and soy treatments then compared to each other and an all-white meat chicken nugget control. All data was analyzed with a ? < 0. 05 using SAS with PROC GLM and Duncan?s MRT, except for sensory data which was analyzed as a complete randomized block design using analysis of variance with a ? < 0. 05, and was analyzed using SAS with PROC GLM. Results indicated that no notable trends were apparent in the quality testing. A trained sensory panel determined that Soy flavor was more detectable at 20 % and 30 % than wheat flavor was at similar levels. The results indicate that wheat proteins can replace soy proteins for functional properties in both emulsified and non-emulsified chicken nuggets at all concentrations evaluated. It was also determined that wheat proteins could be used at levels up to 30 % without imparting a noticeable flavor...|$|R
30|$|Since peanut flour {{is rich in}} oil and proteins, it {{is widely}} used in {{different}} foods: {{as a replacement for}} animal source proteins, in breakfast snack foods and cereals, as an improver of cereal flours, and {{it can be used to}} produce <b>textured</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>proteins</b> or can be used directly in ground meats to provide adequate moisture and fat binding characteristics [9]. As an oilseed crop, peanut is characterized with proteins of high quantity and quality, as well as with high caloric value. It is also high in phytic acid and contains fibers and perhaps other binding agents which reduce mineral bioavailability from the seeds [10]. Chemical properties of grain are under high genotypic and environmental impact, reflected in induced variations in oil content, individual fatty acid contents, and derived oil quality parameters [11]. Dwivedi et al. [12] reported significant and negative correlation between oil and protein contents, as well as significant linear increase in oil content followed by seed mass increase. However, no such relationship was observed for protein content. Similarly to chickpea, phenolics from peanut seeds and particularly peanut skin have high antifungal and antioxidative activity [13 - 15]. Positive effect of peanut on human health can be confirmed by the studies of Emekli-Alturfan et al. [16], who ascertained that addition of peanut to the diet did not significantly change blood lipids, protrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, or fibrinogen levels, both in control and in hyperlipidemic groups. Peanut consumption improved glutathione (GSH) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) levels and decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), without increasing other blood lipids in experimental hyperlipidemia.|$|R
25|$|Fat-free (defatted) {{soybean meal}} is a {{significant}} and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as <b>textured</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein</b> (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes. The beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins. Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. Traditional non-fermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk from which tofu and tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto and tempeh.|$|E
25|$|It is essential, therefore, that vegetarians consume {{adequate}} {{amounts of}} dietary supplements or foods {{that have been}} fortified with B12 (such as nutritional yeast or other yeast extracts, vegetable stock, veggie burger mixes, <b>textured</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein,</b> soy milks, vegetable and sunflower margarines, and breakfast cereals). B12 {{that is to be}} used in these supplements is typically grown from vegan sources (such as bacteria). Soybean and barley seeds grown in soils amended with cow dung (which is naturally rich in B12), or with pure B12 had a higher B12 content than those grown without this supplementation. There is a patent for cultivating plants in a solution containing vitamin B12 so that the crop contains more B12.|$|E

40|$|The {{consumption}} of foods made from soybeans is increasing {{because of their}} desirable nutritional value. However, some soy foods contain high concentrations of oxalate and/or phytate. Oxalate is a component of calcium oxalate kidney stones, whereas phytate is an inhibitor of calcium kidney stone formation. Thirty tested commercial soy foods exhibited ranges of 0. 02 − 2. 06 mg oxalate/g and 0. 80 − 18. 79 mg phytate/g. Commercial soy foods contained 2 − 58 mg of total oxalate per serving and 76 − 528 mg phytate per serving. Eighteen of 19 tofu brands and two soymilk brands contained less than 10 mg oxalate per serving, defined as a low oxalate food. Soy flour, <b>textured</b> <b>vegetable</b> soy <b>protein,</b> <b>vegetable</b> soybeans, soy nuts, tempeh, and soynut butter exhibited greater than 10 mg per serving. The correlation between oxalate and phytate in the soy foods was significant (r = 0. 71, P 3 ̆c 0. 001) indicating that oxalate-rich soy foods also contain higher concentrations of phytate. There also was a significant correlation, based on molar basis, between the divalent ion binding potential of oxalate plus phytate and calcium plus magnesium (r = 0. 90, P 3 ̆c 0. 001) in soy foods. Soy foods containing small concentrations of oxalate and moderate concentrations of phytate may be advantageous for kidney stone patients or persons with {{a high risk of}} kidney stones...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{consumers}} in the product development system for developing a food product was investigated. The investigation studied the techniques suitable for use with consumers and how well the development system worked in a cross-cultural situation. A bakery snack was developed for export from New Zealand to Malaysia, targetted at two major ethnic groups, the Malays and Chinese. Initial market research (including a consumer survey and a focus group) provided general information on the eating of snacks by the Malays and the Chinese. Multidimensional scaling also provided general information on their perceptions of bakery snacks and uncovered an area for further development work. The initial market research findings indicated that the Malays and Chinese were similar in their perceptions and preferences of bakery snacks. Their purchasing patterns of bakery products from bread and cake shops were somewhat different. Bread and cake were more popular among the Malays, while the Chinese bought more filled buns and currys puffs. Consumers generated 100 new product ideas for bakery snacks using brainstorming and nominal group technique. Both techniques {{were found to be}} useful under different conditions. The product ideas were reduced to seven using a series of quantitative techniques. The final selection of a macaroni and minced meat pie for further development was made by Malay and Chinese consumer groups. Formulation of the pie was studied, using sensory profiling with fixed "ideals", by a small panel in New Zealand. The panel consisted of Malaysian students who had been in New Zealand for one or two years. Data obtained from the sensory profiling were used to derive empirical equations relating sensory attributes and acceptability to ingredient levels, so that the formulation could be guided quickly and systematically. The final product was consumer tested in Malaysia using a central location test, focus groups and sensory profiling. Consumer input was useful in every stage of the development of the product. Their input was particularly important during the initial market research, the formulation stage and product testing. It was concluded that consumers were best utilised in as many stages of the development of a consumer product as possible, using groups of 10 - 30 people. Most techniques were found suitable for cross-cultural research. Exceptions occurred where questionnaires were involved (i. e. the initial consumer survey and the central location test) where it was found that Malays were reluctant to answer questions. Results from the different techniques at the various stages of the project correlated well with few exceptions. The pie developed was acceptable to Malaysians, both Malays and Chinese, but improvements are still necessary, particularly in the sensory properties before test marketing. The beef flavour was too strong and could possibly be reduced by decreasing the beef content and replacing it with <b>textured</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

Five experimental diets were formulated with increasing replacement levels of animal <b>protein</b> by <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein.</b> A total of 9000 individuals (initial mean weight 1. 18 ± 0. 12 g, initial mean length 2. 1 ± 0. 3 cm) were distributed in 20 net cages (1 m 3) with a density of 450 ind. m- 3. Cages were randomly placed in a pond (180 m 2, 1. 5 m deep, 10 % water renewal per day). After 63 days of cultivation, total count and individual biometrics from 20 % of each experimental unit were taken. Mean weight, total length, survival, feed conversion, biomass weight gain and proximate body composition were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized with five treatments and four replications. The reduction in the formulation cost achieved by increasing levels of <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein</b> compensated the slight decrease in biomass gain. Besides that, inclusion of <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein</b> resulted in greater fat deposition, suggesting future exploration of A. altiparanae as a functional food. ...|$|R
