The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants, dollar stores, and money changers. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas.|$|E

25|$|While {{speaking}} out against fascism, Negulescu was also critical of the authoritarian King Carol II who, from 1934, used {{the state of emergency}} against both the Iron Guard and liberal democrats. In March 1935, alongside envoys from other groups, he participated in negotiations with Grigore Filipescu's new Conservative Party, seeking a common platform against censorship and repression. Shortly before the start of World War II, Negulescu and Filipescu's political vision was defeated by the rise of successive fascist regimes. The first of these was the National Renaissance Front (FRN), established by Carol. As noted by scholar Maria Bucur, it formalized <b>the</b> <b>clientele</b> system that Negulescu had spoken out against. In February 1938, Averescu resigned the PP presidency and joined the king's supporters; Negulescu replaced him {{as the head of the}} moribund party, which survived until the authoritarian constitution came into force later that year, and possibly dissolved itself voluntarily.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty-six years {{most of the}} {{research}} on the ex-dividend day price behavior of common stocks has centered on either <b>the</b> tax-induced <b>clientele</b> hypothesis or <b>the</b> short-term trader hypothesis. However, neither theory has fully explained why, on average, the price drop-off on the ex-dividend day is less than the declared dividend. This paper investigates both of these hypotheses and introduces a new explanation. <b>The</b> tax-induced <b>clientele</b> hypothesis is considered by replicating the Elton and Gruber 1970 study and by examining the effects of the 1986 Tax Reform Act on ex-dividend day price movements during the years 1984 through 1988. The replication of the Elton and Gruber study in Chapter 2 will provide results contrary to <b>the</b> tax-induced <b>clientele</b> hypothesis. Also, <b>the</b> tax-induced <b>clientele</b> hypothesis cannot fully explain the price behavior of common stocks on ex-dividend days during the 1984 through 1988 period, as shown in Chapter 3. The short-term trader hypothesis is examined in Chapter 4 by determining if the actions of the short-term traders are truly riskless as proposed by Kalay (1982). If so, the price drop-off will be examined to see if these short-term traders are able to "arbitrage" the excess profits up to their marginal transaction costs. As with <b>the</b> tax-induced <b>clientele</b> hypothesis, <b>the</b> results will show that the short-term trader hypothesis cannot explain the ex-dividend day price movements of common stocks. A new explanation, a risk shift hypothesis, is considered in Chapter 5. This hypothesis proposes that the excess profits earned on the ex-dividend day are merely premiums for taking on more risk by holding securities during the ex-dividend day period. Unfortunately, the results do not support this theory...|$|R
