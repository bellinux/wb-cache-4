25|$|Anne {{undergoes}} {{surgery on}} a blocked carotid artery, but the surgery goes wrong, leaving her paralyzed {{on her right}} side and confined to a wheelchair. She makes Georges promise not to send {{her back to the}} hospital or into a nursing home. Georges becomes Anne's dutiful, though slightly irritated, caretaker. One day, Anne tells Georges that she doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heather died in 1943, and in 1944 Willis {{gave up the}} {{ownership}} of the school, which was transferred to a public body. She retired as headmistress in 1946, but intended <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> at Hill House, which had been built {{for her in the}} school's grounds. This led to her chosen successor moving to another school, and Willis decided to divide her time between Hill House and a second home at 38, Tedworth Square, Chelsea, London SW3. She kept up with old pupils and continued her interests in the Bermondsey Time and Talents Settlement and in the Girl Guides movement.|$|E
25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was my}} task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E

60|$|I {{was at a}} great school {{yesterday}} (St. Paul's), {{where for}} four hundred years they have been busy with brains, and building up England by producing Pepys, Miltons, and Marlboroughs. Six hundred boys left to {{nothing in the world}} but theoretical morality. I wanted to become the professor of practical morality, but the high master was away, so I suppose I shall have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> making my <b>living</b> the same old way--by adding practical to theoretical morality.|$|R
2500|$|The ban {{on private}} {{holdings}} ruined peasant life {{at its most}} basic level, according to Mirsky. Villagers were unable to secure enough food <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> because they were deprived by the commune system of their traditional means of being able to rent, sell, or use their land as collateral for loans. In one village, once the commune was operational the Party boss and his colleagues [...] "swung into manic action, herding villagers into the fields to sleep and to work intolerable hours, and forcing them to walk, starving, to distant additional projects." ...|$|E
2500|$|In All in the Family, Rob Reiner {{often did}} imitations of Groucho, and Sally Struthers dressed as Harpo in one episode {{in which she}} (as Gloria Stivic) and Rob (as Mike Stivic) were going to a Marx Brothers film festival, with Reiner {{dressing}} as Groucho. Gabe Kaplan did many Groucho imitations on his sit-com Welcome Back, Kotter and Robert Hegyes sometimes imitated both Chico and Harpo on the show. In Woody Allen's film Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Woody's character, after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, is inspired <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> after seeing a revival showing of Duck Soup. In Manhattan (1979), he names the Marx Brothers as something that makes life worth living. In an episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show Murray calls the new station owner at home late at night to complain when the song [...] "Hooray for Captain Spaulding" [...] is cut from a showing of Animal Crackers {{because of the new}} owners' policy to cut more and more from shows to sell more ad time, putting his job on the line.|$|E
2500|$|For years, the Prince {{has felt}} that he is dying, [...] "as if the vital fluid ... life itself in fact and perhaps even the will <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living,</b> were ebbing out of him ... as grains of sand cluster and then line up one by one, unhurried, unceasing, before the narrow neck of an hourglass." [...] A last minute visit to a doctor has tired him {{so much that it}} is decided that he should not go back to the villa outside Palermo, but shall stay in a hotel inside the city itself. As he settles into the hotel, the Prince contemplates the fates of several of his family members—Tancredi's {{political}} success in the new Kingdom of Italy, the deaths of Father Pirrone from old age, of Princess Maria from diabetes, and of Paolo after being thrown by a horse. He also recalls the maturation and dignity of Concetta—who, he realizes, is the true heir of what was noble and enduring of the Salina family. He dismisses Paolo's son and biological heir, Fabrizietto as dissolute, shallow, and aimless.|$|E
40|$|One {{benefit of}} the slow popularization of dialectical {{understanding}} is that fewer and fewer people are naive enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> claiming that <b>living</b> in a democracy means that they are free. We {{know that we are}} not. What passes for freedom is, we know only too well, a condition of relative civil liberation based on and expressed principally through the free consumption of commodities; the sham forms of political enfranchisement attendant on that free consumption are possible for us only because they are impossible for the masses of people who spend their lives in poverty and misery working to produce the commodities that we pick and choose. As popular political understanding becomes more dialectical, this fact becomes more and more obvious...|$|R

"Go back again, now {{you have}} seen us, and your outward eyes have learned {{that in spite of}} all the infallible maxims of your day there is yet a time of rest in store for the world, when mastery has changed into {{fellowship}} — but not before. Go back again, then, and while you live you will see all round you people engaged in making others live lives which are not their own, while they themselves care nothing for their own real lives — men who hate life though they fear death. Go back and be the happier for having seen us, for having added a little hope <b>to</b> your struggle. <b>Go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> while you may, striving, with whatsoever pain and labour needs must be, to build up little by little the new day of fellowship, and rest, and happiness." ...|$|R
