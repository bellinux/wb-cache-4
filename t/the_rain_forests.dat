5|$|P. fimbriata {{is found}} in <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Malaysia {{including}} Malacca, Indonesia, and in Australia's Northern Territory and Queensland. It lives on foliage, tree trunks, boulders, and rock walls. Throughout its range, {{this is the most}} common species of the genus Portia. Queensland specimens of P. fimbriata live near running water and where there is moderate light, while Northern Territory specimens live in caves where the light varies from rather dark at the back to much brighter around the mouths. Other populations of Portia also live with higher light levels than in Queensland, and some members of these other populations are found in webs exposed to direct sunlight for part of the day. In Queensland, P. fimbriata shares its environment with a common prey, the very abundant Jacksonoides queenslandicus, and with large populations of other non-Portia salticids and non-salticid web-building spiders.|$|E
5|$|Malick {{spent years}} working on other projects, {{including}} a stage production of Sansho the Bailiff and a script known as The English-Speaker, spending $2 {{million of the}} producers' money, half of which for writing. In 1990, he met with James Jones' widow Gloria and his daughter Kaylie about adapting The Thin Red Line into a film. By January 1995, Geisler and Roberdeau were broke and pressured Malick to decide which one he would complete. They approached Malick's former agent, Mike Medavoy, who was setting up his own production company, Phoenix Pictures, and he agreed to give them $100,000 to start work on The Thin Red Line. Medavoy had a deal with Sony Pictures and Malick began scouting locations in Panama and Costa Rica before settling on <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of northern Australia. In April 1997, three months before filming, Sony pulled the plug while crews were building the sets in Queensland, because new studio chairman John Calley did not think Malick could make his movie with the proposed $52 million budget. Malick traveled to Los Angeles with Medavoy to pitch the project to various studios. 20th Century Fox agreed to put up $39 million of the budget with the stipulation that Malick cast five movie stars {{from a list of}} 10 who were interested. Pioneer Films, a Japanese company, contributed $8 million to the budget, and Phoenix added $3 million.|$|E

Eucalyptus forests thrive where <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> have been cleared but even here rainforest plants typically dominate the understorey.|$|E

25|$|The {{other half}} of the zoo is the Wilds of Africa. Opened in 1990, it was the first exhibit to feature all of the major {{habitats}} of Africa. Visitors can visit <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests,</b> mountains, woodlands, rivers, deserts, and bush of Africa. The Nature Trail takes visitors through the rain forest past two large, naturalistic gorilla habitats. Nile crocodiles, wattled cranes, and a few other animals are seen before the Forest Aviary. In the middle of the forest is the Kopje, home to rock hyraxes, klipspringers, and meerkats. The rain forest/watering hole is also home to hippopotamus and okapi, which, {{in the case of the}} latter,zoo is famous for in both its breeding and research. About 20 percent of okapi in zoos in the U.S. and Japan can trace their lineage back to it.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Russell Marker, a {{professor}} of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from sarsaparilla, which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the saponin from inedible Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana and Dioscorea composita) found in <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of Veracruz near Orizaba. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety diosgenin. Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the barbasco yam had started and {{the period of the}} heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 October, Rael sat mesmerized and listened to a 3 hour lecture from Yahweh Elohim about his {{religions}} and philosophers, the need for geniocracy, Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism, and about the ideas of God and Soul, and later traveled to the Planet of the Eternals. The planet orbited around a very large star and had a climate similar to <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of Earth. He later {{sat down with the}} Eloha and had a meal with the major prophets including Buddha, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed. A guide showed him installations that housed machines for creating biological robots. He gave a picture of his mother to a machine which created similarly-appearing biological robot. That night, he received an introduction to build his future home at the Planet of the Eternals and was presented young, mature female biological robots. He said that before reaching a climax, he wore a helmet which played music controlled by his thoughts, which the females danced to. Then the climax happens.|$|E

25|$|Locust swarms {{fly with}} the wind at roughly {{the speed of the}} wind. They can cover from 100 to 200 {{kilometers}} in a day, and will fly up to about 2,000 meters above sea level (thereafter, it becomes too cold). Therefore, swarms cannot cross tall mountain ranges such as the Atlas, the Hindu Kush or the Himalayas. They will not venture into <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of Africa nor into central Europe. However, locust adults and swarms regularly cross the Red Sea between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and are even reported to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Caribbean in ten days during the 1987-89 plague. A single swarm can cover up to 1200 square kilometers and can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer (a total of around 50 to 100 billion locusts per swarm, representing 100,000 to 200,000 tons, considering an average mass of 2 grams per cricket). The locust can live between three and six months, and there is a ten to 16-fold increase in locust numbers {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E

500|$|The {{habitat of}} the cat {{includes}} <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of South and Central America, open, seasonally flooded wetlands, and dry grassland terrain. Of these habitats, the jaguar much prefers dense forest; the cat has lost range most rapidly in regions of drier habitat, such as the Argentine pampas, the arid grasslands of Mexico, and the southwestern United States. The cat will range across tropical, subtropical, and dry deciduous forests (including, historically, oak forests in the United States). The jaguar prefers to live by rivers, swamps, and in dense rainforest with thick cover for stalking prey. Jaguars have been found at elevations as high as 3,800m, but they typically avoid montane forest and are {{not found in the}} high plateau of central Mexico or in the Andes.
