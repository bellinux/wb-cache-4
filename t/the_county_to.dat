5|$|CR26 has {{continued}} to deteriorate in the years since, with one , limited maintenance segment seeing the most wear.

5|$|The Diet of 1468 {{authorized}} Matthias to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax {{to finance the}} new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf {{that he would not}} demand such charges in the future.

5|$|All {{of what is}} now NY18F {{south of}} Youngstown was {{originally}} designated as part of NY34 in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY34 became part of NY18, which was extended north to Youngstown and east to Rochester as part of the renumbering. NY18 was originally state-maintained from the village of Lewiston to Youngstown; however, the state of New York relinquished ownership and maintenance of NY18 between Center Street in Lewiston and the village of Youngstown on July24, 1947. The section within the village of Lewiston was transferred to village control, while the remainder of the route was given to Niagara County. In December 1947, Lewiston petitioned <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>to</b> also assume maintenance of the portion of NY18 within the village; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, {{largely in the}} form of freezing rain, ice, and snow. From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, and continued to deepen for several more hours. Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas. The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6inches in the far eastern parts of <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>to</b> only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County.|$|E
5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} had left <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>to</b> search for armed resistance {{in other parts}} of Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by Republicans that the cabin was a fort. A structure that may have once been this cabin was rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, the soldiers who left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E

5|$|Due to an archaic law in Erie County, {{the town}} of Tonawanda and {{the town of}} Amherst, who {{completed}} the road in 1925, were requested in 1935 to take over $2million (1935USD) in debts bonded for its construction. The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new road a financial burden for <b>the</b> <b>county.</b> <b>To</b> make things worse, the new road did not bring the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake {{on the part of the}} county and towns.|$|E
5|$|Facing Hampshire in Southampton for {{the third}} match, Somerset won the toss and opted to bat first. The pitch was soft, due to the heavy {{rainfall}} through the morning, and play started shortly after midday. Sainsbury was yet again one of few Somerset players to reach double figures, and they were bowled out for 101. Cecil Currie, a spin bowler for Hampshire, collected eight of the wickets. Somerset managed to restrict Hampshire's lead to 46 runs; Francis Reed took four wickets, and Fothergill three. Fowler and Fothergill were Somerset's most successful batsmen in their second innings, played mostly in light rain, helping <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>to</b> reach 118 runs. That left Hampshire requiring 73 runs to win, which the hosts achieved without losing any wickets, to beat Somerset with ten wickets to spare.|$|E
5|$|In April 1931, Siamese King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambai Barni {{traveled}} from Bangkok to Ophir Hall (currently Reid Hall of Manhattanville College).

From Chicago, they took another train, departing at 10:30a.m. on the 21st and arriving at noon on the 22nd, and the trip took 25 hours; the king had requested the train travel slowly, as he was recovering from bronchitis and malaria. The train arrived at the Scarborough station, where journalists, spectators, and video and still photographers met them, along with one of their hosts; they were later driven across <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>to</b> stay at Ophir Hall for about six weeks {{in order for a}} cataract operation could be performed by a New York doctor on the king's left eye.

5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white students from <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>to</b> voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of black students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY93 was realigned to use Junction and Upper Mountain Roads instead. As a result, NY270 was {{cut back to}} its {{junction}} with Upper Mountain Road. On November1, 2005, the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure that, if passed, would allow <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>to</b> ask the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to remove the NY93 designation from Upper Mountain Road, a county-maintained highway, and reassign it to Junction Road (NY270) and Saunders Settlement Road (NY31). The change was intended to eliminate truck traffic on Upper Mountain Road while providing additional capacity to NY93. This part of the agenda was passed. NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006, rerouting NY93 as proposed and truncating NY270 southward to NY31.|$|E
5|$|M-139 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} highway entirely within Berrien County in the US {{state of}} Michigan.

The highway runs parallel to the St. Joseph River, crossing the river several times as it follows a set of roads previously used for US31 in the area.
