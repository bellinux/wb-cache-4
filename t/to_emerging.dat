5|$|Johngarthia lagostoma {{lives in}} burrows among vegetation, at altitudes of up <b>to</b> , <b>emerging</b> {{at night to}} feed on plant matter and {{occasionally}} on animals. From January to March there is an annual migration to the sea to release the planktonic larvae. The species was first described (as Gecarcinus lagostoma) by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837 from material sent {{to him by the}} naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, collected by the French ship Astrolabe.|$|E

5|$|Kate {{made its}} first {{landfall}} on the northern coast of Cuba at this intensity prior <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of November19. Once clear of land, it began to strengthen quickly, becoming a Category3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h) the following day. On November21, a cold front moving across the Mississippi Valley resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone, and Kate came ashore near Mexico Beach, Florida, as a minimal Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (160km/h). Gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the Southeast United States coastline, and Kate transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on November23, a day after exiting the coastline of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Barbara {{strengthened}} into {{a hurricane}} around 1800UTC on May29 while located about 65mi (105km) east-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. At its peak intensity {{as it was}} making landfall, it had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983mbar (hPa; 29.03inHg). With this intensity, Barbara made landfall {{on the coast of}} Tonalá, Chiapas at approximately 1950UTC. This marked both the easternmost and second earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966. As Barbara moved inland within the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, rapid dissipation occurred. The cloud tops warmed and Barbara degenerated into a tropical storm at 0000UTC on May30. This was followed by a downgrade to tropical depression nine hours later as Barbara's low-level circulation was disrupted by the mountainous terrain. Very early on May 31, the surface circulation of Barbara soon dissipated about 25mi (40km) north-northwest of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, prior <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm's associated leftover moisture partially contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Andrea in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Other new {{features}} include Internet Worm Protection to block worms, which scan IP addresses for open ports. It also blocks inbound ports based on known and suspected exploits using signatures and heuristics. The {{addition of the}} feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal confidential information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a whitelist of sites where confidential information can be transmitted. Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. The Browser Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as the browser and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements.|$|E

Believing that {{the second coming of}} Christ was imminent, these Christians expected an endtime revival of apostolic power, spiritual gifts, and miracle—working. Figures such as Dwight L.

25|$|Both Gheorghiu-Dej and Drăghici opposed de-Stalinization, {{but their}} talk of {{national}} communism and socialist patriotism signaled Romania's emancipation from the Soviet Union. Drăghici still had important assignments after Gheorghiu-Dej's death, but was bitterly opposed <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu used his {{influence in the}} party to incriminate Drăghici of all publicly known Securitate crimes, then deposed him. Drăghici was not brought to justice, but lived in anonymity in the Bucharest area from 1968 to 1989. He lived his final years in Hungary, with his family, despite Romanian efforts to have him extradited. Shortly before his death, a trial held in absentia convicted him of incitement to murder.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} problem {{therefore is}} how {{to ensure that the}} appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived {{in various parts of the}} social system.|$|E
