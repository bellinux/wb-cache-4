Tax credits, on the other hand, are perceived as more equitable since the after tax benefit of the incentive is not tied to the marginal tax rate of the donor. Additional tax favored approaches have been proposed for organ donation, including providing: tax credits {{to the families of}} deceased donors (seeking to encourage consent), refundable tax credits (similar to the earned income credit) to provide greater <b>tax</b> <b>equity</b> among potential donors, and charitable deductions for the donation of blood or organs.|$|E
25|$|A {{flat tax}} system and income taxes overall are not {{inherently}} border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported {{to a foreign}} country (see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price). Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would impact the global competitiveness of a country. However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed Border <b>Tax</b> <b>Equity</b> Act in the U.S. attempts this). Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit {{is a violation of}} the World Trade Organization agreement. Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally.|$|E

Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, standard deduction, and earned income tax credit. The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E

Despite the continu-ing policy debate {{on the level of}} dividend and capital gains taxes, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the effects of <b>tax</b> changes on <b>equity</b> valuations. This study investigates empirically whether changes in investment tax rates had an impact on US equity prices over the period between 1913 and 2006. My paper contrasts two hypotheses of whether taxes are capitalized into equity valuations. Under the tax capitalization hypothesis, aggregate equity valuation measures are inversely related to the <b>tax</b> burden on <b>equity</b> securities. In this case, an increase in investment tax rates reduces the valuation of equity securities generating higher expected before-tax returns. The higher expected returns compensate taxable investors for their increased tax burden. Thus, aggregate equity valu-ation levels should be relatively low during time periods when investment taxes are high. In contrast to the tax capitalization hypothesis, Merton H. Miller and Myron S.

[...] The fact that tax receipts as a percentage of GDP fell following the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 shows a decrease in tax burden as share of GDP and a commensurate increase in the deficit, as spending did not fall relative to GDP.

40|$|The {{increase}} in international capital mobility {{over the past}} two decades has put pressure on the tax treatment of corporate equity income. Corporate level taxes distort investment flows across locations and create opportunities for tax avoidance by shifting income across jurisdictions. Outward flows of capital shift part of the burden of the corporate level <b>tax</b> on <b>equity</b> income from capital to labor, thereby making its incidence less progressive. Individual level <b>taxes</b> on corporate <b>equity</b> income lower the after-tax return to savings but have less distorting effects on investment location and are more likely to fall on owners of capital than workers. This logic suggests there may be both efficiency gains and increases in progressivity from shifting <b>taxes</b> on corporate <b>equity</b> income from the corporate to the shareholder level. We discuss these effects and estimate the distributional effects of raising shareholder-level <b>taxes</b> on corporate <b>equity</b> income and using the revenue to cut the corporate tax rate. We find that taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income (subject to a maximum 28 percent rate on long-term capital gains) would finance a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to about 26 percent, assuming no behavioral responses. While the distributional effect depends on what one assumes about the incidence of the corporate income tax, our results suggest that even if the corporate income tax is paid entirely by capital income, the reform would make the tax system more progressive...|$|R
