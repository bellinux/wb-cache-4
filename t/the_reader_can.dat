5|$|In 2002, Chabon {{published}} Summerland, {{a fantasy}} novel written for younger readers that received mixed reviews but sold extremely well, {{and won the}} 2003 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. Two years later, he published The Final Solution, a novella about an investigation led by an unknown old man, whom <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> guess to be Sherlock Holmes, during {{the final years of}} World War II. His Dark Horse Comics project The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, a quarterly anthology series that was published from 2004 to 2006, purported to cull stories from an involved, fictitious 60-year history of the Escapist character created by the protagonists of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. It was awarded the 2005 Eisner Award for Best Anthology and a pair of Harvey Awards for Best Anthology and Best New Series.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{original}} version had included Sheikh Patrash Pasha showing Tintin a copy of Tintin in America, in the 1955 version this was changed to the earlier Tintin in the Congo, and Hergé would change it again for subsequent printings, this time to Destination Moon (1953), an Adventure set chronologically after Cigars. Benoît Peeters exclaimed that with this scene, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> imagine Tintin's surprise at encountering an adventure {{he had not yet}} had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom he had not yet met. Another anachronism in this version appears when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall, the ancestral home of Captain Haddock, from the much later volumes of the series. Harry Thompson opined that the most important changes to the book were artistic, for in the late 1950s Hergé was {{at the peak of his}} artistic ability.|$|E
25|$|Syntax {{highlighting}} is {{one strategy}} {{to improve the}} readability and context of the text; especially for code that spans several pages. <b>The</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> easily ignore large sections of comments or code, depending on what they are looking for.|$|E

25|$|To be proved, a theorem must be expressible as a precise, formal statement. Nevertheless, theorems {{are usually}} {{expressed}} in natural language {{rather than in}} a completely symbolic form, with the intention that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> produce a formal statement from the informal one.|$|E
25|$|The tone of {{the book}} is far more romantic and tragic than the average Simon Templar books. In most books of the series, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> know in advance that no matter what terrible threats and perils Templar would face, he would survive them all and live to have new adventures in the next book and the next.|$|E
25|$|Reading: to read {{a person}} is to {{highlight}} and exaggerate all of the flaws of a person, from their ridiculous clothes, to their flawed makeup and anything else <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> come up with. It is a battle of wit, in which the winner is one who gets the crowd to laugh the most.|$|E

25|$|In computing, a hyperlink, {{or simply}} a link, is a {{reference}} to data that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called anchor text. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system, {{and to create a}} hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to link). A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext.|$|E
25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There are moments in when <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, {{rather than an}} imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. It is as if Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in his manner of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E
25|$|Signaling {{between the}} reader and the tag is done in several {{different}} incompatible ways, depending on the frequency band used by the tag. Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, {{very close to the}} reader antenna because they are {{only a small percentage of}} a wavelength away. In this near field region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in the reader. The tag can modulate the field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can backscatter a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's interrogation signal.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of leet is its unique approach to orthography, using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in a word. For more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use homoglyphs, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixed—anything that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the argot (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the average reader cannot make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself try to make sense, if deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords. Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore) require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.|$|E
500|$|Academic Leona W. Fisher {{wrote in}} Children's Literature Association Quarterly {{that the novel}} employs a seldom used yet ingenious {{literary}} technique: {{the story is told}} with [...] "the sustained internal monologue presented almost exclusively in the present tense". The mores of his society and the actions of adults are strained through Marty's mind concurrently with his emotional agony and ethical judgments. The dialogue of the other characters tempers but does not counteract the [...] "exclusivity of his linguistic point of view" [...] because Marty is the sole narrator. Shiloh has a [...] "compacted time-frame, bounded by the past-tense opening and closing". Fisher noted that because the novel's events are confined to several weeks in the summer, {{there is no need for}} a [...] "panoramic sweep" [...] of the actions. <b>The</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> concentrate solely on Marty's ethical crisis. Conveying the mood of the novel is also mostly confined to Marty's thoughts and current action. Naylor uses the past-perfect verb [...] "had" [...] on several occasions to depict the tones of the scenes. This usage conveys turning-points in the story, transferring the reader from the [...] "immediate tension" [...] of the present to a growing cognizance.|$|E
500|$|Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up, is [...] "largely a {{selection}} of his best blog postings {{over the past few}} years related to climate change issues". TreeHugger describes the book as [...] "a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change, the media that so badly neglects it, the politicians who attempt to address it (and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore [...] science), and the clean energy solutions that could help get us out of the mess." [...] In 2011, Romm sat on the panel of the Green Car Summit of the Washington Auto Show. His 2012 book, Language Intelligence, concerns persuasion and the effective use of rhetoric. [...] Ed Markey commented on the book, [...] "Joe masterfully ... scripts ways to master the metaphor, and incorporate irony. Solutions <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> use for speeches, social media, or just winning the debate around the kitchen table." [...] Romm wrote an article for Time magazine in August 2012 using the research from Language Intelligence to analyze whether Mitt Romney or Barack Obama is the more effective communicator. In speeches and lectures since then, Romm has advocated that scientists use the principles of effective communication outlined in the book (instead of their usual, technical, neutral style) to better explain the dangers of, and solutions to, climate change to lay people and the media.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} this stage, {{before the}} reader becomes an expert reader, many {{processes}} are starting to become automatic.

2500|$|One {{question}} {{in the realm of}} language comprehension is how people understand sentences as they read (also known as sentence processing). Experimental research has spawned a number of theories about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. Typically these theories are concerned with what types of information contained in the sentence <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> use to build meaning, and at what point in reading does that information become available to the reader. Issues such as [...] "modular" [...] versus [...] "interactive" [...] processing have been theoretical divides in the field.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new trend}} in {{newspaper}} publishing {{is the introduction}} of personalization through on-demand printing technologies or with online news aggregator websites like Google news.
