50|$|In {{molecular}} biology and genetics, {{upstream and downstream}} both refer to relative positions in DNA or RNA. Each strand of DNA or RNA has a 5' end and a 3' end, so named for the carbon position on the deoxyribose (or ribose) ring. By convention, upstream and downstream relate to the 5' to 3' direction in which RNA transcription takes place. Upstream is <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> 5' <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> RNA molecule and downstream is <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> 3' <b>end.</b> When considering double-stranded DNA, upstream is <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> 5' <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> coding strand for the gene in question and downstream is <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> 3' <b>end.</b> Due to <b>the</b> anti-parallel nature of DNA, this means <b>the</b> 3' <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> template strand is upstream of the gene and <b>the</b> 5' <b>end</b> is downstream.|$|R
