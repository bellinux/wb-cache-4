5|$|An {{analogy is}} also made between Gawain's {{trial and the}} Biblical test <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> {{encounters}} in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing {{him to become a}} better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.|$|E

5000|$|When Adams died in 1983, he left Hoskins Â£1000, which [...] "somewhat embarrassed" [...] Hoskins. Hoskins {{gave it to}} charity. In 1984, Hoskins {{published}} {{a book about the}} case: [...] "Two Men Were Acquitted: The trial and acquittal of Doctor John Bodkin Adams". He reiterated his belief <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> was innocent but conceded <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> had been naive in his behaviour and too avaricious in his chase of patients' bequests.|$|R
5000|$|Later <b>that</b> month, <b>Adams</b> {{testified before}} a federal court that he injured his leg in the College All-Star Game while playing for Green Bay in 1945 and was not, as the Rams claimed, a player of [...] "unique ability". Red Conkright, a {{one-time}} Rams assistant {{who moved to the}} Browns' staff, testified <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> was an [...] "erratic" [...] kicker and [...] "at present a second team player". At the end of the month, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for the Browns. The judge rejected the Rams' contention <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> therefore had no obligation to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams. Four other former Rams players joined the Browns along with Adams: Tommy Colella, Don Greenwood, Mike Scarry and Gaylon Smith.|$|R
2500|$|Former Belfast IRA {{commander}} Brendan Hughes {{has named}} Adams as ordering {{the murder and}} secret burial of Jean McConville in 1972. McConville {{was one of the}} 16 [...] "Disappeared", who were abducted and killed during the Troubles. Former republican prisoner Evelyn Gilroy, who was active in Divis where McConville was abducted, says <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> was the only person in a position to order the murder. Among the abductors of McConville was Dolours Price, who has claimed that she did so on the orders of Adams. Hughes and Price also claimed <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> was involved in approving IRA bomb attacks in London in the early 1970s. Former Garda Detective Superintendent PJ Browne has claimed <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> was [...] "the leader of the psychotic IRA unit in Belfast in the early 1970s".|$|R
5|$|Usually, {{the episodes}} {{are focused on}} Adam's {{experiences}} at Charles Darwin Middle School due to his inability {{to fit in with}} his anthropomorphic schoolmates, the challenges that he must face (such as the presumed stupidity of his peers, being schooled in subjects of use only to animals, the introductions of new students of odd, dangerous, or fictional species to the school or the misadventures <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> stumbles into with them, or the common effects of adolescence as they are experienced by zoo animals).|$|E
5|$|After {{not telling}} anyone about hitting Delia, Adam fears the {{investigation}} is closing in on him. He names Jack Connor's godfather and makes him promise to protect him should anything happen to him, and then proposes to Chelsea again and asks her to move to Paris with him, like they had planned during their first marriage. At the same time, Victor's private investigation on the hit-and-run driver leads him to Adam. He agrees to not turn him in {{as long as he}} can take part in Connor's life; a role he had initially refused him. Adam agrees as he and Chelsea remarry. Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) puts the pieces together and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them staggers away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes. Adam's body is thrown from the vehicle, is not recovered and he is presumed dead, devastating Chelsea just as news <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> killed Delia breaks. However, Adam's bloody hand is later shown to be moving, alluding that he survived. Soon after, he is shown to be lying in a bed, being held captive by an unknown captor. Later Victor informs Chelsea that his investigators have found Adam's remains, but elsewhere Adam is seen paying off Victor's investigator, confirming <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> has faked his death.|$|E
5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E
50|$|On November 25, 2016, Howard Shore {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> {{was working}} on a book that will cover the music of The Hobbit films.|$|R
25|$|In the Doctor Who 2012 Christmas episode The Snowmen, writer Steven Moffat was {{inspired}} by a storyline <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> pitched called The Doctor Retires.|$|R
50|$|Note: Some {{reference}} books claim <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> managed a laundry in London after her retirement, {{but do not}} cite reliable primary sources for this.|$|R
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from the prophetic books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from On Plagiarism, an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and hell, arguing <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, even those condemned to hell.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} how William Adam became a {{successful}} architect from these beginnings, but by 1721 he was engaged on major projects at Floors Castle, where he executed a design by Vanbrugh, and designing extensions to Hopetoun House. John Gifford links Adam's rise with the retirement of James Smith, the most prominent architect of the early 18th century, who was in his 70s by this time. Like Smith, Adam was a trained mason, had social connections through his family, and had the financial backing of successful business ventures. It was in 1721 <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> became a Freemason being initiated in The Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel), No.1.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} begins nine months later. Rachel and Adam move into their first house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} {{that she has been}} married for over six years. She contacts her husband Kris Bumstead (Lennie James) and after briefly considering going back to him and dumping Adam, she gets the divorce. After a misunderstanding with Karen, Rachel worries <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> has stopped finding her sexually attractive, and they agree to indulge in each other's sexual fantasies. Rachel shares her with Adam: to have sex in a shop window. Adam arranges to get the keys to a shop, and he and Rachel act out her fantasy, though are arrested when a ramraider leads the police to them.|$|E
50|$|On 4 February 2010 the BBC {{reported}} <b>that</b> Irene <b>Adams</b> {{had been}} told by Sir Thomas Legg to repay an amount of 5050 pounds. The Sunday Post reported in November 2014 <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> had claimed Â£53,000 of expenses during a period when she did not speak in debate or submit any written questions.|$|R
5000|$|Biographer John Ferling {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> {{made the}} most of juror selection during the jury selection stage of the trial, saying <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> [...] "expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles." [...] Hiller B. Zobel is a scholar who has closely studied the trial, and he concluded, [...] "we can be fairly sure that before a single witness had been sworn, the outcome of the trial was certain." [...] Ferling also surmises <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.|$|R
25|$|On 17 June 2013 it was {{announced}} by Surrey County Cricket Club <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> had been sacked, along with his first team coach Ian Salisbury.|$|R
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he believed <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Holly {{runs away}} from home and a {{large-scale}} police investigation is put in place to find her. Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat. Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him. After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma. Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having {{to accept the fact that}} Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> would take her back.|$|E
5|$|On the High Street, No. 106 and 107 {{stand on}} the site of Tackley's Inn; built around 1295, it was the first piece of {{property}} <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> de Brome acquired when he began to found the college in 1324. It comprised a hall and chambers leased to scholars, behind a frontage of five shops, with the scholars above and a cellar of five bays below. The hall, which was open to the roof, was 33feet (10m) long, 20feet (6m) wide, and about 22feet (7m) high; at the east end was a large chamber with another chamber above it. The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window. The cellar below is of the same date and is the best preserved medieval cellar in Oxford; originally entered by stone steps from the street, it has a stone vault divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs, with carved corbels.|$|E
60|$|Thus adjured, Thursday October {{took the}} pincers, and gazed {{with a look}} of great anxiety into the {{cavernous}} mouth <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> opened to his view.|$|R
50|$|On April 30, 2012, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars as an undrafted free agent. He was waived on September 1, 2012.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} on The Modern Musician podcast <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> has written book titled Impossible Silence, which covers silent films {{and the history}} of film music.|$|R
5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive. The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff noted his {{enjoyment}} of the storyline, but he mostly enjoyed the episode's inclusion and voice work of Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. He also commented favorably on the gags that describe Russia as filled with bears on unicycles and <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> West {{turns out to be}} the Russian sleeper agent. He criticized the improv comedy storyline, and commented that improv troupes and 1980s comedies are lazy targets. He graded the episode a B, tying with The Simpsons and American Dad!, and beating its spin-off The Cleveland Show. IGN Television critic Ahsan Haque gave the episode a mixed review, stating that he did not like the improv storyline, and he was not amused with Peter's usage of Joe's American flag as toilet paper. However, he praised the scene that involved Stewie's, Brian's, Chevy Chase's, and Dan Aykroyd's travel to Russia, and he ultimately gave the episode 7.7 out of 10.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear My Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play himâEnglish writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youthâbut Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E
5|$|The script of Human Revolution {{was written}} by Mary DeMarle, who was {{narrative}} director and main writer. While she did act as chief writer, DeMarle also worked {{on a number of}} other people throughout development so the story could be conveyed through environments and dialogue, along with handling how its progression was influenced by player choices. Sheldon Pacotti, main writer for the first two Deus Ex titles, was brought in as story consultant during the early stages, and was also contacted regularly through production to ensure that the storyline fitted properly within the series chronology. A total of four writers worked on the game, including author James Swallow. DeMarle was brought onto the project four months into its development, after it had been decided that it would be prequel to the first game, focusing on mechanical rather than nanotechnological enhancement technology. As part of her research, DeMarle looked up multiple subjects, from speculated conspiracy theories to the current level of biotechnology: the final story was influenced in large part by her reading of non-fiction and writings concerning transhumanism. DeMarle compared the game's study of transhumanism through main character Adam to that in the 1982 film Blade Runner, while also using the video game medium to put questions surrounding the ethics and motivations surrounding transhumanism in a nuanced way. She also stated <b>that</b> <b>Adam</b> being forced to confront these issues in person was the narrative's central irony, something that had previously been explored using different narrative elements in Deus Ex. The ending, which was ultimately decided using a choice of buttons, was chosen because of technical and time constraints while retaining player interaction. While the gameplay evolved continually through development and some elements required cutting, the story remained almost unchanged, instead being further refined and improved to work out plot holes.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{announcement}} of the discovery, Herschel, Challis and Richard Sheepshanks, foreign secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, announced <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> had already calculated the planet's characteristics and position. Airy, at length, published an account of the circumstances, and Adams's memoir was printed as an appendix to the Nautical Almanac. However, it appears that the version published by Airy had been edited by the omission of a [...] "crucial phrase" [...] to disguise the fact <b>that</b> <b>Adams</b> had quoted only mean longitude and not the orbital elements.|$|R
2500|$|Orchard (1997) {{states that}} [...] "it is unclear {{to what extent}} Adam's {{description}} has a basis in historical fact rather than lurid fiction" [...] yet <b>that</b> <b>Adam's</b> account contains [...] "a good deal of useful information (as well as considerable speculation)." [...] Orchard points out <b>that</b> <b>Adam's</b> description of the temple has often been questioned [...] "on several levels" [...] and that Thietmar of Merseburg produced a considerably less detailed but similar account of sacrifices held in Lejre, Denmark earlier in the 11th century.|$|R
