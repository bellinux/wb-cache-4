25|$|The London Underground 1960 Stock was a {{class of}} {{electric}} multiple unit for the London Underground Central line. Twelve motor cars were supplied by Cravens, and pairs were made up to four cars {{by the addition of}} two converted standard <b>stock</b> <b>trailers.</b> A production run of 338 motor cars was shelved, due to the time needed to assess the new features and the cost of converting the trailer cars. Some of the pre-1938 trailers were later replaced by 1938 <b>stock</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The set was {{originally}} numbered 900 {{in the old}} hauled carriage set number series, but this was amended in February 1966 to 701 in the new series for trailer control units. Despite this, and its designation as 7-TC (7-car <b>Trailer</b> Control <b>stock),</b> {{it was not a}} real trailer control unit in that a locomotive could not be operated remotely from the unit's driving cars.|$|R
5000|$|The least {{expensive}} type of <b>trailer</b> is the <b>stock</b> <b>trailer,</b> a trailer designed for cattle that is enclosed on the bottom, but has slits at approximately the eye {{level of the}} animals to allow ventilation. Trailers designed specifically for horses are more elaborate. Because horses are usually hauled {{for the purpose of}} competition or work, where they must arrive in peak physical condition, horse trailers are designed for the comfort and safety of the animals. They usually have adjustable vents and windows as well as suspension designed to provide a smooth ride and less stress on the animals.|$|R
50|$|The first {{coaches of}} the first batch (1927) had Westinghouse brakes, Metro-Vickers control systems and MV153 motors; {{they were used to}} replace the motor cars working with Bogie <b>Stock</b> <b>trailers</b> that formed 'W' trains.|$|R
50|$|The Q38 stock {{consisted}} of 25 driving motor cars and 183 trailers. Motor cars were numbered in the District line 4xxx series whilst the trailer cars were numbered with the O and P <b>stock</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R
50|$|After World War II it {{was decided}} to replace the London Underground trains that {{remained}} with hand-operated sliding doors. R Stock was ordered to replace such trains on the District line and the LPTB considered 200 cars were needed, but due to the shortages of labour and materials following the war only 143 new cars were authorised. Some Q <b>stock</b> <b>trailers</b> that had been built in 1938 were converted into R Stock driving motor (DM) cars. The new cars were designated R47 and built by Birmingham RC&W and Gloucester RC&W and the 82 Q <b>Stock</b> <b>trailers</b> converted by Gloucester RC&W from Q38 trailer were designated R38/1. The first car arrived in 1949 and entered service in 1950.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>stock</b> <b>{{trailers}}</b> {{and horse}} trailers {{range in size}} from small units capable of holding one to three animals, able to be pulled by a pickup truck or even an SUV; to large semi-trailers that can haul a significant number of animals.|$|R
50|$|Thirty {{cars were}} built, twenty-six driving motor cars and four <b>trailers.</b> The E <b>stock</b> {{was based on}} the earlier C Stock and D Stock but {{differed}} in that the roof was elliptical rather than the clerestory roof of the C Stock and D Stock.|$|R
25|$|A60 and A62 {{stocks were}} nearly {{identical}} in appearance. The most {{significant differences were}} the border around the destination window on A62 motor cars and the make of compressor under the <b>trailer</b> cars: A60 <b>stock</b> used the Westinghouse DHC 5A, A62 cars the Reavell TBC 38Z.|$|R
50|$|Horses {{and other}} {{livestock}} are allowed on some trails but not others. They {{are not allowed}} near the visitor center, or in the Sus or Signal Hill picnic areas. The Cam Boh, El Camino del Cerro, and Sendero Esperanza trailheads have parking places for <b>stock</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A60 and A62 {{stocks were}} nearly {{identical}} in appearance. The most {{significant differences were}} the border around the destination window on A62 motor cars and the make of compressor under the <b>trailer</b> cars: A60 <b>stock</b> used the Westinghouse DHC 5A, A62 cars the Reavell TBC 38Z.|$|R
50|$|During World War II several {{cars were}} lost. 14199 (O stock DM) was {{destroyed}} at Neasden on 27 September 1940, 13036, 14042, 14049 (all O stock DM), 13229, 14229 (all P Stock DM), 014080 (O <b>stock</b> <b>trailer)</b> at Moorgate station on 29 December 1941, and 14263 (P stock DM) at Baker Street on 10 May 1941. To {{make up for}} the number of 'D' end DMs (14xxx) cars destroyed, three 'D' end trailer cars were rebuilt into DMs. These were 014270-014272 which were renumbered 14270-14272 when converted. DM 14233 was damaged during bombing and one end of the car was destroyed. This was repaired using an end of Q38 <b>Stock</b> <b>trailer</b> 013167, which had also been badly damaged. The rebuilt car entered service renumbered 14233 in 1941; it became 54233 in 1963.|$|R
25|$|Because {{of their}} shorter {{wheelbase}} {{and the smaller}} motor-generator set designed for one <b>trailer</b> only, 36/42 <b>stock</b> units were kept for the Johnsonville line as much as possible. Similarly, the three-car sets of 1946 stock were kept for use on the Paekakariki, Melling and Upper Hutt services due to their greater passenger-carrying capacity and reduced brake capacity on steep lines.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s the East London Line was {{worked by}} 1938 Stock trains, {{replacing}} trains of Q Stock. Single 1938 <b>Stock</b> <b>trailer</b> carriages were also inserted into 1960 Stock trains {{in the mid}} 80's; these were used on the Woodford-Hainault and Epping-Ongar sections of the Central line. In addition, unit 10177 (latterly shipped to Alderney) worked the Epping-Ongar shuttle between 11/57 and 6/60.|$|R
50|$|It had {{originally}} been planned that three trailer cars would be inserted into the three streamlined units, to lengthen them from six- to seven-car units. These would have been similar to 1938 <b>stock</b> <b>trailers</b> except {{that they had no}} compressors. After the war these three cars instead became part of the 1938 Stock and were numbered 012412 - 012414, being fitted with compressors.|$|R
50|$|Once {{returned}} to the Central, cars were not compatible with the 1903 tube stock. Because of this the different stock were given nicknames, the 1915 stock {{became known as the}} 'Ealing Stock' while the 1903 stock became known as 'Tunnel Stock' or 'Local Stock'. As no trailer cars had been built several 1900 <b>stock</b> <b>trailers</b> were modified to run with them.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a number}} of {{different}} styles of trailers used to haul livestock such as cattle and horses. The most common is the <b>stock</b> <b>trailer,</b> a trailer that is enclosed on the bottom, but has openings at approximately the eye level of the animals to allow ventilation. The horse trailer is a more elaborate form of <b>stock</b> <b>trailer.</b> Because horses are usually hauled for the purpose of competition or work, where they must be in peak physical condition, horse trailers are designed for the comfort and safety of the animals. They usually have adjustable vents and windows as well as suspension designed to provide a smooth ride and less stress on the animals. In addition, horse trailers have internal partitions that assist the animal in staying upright during travel and protect horses from injuring each other in transit. Larger horse trailers may incorporate additional storage areas for horse tack and may even include elaborate living quarters with sleeping areas, bathroom and cooking facilities, and other comforts.|$|R
50|$|After World War II the {{streamlined}} cab DMs were rebuilt into trailers for {{use with}} the 1938 Stock. These cars were renumbered 012477 - 012494. As trailers they were easily identifiable from 1938 <b>Stock</b> <b>trailers,</b> with only three windows between the end single door and the first double door, while the 1938 Stock had four. The last of these trailers, 012489, was withdrawn in 1976.|$|R
50|$|The G Stock {{was built}} to allow the {{scrapping}} of some of wooden-built B <b>Stock</b> <b>trailer</b> cars which were in poor condition. Some steel-framed B Stock motor cars were converted to trailers, themselves being replaced by new G Stock motorcars. The G Stock consisted entirely of motor cars, all built with a clerestory roof similar in style to the B Stock with which they would work.|$|R
50|$|Many American horse {{trailers}} have stalls {{which are}} slanted {{at about a}} 45 degree angle {{to the line of}} travel, this design is thought to be more natural to horses, as many times horses travel slightly canted to the line of travel when hauled in a <b>stock</b> <b>trailer</b> without dividers. It also has the benefit of being able to haul more horses in a shorter unit.|$|R

50|$|The EnCon Police Division dedicates {{numerous}} {{hours every}} year in educating the public on such topics as the protection of our natural resources and safety concerns while enjoying the outdoors.EnCon Police Officers often appear at agricultural fairs, schools, fish & game clubs, businesses, civic and youth group organizations to accomplish this important goal. Officers utilize two mobile <b>trailers</b> that are <b>stocked</b> with educational materials and mounts of indigenous wildlife.|$|R

5000|$|Four trams and two {{trailers}} {{were ordered}} from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWa), with motors from Siemens. The GB Class 1 trams cost NOK 360,000, including some work <b>trailers.</b> The <b>stock</b> had bogies, were 13 m long and weighed 30 t, and had 4x [...] The chassis were delivered on 20 July 1924, while the motors came on 5 July. They were assembled at the Dalsenget Depot. Because {{of the wider}} bodies, all transport from the track at Ila to Dalsenget {{had to be done}} at night, so the trams would not meet other trams in the opposite track. The first test run was on 5 July, but failed due to a short circuit. A successful attempt was made on 9 July.|$|R
50|$|The Censorship Board {{banned the}} film's <b>trailer,</b> which {{included}} <b>stock</b> footage from 14 October 1973 student uprising, with soldiers and policemen beating up unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators. Bhandit then vowed to not release the film if the board made any cuts, but the board responded that Bhandit was simply using the censorship review {{process as a}} means of generating publicity for his film. As it turned out, the film was released without any cuts, a sign, Bhandit said, that Thai society was maturing.|$|R
50|$|A second batch {{was ordered}} to allow the F Stock to be {{transferred}} to Metropolitan line and so allow the Circle Stock to be withdrawn. The 90 new R49 cars were constructed from aluminium and built by Metro Cammell, reducing the weight of a train by 5.4 LT. An eight car train from this batch was unpainted as an experiment. A third batch of R59 twenty cars, 13 new, was built to allow the transfer of Q <b>stock</b> <b>trailers</b> to increase the length of Circle line trains to six cars.|$|R
50|$|McNabs are {{becoming}} increasingly popular {{in the world of}} dog sports. Their outstanding athletic prowess and agility coupled with high intelligence make them ideal competitors. McNabs are now competing successfully in agility trials, dock diving, disc dog competitions, and flyball. They are also exceptional competitors in barn hunt and nose work. Many ranchers are competing with McNabs in the relatively new sport of Ranch Dog Herding where dog and handler on horseback work as a team herding three head of cattle through five obstacles and then into a <b>stock</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|R
50|$|This build was not {{initially}} compatible with other builds, {{because it was}} fitted with an electro-pneumatic braking system, {{as well as the}} Westinghouse air brake. To accommodate its control, an extra 10-core control jumper was fitted, and previous builds of Standard Stock were gradually altered to include the extra wires, a process which was largely completed by 1936. Standard Stock motor cars which were running on the Bakerloo line with Cammell Laird 1920 <b>Stock</b> <b>trailers</b> were not fitted with the electro-pneumatic brake wiring until the trailers were withdrawn in 1938.|$|R
5000|$|In 1931, the UERL began a major {{renumbering}} {{of all its}} {{multiple unit}} cars. The series {{was adopted by the}} London Underground when it took over in 1933 and renumbered stock inherited from other lines into the UERL's series. The table below shows the number ranges used for the inherited stock and initially used by the UERL/London Underground for new stock (including the LU-design M and N Stock and Q38 Stock DM cars - Q38 <b>Stock</b> <b>trailers</b> were allocated numbers in one of the new numbering series described later): ...|$|R
5000|$|Following initial {{trials of}} {{automatic}} train control on the District Line in 1963, {{five of the six}} 4-car units of 1960 stock were altered for a full-scale trial on the Woodford to Hainault branch. The intention was to ensure that such control was reliable {{by the time it was}} introduced on the Victoria Line, then under construction. Part of the conversion process involved the provision of a trip valve instead of a trip cock for emergency stopping of the train, but the trip cocks were retained, so that the trains could operate on tracks which were not equipped for automatic train operation, and the train stops on the Woodford to Hainault branch were retained, as conventional trains still had to use the branch to reach Hainault depot. The five units were stabled in the depot, and a maximum of four were used on the Woodford to Hainualt experiments at any one time, with the first train running on 5 April 1964. By 1974, the standard <b>stock</b> <b>trailers</b> were becoming a maintenance liability, and three of the units had their two trailers replaced by a single modified 1938 <b>stock</b> <b>trailer.</b> Because of the cost of the conversion, the trailers of the remaining two units were refurbished, which included repainting in white, rather than aluminium, at the depot.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s F Stock was {{transferred}} to the Metropolitan line Uxbridge service, and some O and P Stock, reformed into 5-car trains transferred to replace the trains on the Circle line; these began running in 1947. Because of the reliability of the metadynes and the difficulty repairing them, one Circle line train was converted to use the pneumatic camshaft control (PCM) equipment used on the 1938 tube stock and entered service in March 1955. This was considered a success and the other Circle line trains were converted, followed by the units that operated the Hammersmith & City services. The converted trains were known as CO/CP stock, converted motor cars became CO or CP <b>stock</b> and the <b>trailers</b> COP <b>stock.</b> In 1959/60 the length of the Circle line trains was increased to six cars with the addition of converted Q38 trailers, and with similar trains running on the Hammersmith & City and Circle lines maintenance for the stock for the two lines was concentrated at Hammersmith depot, allowing Neasden depot to specialise in the new A Stock.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, {{to replace}} {{hand-operated}} sliding {{doors on the}} London Underground, unpainted aluminium R Stock reused the newer Q <b>Stock</b> <b>trailers</b> purchased before the war. New pneumatic camshaft mechanism (PCM) control equipment and motors were fitted and the sets formed with new trailers. When, in the 1950s the Metadyne equipment on the O and P Stock became unreliable and needed replacement, PCM control equipment was used and the modified motor car became known as CO and CP <b>stock</b> respectively; <b>trailers</b> were classified COP Stock. For the deep-level tubes the unpainted aluminium 1959 stock was developed to replace pre-war designs, and entered service on the Piccadilly line and later on the Central.|$|R
