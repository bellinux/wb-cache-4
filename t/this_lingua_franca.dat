Moreover, the specific way in which these resources are mobilized shows the participants orientation towards two basic principles of social interaction: intersubjectivity and progressivity.

5000|$|While many creoles {{around the}} world have lexicons based on {{languages}} other than Portuguese (e.g. English, French, Spanish, Dutch), it was hypothesized that such creoles were derived from <b>this</b> <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> by means of relexification, i.e. the process in which a pidgin or creole incorporates a significant amount of its lexicon from another language while keeping the grammar intact. There is some evidence that relexification is a real process. Pieter Muysken and [...] show that there are languages which derive their grammar and lexicon from two different languages respectively, which could be easily explained with the relexification hypothesis. Also, Saramaccan seems to be a pidgin frozen in the middle of relexification from Portuguese to English.

This paper considers the LFC in the context of China, to determine which of the features of English pronunciation that typically occur with speakers from China should be a priority for teachers. In addition, the paper discusses accommodation to the needs of listeners, something that is a central component of ELF-based teaching, and it notes that the teaching of accommodation skills is practical, attainable, and fun.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the attitudes}} and motives of students studying English at the Freie Universität Berlin (FUB) and suggests that changing opinions on national (US and UK) standards {{and the emergence of}} the 'New Europe' represent mutually reinforcing conditions of possibility for the deliberate adoption of a Europeanised English as a <b>Lingua</b> <b>Franca</b> (ELF). We present results from a sociolinguistic profile of students at the FUB which include a statistical analysis of questionnaires distributed to 101 students of English in July 2001; excerpts from student essays that reflect on the role of English in students' lives; and in-depth interviews with five of these students (see further Erling 2004). Through statistical analysis, it became clear that there were certain clusters among students: a US-friendly cluster (54 %), a pro-British cluster (13 %) and a <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> cluster (34 %). In <b>this</b> paper, the <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> cluster is considered in depth with an analysis of their descriptions of the challenges of making English 'their own […] forcing it to submit to their own intentions and accents' (Bakhtin 1981 : 294). We also describe specific linguistic features of these students' Englishes and compare them to other varieties of world Englishes. These findings suggest that these users are appropriating the language for their own purposes, asserting their identities through English and empowering themselves as owners of the language. With this in mind, pedagogical implications for teaching ELF at the university level are considered in the final section of the paper...|$|R

40|$|Why would a firm {{incorporate}} in Delaware {{rather than}} in its home state? Prior explanations {{have focused on the}} inherent features of Delaware corporate law and on the positive network externalities created by so many other firms domiciling in Delaware. We offer an additional explanation: a firm may choose Delaware simply because its law is nationally known and thus can serve as a lingua franca for in-state and out-of-state investors. Analyzing the incorporation decisions of 1, 850 venture-capitalist-backed start-ups, we find evidence consistent with <b>this</b> <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> explanation. Indeed, the lingua franca effect appears to be more important than other factors that have been shown to influence corporate domicile, such as corporate law flexibility and the quality of a state’s judiciary.

40|$|The role of {{translation}} for scientific knowledge today is more vital and diverse than ever, {{precisely because of}} the expanding dominance of English(es).

Such transfer reflects the human, social dimension to scientific work and seems unlikely to diminish with continued expansion in the official use of English.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the first}} part of the study (sections 1 – 4), we {{substantiate}} our claim that such literary representations are indeed reliable renditions of the linguistic medium African slaves in Portugal actually used in their interactions with the white population and among themselves.

Senegambia, where it soon became the lingua franca of trade between Portuguese expatriates and the local populations. From <b>this</b> <b>lingua</b> <b>franca,</b> creoles subsequently arose. In the second part (sections 5 – 11), we propose an extensive outline of LdP grammar such as we are able to retrieve from the corpus. Comparisons with present-day WAPCs are attempted. We conclude (sections 12 – 13) that the availability of such historical testimonies indeed gives us the exceptional opportunity of gaining some first-hand knowledge of the transitional medium that necessarily separates a lexifier language from ‘its’ creole(s). The fact that this transitional medium, we think, looks much more like a BV than a destructured jargon lends support to the assumption that untutored L 2 acquisition by adults played a crucial role in creole formation...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{shows just}} how deeply {{affected}} English has already been through its unprecedented spread, and the unique function it has as the world language. It argues, however, {{that it would be}} premature to launch into a discussion of the teaching of <b>this</b> <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> before certain prerequisites have been met. The most important of these are a conceptualization of speakers of lingua franca English as language users in their own right, and the acknowledgment of the legitimacy of, and indeed the need for, a description of salient features of English as a lingua franca (ELF), alongside English as a native language (ENL). The presentation summarizes the empirical research into the lingua franca use of English, which has recently gathered considerable momentum. It sets this research in relation to other relevant work in descriptive linguistics, sociolinguistics, and applied linguistics for language pedagogy. Finally, it discusses the implications of this historically unique situation for potential developments in the pedagogy of English teaching and outlines some research questions that must be addressed if advances in the teaching of English as a lingua franca are to have a secure theoretical and descriptive base...|$|E
40|$|In {{science and}} in all other domains that require {{communication}} across borders, we need one lingua franca, and <b>this</b> <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> will be English. The adoption of the native language of some as everyone’s lingua franca unavoidably raises a problem of justice in various senses. One of these is cooperative justice, the fair distribution {{of the cost of}} producing a public good. This article proposes a criterion of fair burden sharing — proportionality of cost to benefit — and explores its policy implications. Does this criterion require a linguistic tax on the native speakers of the lingua franca in order to subsidize the learning of it by all others? If so, how high should the subsidy be, and should it be pitched at the same per capita level for all learning communities? If not, is there an alternative way of implementing a fair compensation for the free riding of lingua franca natives on everyone else’s learning? Among the article’s conclusions are that fair subsidies would need to be directed disproportionately to the Chinese — even abstracting from possible differences in the difficulty of learning English — and that more hopes should be focused on the compensatory poaching of the web than on anything resembling a linguistic tax...|$|E
40|$|With the {{continuing}} {{globalisation of markets}} and internationalisation of trade, professionals {{from a wide range}} of organisations, from large multinational corporations to small to medium size enterprises, are increasingly coming together to do business in the international workplace, particularly in meetings. Such international events usually bring together people from different linguistic and socio-cultural backgrounds with the result that a common language of communication is frequently adopted. More often than not <b>this</b> <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> is English. While English for International Business (EIB) has an essential function as a lingua franca in multilingual settings, it can also present challenges both linguistically and culturally, particularly as more and more interactions are between speakers whose first language is not English. This paper reports on preliminary research which forms part of a larger scale study investigating the use of English as a lingua franca in international business meetings. The paper summarises the findings of a questionnaire exploring the use of EIB by a particular European business organisation. It is hoped that the limited findings will help shed light on some of the language issues that may be present in such international contexts and the possible communications difficulties and frustrations that can result. A positive result is that as well as uncovering some of these challenges, the analysis also shows an awareness by many participants of some of the strategies that can be used to overcome them. 1226...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} relevance of Jenkins’s theory in Dutch educational settings and argues {{that it would be}} undesirable to teach the LFC at Dutch secondary schools: the <b>Lingua</b> <b>Franca</b> Core, which is the pronunciation model of English as a <b>Lingua</b> <b>Franca,</b> should not be introduced at Dutch secondary schools because it is neither teachable nor widely accepted. In addition, there is no evidence for the suggested advantages with respect to learnability, intelligibility and comprehensibility. Chapter 2 addresses the question of how the <b>Lingua</b> <b>Franca</b> Core may be taught. In Chapter 3, it is argued that native-like accents are still highly valued, which causes the <b>Lingua</b> <b>Franca</b> Core to be unacceptable to most people.

The move to prepare Japan to use ELF in a globalized world has manifested in a number of MEXT initiatives in recent years. In one large initiative, university programs conducted entirely in English have emerged across the country as part of the “Global 30 ” (G 30) project, in a bid to attract international students into the Japanese higher education sector—creating new communities for ELF usage in Japanese universities that rarely existed before. This study utilized classroom observations and interviews with five different university instructors lecturing in a G 30 -selected Japanese university. This study specifically focused on elements of both English Medium Instruction (EMI) as well as Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) in order to target possible issues related to students’ language support needs. Data were analyzed to evaluate criticisms of the G 30 project (e. g. Burgess, 2010; Hashimoto, 2013), including a lack of integration of local and international students in the program due to perceived linguistic and cultural barriers. Data are also discussed in relation to other EMI studies that highlight the difficulty students face in such programs, which sometimes result in students dropping such classes and even the university altogether (Selzer and Gibson, 2009). Regarding CLIL, the findings suggest that a better balance of content and language focus and more adequate language support is needed in order to effectively use English as the medium of instruction in <b>this</b> <b>lingua</b> <b>franca</b> setting. In terms of EMI and the G 30 initiative, it is clear that better collaboration between programs is also needed in order for the G 30 project to succeed...|$|E
