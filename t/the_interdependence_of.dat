5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of <b>the</b> <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E

25|$|Cambodia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} levels of forest cover in the region as <b>the</b> <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> Cambodia’s {{geography}} and hydrology makes it rich in natural resources and biological diversity - among the bio-richest countries in Southeast Asia. The Royal Government of Cambodia estimates Cambodia contains approximately 10.36 million hectares of forest cover, representing approximately 57.07% of Cambodia’s land area (2011). On the contrary, international observers and independent sources provide rather different numbers. Consensus permeates, as most sources agree, that deforestation, loss of seasonal wetlands and habitat destruction - among countless minor factors - correlates with the absence of strict administrative control and indifference in law enforcement - not only in Cambodia but the entire region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{complexity}} of round robin iterative data flow analysis has been traditionally defined as 1 + d where d is {{the depth of}} a control flow graph. However, this bound is restricted to bit vector frameworks, which by definition, are separable. For non-separable frameworks, the {{complexity of}} analysis is influenced by <b>the</b> <b>interdependences</b> <b>of</b> program entities, hence the bound of 1 + d is not applicable. This motivates the need for capturing <b>the</b> <b>interdependences</b> <b>of</b> entities to define a general complexity measure. We propose Degree of dependence δ which quantifies the effect of non-separability on the complexity of analysis for a particular problem instance. We define the complexity bound of 1 + δ + d which explains the complexity of round robin analysis of general nonseparable data flow problems. Like d, δ is a theoretical concept useful for understanding the complexity rather than estimating it. In bit vector frameworks the bound 1 + δ + d reduces to 1 + d due to δ = 0. Apart from being general, our bound is also precise, as corroborated by empirical results. Index Terms — Data flow analysis, Complexity, Constant propagatio...|$|R

See Gibbs' phase rule. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging {{the right amount of}} water and applying heat, the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.|$|E
25|$|Poincaré {{states that}} {{mathematics}} (analysis) and physics {{are in the}} same spirit, that the two disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, <b>the</b> <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also {{to take a step back}} to comprehend the broader world of nature. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton within the framework of Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

500|$|Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within {{social theory}} are terms that {{refer to a}} {{distinction}} emerging out {{of the work of}} Levi-Strauss who inherited it from the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure. The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyse dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a language, while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual speech. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to Central Problems in Social Theory, he states that, [...] "in order to show <b>the</b> <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> action and structure ... we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." [...] And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of social reproduction. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim. Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data.|$|E
500|$|Ardhanarishvara signifies [...] "totality {{that lies}} beyond duality", [...] "bi-unity {{of male and}} female in God" [...] and [...] "the {{bisexuality}} and therefore the non-duality" [...] of the Supreme Being. It conveys that God is both Shiva and Parvati, [...] "both male and female, both father and mother, both aloof and active, both fearsome and gentle, both destructive and constructive" [...] and unifies all other dichotomies of the universe. While Shiva's rosary in the Ardhanarishvara iconography associates him with asceticism and spirituality, Parvati's mirror associates her to the material illusory world. Ardhanarishvara reconciles and harmonizes the two conflicting ways of life: the spiritual way of the ascetic as represented by Shiva, and the materialistic way of the householder as symbolized by Parvati, whose raison d’être in Hindu mythology is to lure the ascetic Shiva into marriage and the wider circle of worldly affairs. <b>The</b> <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> Shiva on his power (Shakti) as embodied in Parvati is also manifested in this form. Ardhanarishvara conveys that Shiva and Shakti are one and the same, an interpretation also declared in inscriptions found along with Ardhanarishvara images in Java and the eastern Malay Archipelago. The Vishnudharmottara Purana also emphasizes the identity and sameness of the male Purusha and female Prakriti, manifested in the image of Ardhanarishvara. According to Shaiva guru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (1927–2001), Ardhanarishvara signifies that the great Shiva is [...] "All, inseparable from His energy" [...] (i.e. his Shakti) and is beyond gender.|$|E
