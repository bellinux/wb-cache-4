Instead of getting tried, the ruler appointed Ibrahim at his Sakhir Palace.

The Khalids had agreed to reduce taxes on residents of Sitra following the visit. However, as soon as Knox left, taxes were increased again, and Shia residents continued to be subjected to forced labor.

In May 1174, Turan-Shah conquered Zabid from a Kharijite dynasty and executed its leader Mahdi Abd al-Nabi, and later that year Aden was taken from <b>the</b> <b>Shia</b> Banu Karam tribe.
