The people of the Harappan civilization in Pakistan and northwestern India had primitive water-cleaning toilets that used flowing water in each house that were linked with drains covered with burnt clay bricks. <b>The</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> removed the human waste.

500|$|Irwin {{was quoted}} as saying that the Central Garden [...] "is a {{sculpture}} {{in the form of a}} garden, which aims to be art." [...] Water plays a major role in the garden. A fountain near the restaurant flows toward the garden and appears to fall into a grotto on the north garden wall. The resulting stream then flows down the hillside into the azalea pool. The designers placed rocks and boulders of varying size in the stream bed to vary the sounds from <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>water.</b> A tree-lined stream descends to a plaza, while the walkway criss-crosses the stream, which continues through the plaza, and goes over a stone waterfall into a round pool. A maze of azaleas floats in the pool, around which is a series of specialty gardens. More than 500 varieties of plant material are used for the Central Garden, but the selection is [...] "always changing, never twice the same".|$|E
500|$|In Greek tradition, clepsydrae {{were used}} in court; later, the Romans adopted this practice, as well. There are several {{mentions}} of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in Theaetetus, Plato says that [...] "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> urges them on". Another mention occurs in Lucius Apuleius' The Golden Ass: [...] "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief {{witness for the prosecution}} to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base". The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.|$|E

2500|$|The name is {{supposed}} to have been derived from the spring which runs out of the Bunter sandstone over a bed of clay, near to the northern end of the forest, called [...] "Bull Well."

2500|$|As {{its name}} describes, this Act {{authorised}} works {{to improve the}} Arun upstream from Houghton Bridge (the tidal limit) to Newbridge, near Billingshurst. The route involved a new artificial cut of [...] from Newbridge along the river to Pallingham, crossing the river by an aqueduct on three strong brick arches at Lordings Lock near Wisborough Green. An undershot waterwheel of a design unique on the waterway system was built into the aqueduct. Driven by {{the flow of the}} river this had scoops {{on the back of the}} blades which raised a small proportion of <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> into the higher canal. This was completed in 1787. A second artificial cut was added in 1790 from Coldwaltham to Stopham, including a 375-yard (343m) tunnel under Hardham Hill, which avoided a large bend in the river near Pulborough, saving [...]|$|E

60|$|Another steep ascent placed {{me at the}} Effuenta establishment. I was now paying {{my second}} visit to the far-famed Tákwá Ridge. It is a long line running {{parallel}} with Vinegar Hill, but instead of being regular, like its neighbour, it is broken {{into a series of}} small crests looking on the map like vertebræ; these heights being parted by secondary valleys, some of which descend almost to the level of <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>water.</b> Westward the hog's-back is bounded by the Tákwá rivulet, rising {{in the northern part of}} the valley. Eastwards there is a corresponding feature called by the English 'Quartz Creek:' it breaks through the ridge in the southern section of the Effuenta property and unites with the Tákwá. My aneroid showed the height of the crest to be 260 feet above sea-level, and about 160 above the valley. Mr. Wyatt has raised it to 1,400 feet--a curious miscalculation.|$|E

He spread his elbows on the top rail and resting his chin on his clasped hands looked absently at the river, at the dance of sunlight on <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>water.</b> Gradually the forest of the further bank became smaller, as if sinking below the level of the river.

Five weeks' siege in a narrow fortress, then the two miles of subterranean struggle--these might well make the grass beneath the wild sycamore, the cork-tree, the long reeds, the willows, above all, the sound of <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>water,</b> absolute ecstasy. There was an instant rush for the river, impeded by many a thorn-bush and creeper; but almost anything green was welcome at the moment, and the only disappointment was at the height and steepness of the banks of rock.
