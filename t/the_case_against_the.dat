5|$|My factual {{position}} in the case {{as well as in}} the world of science of today does not permit me to enter <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Food and Drug Administration, since such action would, in my mind, imply admission of the authority of this special branch of the government to pass judgment on primordial, pre-atomic cosmic orgone energy. I, therefore, rest the case in full confidence in your hands.|$|E
5|$|Evidence against Croitoru and Gravelle was {{presented}} {{over the course}} of eight weeks in 2006, but the judge stated that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> two accused was not strong. Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant withdrew the charges on June 12, 2006. Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits against people involved with the prosecution. Gravelle is suing for $25 million, and Croitoru is seeking $15 million for wrongful imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Hamilton Police Services was ordered to pay Gravelle $10,000 for court costs. In June 2006, Croitoru also pleaded guilty to the charges of extortion and violating the terms of his bail. As a result, he was forced to forfeit $10,000 of the bail money.|$|E
5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed {{to bring the}} case against Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter, and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career {{of support for the}} royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E

Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009.

5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Garridos.|$|E
