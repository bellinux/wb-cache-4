In the main series, Bianchi took <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> positions and a number of points positions before he was injured in a first-lap crash at the Hungaroring. In the feature race, he spun into the path of the field exiting the first corner, and was struck head-on by Ho-Pin Tung, sustaining a fractured second lumbar vertebra in the process. Bianchi was fourth in the drivers' championship {{at the time of his}} injury.

Both vessels had <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and Albatross had different bows; Nautilus received a clipper bow, while Albatross had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle that extended {{to the base of the}} main mast, while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the fore mast.|$|E

25|$|Thompson started {{racing in}} the BTCC in a privately entered Peugeot 405 in 1994, his {{performances}} earning him a factory Vauxhall drive for 1995. He {{became the youngest}} ever race-winner that year, also taking <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> positions, before his season was cut short by a crash at Knockhill giving him an eye injury. 1996 was a transitional year with the new Vauxhall Vectra, although Thompson took a victory at Snetterton, moving up from fifth in a two-lap burst in which Roberto Ravaglia and Rickard Rydell collided, Joachim Winkelhock spun, and Alain Menu broke down.|$|E

25|$|The {{event was}} contested by ten teams of two drivers each. The teams were e.Dams-Renault, Audi Sport ABT, Virgin, Dragon, Mahindra, Venturi, Andretti, Techeetah, NextEV and Jaguar. Before the race, e.Dams-Renault driver Sébastien Buemi led the Drivers' Championship with 157 points, ten ahead of nearest rival Lucas di Grassi in second, who in turn, was a further 43 {{in front of}} third-placed Felix Rosenqvist. Sam Bird was fourth on 100 points and Nico Prost stood in fifth place with 84 points. e.Dams-Renault were leading the Teams' Championship with 259 points; Audi Sport ABT were in second place on 194 points and Mahindra with 182 points contended the team for the {{position}}. With 153 points, Virgin were in fourth position and Techeetah rounded out the top five with 94 points. e.Dams-Renault and Buemi had dominated the championship with three other drivers winning races {{during the course of}} the season. Di Grassi, Bird, Jean-Éric Vergne, José María López and Rosenqvist had all finished in second place at least once, and Mahindra teammates Rosenqvist and Heidfeld along with di Grassi, Bird and Stéphane Sarrazin had all taken at least one third-place result. A maximum of fifty-nine points were available for the final ePrix which meant Buemi could still win the title if di Grassi won both races and Buemi took <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> positions and finished second twice.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Manheim Auctions {{moved back}} to {{full-time}} sponsorship, and Phil Parsons was hired to drive. Parsons finished 8th at North Carolina Motor Speedway, but was released in the final {{part of the year}} as Dick Trickle took his place, and had an outside-pole starting spot at the Slick 50 500, then followed it up with a fifth-place finish at Atlanta Motor Speedway. After Trickle left {{at the end of the}} year, LHM signed 1992 Busch Series champion Joe Nemechek to compete for Rookie of the Year, sponsored by Meineke, for 1994 Nemechek had two consecutive top-five qualifying runs and finished 3rd at Pocono Raceway. When they were unable to clinch the rookie crown, Nemechek left to run his own team, and Hedrick signed another Busch Series veteran to compete for Cup rookie honors, Ricky Craven, as well as Kodiak as a sponsor. They had one top-five and four top-tens, defeating Robert Pressley for Rookie of the year. Craven was rewarded with a share of ownership in the Hedrick operation, and responded with <b>two</b> <b>pole</b> positions and five top-tens in 1996. He ran up near the top of the points standings very early in the season, but suffered a horrific crash at the Winston Select 500. Although he survived with no major injuries, his performance slipped after that, and many attribute that to a lack of confidence following that wreck. Craven left for Hendrick Motorsports at the end of the 1996 season.|$|E
