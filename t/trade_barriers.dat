40|$|This article {{develops}} {{an index}} of <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> for 119 countries by using the tariff and the import data from TRAINS database of UNCTAD at 6 -digit level of HS classifications. Bivariate as well as multivariate econometric models have been estimated to explain cross-country variations in the constructed <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> indices. The results show that cross-country variations in <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> indices are much influenced by variations in per capita income, population and literacy rate. This article considers Bangladesh as an example and finds that at disaggregated levels of commodity classification, there are significant differences among <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> indices across commodities and cross-country rankings of <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> indices are not necessarily consistent with the rankings of <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> indices in the cross-industry context.

40|$|AbstractIn July 2013 the European Union (EU) imposed {{restrictions}} on Chinese solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers, looking to exporting to the EU. In this paper, {{we consider the}} impact of this <b>trade</b> <b>barrier,</b> using a sample of 454 stock-listed PV producing firms. We find that the <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> erased US$ 8, 19 million off the value of the average European PV manufacturers and US$ 247. 03 million off the value of the average Chinese PV manufacturers. We also find that while the <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> reduced the willingness of the industry to reorganise, it stimulates Chinese manufacturers to reorganise both their domestic and their international operations. The latter, we warn, is likely an attempt by Chinese manufacturers to ‘tariff jump’. We conclude, therefore, that the <b>trade</b> <b>barrier</b> was both inefficient, in that it both hurt the companies it aimed to protect, and ineffective, as those it sought to punish may have circumvented it...|$|R
5|$|The {{customs law}} set <b>trade</b> <b>barriers</b> to {{products}} {{produced in the}} country, and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods, together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver. However, the law was not completely effective because of {{the control of the}} port, which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income. The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces, and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros. Despite the financial obstacles, the economy of Entre Ríos has grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires, with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production.|$|E

Benjamin Franklin, John and Sarah Jay, and John and Abigail Adams met there every Monday, and dined in company with Lafayette's family and the liberal nobility, including Clermont-Tonnerre and Madame de Staël. Lafayette continued to work on lowering <b>trade</b> <b>barriers</b> in France to American goods, and on assisting Franklin and his successor as envoy, Jefferson, in seeking treaties of amity and commerce with European nations. He also sought to eliminate the injustices that Protestants in France had endured since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes a century before.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain <b>trade</b> <b>barriers</b> between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E

Which contract is adopted in equilibrium is shown to depend on the characteristics of the product and whether switches in contracts occur with trade liberalization and on the number of competing products. ...|$|R
40|$|Starting on January 1 st, 2012, the {{international}} aviation sector {{will be included}} into the already existing EU ETS. All air crafts departing and arriving within the European Union will be obliged to hold permits corresponding to their total emissions of CO 2 for those routes. Since emissions from {{the international}} aviation sector are not included under the Kyoto Protocol, the European Commission has decided to introduce a <b>trading</b> <b>barrier</b> between the sectors {{in order not to}} jeopardize the Kyoto targets. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the potential loss in cost-effectiveness of introducing such a <b>trading</b> <b>barrier</b> between two sectors taking into account that damage from emissions is not necessarily uniform. A theoretical model is developed to address the question and it is found that, at least for the case with linking the international aviation sector to the stationary sources within the EU ETS, the <b>trading</b> <b>barrier</b> might be unwarranted as it might lead to higher damage from emissions as compared to alternative ways to link the trading sectors. However, it should be stressed that this finding is not general and caution should be taken in the future when linking emission trading schemes as, depending on the heterogeneity of emission damage, a <b>trading</b> <b>barrier</b> might very well be justified. ...|$|R
5|$|IMF members {{signed the}} Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which {{ratified}} {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective <b>trade</b> <b>barriers,</b> and contractionary monetary policy.|$|E

25|$|Many Indian {{provinces and}} princely states imposed inter-provincial <b>trade</b> <b>barriers</b> {{beginning}} in mid-1942, preventing other provinces from buying domestic rice. One underlying cause was the anxiety and soaring prices {{that followed the}} fall of Burma, but a more direct impetus in some cases (for example, Bihar) was the trade imbalances directly caused by provincial price controls. The power to restrict inter-provincial trade had been conferred on provincial governments in November 1941 as an item under the Defence of India Act, 1939. Provincial governments began erecting <b>trade</b> <b>barriers</b> that prevented the flow of foodgrains (especially rice) and other goods between provinces. These barriers reflected a desire to see that local populations were well fed, thus also forestalling civil unrest.|$|E
