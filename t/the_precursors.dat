5|$|<b>The</b> <b>precursors</b> for systemin and AtPEP1 {{are both}} {{processed}} to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor.

In tobacco, it is processed into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described. The production of multiple signalling peptides from one precursor is a common feature found in animals.|$|E

40|$|The biogenesis and {{assembly}} of subunit II of photosystem I (PSI) (psaD gene product) were studied and characterized. <b>The</b> <b>precursor</b> and <b>the</b> mature form were produced in vitro and incubated with intact plastids or isolated thylakoids.

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle {{to save the}} planet, several Halos are able to escape, their own AIs {{enacting}} failsafe protocols. Bornstellar manages to escape {{with the help of}} a young council member and a guard. They escape through the same portal as the Halos but lose power and drift for an unknown amount of time before being recovered by Lifeworkers. The portal has carried them to the Ark, the massive structure that serves as a construction site for Halos and also a haven for the Librarian's work. The trio are healed, and Bornstellar meets the Librarian, which brings up conflicting thoughts and feelings, due to his imprint from the Didact. She informs him that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact had long ago, it is learned that <b>the</b> <b>Precursors</b> created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate <b>the</b> <b>Precursors,</b> except this one, who now seeks revenge.|$|E

30|$|If {{the fluid}} is {{perfectly}} wetting, {{we have seen}} that van der Waals forces lead to the formation of a precursor film in front of the contact line (de Gennes 1985). Wang (2003) in his thesis claimed the surface feature, particularly micro-structure or roughness, promotes the formation and development of thin precursor film, they claimed that <b>the</b> <b>precursor</b> film spreads much faster than the movement of the apparent contact line (ACL) on a rough solid surface. Amit Sah (2014) studied precursor film with glass capillaries and cover slips.

Yuan and Zhao (2010) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the atomic details and the transport properties of <b>the</b> <b>precursor</b> film in dynamic wetting. Their results showed that the molecules which finally formed <b>the</b> <b>precursor</b> film came almost from the surface in the initial state of the droplet.

5|$|Climatologically, {{tropical}} cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west {{trade winds}} on the equatorial {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out. These waves are <b>the</b> <b>precursors</b> to many tropical cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are <b>the</b> <b>precursors</b> of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. <b>The</b> <b>precursors</b> to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls.

30|$|In summary, {{we report}} a thermal {{decomposition}} method to prepare copper micro-rods with layered porous {{structure for the}} first time, by using a well-designed coordination compound of Cu(BTA) 2 crystal as <b>the</b> <b>precursor.</b> <b>The</b> shape of the crystals was preserved for the copper product. This allows us to obtain copper with various morphologies by the growth of <b>the</b> <b>precursor</b> crystals of different sizes and shapes, without changing the molecule itself. Moreover, the layered nano-structure is highly related to the crystal parameters of <b>the</b> <b>precursor.</b> It could be expected that <b>the</b> same <b>precursor</b> crystallizes in different crystalline spaces; accordingly, the micro/nano-structure would be tuned.|$|R

5|$|John of Ludzisko and Archbishop Gregory of Sanok, <b>the</b> <b>precursors</b> of Polish humanism, were {{professors at}} the university. Gregory's court {{was the site}} of an early {{literary}} society at Lwów (Lviv) after he became the archbishop there. Scholarly thought elsewhere was represented by Jan Ostroróg, a political publicist and reformist, and Jan Długosz, a historian, whose Annals is the largest history work of his time in Europe and a fundamental source for history of medieval Poland. Distinguished and influential foreign humanists were also active in Poland. Filippo Buonaccorsi, a poet and diplomat, arrived from Italy in 1468 and stayed in Poland until his death in 1496. Known as Kallimach, he prepared biographies of Gregory of Sanok, Zbigniew Oleśnicki, and very likely Jan Długosz, besides establishing another literary society in Kraków. He tutored and mentored the sons of Casimir IV and postulated unrestrained royal power. In Kraków, the German humanist Conrad Celtes organized the humanist literary and scholarly association Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana, the first in this part of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Many comets and asteroids {{collided}} with Earth {{in its early}} stages. Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 billion years ago brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth's oceans, {{or at least a}} significant portion of it.

The detection of organic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or meteorites may have brought <b>the</b> <b>precursors</b> of life—or even life itself—to Earth. In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis.

Copied on the Yuan model, the Ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions: one civil, one military, and one for surveillance. Below {{the level of the}} province (sheng 省) were prefectures (fu 府) operating under a prefect (zhifu 知府), followed by subprefectures (zhou 州) under a subprefect.
