50|$|The {{tidal regime}} at the {{entrance}} to Pelorus Sound is typical of New Zealand coastal locations, i.e. there is a semi-diurnal tide modulated on a spring-neap cycle, generated by the superposition of M2 (lunar, semi-diurnal) and S2 (solar, semi-diurnal) tidal constituents. Other tidal constituents, notably N2 (semi-diurnal, generated by the ellipticity of the moon’s orbit), introduce further modulation, meaning that the spring-neap cycle is not exactly repeated. The tidal range varies between 1.0 and 1.3 m at neap and 2.1 and 2.4 m at spring. (These values are calculated from a sea level time series, July 1997 - February 1998, at Pelorus Sound entrance.) The propagation of this <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> into Pelorus Sound has not been well described, but models and measurements both suggest that the tidal range within the sound is somewhat larger (by 10-20%) than {{at the entrance}}. Because the sound is long, and in places narrow, the tidal currents are fairly strong.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{along-track}} {{analysis of}} 7 years of TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) data has been {{performed on the}} global ocean over the period 1993 - 1999. Such long time series allow us to determine the semidiurnal tidal component very accurately, while resolving the aliasing problems, {{at least for the}} main tidal wave M 2. As already inferred by other authors, this along-track analysis detects the surface signatures of the internal tides signal that maintains coherence with the M 2 astronomical forcing. By analyzing the T/P data in different periods of 3 years or more, the stability of the M 2 tidal characteristics is demonstrated for the barotropic component {{as well as for the}} baroclinic signal observed in the altimetric data. This stability varies with location. For the barotropic component the dispersion of the results as a function of the length and period of analysis is only significant over the areas of ocean mesoscale activity (noise impact) and of large barotropic <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> (separating the different components of the <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> proves difficult). The baroclinic <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> appears to be surprisingly stable over many areas located around strong topographic gradients like submarine ridges. A methodology has been developed to draw a map of these areas. This can be of help for ocean modelers to specify areas of higher vertical mixing associated with internal tidal wave activity and for those who assimilate altimetric data in their models by giving guidance on where to increase the uncertainty of the altimeter data over these areas...|$|E
30|$|We {{compared}} {{observed and}} modeled daily variations at several coastal and island observatories {{and concluded that}} at some locations the <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> could in fact explain {{the majority of the}} observed daily variations. We showed that the effect of <b>tidal</b> magnetic <b>signals</b> at numerous locations might be sufficiently strong relative to Sq variations, and neglecting <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> might lead to a misinterpretation of data when analyzing daily variations and assuming that these variations are of purely Sq origin. Furthermore, in the context of internal studies, where smaller internally induced Sq signals are to be delineated, the contribution of <b>tidal</b> magnetic <b>signals</b> becomes a significant deteriorating factor.|$|R
30|$|Figures  6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 {{also show}} that sea floor {{horizontal}} tidal magnetic fields exhibit a considerably different spatial pattern than those at the sea level. Overall, <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> at the sea floor are 2 – 3 times stronger than those at the sea level. The situation is opposite with the Sq signals; specifically, they are 2 – 3 times weaker at the sea floor due to the 3 -D nature of the problem, namely the heterogeneous conductance of the continents and oceans. Maximum amplitudes of Sq signals are a few times larger than those of <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> both at the surface and sea floor. However, due to different global patterns of Sq and <b>tidal</b> <b>signals,</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> may become comparable in amplitude and even exceed Sq signals at specific locations. This effect is more pronounced at the period of 12 h than that at 24 h for all three components, with the Z component affected most (cf. Figs. 10, 15).|$|R
30|$|We {{proposed}} a numerical scheme to correct {{for the effect}} of <b>tidal</b> magnetic <b>signals.</b> Specifically, we proposed the subtraction of the modeled tidal magnetic fields from observations. Modeling was performed by using realistic tidal transports and conductivity models of the Earth. We validated the correction scheme by using 1 -y long time series of magnetic fields at one ground-based and one sea floor site where the <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> appear to be substantial. We showed that such correction enables efficient suppression of the <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> in the observations.|$|R

Then tidal analysis on hourly data was performed and the results presented in this paper; amplitudes, gravimetric factors, phase differences for the main tidal waves, M 2, S 2, N 2, 01, Pl, K 1, QI, were calculated together with barometric pressure admittance and long term instrumental drift...|$|E
40|$|Most {{previous}} investigations on tide-induced watertable {{fluctuations in}} coastal aquifers {{have been based}} on one- dimensional models that describe the processes in the cross- shore direction alone, assuming negligible along-shore variability. A recent study proposed a two-dimensional approximation for tide-induced watertable fluctuations that took into account coastline variations. Here, we further develop this approximation in two ways, by extending the approximation to second order and by taking into account capillary effects. Our results demonstrate that both effects can markedly influence watertable fluctuations. In particular, with the first-order approximation, the local damping rate of the <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> could be subject to sizable errors...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} tidal and Sq magnetic signals in daily variations at the surface and sea floor. As expected, sea floor horizontal tidal magnetic fields differ substantially from those at the surface both in amplitude and in spatial structure. In comparison with the surface modeling results, sea floor <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> are 2 – 3 times stronger, while sea floor Sq signals are 2 – 3 times weaker. Even though Sq signals are a few {{times larger than the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> for most regions, owing to their substantially different global patterns, <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> may exceed Sq signals at many locations. This, in particular, is plausible for the vertical magnetic field component Z of the daily variations.|$|R
30|$|Assuming that Sq {{variations}} are periodic, one {{can represent}} them via a sum of time harmonics with periods of 24,  12,  8,  6,  etc., h (Matsushita and Maeda 1965). At the same time, diurnal and semidiurnal lunar and solar oceanic tides induce magnetic signals with periods close {{or equal to}} 12 and 24 h (Egbert and Erofeeva 2002). In short time series, e.g., in single-day data, signals with close periods become inseparable (see “Appendix” for more details). Consequently, ocean <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> inevitably affect Sq variations at periods of 12 and 24 h if {{the length of the}} time series is as short as one day. If not accounted for, the effect of ocean <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> in Sq variations can be mistakenly attributed to being part of the Sq signals, for instance, those induced by the mantle conductivity anomalies. This prompted us to assess the effect of the ocean <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> in daily variations and implement a correction scheme for them.|$|R
30|$|Since the <b>tidal</b> {{magnetic}} <b>signals</b> at {{the period}} of 12 h are dominated by the semidiurnal M 2 tide, which is known to generate the largest magnetic fields among all tidal constituents (Kuvshinov 2008), {{it is no surprise}} that the <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> at a period of 12 h, both at the sea level and sea floor (cf. bottom plots of Figs.  6, 7, 8, 9, 10), have larger amplitudes than those at {{the period of}} 24 h (cf. bottom plots of Figs. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). Further, the Sq signals at the 24 -h period have larger amplitudes than those at the 12 -h period.|$|R

30|$|Knowledge of {{the surface}} {{velocity}} and strain of ice shelves is important in determining their present kinematic state and detecting any change in that state. Data collected using the Global Positioning System (GPS) often {{plays an important role}} in determing these parameters, either directly, or as ground-truthing to other techniques such as InSAR. The processing of GPS data on floating ice shelves is complicated by the presence of a distinct vertical <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> and large horizontal motions in the data. Over a one hour period, vertical and horizontal movements can be as much as 0.3 metres and 0.1 metres respectively. For such GPS data to be processed using conventional static methods would require the observation period to be split into small (∼ 1 hour) segments, and the segments processed separately. Other processing options may include kinematic processing or sequential processing, although these techniques have their own drawbacks. Instead, we have developed software to remove signals based on a priori knowledge of the ice shelf motion. The <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> is removed using a local tide model and the horizontal velocity effect is corrected to a specific time epoch. This allows us to process our GPS data in a tide-free, velocity-free environment for a given day using conventional GPS processing software. The corrected GPS data, now largely free from the effects of ice shelf motion, may then be combined to produce high precision velocity and strain rate models of the ice shelf.|$|E
40|$|Various current data, {{collected}} in the Strait of Otranto during the period 1994 – 2007, have been analysed {{with the aim of}} describing the characteristics of the tidal motions and their contribution to the total flow variance. The principal tidal constituents in the area were the semi-diurnal (M 2) and the diurnal (K 1), with the latter one predominant. The total flow was, in general, more energetic along the flanks than {{in the middle of the}} Strait. Specifically, it was most energetic over the western shelf and in the upper layer along the eastern flank. In spite of the generally low velocities (a few cm s − 1) of the principal tidal constituents, the tidal variance has a pattern similar to that of the total flow variance, that is, it was large over the western shelf and low in the middle. The proportion of non-tidal (comprising the inertial and sub-inertial low-frequency bands) to tidal flow variances was quite variable in both time and space. The contribution of the low-frequency motions predominated over the tidal and inertial ones in the eastern portion of the strait during the major part of the year, particularly in the upper and intermediate layers. In the deep, near-bottom, layer the variance was evenly distributed between the low frequency, diurnal and semi-diurnal bands. A prominent exception was observed near the western shelf break during the summer season when the contribution of the <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> alone to the total variance reached 77 %. This high contribution was mainly due to the intensification of the diurnal signal at that location in the proximity of both the surface and bottom layers (velocities of about 10 cm s − 1). Local wind and sea level data were analysed and compared with the flow to find the possible origin of this diurnal intensification. Having excluded the sea-breeze impact on the intensification of the diurnal <b>tidal</b> <b>signal,</b> the most likely cause remains the generation of the topographically trapped internal waves and the diurnal resonance in the tidal response. These waves were sometimes generated by the barotropic <b>tidal</b> <b>signal</b> in the presence of summer stratification. The effect was seen only in the presence of the topographic slope change. This phenomenon may stimulate the diapycnal mixing during the stratified season and enhance ventilation of the near-bottom layers...|$|E

Hourly {{sea level}} data from tide gauges and a {{barotropic}} model {{are used to}} explore the spatial and tempo-ral variability of sea level extremes in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic coasts of the Iberian peninsula on seasonal time scales. Significant spatial variability is identified in the observations in all seasons.

The maxima in spring and summer are less than 60 cm in most stations. The wind and atmospheric forcing contributes about 50 cm {{in the winter and}} between 20 – 40 cm in the other seasons. In the western Mediterranean the observed extreme values are less than 50 cm, except near the Strait of Gibraltar. Direct atmospheric forcing contributes significantly to sea level extremes. Maximum sea level val-ues due to atmospheric forcing reach in some stations 45 cm during the winter. During the summer the contribution of the direct atmospheric forcing is between 10 – 20 cm.

40|$|Three {{stations}} {{near the}} calving {{front of the}} Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, recorded GPS data through a full spring-neap tidal cycle in November 2005. The data revealed a diurnal horizontal motion that varied both along and transverse to the long-term average velocity direction, similar to <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> observed in other ice shelves and ice streams. Based on its periodicity, {{it was hypothesized that}} the signal represents a flow response of the Ross Ice Shelf to the diurnal tides of the Ross Sea. To assess the influence of the tide on the ice-shelf motion, two hypotheses were developed. The first addressed the direct response of the ice shelf to tidal forcing, such as forces due to sea-surface slopes or forces due to sub-ice-shelf currents. The second involved the indirect response of ice-shelf flow to the <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> observed in the ice streams that source the ice shelf. A finite-element model, based on viscous creep flow, was developed to test these hypotheses, but succeeded only in falsifying both hypotheses, i. e. showing that direct tidal effects produce too small a response, and indirect tidal effects produce a response that is not smooth in time. This nullification suggests that a combination of viscous and elastic deformation is required to explain the observations...|$|R

However, {{the results of our}} modeling show that <b>tidal</b> <b>signals</b> vary substantially over the year since individual constituents modulate total signals depending on the phase (cf. Eq. 14). This behavior is shown in Fig. 16 for the geomagnetic observatory VAL (Ireland) and the sea floor site T 12 - 2. Clearly, the peak amplitudes reach up to 5 nT and go as low as 1 nT.|$|R
