5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak was confronted by two more Chinese.

Eventually, all 20 men of <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving <b>the</b> <b>patrol,</b> both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As {{this was}} the first Boy Scouting event, the boys did not have uniform shirts, but they did wear khaki scarves and were {{presented}} with brass fleur-de-lis badges, the first use of the Scout emblem. They also wore a coloured knot on their shoulder indicating their patrol: green for Bulls, blue for Wolves, yellow for Curlews, and red for Ravens. <b>The</b> <b>patrol</b> leader carried a staff with a flag depicting <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> animal. After passing tests on knots, tracking, and the national flag, they were given another brass badge, a scroll with the words Be Prepared, to wear below the fleur-de-lis.|$|E

5|$|On 14 June 1952, Bleak {{was part}} of a patrol of the 2nd Battalion, 223rd Infantry, sent north to probe Chinese forward {{positions}} and attempt to obtain Chinese prisoners of war for interrogation. Bleak volunteered to accompany the 20-man patrol of an I Platoon on this mission, which was to send them to a sparsely vegetated feature called Hill 499, where Chinese forces were known to be operating. <b>The</b> <b>patrol</b> left United Nations lines at 04:30 Korea Standard Time on 14 June, under cover of darkness. It was preceded by an attack by F Company, 223rd Infantry, to the west which was intended to distract Chinese forces. However, as <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> ascended the hill, it came under heavy Chinese automatic weapons fire which struck the lead elements, injuring several soldiers. Bleak, {{at the rear of the}} formation, rushed forward and treated and stabilized several soldiers hit in the initial volley, then followed the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> as it continued its mission.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 2000, {{a patrol}} from 1 R IRISH left their base in Waterloo to visit Jordanian peacekeepers {{attached}} to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and based at Masiaka. Over lunch, they were informed that the West Side Boys had begun to disarm, despite their initial reluctance, and the company commander—Major Alan Marshall—decided to take <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> to investigate en route back to their base. <b>The</b> <b>patrol</b> turned off the main road onto a dirt track {{that led to the}} village of Magbeni, where the West Side Boys were based. As they approached the base, they were surrounded by a large group of West Side Boys, who used an anti-aircraft gun mounted on a Bedford truck to block the patrol's route. Marshall dismounted his vehicle, then resisted an attempt to grab his rifle and was beaten. He and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> were then forced into canoes at the bank of Rokel Creak and transported to Gberi Bana, a village {{on the other side of}} the river, just upstream from the point of the initial confrontation.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1918, Maxwell {{commanded}} a scouting patrol that was operating {{to the east}} of Ploegsteert. Having obtained the required information, he ordered <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> to withdraw. He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body when he noticed about thirty Germans nearby. Recalling <b>the</b> <b>patrol,</b> he led an attack against the party, which had sheltered in an old trench; the Germans quickly withdrew, leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war. Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement, news of which was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 13 May 1918.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Civil Defense <b>Patrols</b> {{were both}} {{responsible}} {{for and the}} victims of war crimes. Males as young as eight years old were forced to serve in <b>the</b> <b>Patrols.</b> In addition to typical military work, members were forced to serve as laborers. Those who refused were forced to find a replacement, or they could be fined, imprisoned, beaten or even executed, all without trial. They would also be labelled as rebel sympathizers and could become the victims of paramilitary groups such as <b>the</b> <b>Patrols</b> themselves. Members of <b>the</b> <b>patrols</b> were sometimes ordered by the local commanders to torture and murder other villagers. One commission found that 90% of the 700 massacres and 100,000 disappearances had been committed by either the army or <b>the</b> <b>patrols.</b> During a particularly violent period between March 1982 and August 1983, {{tens of thousands of}} indigenous people were tortured, raped and killed, and <b>the</b> <b>Patrols</b> are suspected to have participated in some of these. Sometimes, the army forced them to carry out these actions, but other times they chose to by themselves.|$|R

However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
