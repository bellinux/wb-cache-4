5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E

25|$|Paradoxical {{intention}} is a cognitive reframing technique where the insomniac, instead {{of attempting to}} fall asleep at night, makes every effort to stay awake (i.e. essentially stops trying to fall asleep). One theory <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> {{the effectiveness of this}} method is that by not voluntarily making oneself go to sleep, it relieves the performance anxiety that arises from the need or requirement to fall asleep, which is meant to be a passive act. This technique has been shown to reduce sleep effort and performance anxiety and also lower subjective assessment of sleep-onset latency and overestimation of the sleep deficit (a quality found in many insomniacs).|$|E

2500|$|The {{article on}} Ash Wednesday in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica says that, after the Protestant Reformation, the ashes {{ceremony}} was not forbidden in the Church of England, a statement <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> the research by Blair Meeks that the Anglican tradition [...] "never lapsed in this observance". It was even prescribed under King Henry VIII in 1538 and under King Edward VI in 1550, but it {{fell out of}} use in many areas after 1600. In 1536, the Ten Articles issued by authority of Henry VIII commended [...] "the observance of various rites and ceremonies as good and laudable, such as clerical vestments, sprinkling of holy water, bearing of candles on Candlemas-day, giving of ashes on Ash-Wednesday". After Henry's death in January 1547, Thomas Cranmer, within the same year, [...] "procured an order from the Council to forbid the carrying of candles on Candlemas-day, {{and the use of}} ashes on Ash-Wednesday, and of palms on Palm-Sunday, as superstitious ceremonies", an order that was issued only for the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury, of which Cranmer was archbishop. The Church Cyclopædia states that the [...] "English office had adapted the very old Salisbury service for Ash-Wednesday, prefacing it with an address and a recital of the curses of Mount Ebal, and then with an exhortation uses the older service very nearly as it stood." [...] The new Commination Office had no blessing of ashes and therefore, in England as a whole, [...] "soon after the Reformation, the use of ashes was discontinued as a 'vain show' and Ash Wednesday then became only a day of marked solemnity, with a memorial of its original character in a reading of the curses denounced against impenitent sinners". The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in the 19th century, observed Ash Wednesday: [...] "as a day of fasting and humiliation, wherein we are publicly to confess our sins, meekly to implore God's mercy and forgiveness, and humbly to intercede for the continuance of his favour". In the 20th century, the Book of Common Prayer provided prayers for the imposition of ashes.|$|E
