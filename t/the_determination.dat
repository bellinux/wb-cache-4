5|$|<b>The</b> <b>determination</b> of an {{individual}}'s age by anthropologists {{depends on}} whether or not the individual was an adult or a child. <b>The</b> <b>determination</b> of the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} longstanding doctrines that exclude {{judicial}} review of <b>the</b> <b>determinations</b> or findings <b>the</b> President makes as conditions for invoking statutory powers should be replaced. These doctrines are inconsistent with the fundamental constitutional commitment to reviewing whether federal officials act with legal authorization. Where a statute grants power conditioned upon an official making a determination that certain conditions obtain - as statutes that grant power to the President often do - review of whether that power is validly exercised requires review of <b>the</b> <b>determinations</b> <b>the</b> official makes to invoke the power. Review of those determinations is commonplace with regard to government actors subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. But because the Administrative Procedure Act {{does not apply to}} the President, courts have resorted to old common law doctrines barring review of <b>the</b> <b>determinations</b> <b>the</b> President makes to invoke statutory authority. While these doctrines had a justification when {{judicial review of}} the President’s actions occurred in individual damages actions against officials who implemented the President’s orders, they no longer do and should be abandoned. Instead, judicial review of the President’s claims of statutory power should extend, as it does for other officials, to all <b>the</b> <b>determinations</b> necessary to evaluate whether the President acts within the limits Congress has prescribed. To better describe and defend such review, this Article argues that we should conceive of it as a branch of ultra vires review, including review of the legal, factual, and law-as-applied-to-fact conclusions necessary to determine whether the President acts within the boundaries of statutory authority...|$|R
