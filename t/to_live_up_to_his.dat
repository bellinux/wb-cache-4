5|$|George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who {{had earlier}} praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure {{to take a}} lead after the Prayer Book {{rejection}} of 1928 meant that the Church of England {{had been unable to}} revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's laissez-faire approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his primacy with a great historical act, he had failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.|$|E

He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, {{establishing}} milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> <b>His</b> early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. Upon learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the Nine Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions during his two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he murdered his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed {{with a high level of}} suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E

5|$|The plot of Arrested Development {{revolves}} around {{the members of the}} Bluth family, a formerly-wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances and who often find themselves drawn into interactions with incestuous undertones. At the center of the show is Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the show's straight man, who strives {{to do the right thing}} and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness, and manipulative natures. Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but feels a constant pressure <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans. He battles with a crush he has on cousin Maeby, which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.|$|E

He made his debut against Manchester United at St James' Park, which {{included}} having a goal ruled out for offside. However, in his next game, he suffered a hamstring injury while playing against Fulham; upon his return, he was used {{in a number of}} roles, including left midfielder, failing <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> large price tag.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Árbenz's {{election}} in 1950, {{a handful of}} U.S. corporations controlled Guatemala's primary electrical utilities, the nation's only railroad, and the banana industry, which was Guatemala's chief agricultural export industry. By the mid-1940s, Guatemalan banana plantations {{accounted for more than}} one quarter of all of United Fruit Company's production in Latin America. Land reform was the centerpiece of Árbenz's election campaign. The revolutionary organizations that had helped put Árbenz in power put constant pressure on him <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> campaign promises regarding land reform. Árbenz continued Arévalo's reform agenda and in June 1952, his government enacted an agrarian reform program. Árbenz set land reform as his central goal, as only 2% of the population owned 70% of the land.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu {{served as}} the Supervisor of the Palace Writers {{for a long time}} and had access to state secrets. After he was reassigned to be the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, he felt {{dissatisfied}} and unhappy. When someone congratulated on his new appointment, he expressed his anger over losing his previous appointment. When he was serving as the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, he evaluated his subordinates based on their performance and dismissed those who failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> expectations. Emperor Wu once told Xun Xu that he hoped that Xun Xu would learn from Xun Yu and Xun You by promoting deserving officials and dismissing corrupt officials. A few months after Xun Xu assumed his new appointment, his mother died so he resigned and wanted to go home for filial mourning. However, Emperor Wu denied him permission and sent Zhou Hui (周恢) to announce an imperial edict ordering him to return to his job.|$|E

25|$|Lescot was a mulatto who {{had served}} in {{numerous}} government posts. He was competent and forceful, and many considered him a sterling candidate for the presidency, despite his elitist background. Like the majority of previous Haitian presidents, however, he failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> potential. His tenure paralleled that of Vincent in many ways. Lescot declared himself {{commander in chief of}} the military, and power resided in a clique that ruled with the tacit support of the Garde. He repressed his opponents, censored the press, and compelled the legislature to grant him extensive powers. He handled all budget matters without legislative sanction and filled legislative vacancies without calling elections. Lescot commonly said that Haiti's declared state-of-war against the Axis powers during World War II justified his repressive actions. Haiti, however, played no role in the war except for supplying the United States with raw materials and serving as a base for a United States Coast Guard detachment.|$|E
25|$|Royle bolstered Everton's squad for the 1995–96 season, with a club record £5 million {{move for}} Manchester United's {{unsettled}} Ukrainian winger Andrei Kanchelskis. He {{was determined to}} build on the FA Cup glory with a good run in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup however runs in the cup competitions were short lived. Everton's league form was vastly improved as they finished sixth and were narrowly pipped to a UEFA Cup place by Arsenal {{on the final day of}} the season. It had been a great season for Kanchelskis though, as he scored 16 goals and continued <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> reputation as the finest right-winger in the Premier League. However, he defected to Italian club Fiorentina halfway through the next season. Everton slowly fell apart without Kanchelskis, and manager Royle stepped down as manager on 27 March 1997 over a disagreement on transfers and with a relegation battle creeping upon the club. Veteran defender and captain Dave Watson took over as caretaker until the end of the season, helping confirm Everton's survival, but he did not want the job permanently and the hunt was now on for a new manager.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh's {{scores were}} worse {{the second time}} around, as Nafees failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{previous}} innings century after making 33, and opener Omar edged to the wicket keeper Gilchrist for 18. Soon the captain was run out for seven and Aftab Ahmed lost his wicket in the final over to see Bangladesh positioned at 124 for 5 at stumps. The fourth day continued in the same vain as Khaled Mashud was bowled for a duck in the second over {{of the day and}} both Shane Warne and Jason Gillespie made up for their first innings oversight by bowling and trapping the last five wickets of Bangladeshi for 88 runs, the former improving his previous 0-112 to this innings' 3-28, despite Mohammad Rafique taking three fours off him. Australia started the final innings in the knowledge that they have only twice, in fifty years, managed to pull off a second innings score higher than the first, needing as they did 307 runs for victory. Taking no risks, Australia's openers made a calm 67 either side of the tea break before captain Ricky Ponting came out with seven boundaries and an unbeaten 72 at the close of play. The second wicket partnership stood for 106 before Australian wickets began to tumble with two removals from left-arm slow bowler Mohammad Rafique to leave the team at 212-4, with only their high-scoring skipper and Adam Gilchrist (6*) in the way of their five bowlers at the lower order.|$|E

25|$|Hoad, seeded {{first among}} the foreign players at the U.S. Championships, failed <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> seeding {{when he lost}} to Ham Richardson in a five-set quarterfinal. His lackluster form {{continued}} when he was defeated by unseeded Luis Ayala in the quarterfinal of the Pacific Southwest Championships in mid-September. After returning to Australia {{at the end of}} September Hoad scheduled extra practice to work on his serve and volley but subsequently lost to Don Candy in the semifinal of the Sydney Metropolitan Championships. In early November matters briefly improved as he consolidated the Queensland title in Brisbane. In the final he overcame a sunstroke and the loss of sets three and four by 0–6 to defeat Hartwig in five sets. In mid November he was upset by veteran John Bromwich who better exploited the windy conditions in the quarterfinal of the N.S.W. Championships. At the Victorian Championships, the last significant tournament before the Davis Cup Challenge Round, Hoad was defeated in straight sets in the semifinal by Seixas. As in the previous match against Sven Davidson he showed such poor form and at times an apparent lack of interest that he was jeered by the crowd and several left after he smashed a ball into the stands. The 1954 Davis Cup Challenge Round was played on 27–29 December on the grass courts at the White City Stadium in Sydney between title holders Australia and the United States. Hoad played the first rubber, in front of a record crowd of 25,000, which he lost to world No.1 Trabert in a high-quality four-set match. Rosewall also lost his singles match and the United States won back the cup after Seixas and Trabert defeated Hoad and Rosewall in four sets in the doubles rubber. At the end of an erratic and ultimately disappointing season Hoad's world ranking slipped to No.7. In a 1956 interview Hoad admitted that especially in 1954 he often got fed-up with tennis and didn't care whether he played or not.|$|E

Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to", trying <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> successful brother Reggie.

England under the Stuarts was Egypt; they were Israel fleeing ... to establish a refuge for godliness, a city upon a hill." [...] By the time of John Adams' birth in 1735, Puritan tenets such as predestination were no longer as widely accepted, and many of their stricter practices had moderated with time, but Adams [...] "considered them bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency." [...] It was a value system which he believed in and wished to live up to. Adams emphatically recalled that his parents [...] "held every Species of Libertinage in...
