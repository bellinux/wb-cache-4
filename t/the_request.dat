40|$|In some research, it is {{elaborated}} {{that the}} process of extradition, MLA, Good Mutual Relation are conducted between governments represented by central authority from each state, meanwhile the process of Handing-Over is conducted by police (Ncb-Interpol) of each state.

In practice, those four are influenced by ten factors: the difference in legal system and legal politics, the existence of agreement between <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> state and <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> state, clauses and the qualification of the clauses in the agreement of extradition or MLA, formulation of extradition and MLA in international convention, formulation of extradition and MLA in <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> state, relationship of <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> and <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> states, bargaining position of a state, facility and infrastructure, law enforcer means and Law awareness of law subject...|$|R

50|$|Extradition is the {{mechanism}} by which one sovereign requests and obtains custody of a fugitive located within the jurisdiction and control of another sovereign. It is an ancient mechanism, dating back to at least the thirteenth century BCE, when an Egyptian Pharaoh negotiated an extradition treaty with a Hittite King. Through the extradition process, a sovereign (<b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> state) typically makes a formal request to another sovereign (<b>the</b> <b>requested</b> state). If <b>the</b> fugitive is found within the territory of <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> state, then <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> state may arrest the fugitive and subject {{him or her to}} its extradition process. The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> state.|$|R

40|$|We analyse a {{scheduling}} {{system in}} which users announce requests for information from a server some time before they actually need this information. Each constituent of <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> information has its own specific deadline, which is characteristic for applications that gradually consume a stream of information (e. g., video). For that purpose, a request fully specifies when <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> user needs each constituent of this information. Since each user device {{is equipped with a}} buffer, the server can exploit this detailed timing information to deliver parts of <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> information upfront. <b>The</b> more <b>the</b> <b>requests</b> are announced in advance, the better the ability of the server to avoid deadline violations. We investigate for a given server capacity via semi-analytical techniques complemented with simulations how much <b>the</b> <b>requests</b> need to be announced in advance to essentially avoid violating all deadlines...|$|R
30|$|For a MN in a MANET that {{requests}} {{information to}} DS {{or to the}} Internet through a gateway, the first strategy to reduce the traffic in the network is to implement a local cache for <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> documents. This cache can serve <b>the</b> <b>requests</b> of <b>the</b> node itself to the same document even if the DS is not available. In that case <b>the</b> <b>requests</b> will not introduce any traffic in the MANET.|$|R
30|$|Our {{algorithm}} comprises {{two main}} phases: monitoring and eviction. In the monitoring phase (see Algorithm 1), the cache collects information about access to pages and user <b>requests.</b> <b>The</b> algorithm keeps, for each cached page, the page’s hit count while cached (frequency) and the timestamp {{of the latest}} access to the page (recency). On a cache hit, the frequency and recency information of <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> object is updated and its cached version is returned to the user. If, on the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> object is not cached, the system gets it from the origin server before returning it to <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> user. In addition, a cache miss triggers the eviction phase of the algorithm if <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> object does not fit in the available free space.|$|R
