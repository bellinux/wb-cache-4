40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, it {{examines}} the trend and nature of East Asian trade. The United Nations BEC classification is utilized to categorize total <b>trade</b> into <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> semi-finished goods, <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> components and parts, <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> capital goods as well as <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> final consumption goods. It shows that the increasing importance of East Asia as a trading region is due at least partially to the rising <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> components and parts. Next, it tries to find out if foreign direct investment plays a role in the import and export behavior of East Asian intra-regional trade. Using a gravity model, it evidences that in general FDI is important in explaining imports and exports of intra-East Asian <b>trade.</b> <b>In</b> particular, FDI is especially important <b>in</b> explaining <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> components and parts, followed by <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> capital goods. This helps confirm that FDI and trade associated with production fragmentation in East Asia are complementary. ...|$|R

Private fur traders, mostly promyshlenniki, launched fur trading expeditions from Kamchatka, at first focusing on nearby islands such as the Commander Islands.
