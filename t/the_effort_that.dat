25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>that</b> these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E

The video was shot in Reykjavík in over two days. The director wrote the initial treatment for the video after visiting museums in London. The video features a mix of CG pictures and real natural elements, gathered by the team from different location in Iceland. The floating rocks in the video are made from foam and covered in plaster, fossilized barnacles and various textiles, the rock's tongues and the sand are computer animated; for this reason, the post-production lasted two months.

500|$|The gaming blog Polygon was {{launched}} on October 24, 2012, as Vox Media's third property. The site grew from technology blog The Verge, which {{was launched}} {{a year earlier}} as an outgrowth of sports blog network SB Nation before Vox Media was formed. Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff approached Joystiq editor-in-chief Christopher Grant in early 2011 about starting a video game website. Bankoff considered video games to be a logical vertical market for Vox, whose sites attracted an 18- to 49-year-old demographic. He also saw games to be an expanding market in consideration of mobile and social network game categories. Forbes described Bankoff's offer as a [...] "serious commitment to online journalism" [...] {{in an age of}} content farms and disappearing print publications, but Grant did not trust the offer and declined. Upon seeing <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>that</b> Vox put into The Verge, their Chorus content management system, and the quality of their content and sponsorships, Grant changed his mind and returned to pitch Bankoff. Grant wanted the new site to compete with top gaming websites GameSpot and IGN, but still be able to run longform [...] "magazine-style journalism" [...] that could be of historic interest. As part of the site's attempt to [...] "redefine games journalism", Vox made a 13-part documentary series of the site's creation ("Press Reset") that tracked the site's creation from start to launch.|$|E

[...] "From where I sit, it's got to be in the top five, if not three", said TV Guides Matt Mitovich in regards to this episode. Mitovich noted, [...] "...I can only bow with great reverence to <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>that</b> goes into 30 Rock, where in an episode like this week's, every other line is funny and/or fantastically absurd." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning opined than an episode like this one, with its guest stars and taking on the issue of race, got [...] "some decent laughs", though it [...] "failed to produce a solid half hour." [...] Canning disliked LL Cool J's guest spot, observing that it was [...] "nothing more than a generic caricature put in the role of a sub-par straight man", but enjoyed Wayne Brady's, as he was [...] "a successful part of the episode's best storyline." [...] Canning said that Tracy as Oprah was [...] "more weird than funny, unfortunately", but liked that Jason Sudeikis made a brief appearance as [...] "Flower Guy" [...] in the episode. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. Mekeisha Madden Toby for The Detroit News found the episode a [...] "side-splitter".|$|E
