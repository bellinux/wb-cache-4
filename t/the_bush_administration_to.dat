5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>to</b> appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman.

5|$|Ryan {{voted to}} extend {{unemployment}} insurance in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E

25|$|In July 2006, Van Hollen urged <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> {{support a}} ceasefire {{supported}} by a peacekeeping force that would end the 2006 Lebanon War.

The 9/11 Commission reported that, despite recent alliances with the U.S., the UAE had strong ties to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda prior to the 9/11 attacks. The measure in the House was H.R 4807, and in the Senate, S. 2333; these were introduced to require a 45-day review of this transfer of ownership. On March 9, 2006, Dubai Ports World withdrew its application to operate the ports.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the period}} of combat in March–April 2003, both protests and armed combat {{experienced}} a temporary decline in intensity. Protests against the war as a whole continued, often {{on the occasion of}} anniversaries of the war and visits by members of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> foreign cities. Within the United States, general anti-war protests were joined by protests focusing on particular issues or strategies including: opposition to torture and abuse (such as that in the Abu Ghraib prison), calls for withdrawal of members of the coalition from Iraq, counter-recruitment, support for military resisters such as Lt. Ehren Watada, and opposition to military and corporate contractors. The largest protests during this period have been national, multi-issue mobilizations such as those on August 30, 2004, and April 29, 2006. Black bloc elements were present during some of the protests.|$|E
500|$|Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, , {{is a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that {{military}} commissions set up by <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> try detainees at Guantanamo Bay lack [...] "the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949."

500|$|Corzine {{tried and}} failed to {{introduce}} legislation for chemical plant regulation six weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

500|$|Many {{economists and}} world governments {{determined}} that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped for <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E
500|$|After his {{re-election}} in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated criticism {{from across the}} political spectrum for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "Great Recession", prompting <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.|$|E

500|$|Former Pat Buchanan pollster Frank Luntz {{was hired}} by the campaign, along with former Republican National Campaign Committee {{chairman}} Charles Leonard. The New York Times reported that Perot sought the help of operatives to search court and federal documents to find information that might reflect poorly on the potential candidate so that preparations could be made to respond. In the final round of Democratic and Republican primaries, most notably in California, exit polls revealed that 42% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats favored Perot. A Time Magazine poll found that Perot had 37% support of all the electorate, ahead of both Bush and Clinton who tied for second at 24%. At this time, Vice President Dan Quayle became the most senior member of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> criticize Perot, calling him a [...] "temperamental tycoon".|$|E

500|$|Biden became {{interested}} in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. [...] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden {{was among the first to}} call for the [...] "lift and strike" [...] policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes. [...] Both the George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement. [...] In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. [...] Biden related that he told Milošević, [...] "I think you're a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one." [...] Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> arm the Bosnians, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance preferred by the Clinton administration, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman. The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort. [...] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his [...] "proudest moment in public life" [...] that related to foreign policy. [...] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia and Montenegro, and co-sponsored with his friend John McCain the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on President Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milosevic over Serbian actions in Kosovo. [...] In 1998, Congressional Quarterly named Biden one of [...] "Twelve Who Made a Difference" [...] for playing a lead role in several foreign policy matters, including NATO enlargement and the successful passage of bills to streamline foreign affairs agencies and punish religious persecution overseas.|$|E
