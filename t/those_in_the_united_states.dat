5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E
5|$|In February 1989 {{one hundred}} {{construction}} workers were assembling temporary housing {{for themselves in}} Leninakan {{with a plan to}} start on the local population's housing {{by the end of the}} month, though schools and factories were also on the list of facilities to be rebuilt. Deputy chairman of a city building and architecture council said that updated building codes like <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> were being drafted (along with a strict requirement that the new protocols be respected) and that the new buildings would be no taller than four stories and would be located away from areas with the highest seismic risk. Other officials decided that the town would be relocated several miles to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and driver training, but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While it might be argued that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different from <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> the U.S. fatality rate is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more small cars driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests that differences in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as driver behavior.|$|E

25|$|Various groups {{support or}} embody the anti-sweatshop {{movement}} today. The National Labor Committee brought sweatshops {{into the mainstream}} media in the 1990s when it exposed the use of sweatshop and child labor to sew clothing for Kathie Lee Gifford's Wal-Mart label. United Students Against Sweatshops is active on college campuses. The International Labor Rights Fund filed a lawsuit on behalf of workers in China, Nicaragua, Swaziland, Indonesia, and Bangladesh against Wal-Mart charging the company with knowingly developing purchasing policies particularly relating to price and delivery time that are impossible to meet while following the Wal-Mart code of conduct. Labor unions, such as the AFL-CIO, have helped support the anti-sweatshop movement out of concern both {{for the welfare of}} workers in the developing world and <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
25|$|Populations found outside North America {{originate}} from the United States. In 2011, the DNA of specimens from Australia, China, and Taiwan was analysed with results showing {{that they are}} related to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Despite its spread, S. geminata has a greater geographical range than the red imported fire ant, {{but it can be}} easily displaced by it. Because of this, almost all of its exotic range in North America has been lost and the ant has almost disappeared there. On roadsides in Florida, 83% of these sites had S. geminata present when the red imported fire ant was absent, but only 7% when it is present. This means that the ant can probably invade many tropical and subtropical regions where S. geminata populations are present.|$|E
25|$|The border city of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, offers big-city {{amenities}} like museums, a zoo, {{a sports}} convention center, {{and an international}} airport.

Many shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are also located in walking distance from the border. Also many residents from California, Arizona and Nevada look for medical and dental services in Mexicali, because they tend to be less expensive than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college-aged Southern Californians.
