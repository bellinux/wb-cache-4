5|$|To provide <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> <b>performance,</b> several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Cable driven {{systems have}} been applied in several {{manipulators}} and due to their high backdrivability and apparent low inertia have been successfully used in telemanipulation systems. However, {{in order to achieve}} high performances, a control to keep the cables taut is needed. In this paper, a position control in the null and range space is used to avoid cables from slacking and to achieve <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> <b>performances.</b> Indeed, a cable driven manipulator is a redundant system and its null space represents the internal forces, that is the tensions of the cables. To guarantee robustness against model parametric uncertainties and external disturbances, a position based disturbance observer has been designed. Proof of stability of the proposed control and bounds of the estimation error have been given. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control achieve <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> <b>performances</b> keeping <b>the</b> cables taut...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the tuning of a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller) regulator, with B-spline basis functions of order 3, implemented in an automatic daylight control system. After the tuning {{process of the}} regulator scaling gains, a set of ranges for scaling gains resulted. For these ranges of scaling gains the automatic lighting control system (ALCS) satisfied <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> <b>performances.</b> After <b>the</b> tuning process, {{the behavior of the}} ALCS {{in the presence of the}} illuminance disturbances was studied. At the final of the paper, an experimental tuning algorithm of the regulator scaling gains via ALCS step responses analysis is proposed. Even if the used experimental model of the process is a gross approximation of the real model of the process, using this experimental tuning algorithm, the designer can find a set of ranges of the regulator scaling gains for which the ALCS is stable and satisfy <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> <b>performances...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Fanno flow {{model is}} often used {{in the design and}} {{analysis}} of nozzles. [...] In a nozzle, the converging or diverging area is modeled with isentropic flow, while the constant area section afterwards is modeled with Fanno flow. [...] For given upstream conditions at point 1 as shown in Figures 3 and 4, calculations can be made to determine the nozzle exit Mach number and the location of a normal shock in the constant area duct. [...] Point 2 labels the nozzle throat, where M= 1 if the flow is choked. [...] Point 3 labels the end of the nozzle where the flow transitions from isentropic to Fanno. [...] With a high enough initial pressure, supersonic flow can be maintained through the constant area duct, similar to <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> <b>performance</b> of a blowdown-type supersonic wind tunnel. [...] However, these figures show the shock wave before it has moved entirely through the duct. [...] If a shock wave is present, the flow transitions from the supersonic portion of the Fanno line to the subsonic portion before continuing towards M= 1. [...] The movement in Figure 4 is always from the left to the right in order to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
