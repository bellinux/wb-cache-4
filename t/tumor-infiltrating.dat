We employed and compared the performances of three methods of spectral classification for tissue characterization, including spectral slope analysis, principle component analysis (PCA), and artificial neural network (ANN) classification. The ANN classifier yielded the best correlation between spectral pattern and histopathological diagnosis, with a typical sensitivity of 80 % and specificity of 93 % for differentiating tumor from normal brain tissues.

40|$|The SSX- 2 gene encodes a tumor-specific antigen {{expressed}} in neoplasms of various histological types. By analyzing a <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> lymph node of a melanoma patient bearing an SSX- 2 -expressing tumor, we have recently identified the first SSX- 2 -derived CD 8 (+) T-cell epitope, {{that corresponds to}} peptide SSX- 2 (41 - 49), and is recognized by specific CTL in an HLA-A 2 restricted fashion. Here, we have used fluorescent HLA-A 2 /SSX- 2 (41 - 49) peptide multimeric complexes to analyze the response to SSX- 2 (41 - 49) in melanoma patients and healthy donors. Multimer(+) CD 8 (+) T cells were readily detected {{in the majority of}} patients bearing SSX- 2 -expressing tumors and, at lower proportions, in patients with nonexpressing tumors and healthy donors. Importantly, isolated A 2 /SSX- 2 (41 - 49) multimer(+) CD 8 (+) T cells exhibited a large functional heterogeneity in terms of antigen recognition and tumor reactivity. SSX- 2 -specific CTLs isolated from <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> lymph node of antigen-expressing patients {{as well as from the}} corresponding peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibited high functional avidity of antigen recognition and efficiently recognized antigen-expressing tumors. In contrast, SSX- 2 -specific CTLs isolated from patients with undetectable responses in the <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> lymph node, as well as from healthy donors, recognized the antigen with decreased functional avidity and were not tumor reactive. Together, these data indicate that CD 8 (+) T-cell responses to SSX- 2 (41 - 49) frequently occur in SSX- 2 -expressing melanoma patients and suggest that SSX- 2 (41 - 49) -specific CTLs of high avidity and tumor reactivity are selectively expanded during immune responses to SSX- 2 -expressing tumors in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background: Trogocytosis {{is defined}} as the {{transfer}} of cell-surface membrane proteins and membrane patches from one cell to another through contact. It is reported that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) could be transferred from cancer cells to monocytes via trogocytosis; however, the clinical significance of this is unknown. The aim {{of this study is to}} demonstrate the presence and evaluate the clinical significance of HER 2 + <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> immune cells (arising through HER 2 trogocytosis) in HER 2 -overexpressing (HER 2 +) breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab-based primary systemic therapy (PST). Methods: To assess the trogocytosis of HER 2 from cancer cells to immune cells, and to evaluate the up- and down-regulation of HER 2 on immune and cancer cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers and breast cancer patients were co-cultured with HER 2 + and HER 2 -negative breast cancer cell lines with and without trastuzumab, respectively. The correlation between HER 2 expression on <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> immune cells and a pathological complete response (pCR) in HER 2 + breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab-based PST was analyzed. Results: HER 2 was transferred from HER 2 + breast cancer cells to monocytes and natural killer cells by trogocytosis. Trastuzumab-mediated trogocytosed-HER 2 + effector cells exhibited greater CD 107 a expression than non-HER 2 -trogocytosed effector cells. In breast cancer patients, HER 2 expression on <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> immune cells in treatment naïve HER 2 + tumors was associated with a pCR to trastuzumab-based PST. Conclusions: HER 2 -trogocytosis is visible evidence of tumor microenvironment interaction between cancer cells and immune cells. Given that effective contact between these cells is critical for immune destruction of target cancer cells, this interaction is of great significance. It is possible that HER 2 trogocytosis could be used as a predictive biomarker for trastuzumab-based PST efficacy in HER 2 + breast cancer patients...|$|R

It may therefore represent a source of CD 8 (+) T cell epitopes useful for specific immunotherapy of cancer. To identify potential SSX- 2 -derived epitopes that can be recognized by CD 8 (+) T cells, we used an approach that combined: 1) the in vitro proteasomal digestion of precursor peptides overlapping the complete SSX- 2 sequence; 2) the prediction of SSX- 2 -derived peptides with an appropriate HLA-A 2 binding score; and 3) the analysis of a <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> lymph node cell population from an HLA-A 2 (+) melanoma patient with detectable anti-SSX- 2 serum Abs. This strategy allowed us to identify peptide SSX- 2 (41 - 49) as an HLA-A 2 -restricted epitope.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) can distinguish <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> edema in gliomas from pure edema in meningiomas and metastases. Material and Methods: Thirty patients were studied: 18 WHO grade III or IV gliomas, 7 meningiomas, and 5 metastatic lesions. ADC and FA were determined from ROIs placed in peritumoral areas with T 2 -signal changes, adjacent normal appearing white matter (NAWM), and corresponding areas in the contralateral healthy brain. Values and lesion-to-brain ratios from gliomas were compared to those from meningiomas and metastases. Results: Values and lesion-to-brain ratios of ADC and FA in peritumoral areas with T 2 -signal changes did not differ between gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases (P = 0. 40, P = 0. 40, P = 0. 61, P = 0. 34). Values of ADC and FA and the lesion-to-brain ratio of FA in the adjacent NAWM did not differ between tumor types (P = 0. 74, P = 0. 25, and P = 0. 31). The lesion-to-brain ratio of ADC in the adjacent NAWM was higher in gliomas than in meningiomas and metastases (P = 0. 004), but overlapped between tumor types. Conclusion: Values and lesion-to-brain ratios of ADC and FA in areas with T 2 -signal changes surrounding intracranial tumors and adjacent NAWM were not helpful for distinguishing pure edema from <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> edema when data from gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases were compared...|$|R

However, this process is complicated because Tregs seem to be preferentially trafficked to the tumor microenvironment.

Here, we describe the supertoroidal model, which incorporates an increase in surface genus and a continuum of toroidal shapes to improve upon the characterization of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). DTI brain datasets of 18 individuals with GBM and 18 normal subjects were acquired using a 3 T scanner. A supertoroidal model of the diffusion tensor and two new diffusion tensor invariants, one to evaluate diffusivity, the toroidal volume (TV), and one to evaluate anisotropy, the toroidal curvature (TC), were applied and evaluated in the characterization of GBM brain tumors. TV and TC were compared with the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) indices inside the tumor, surrounding edema, as well as contralateral to the lesions, in the white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM). The supertoroidal model enhanced the borders between tumors and surrounding structures, refined the boundaries between WM and GM, and revealed the heterogeneity inherent to <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> tissue. Both MD and TV demonstrated high intensities in the tumor, with lower values in the surrounding edema, which in turn were higher than those of unaffected brain parenchyma. Both TC and FA were effective in revealing the structural degradation of WM tracts.

Furthermore, knocking down CXCL 1 expression in 3 LL cells significantly hindered tumor growth by inhibiting recruitment of neutrophils from peripheral blood into tumor tissues. Additionally, <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> neutrophils expressed higher levels of MPO and Fas/FasL, which may be involved in TAN-mediated inhibition of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells.

In melanoma and certain other cancers, the numbers of mutations and neoantigens correlate with patient response.

Results: Strict somatotopic organisation in the primary sensory cortex was shown in the group average; at the subject level the thumb was located laterally, anteriorly and inferiorly to the little finger in 94 % of subjects (Paper 1). The sensorimotor and language areas close to intracranial tumors were identified in 95 % of patients. Paradigm effectiveness ranged from 79 to 95 %. The median quality of the activation maps was high. fMRI contributed to the decision to operate, the surgical approach and the extent of the resection in 9, 13 and 12 patients, respectively (Paper 2). BOLD activation obtained from fMRI with motor, sensory and language stimulation pre- and postoperatively in glioma patients yielded differences in the spatial extent similar to those obtained from repeated examinations in healthy controls (Paper 3). Values and lesion-to-brain ratios of ADC and FA in peritumoral edema did not differ between high grade gliomas, meningiomas and metastases (Paper 4). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the spatial resolution of fMRI using a clinical protocol is adequate for localisation of the sensory representation of a finger (Paper 1). Preoperative fMRI for mapping of motor, sensory and language functions at 3 T is feasible and contributes to neurosurgical decision making (Paper 2). Longitudinal pre- and postoperative fMRI studies may be performed in patients with gliomas without concerns for potential effects of the decreased tumor volume on the BOLD effect as a possible source of error (Paper 3). Values and lesion-to-brain ratios of ADC and FA may not be useful to distinguish pure edema from <b>tumor-infiltrated</b> edema in peritumoral areas with T 2 -signal changes (Paper 4) ...|$|R
