The designer's desire to accurately replicate <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Walled City {{is reflected in the}} arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|Barman drew on {{data and}} {{measurements}} taken by Heather Knutson, {{a student at}} Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. The planet orbits its parent star every {{three and a half}} days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded {{that there must be}} a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E

5|$|In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe {{visited the}} Saturn system. It sent back the first {{high-resolution}} {{images of the}} planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from {{the plane of the}} Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Since 1912 {{the teams}} {{have played the}} game at the Cotton Bowl stadium in Dallas, Texas, amid <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{adjacent}} Texas State Fair. This is unusual because most college football games alternate between the opponents home stadiums. Dallas {{was chosen as the}} neutral site because it is approximately halfway between the two schools. The stadium is divided down the 50-yard line, with half of the stadium predominantly clad in the crimson and cream colors of Oklahoma, and the other half mostly wearing the burnt orange and white of Texas.|$|E

5|$|The metal is {{divalent}} {{and has a}} noticeably high volatility. In {{order to}} reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reductant gas, for example H2O+HCl for EsOCl so that the sample is partly regrown during its decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Umboh was {{an authoritarian}} perfectionist, who often reshot scenes he felt flawed and refused {{input from the}} actors. He {{sometimes}} worked together with other directors, including Sjumandjaja, Misbach Yusa Biran, and Arifin C. Noer, to improve the film's flow. These collaborations influenced <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> films; for example, films shot with Noer like Sesuatu yang Indah (Something Beautiful; 1976) came across as surrealistic, while collaborations with Sjumandjaja were more realistic. Shooting scripts were often prepared minutes before shooting, but, according to Karya, Umboh memorised each line of dialogue and used his recollection during dubbing.|$|E
5|$|WASP-17b is an {{exoplanet}} in {{the constellation}} Scorpius that is orbiting the star WASP-17. Its discovery was announced on 11 August 2009. It is the first planet discovered to have a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in a direction counter to the rotation of its host star. This discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory. In terms of diameter, WASP-17b is the second-largest exoplanet discovered yet, and at half Jupiter's mass, this makes it the most puffy planet known. On 3 December 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope reported detecting water in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exoplanet.|$|E
40|$|The {{solar wind}} is {{expected}} to have an important influence on <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon, Mercury and Venus and therefore a brief outline of solar wind theory is presented along with <b>the</b> predicted properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind at <b>the</b> orbits <b>of</b> these planets. Since <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon and possibly Mercury are formed primarily by solar wind accretion, we present the latest accretion models for these bodies.

5|$|White Zombie is {{considered}} the first feature length zombie film. A sequel to the film, titled Revolt of the Zombies, opened in 1936. Modern reception to White Zombie has been more positive than its initial release. Some critics have praised <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, comparing it to the 1940s horror film productions of Val Lewton, while others still have an unfavorable opinion {{on the quality of}} the acting.|$|E
5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction of violence, and felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the White House {{with other members of}} the International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. Riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to water and ammonia, <b>the</b> clouds in <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas giant planets contain ammonium sulfides. The reddish-brownish clouds {{are attributed to}} polysulfides, arising from the exposing the ammonium sulfides to light.|$|R

5|$|Louise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her {{household}} {{to move from}} Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. <b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal court became gloomy and morbid {{in the wake of}} the Prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull. Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged mourning. For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation {{and the development of}} lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
5|$|The changes led to {{significant}} department reorganisations within RNC, with several dozen staff members being summarily dismissed without explanation; some {{were replaced by}} volunteers. A number of former college employees made complaints regarding {{the manner in which}} their employment was ended. In July 2008 the college lecturers union, the University and College Union, called for greater consultation between management and staff at the college. Speaking in a 2009 interview with In Touch Ian Pickford, who was brought in as interim principal following Christine Steadman's departure, claimed that <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> college had changed and issued a challenge to any student or member of staff who was still unhappy to meet with him to discuss their concerns.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the Sun's {{development}} suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star {{would not have been}} able to sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.|$|E
5|$|The {{story and}} cut scene {{animations}} were created in-house. The plot was originally written by Fox, {{who had also}} written most of the Sly Cooper stories, and reviewed by Fleming. As they continued to develop the game, they rewrote pieces of the story to reflect changes in the game, {{making sure that the}} story remained enjoyable. As the game became more complex, they brought in Bill Harms, a published comic book author, who had previously written for Supreme Commander and other video games. Harms assisted with the story and in-game dialog in addition to marketing materials. Fleming noted that {{the second half of the}} story underwent significant changes in the last nine months of development; for example, when voice actor Caleb Moody voiced the lines for Zeke, he ad libbed additional lines that the team found to be enjoyable, and they reworked the story to incorporate them. The cut scenes were created in a similar format to the comics that the game was influenced by, and used to further extend <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superhero motif. The cut scenes were created by taking 2D art created in Corel Painter and Adobe Photoshop and placing them into artificial 3D stages built in Adobe After Effects to create a pseudo-3D effect that allowed them to play with camera placement and effects, and addition of organic elements such as dust clouds and ink spots.|$|E
