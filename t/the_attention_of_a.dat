On 3 October 2003, he delivered an additional 14,000 signatures. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter endorsed the petition when granted a chance to speak on Cuban television, bringing Payá's efforts to <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wide Cuban audience. Cuban President Fidel Castro described the petition drive as a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government.|$|E

5|$|Tracy finally {{achieved}} {{some success}} by joining {{forces with the}} notable stock manager William H. Wright {{in the spring of}} 1924. A stage partnership was formed with the young actress Selena Royle, who had already made her name on Broadway. It proved a popular draw and their productions were favorably received. One of these shows brought Tracy to <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Broadway producer, who offered him the lead in a new play. The Sheepman previewed in October 1925, but it received poor reviews and closed after its trial run in Connecticut. Dejected, Tracy was forced back to Wright and the stock circuit.|$|E

5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection report {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E

5|$|By 1928, Tschaikovsky's claim had {{received}} interest and {{attention in the}} United States, where Gleb Botkin had published articles in support of her cause. Botkin's publicity caught <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distant cousin of Anastasia's, Xenia Leeds, a former Russian princess who had married a wealthy American industrialist. Botkin and Leeds arranged for Tschaikovsky {{to travel to the}} United States on board the liner Berengaria at Leeds's expense. On the journey from Seeon to the States, Tschaikovsky stopped at Paris, where she met Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia, the Tsar's cousin, who believed her to be Anastasia. For six months Tschaikovsky lived at the estate of the Leeds family in Oyster Bay, New York.|$|E
5|$|Following his triumph, Germanicus {{was sent}} to Asia to reorganize the provinces and kingdoms of Asia, which were in such disarray that <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> domus Augusta was deemed {{necessary}} to settle matters. Germanicus was given imperium maius (extraordinary command) over the other governors and commanders of the area he was to operate; however, Tiberius had replaced the governor of Syria with Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who {{was meant to be}} his helper (adiutor), but turned out to be hostile. According to Tacitus, this was an attempt to separate Germanicus from his familiar troops and weaken his influence, but the historian Richard Alston says Tiberius had little reason to undermine his heir.|$|E
5|$|Gosling came to <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wider {{audience}} in 2004 with {{a leading role}} in the commercially successful romantic drama The Notebook. His performance as a drug-addicted teacher in Half Nelson (2006) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and his performance as a socially inept loner in Lars and the Real Girl (2007) was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

Gosling co-starred in three mainstream films in 2011–the romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, the political drama The Ides of March, and the neo-noir crime thriller Drive–and received two more Golden Globe Award nominations. His directorial debut, Lost River, was released to poor reviews in 2014. Greater success came to Gosling when he starred in two critically acclaimed films–the financial comedy-drama The Big Short (2015) and the musical La La Land (2016).

5|$|In 1741, the Chamouny {{valley and}} its glaciers {{on the north}} side of the massif were {{discovered}} and written about by two aristocratic travelling Englishmen, named William Windham and Richard Pococke. The descriptions of their exploits were published across Europe, bringing the mountains of the Mont Blanc range to <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wide audience for the first time. In 1760, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure offered a large financial prize to the first people who successfully ascended Mont Blanc. The summit was finally attained on 8 August 1786 by two Chamonix men, the guide Jacques Balmat and Dr. Michel Paccard. The decades that followed saw the gradual opening up of Chamonix to the world, as well as the rest of the Mont Blanc massif. The many published accounts of climbs and impressive sights amongst or around the mountain range attracted numerous wealthy and notable visitors, for whom a visit to marvel at the Sea of Ice (the Mer de Glace) became a fashionable thing to experience.|$|E
5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar attracted <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport {{almost two years ago}} the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E

5|$|Sue Bailey Thurman (née, Sue Elvie Bailey; August 26, 1903 – December 25, 1996) was an American author, lecturer, {{historian}} {{and civil rights}} activist. She was the first non-white student to earn a bachelor's degree in music from Oberlin College, Ohio. She briefly taught at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, before becoming involved in international work with the YWCA in 1930. During a six-month trip through Asia in the mid 1930s, Thurman became the first African-American woman to have an audience with Mahatma Gandhi. The meeting with Gandhi inspired Thurman and her husband, theologian Howard Thurman, to promote non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} creating social change, bringing it to <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young preacher, Martin Luther King Jr. While they did not actively protest during the Civil Rights Movement, they served as spiritual counselors to many on the front lines, and helped establish the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States.|$|E

Although it failed, the strike was the first organized industrial agitation in Northern Rhodesia and is viewed by some as the first overt action against colonial rule. It caught <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of African townsmen, leading {{to the creation of}} trade unions and African nationalist politics, and is seen as the birth of African nationalism.|$|E
5|$|The Invasion of Île Bonaparte was an amphibious {{operation}} in 1810 that formed {{an important part}} of the British campaign to blockade and capture the French Indian Ocean territories of Île Bonaparte (now Réunion) and Isle de France (now Mauritius) during the Napoleonic Wars. These islands formed a fortified base for a French frigate squadron under Commodore Jacques Hamelin to raid British convoys of East Indiamen travelling between Britain and British India. Hamelin's ships had destroyed two convoys the previous year despite <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> squadron of Royal Navy ships under Commodore Josias Rowley.
