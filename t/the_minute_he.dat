500|$|Heisman {{recalled}} that, when Strupper {{first arrived}} from Riverside Military Academy, Heisman {{could not imagine}} Strupper playing on the football team: [...] "Too light for the line, I didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't {{be able to get}} the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>he</b> began looking for openings through which to run the ball." [...] He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Duffy, {{who would}} play Pamela's {{on-screen}} love, knew the part was ideal for Principal <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>he</b> set {{his eyes on}} her. He recalled {{that one of the}} finalists for Pamela [...] "was a remarkably talented young actress from New York... really good. , in walked Victoria Principal with the tightest jeans I've ever seen and the most unbelievable blouse. I just went, 'Hello, Pam'. I knew {{she was going to be}} Pam Ewing." [...] Producer Michael Filerman (Knots Landing and Falcon Crest) offered insight, [...] "Principal really wanted that role...and worked very hard to get it. And there's a humanity about her that's just winning. And the camera likes her very much. The camera just loves her. That's real important." [...] During the pilot filming, Principal became very close with teenaged actress Charlene Tilton, who played Lucy Ewing. Principal explained that [...] "the location shooting was hard on Tilton, who was only seventeen and had never been away from home".|$|E
500|$|Coach John Heisman's swift backfield {{used the}} pre-snap {{movement}} of his [...] "jump shift" [...] offense, and Al Hill led the team in carries. Ev Strupper, arguably {{the best of the}} four, was partially deaf; because of his deafness, he called the signals instead of the team's quarterback. When [...] "Strupe" [...] tried out for the team, he noticed that the quarterback shouted the signals every time he was to carry the ball. Realizing that the loud signals would be a tip-off to the opposition, Strupper told Heisman: [...] "Coach, those loud signals are absolutely unnecessary. You see when sickness in my kid days brought on this deafness my folks gave me the best instructors obtainable to teach me lip-reading." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash.

500|$|Paul Newman's character, Luke, is a {{decorated}} war veteran who is sentenced to serve {{two years in}} a Florida rural prison. He constantly defies the authorities of the facility, becoming a leader among the prisoners, as well as escaping multiple times. While the script was being developed, the leading role was initially considered for Jack Lemmon or Telly Savalas. Newman asked to play the leading role after hearing about the project. In order to develop his character, he traveled to West Virginia, where he recorded local accents and surveyed people's behavior. George Kennedy turned in an Academy Award-winning performance {{as the leader of the}} prisoners, Dragline, who fights Luke, and comes to respect him. During the nomination process, worried about the box office success of Camelot and Bonnie and Clyde, Kennedy invested US$5,000 in trade advertising to promote himself. Kennedy later stated that thanks to the award his salary was [...] "multiplied by ten <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>he)</b> won," [...] also adding [...] "the happiest part was that I didn't have to play only villains anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Acknowledging {{the failure}} of the ongoing Anarky series, Grant has conceeded that its themes, in {{particular}} his interest in exploring esoteric concepts such as philosophy of mind, likely resulted in [...] "plummeting" [...] sales. Breyfogle claimed the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary as his explanation for the series' failure. Breyfogle wrote at the time: [...] "Anarky is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not-quite-so-mainstream. This title may have experienced exactly what every 'half-breed' suffers: rejection by both groups with which it claims identity." [...] Besides the themes, commentators have also found the escalation of Anarky's skills and special heroics as a source of criticism among readers. [...] "I liked the original concept behind Anarky: a teenage geek who reads The Will to Power one too many times and decides to go out and fix the world," [...] wrote a critic for Fanzing, an online newsletter produced by comic book fans and professionals. [...] "But <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>he</b> wound up getting $100 million in a Swiss Bank account, owning a building, impressing Darksied, getting a Boom Tube and was shown as being able to outsmart Batman, outhack Oracle and generally be invincible, I lost all interest I had in the character." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>he</b> lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E

Hence, he argued, [...] "We have to educate a people who cannot at present be educated by means of their mother-tongue. We must teach them some foreign language."

Hall stated that [...] "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. … It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app {{would be in the}} healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant.

To “The Maples" [...] in its more than half-century of life came many authors; among them Emerson, searching the vicinity for the lost grave of his grandfather {{who died in the}} American Revolutionary War.

H. Stoddard’s, his wife’s, Howells'—But to name them all would be to recite a long list of the makers of American literature. Nor of American literature alone.
