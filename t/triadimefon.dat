50|$|Integrated pest {{management}} was designed after Rachael Carson's Silent Spring {{as a way}} to manage for pests without overusing pesticides. Chemicals are still used but in a way that focuses on proper use of pesticide application so overuse does not occur. The fungicide <b>triadimefon</b> is applied to loblolly and slash pine seeds to prevent fusiform rust. If the seeds used are not treated for fusiform rust, the stand can lose 1-30% of their trees to the rust. Longleaf pine is naturally resistant to fusiform rust so their seeds are not treated with <b>triadimefon.</b> Southern pine nurseries fumigate the soil every four years and hardwood nurseries fumigate yearly. Fumigation promotes growth of beneficial fungus Trichoderma and less of the harmful Phythium fungus. In forest integrated {{pest management}}, insecticides are not applied until an infestation is observed. Herbicides are used to control weeds in nurseries. Low rates and frequent application intervals of herbicide is what is recommended.|$|E

Research to control the disease began with Bordeaux mixture experiments around {{the start of the}} 20th century. Copper and sulfur dust were tried as well but their success was very limited. Sulfur was the only one to have much success at all. Rust resistant strains of asparagus were cultivated but by the 1940s and 1950s these strains of asparagus were no longer providing adequate levels of resistance.

40|$|The {{photochemistry}} {{of pesticides}} triadimenol and <b>triadimefon</b> was studied on cellulose and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) in controlled and natural conditions, using diffuse reflectance techniques and chromatographic analysis. The photochemistry of triadimenol occurs from the chlorophenoxyl moiety, while the photodegradation of <b>triadimefon</b> also involves the carbonyl group. The formation of 4 -chlorophenoxyl radical {{is one of}} the major reaction pathways for both pesticides and leads to 4 -chlorophenol. Triadimenol also undergoes photooxidation and dechlorination, leading to <b>triadimefon</b> and dechlorinated triadimenol, respectively.

40|$|Beer is an {{extremely}} popular beverage worldwide, representing the third-most popular drink after water and tea. And barley is the major raw material used for beer production. However, various combinations of pesticides are widely used at several stages of barley cultiÂ¬vation and during post-harvest storage to control pest and fungal disease. Hence, traces of these pesticides might remain in the beer produced from the treated ingredients. Hence, monitoring trace levels of pesticide residues during beer brewing and investigated the effects of pesticide residue {{on the quality of}} beer is essential. First, the behavior and fate of 3 pesticides (<b>triadimefon,</b> malathion, and dichlorvos) and the main metabolites (triadimenol and malaoxon) during barley storage or beer processing were assessed using a pilot-plant equipment. The residues of all products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Field investigation of the dissipation rate kinetics for <b>triadimefon</b> and malathion during storage indicated that their half-life was twice as high when 5 times the recommended dosage was used. Milling had little effect on removing dichlorvos and malathion residues, whereas they were substantially removed when the spent grains were mashed. The calculated processing factors after processing were all < 1, indicating that the residual ratios of dichlorvos and malathion were reduced during the entire process. In conclusion, storage and processing extensively reduced pesticide residue levels in barley and beer; however, greater focus needs to be paid to the toxicity of their metabolites in commercial by-products. Then we selected the <b>triadimefon</b> as the target fungicide to further study its behavior, the dissipation kinetics of TF during fermentation mediated by two different yeast strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae IAPPST 1401 (Y 1) and CICC 1202 (Y 2), and found that Y 2 promoted the degradation of TF. Response surface methodology was used to optimize fermentation process variables, in order to achieve the maximum removal rate of TF and the minimum production of its corresponding metabolite, triadimenol (TN). <b>Triadimefon</b> is also a widely used triazole fungicide with one chiral carbon center, Stereoselective degradation of <b>triadimefon</b> was found during barley storage, the half-life of S-(+) -triadimefon was 36. 5 d, 31. 5 d and 30. 1 d, while R-(-) -traidmefon was 69. 3 d, 53. 3 d and 33 d under 4 Â°C, 25 Â°C and 40 Â°C, respectively.

This research provides accurate information for evaluating the risk of food safety. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of <b>triadimefon</b> affect the quality and flavor of the fermented beer, The effect of <b>triadimefon</b> on yeast growth and the sensory quality of beer were studied. There were significant differences in sensory quality between beer samples fermented with and without <b>triadimefon</b> based on data obtained with an electronic tongue and nose. Such an effect was most likely underlain by changes in yeast fermentation activity, including decreased utilization of maltotriose and most amino acids, reduced production of isobutyl and isoamyl alcohols, and increased ethyl acetate content in the fungicide treated samples. Furthermore, yeast metabolic profiling by phenotype microarray and UPLC/TOF-MS showed that <b>triadimefon</b> caused significant changes in the metabolism of glutathione, phenylalanine and sphingolipids, and in sterol biosynthesis.

The losses in the evaporation and in the desorption step were small, the major losses occurring when the fungicide was collected from the surface. Also, some degradation products of vinclozolin and <b>triadimefon,</b> i. e., 3, 5 -dichloroaniline, triadimenol, and p-chlorophenol, were briefly studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe mitigative {{effects of}} <b>triadimefon</b> (5 Â mg/L) on the germination, early {{seedling}} growth, photosynthetic pigments, non-enzymatic antioxidant contents {{and activities of}} antioxidant enzymes were studied in salt stressed (40 Â mM NaCl) Withania somnifera Dunal plants. Salinity stress decreased the germination percentage, early seedling growth and chlorophyll contents. Similarly it affected severely the antioxidants like ascorbic acid (AA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and Î±-tocopherol (Î±-toc) in all plant parts (root, stem and leaf). Moreover, it caused changes {{in the activities of}} antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and catalase (CAT). <b>Triadimefon</b> partially mitigated the salinity stress by enhancing all studied parameters to a considerable extent...|$|E

40|$|<b>Triadimefon</b> is a {{systemic}} agricultural fungicide of the triazole class whose major metabolite, triadimenol, also a commercial fungicide, provides {{the majority of}} the actual fungicidal activity, i. e., inhibition of steroid demethylation. Both chemicals are chiral: <b>triadimefon</b> has one chiral center with two enantiomers while its enzymatic reduction to triadimenol produces a second chiral center and two diastereomers with two enantiomers each. All six stereoisomers of the two fungicides were separated from each other using a chiral BGB- 172 column on a GC-MS system so as to follow stereospecificity in metabolism by rainbow trout hepatic microsomes. In these microsomes the S-(+) enantiomer of <b>triadimefon</b> was transformed to triadimenol 27 % faster than the R-(-) enantiomer, forming the four triadimenol stereoisomers at rates different from each other. The most fungi-toxic stereoisomer (1 S, 2 R) was produced at the slowest rate; it was detectable after 8 h, but below the level of method quantitation. The triadimenol stereoisomer ratio pattern produced by the trout microsomes was very {{different from that of the}} commercial triadimenol standard, in which the most rat-toxic pair of enantiomers (known as ââDiastereomer Aââ) is about 85 % of the total stereoisomer composition. The trout microsomes produced only about 4 % of ââDiastereomer Aââ. Complementary metabolomic studies with NMR showed that exposure of the separate <b>triadimefon</b> enantiomers and the racemate to rainbow trout for 48 h resulted in different metabolic profiles in the trout liver extracts, i. e., different endogenous metabolite patterns that indicated differences in effects of the two enantiomers...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>triadimefon</b> and uniconazole treatment on leaf senescence was examd. in the excised leaf disks of two mulberry plants namely, Morus cv. kajli and Morus multicaulis. The lower concns. of <b>triadimefon</b> (5 & 10 ppm) and uniconazole (1 and 5 ppm) {{were able to}} retard senescence for a considerable length {{of time in the}} leaf disks floated on test solns. This was accompanied by an increase in the chlorophyll content during the initial stage of the expt. and declined gradually during the later stage. However, at higher concns., though there was {{a significant increase in the}} chlorophyll content during the initial stages, the disks senescenced much early when compared to the control...|$|E
40|$|An isotopic {{exchange}} method is presented {{that characterizes the}} irreversibility of pesticide sorption-desorption by soil observed in batch equilibration experiments. The {{isotopic exchange}} of (12) C- and (14) C-labeled <b>triadimefon</b> [(1 -(4 -chlorophenoxy) - 3, 3 -dimethyl- 1 -(1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 1 -yl) - 2 -butanone] and imidacloprid-guanidine [1 -[(6 -chloro- 3 -pyridinyl) methyl]- 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -amine] in Hanford sandy loam soil indicated that these systems can be described by a two-compartment model in which about 90 % of sorption occurs on reversible, easily desorbable sites, whereas 10 % of the sorbed molecules are irreversibly sorbed on soil and {{do not participate in}} the sorption-desorption equilibrium. This model closely predicted the hysteresis observed in the desorption isotherms from batch equilibration experiments. The isotopic exchange of <b>triadimefon</b> and imidacloprid-guanidine in Drummer silty clay loam soil indicated that there was a fraction of the sorbed (14) C-labeled pesticide that was resistant to desorption, which increased as pesticide concentration decreased and was higher for <b>triadimefon</b> than for imidacloprid-guanidine. In contrast, the batch equilibration method resulted in ill-defined desorption isotherms for the Drummer soil, which made accurate desorption characterization problematic. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Conazoles are a {{class of}} azole based {{fungicides}} used in agriculture and as pharmaceutical products. They have a common mode of antifungal action through inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis. Some members of this class {{have been shown to}} be hepatotoxic and will induce mouse hepatocellular tumors and/or rat thyroid follicular cell tumors. The particular mode of toxic and tumorigenic action for these compounds is not known, however it has been proposed that triadimefon-induced rat thyroid tumors arise through the specific mechanism of increased TSH. The present study was designed to identify commonalities of effects across the different conazoles and to determine unique features of the tissue responses that suggest a toxicity pathway and a mode of action for the observed thyroid response for <b>triadimefon.</b> Male Wistar/Han rats were treated with <b>triadimefon</b> (100, 500, 180...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous enantioseparation {{of three}} chiral {{triazole}} fungicides i. e. penconazole, myclobutanil and <b>triadimefon</b> by cyclodextrin-modified micellar electrokinetic chromatography (CD-MEKC) under acidic condition was investigated with different HP-?-CD concentrations as chiral selector. The three triazole fungicides have an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom respectively, {{and they all}} contain two enantiomers. In order to achieve the best enantioresolution of these triazole fungicides, the HP-?-CD concentration range was optimized from 0 to 40 mM in 10 mM increment. The results indicate that separation of enantiomers was not achieved with concentration range of HP-?-CD from 0 to 20 mM. Simultaneous enantioseparation was successfully achived at 30 mM and 40 mM HP-?-CD concentration in 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3. 0) solution that containing 50 mM SDS, 10 % methanol and 5 % acetonitrile. However, enantioresolution decreased for myclobutanil and <b>triadimefon</b> enantiomers with HP-?-CD concentration greater than 30 mM. In addition, {{an increase in the}} concentration of HP-?-CD caused {{a significant increase in the}} analysis time. In light of these aspects, the optimal concentration for HP-?-CD was decided to be 30 mM for the simultaneous chiral separation of the three triazole fungicides with resolutions (Rs) between enantiomers for penconazole, Rs = 0. 81; myclobutanil, Rs = 1. 14; <b>triadimefon,</b> Rs = 2. 09; peak efficiencies (N) greater than 108 000 for all stereoisomers and analysis time of less than 15 mi...|$|E
