Stanisław Hejmowski, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led to the death of innocent civilians. The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were provoked by foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government for years to come.|$|E

In a two-hour television movie format, Mallory: Circumstantial Evidence aired in February 1976 with Burr again {{in the role of}} <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> outwits the district attorney. Despite good reviews for Burr, the critical reception was poor, and NBC decided against developing it into a series.|$|E
25|$|Some of the United Monroe poll watchers {{claimed that}} Langdon Chapman, an {{attorney}} for the Monroe town board, which they believe is controlled by members deferential to Kiryas Joel and its interests, {{was one of those who}} intimidated them. Coleman told the Record that while he had been at the banquet hall in question, he had only insisted that poll watchers state the reason for their challenges, as legally required, and had left after two hours. He was subsequently appointed county attorney (<b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> represents the county in civil matters) by new county executive Steve Neuhaus, whose margin of victory included all but 20 of the votes from the village.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, after Pamuk made a {{statement}} regarding the Armenian Genocide and mass killings of Kurds, a criminal case was opened against the author based on a complaint filed by ultra-nationalist lawyer Kemal Kerinçsiz. The charges were dropped on 22 January 2006. In Bilecik, his books were burnt in a nationalist rally. Pamuk has subsequently stated his intent was {{to draw attention to}} freedom of speech issues. However, Kemal Kerinçsiz, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> had originally pressed charges against Pamuk, appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal which ordered the court in Şişli to re-open the case. On March 27, 2011, Pamuk was found guilty and ordered to pay 6,000 liras in total compensation to five people for, among others, having insulted their honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} month {{more than fifty}} people, including many members or former members of Jessey's church, were rebaptised by immersion in London. Barebone strongly disagreed with these advocates of believers' baptism, {{and within a few}} weeks he issued A Discourse Tending to Prove the Baptism... to be the Ordinance of Jesus Christ. The claim that Barebone himself was an Anabaptist is likely to derive from post-Restoration critics. A second work, A Reply to the Frivolous and Impertinent Answer of RB, was published in the spring of 1643. In the next few years Barebone was involved in conflicts with those who controlled the vestry of St. Dunstan-in-the-West, and with Francis Kemp, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> acted for them. Barebone later joined the sect known as the Fifth Monarchists, known for their millenarianism.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press {{led to a}} series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; {{it was one of the}} notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published. Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus. Excerpts from some of these banned books, including Tropic of Cancer, Black Spring and Sexus, were first published in the US by New Directions in The Henry Miller Reader in 1959.|$|E

25|$|After they officially {{filed the}} case in Jalisco, the family members {{sent a letter to}} former Mexican President Felipe Calderón (2006–2012). Calderón responded to their request and {{assigned}} the investigation to the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). However, the family stated that the PGR did not follow-up with them for over a month after officially being assigned to the case. The fishermen group had attended a meeting on March 17 in Guadalajara, where they reportedly received death threats from a man named Antonio Vélez. The family members believe that the disappearance of their three members stemmed from conflicts they had with Gasparotto and ejido members from Portezuelos, La Barca, Jalisco in those two meetings. According to their version of the story, former Governor of Jalisco Francisco Javier Ramírez Acuña hosted parties at Hotelito Desconocido and they believe he might be responsible for the mass disappearance. They also said Calderón visited too. The mother of one of the missing members stated that Efraín Aréchiga, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> was in company of the three men in Guadalajara, did not return to La Cruz de Loreto for six months after they went missing. She believes that his six month hiatus was suspicious and that he might be involved in the mass disappearance as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator who found a body at the office of his client and got arrested; as <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> was assigned to the case was useless, Phoenix took up his own defense. One staff member suggested that Phoenix should be a hamster; while this didn't happen, this early version of Phoenix did have a pet hamster. It was decided early during development to refer to the game as [...] "Surviban: Attorney Detective Naruhodo-kun", with [...] "surviban" [...] being a portmanteau of [...] "survival" [...] and the Japanese word [...] Among other names considered were [...] "Boogie-Woogie Innocence" [...] and [...] "Bingo Bengo", with [...] "bingo" [...] referring to answering correctly and [...] being Japanese for legal representation. At one point, Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms. The game was in danger of getting cancelled at one point, as two of the staff members decided to leave the company, but Takumi's division leader and Inaba got a member of the Resident Evil development team to help them part-time.|$|E
500|$|Hayward {{stated that}} the writers turned Todd from a {{realistic}} soap opera character into [...] "the villain appropriated from nineteenth-century melodrama" [...] and Gothic fiction traditions. [...] After Todd is {{sent to prison for}} Marty's rape, he vows he will escape, and does so by drugging himself and forcing himself to wake up from a coma, which allows him to escape from a speeding ambulance. He returns to Llanview to stalk and terrorize Nora, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> threw his court case, who had gone temporarily blind. He tries to rape Marty for the third time, later inadvertently kills Marty's boyfriend Suede during a scuffle, kidnaps the evangelist Rebecca Lewis, and is shot by the police, but survives. [...] The writers also began to deepen his character by emphasizing his tenderness towards Rebecca and showing flashbacks of the abuse he experienced from his adoptive father, which Hayward states does not [...] "historicize the problem but simply removes the cause of violence one step". [...] Laurie Stone of the Village Voice commented that Howarth's performance steered Todd away from cartoon villainy, [...] "heightening the character's wildness as a dodge from sentimentality and high-mindedness". Instead of killing Todd off as other soap operas had done to other unrepentant rapists, OLTL chose, as Stone put it, [...] "to renovate the genre: maintaining Todd as a rapist, while enlarging his human dimension".|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to try to come up with a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E
