5|$|Since {{the summer}} of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmö have been {{connected}} by the Øresund Bridge, which carries rail and road traffic.

5|$|Wells {{is named}} from three wells {{dedicated}} to Saint Andrew, {{one in the}} market place and two within {{the grounds of the}} Bishop's Palace and cathedral. A small Roman settlement surrounded them, which grew in importance and size under the Anglo-Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a minster church there in 704. The community became a trading centre based on cloth making and Wells is notable for its 17th century involvement in both the English Civil War and Monmouth Rebellion. In the 19th century, transport infrastructure improved with stations on three different railway lines. However, since 1964 <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> without a railway link.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury is {{a popular}} tourist destination: {{consistently}} one of the most-visited cities in the United Kingdom, the city's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> occupied since Paleolithic times and served as {{the capital of the}} Celtic Cantiaci and Jute Kingdom of Kent.

5|$|Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad {{remained}} {{under the}} rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the British Raj, and remained so for , with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the winter office of the President of India.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 {{is an example of}} cooperation between the public and private sectors, with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E
5|$|Other {{structures}} {{designed by}} Cutter include the Spokane Club, Washington Water Power Substation, Monroe Street Bridge (featured {{in the city}} seal), Central Steam Plant, and the Davenport Hotel. Built in renaissance and Spanish Revival style, the Davenport Hotel cost two million dollars to complete, and included new technologies {{at the time of}} its opening in September 1914, such as chilled water, elevators, and air cooling. In contemporary times, one of the foremost and influential architects in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> Warren C. Heylman, who helped give the city a great breadth of mid-century architecture. Heylman's career was most prolific during the 1960s and 1970s where his main body of work was done in the modernist style, designing numerous residential houses, apartment buildings, and architectural embellishments.
