5|$|A freeway {{along the}} I-475 {{corridor}} was {{proposed in the}} 1950s. The 1955 Yellow Book, an early proposal for what would become <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highway System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways {{in and around the}} Flint area, including a loop route freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highway System in 1957, I-475 construction was funded by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Barrow {{partnered with}} Harry Stevens in 1894 to sell {{concessions}} at baseball games. He helped George Moreland form <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> League, a Class-C minor league, in 1894. Barrow, with Stevens and Al Buckenberger, purchased the Wheeling Nailers of <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> League in 1896. Barrow served as field manager until {{the collapse of}} the league that season. The team continued in the Iron and Oil League {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of {{the system}} {{continued}} until 1956, when <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highway System was formed. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> system, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Interstate</b> grew quickly, {{along with}} the {{automobile}} industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways of American life and culture. The automobile and <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social standing and level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.|$|E

5|$|The Kansas Turnpike {{was built}} from 1954 to 1956, predating <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highway System. While {{not part of}} the system's early plans, the turnpike was {{eventually}} incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> system in late 1956, and is designated today as four different Interstate Highway routes: I-35, I-335, I-470, and I-70. The turnpike also carries a piece of U.S. Routes 24 and 40 in Kansas City.|$|E
5|$|A roadway {{has existed}} since before 1926, {{connecting}} Toppenish and Prosser near the current alignment of SR22, however the roadway was incomplete, with a gap existing between Satus and Mabton. The {{gap in the}} roadway was completed by 1933, and the segment between Toppenish and Prosser was numbered Secondary State Highway 3A (SSH3A) by 1939, while the segment between the current I-82 and US97 was originally numbered as part of Primary State Highway 8 (PSH8). These designations remained until the 1964 state highway renumbering, when SSH3A and the small segment of PSH8 were renumbered SR22. Before the completion of I-82 through the area, SR22 continued into the town of Buena, however now that <b>the</b> <b>interstate</b> has been completed, SR22 has been truncated to <b>the</b> <b>interstate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> era, M-21 {{extended}} {{across the}} entire Lower Peninsula, from the junction with US31 in Holland near Lake Michigan east to the St. Clair River at Port Huron, and crossed into Canada where the Blue Water Bridge is currently located.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highway System {{was in the}} {{planning}} stages, no paved road had yet entered the San Rafael Swell. The established highway through the area was US-6/US-50 which, like the railroad, entered Utah from Colorado and turned north around the swell.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Commerce Commission {{agreed with}} the city after it filed a {{complaint}} about these practices, but that decision was struck down by a federal court. In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> main east-west <b>Interstate</b> Highway in <b>the</b> {{region is}} <b>Interstate</b> 80, off of which {{branches}} Interstate 380, which connects the Poconos to Scranton. <b>The</b> other <b>Interstate</b> Highways in <b>the</b> region in <b>Interstate</b> 476, <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Turnpike's Northeast Extension, which has interchanges near Lehighton (Mahoning Valley), Albrightsville (Route 903), and White Haven (Pocono), and Interstate 81, {{which serves as}} an alternate route for <b>the</b> much-busier <b>Interstate</b> 95, particularly for travelers from Toronto, Syracuse, and Montreal to Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Other <b>Interstates</b> that serve <b>the</b> region are <b>Interstate</b> 84, which begins in Scranton and goes east to New England, and Interstate 78, by way of Route 33 or Route 309.|$|R

5|$|MSHD {{had plans}} to upgrade the US16 {{corridor}} to freeway standards {{in the middle of}} the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highway System showed a highway in the corridor. The General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US16 corridor. The 1957 approval for <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highway System replaced much of US16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94). MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US16 corridor.|$|E
5|$|SH-9 {{overlaps}} US-59 for , {{after which}} the road becomes concurrent with US-271. Both remain concurrent, until the highway ends at the Arkansas border. After passing the Arkansas state line, State Highway 9 becomes I-540, and US-271 continues over the state line concurrent with <b>the</b> <b>Interstate.</b>|$|E

5|$|South of Willow Run, <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> {{parallels}} {{the north shore}} of Belleville Lake. East of the water body, it intersects I-275 near the northwest corner of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and angles northeasterly through the southwestern Detroit suburbs along the Detroit Industrial Freeway. I-94 uses the Gateway Bridge over the single-point interchange at US24 (Telegraph Road) in Taylor; these bridges were inspired by Super Bowl XL and provide a western entrance to the city. Further east, <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and passes the Uniroyal Giant Tire in Allen Park. I-94 then turns to the northeast through the Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn before turning back easterly on the Edsel Ford Freeway into Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{appropriated}} {{funding for}} <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> Highway System, {{to construct a}} vast network of freeways across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though <b>the</b> <b>Interstate</b> numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the west) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates. Major decommissioning of former routes began with California's highway renumbering in 1964. The 1985 removal of US66 is often seen {{as the end of}} an era of US highways.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of I-280 destroyed {{a large part}} of the historic urban cores of Orange, East Orange, and Newark. <b>The</b> <b>Interstate</b> passed through the historic downtown cores of East Orange and Orange, and many commercial buildings and historic Victorian homes were demolished in the process.|$|E
