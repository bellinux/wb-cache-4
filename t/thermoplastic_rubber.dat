50|$|Natural rubber {{was first}} used as {{material}} for adhesives starting in 1830. In 1839, Charles Goodyear discovered that a rubber and sulfur mixture, when heated, becomes elastic. In 1843, Thomas Hancock named this process vulcanization. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile {{and the need for}} rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of rubber and metal. This spurred the development of cyclized rubber treated in strong acids.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the research and development of adhesives for the shoe industry, this paper aims to analyze the peel strength of an adhesive joint with various types of surface treatments. In the shoe industry, the adhesive properties are very important to ensure the quality of manufacture of the shoe, thus, to better understand the behaviour of the adhesive joint, it is important to analyze the peel resistance in order to adjust the manufacturing process. For the execution of this work, we considered the following materials: natural leather, <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>rubber</b> (TR), polyurethane (PU) and a polyurethane non structural adhesive solvent based. This paper analyzes the influences of the application of chemical and/or physical surface treatments on substrates in the peel strength of a T joint.|$|E
30|$|For the {{elaboration}} of this work, leather {{was selected as the}} material to use in upper. For the sole, <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>rubber</b> (TR) and polyurethane (PU) were selected. The TR soles are synthesized from polymer blocks, based on butadiene and styrene. This polymer is cured under the effect of sulfur which makes the healing process irreversible. However, by heating the link is weakened and elastomers may again be subjected to a change of shape. Such an occurrence is possible because the styrenic monomers are more polar and thus more soluble than butadiene and when styrene is subjected to temperature it becomes liquid. This characteristic brings advantages, as TR can be subjected to recycling processes [3]. Additionally, these soles are characterized as being resistant to water, very flexible and resilient. They are also a cheaper material when compared with other materials that exist on the market. TR soles are usually used for making women shoes of good quality, presenting itself as a material that has a tendency to replace the EVA and PVC.|$|E
30|$|For the {{manufacture}} of footwear {{it is necessary to}} take into account the following operating procedures: modeling, cutting, uppering, assembly, finishing and packaging. For the preparation of this work the most demanding adhesive joint was considered. The joint described in this paper is part of the assembly procedure, which adjusts the upper to the form of the shoe and proceeds to glue it to the sole. The selection of these materials will vary, depending on its mechanical properties, price and intended design, thereby determining the strength, quality and comfort desired for the final product. The upper can be on natural or synthetic leather, woven or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The soles may be of synthetic rubber, natural rubber (NR) or leather. Synthetic rubbers commonly used in {{the manufacture}} of this component for the construction of the shoe are based on polyurethane (PU), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>rubber</b> (TR), styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA), polyamide (PA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) or acrylonitrile butyl styrene (ABS) [2].|$|E

50|$|Thermoplastic {{elastomers}} (TPE), {{sometimes referred}} to as <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>rubbers,</b> are a class of copolymers or a physical mix of polymers (usually a plastic and a rubber) which consist of materials with both thermoplastic and elastomeric properties. While most elastomers are thermosets, thermoplastics are in contrast relatively easy to use in manufacturing, for example, by injection molding. Thermoplastic elastomers show advantages typical of both rubbery materials and plastic materials. The benefit of using thermoplastic elastomers is the ability to stretch to moderate elongations and return to its near original shape creating a longer life and better physical range than other materials. The principal difference between thermoset elastomers and thermoplastic elastomers is the type of cross-linking bond in their structures. In fact, crosslinking is a critical structural factor which imparts high elastic properties.|$|R

Furthermore, polypropylene as a non-oil resistant material and polyamide as an oil resistant thermoplastic compound are investigated. There exist chances according to the industrial development of oil resistant thermoplastic compounds using the combination of polyamide with ACM, HNBR, NBR and EVA and using the combination of polypropylene with HNBR and NBR. By increasing the polarity, cross-linking density of the rubber {{and the content of}} thermoplastics, the oil resistance and fuel resistance of the thermoplastics increase. Furthermore, the hardness and tensile strength increase as a function of content of thermoplastics and cross-linking density. The phase morphology and the degree of cross-linking of rubber also {{have a positive effect on}} oil and fuel resistance.

The molds, made of 5 -mm-thick layers of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>rubber,</b> consisted of different parts. Flexible catheters were positioned between layers. After brachytherapy, the molds were removed. Surgical reconstruction was performed during the same procedure. Results: Dose to the clinical target volume varied from 40 to 50 Gy for the primary treatment (31 patients) and salvage treatment groups (11 patients). There were 18 females and 24 males treated from 1993 until 2007. Twenty-nine tumors were located in the parameningeal region, and 13 were located in the nonparameningeal region. Patient age at the time of AMORE was 1. 2 - 16. 9 years (average, 6. 5 years). Follow-up was 0. 2 - 14. 5 years (average, > 5. 5 years). Eleven patients died, 3 with local recurrence only, 6 with local and distant disease, I died of distant metastases only, and I patient died of a second primary tumor. Overall 5 -year survival rates were 70 % for the primary treatment group and 82 % for the salvage group. Treatment was well tolerated, and acute and late toxicity were mild.

The first part of my thesis represents a contribution to the program of the research group of the Department of Organic Chemistry of the University of Camerino, that has for a long time been studying the cerium chemistry and has dedicated itself particularly to the study of new methodologies involving the use of system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O with NaI. In many trials good results have been achieved and the procedures developed are characterized not only by the efficiency of the reactions, but also by chemoselective processes, by a good stereochemical control, by reacting available and inexpensive reagents and in some cases, from the possibility of recovering the catalytic promoter system used through simple procedures of work-up. One of the objectives of the modern organic synthesis concern the substitution of the chemical processes that use substances dangerous for the environment with eco-friendly methodologies. The system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O-NaI is inexpensive, non-toxic, very stable when exposed to water and air, it is able to work under solvent-free conditions and it can be recycled. This means that it is an excellent catalyst in various reactions, contributing in this way to the development of green chemistry, in response to the problem of environmental pollution caused by the difficulty eliminating of the organic solvents. This also means the development of new strategies for the synthesis of natural substances and unnatural with important biological activities, it represents a field of remarkable interest and in continuing development in organic chemistry.

A liquid phase transition was recorded for both models, with appreciable reduction in the apparent activation energy of flow above this temperature. The quality of the domain structure depends on the continuity of the polystyrene phase and has been measured by the stress at yield and by the optical birefringence.

The first paper by Quintino et al. is related to training and qualification of adhesive bonding personnel at the European level by the European Welding Federation (EWF). The courses are offered, namely European Adhesive Engineer, European Adhesive Specialist and European Adhesive Bonder. These courses are useful for companies to benefit from improved competitiveness in the global market place and from an increased likelihood of trouble-free production and service performance of their products. In the next paper, Paiva et al. study the importance of the surface treatment in the peeling strength of joints for the shoe industry. The authors considered the following materials: natural leather, <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>rubber</b> (TR), polyurethane (PU) and a polyurethane non structural adhesive solvent based. This work allows manufacturers of footwear to minimize the number of operations in the manufacture of shoes, while still being capable of satisfying the minimum requirements for the sector. In the third paper, Zhang et al. analysed the strength of adhesive joints of riser pipes in deep sea environment loadings such as external pressure, internal pressure, tension, torsion, bending loadings. The authors conclude that singular stress fields exist around the end of the interface. The riser pipe under external pressure, internal pressure and tension loading is more prone to break than under bending and torque loading. The last paper by Valoroso and De Barros is related to adhesive joint computations using cohesive zones. Numerical results are presented for a double cantilever beam geometry with varying thickness for which bilinear and exponential cohesive laws are considered. The authors conclude that the size of the process zone is found to be quite sensitive to the specimen characteristic size.|$|E
40|$|Acrylic {{bone cement}} {{is used in}} {{orthopaedic}} surgery for total joint replacements {{as a means of}} fixation of the prosthesis to the bone. One of the main problems associated with total joint replacements is aseptic loosening which can be caused by the brittle fracture of the cement. The purpose of this research was to improve the resistance of bone cement to brittle fracture by creating new experimental cements containing the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>rubber,</b> acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and to determine if improvements could be furthered by using ABS surface coated with a silane coupling agent, the latter having never been investigated before. Incorporating the ABS into the cement will affect the cements' rheological/handling characteristics, therefore these properties were investigated over the entire curing process both at 25 C and 37 C. The results showed that the introduction of either ABS or silane-coated ABS significantly improved the fracture resistance of the cement. The fracture toughness of cements containing 30 % ABS increased by 19 %. and 40 % silane-coated ABS by 31 %. There was also a substantial improvement in fatigue crack propagation behaviour with cements containing 30 % and 40 % ABS or silane-coated ABS showing a minimum three-fold increase in stress intensity at failure. Furthermore, by monitoring changes in the rheological properties over the entire curing process {{it was found that the}} incorporation of silane-coated ABS particles increased the maximum complex viscosity by 35 % and maximum elastic modulus by 33 %. The curing rates of the cements containing 30 % and 40 % ABS/silane-coated ABS remained comparable with commercial cements. These results are of major significance as the enhanced ability of the new acrylic cements to resist catastrophic failure by brittle fracture could dramatically lengthen the working lifetime of a total joint replacement.

Light weight; at 297 gms for a size 8, the Phobic footwear is several grams lighter than its nearest competitor making for greater comfort and a market advantage. Extensive design development was undertaken with the manufacturers in China to minimise weight in all aspects of the design, typically minimising the thickness of the outer sole and the use of a perforated thermoplastic mid sole stiffening unit to provide strength with minimal weight gain. Subsequent bio-mechanical and user testing/evaluation determined that initial prototypes had been effectively designed. Use of hydrophobic materials selected to repel water.
