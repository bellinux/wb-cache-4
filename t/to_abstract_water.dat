Its populations declined drastically in Europe but are now expanding again, including into the Alps. Here, flood prevention and hydropower have massively altered the riverine landscapes. We evaluated the recovery potential of otters by testing the impact of major factors of habitat transformation and human disturbance on multiple spatial scales. In a hierarchical approach, we investigated spatial use and foraging habitat selection of nine otters in a long-term radiotracking study in the eastern Central Alps. We combined fine scale habitat selection analysis with individual movements by applying a step-selection function approach to the linear river system in a novel way. At home range scale, otters preferred the main riverbeds <b>to</b> <b>abstracted</b> <b>water</b> and tributaries, whereas at fine scale, {{there was no significant}} preference for pristine sections within the watercourses. Otters selected for reservoirs in streams with a width smaller than 12 m and otherwise preferred foraging in residual waters and stretches with main discharge. At this stage of recovery, otters show a surprising flexibility in their habitat selection. This is promising for the species' future expansion into former abandoned areas. However, given that the traditional fish stocking regime might contribute to this recovery by providing profitable hunting grounds after stocking events, there is an increased risk of human-wildlife conflicts. Our results demonstrate a high adaptability of a threatened carnivore to altered landscapes and show how this flexible behaviour opens opportunities for recovery...|$|R

However, the cost associated with disposal {{of the waste}} stream has re-ignited interest in destructive rather concentrative technologies. This thesis explores the potential of membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology {{for the removal of}} nitrate from potable water. Two configurations are considered: an MBR to replace ion-exchange completely; and an MBR to treat the ion-exchange waste stream in-situ for re-use. For the replacement MBR, permeate quality can be affected by nitrite accumulation, micro-organism and carbon breakthrough. However, at steady-state and provided substrate addition was controlled, permeate quality was consistently high. Selection of an appropriate substrate was observed to improve permeability by a factor of three. Permeability was sustained within the MBR by adopting a dead-end filtration strategy having identified a relationship between filtered volume, flux and suspended solids concentration. Provided the filtered volume within a single filtration cycle did not exceed a set volume, the accumulated deposit was reversible. For the ion-exchange waste stream MBR, organic carbon breakthrough was considerable. However, the impact upon resin capacity was apparently limited when permeate was re-used for resin regeneration. Salt shocking did not induce permeability decline although some denitrification capacity was lost. Cost evaluation demonstrated that operating ion- exchange in parallel with MBR regenerant treatment was more cost effective than ion exchange with direct disposal...|$|R

In terms of climate, fynbos is comparable with other Mediterranean systems found around the Mediterranean in Europe, {{in parts of}} Chile, south-western Australia and in the Chaparral in California (Aschmann, 1973). The Cape Floristic Region, of which fynbos is part, {{is one of the}} world's most botanically diverse regions, home to an estimated 9030 vascular species (Goldblatt, 1978; Goldblatt and Manning, 2002).

Almost 69 % of its 8920 species of flowering plants are endemic (Goldblatt and Manning, 2002), and, despite its small area, it is {{regarded as one of the}} six global plant kingdoms (Takhtajan, 1986). Ericaceae, Iridaceae, Proteaceae and the Restionaceae are well represented and there are a number of families that are endemic or nearly so (Goldblatt and Manning, 2002).

40|$|Abstract: In {{the latter}} part of the 18 th century some of Britain’s eastern coastal defences, {{although}} strategically well-positioned, were vulnerable because of the lack of a secure water supply. The military engineer Captain Thomas Hyde Page was tasked with identifying any water resources within the confines of the forts and garrisons that might be developed. At Sheerness he supervised the sinking of a deep, large-diameter well through the London Clay, which tapped water in under-lying sands. The idea of a deep well was possibly influenced by the results of deepening a well at nearby Queenborough Castle some 60 years before. At Landguard Fort he constructed an infiltra-tion gallery that skimmed water from the upper surface of a thin freshwater lens. At Harwich he sank two simple shallow wells <b>to</b> <b>abstract</b> <b>water</b> from beneath the London Clay. At each locality he used a different solution appropriate to local hydrogeological conditions. Although some of his ideas were outdated, he recognized that fresh water appeared to be floating on underlying salt water and speculated that this might be the result of differences in specific gravity. His work was important in publicizing the use of groundwater and foreshadowed the major develop-ments of the following century. The ideal situation at any fortified site, such as a castle or garrison, is to have a water supply situated within the confines of the inner defences. This has two advantages: first, the water is close to the build-ings where it is needed, and second, it is secure and can be maintained even if the garrison is under siege. In medieval castles an internal supply usually meant a deep well, and many of the earliest recorded deep wells in Britain are associated with such sites (Ruckley 1990). In the 18 th century three strategically important garrisons, Sheerness on the southern side of the Thames Estuary and Landguard Fort and Harwich to the north (Fig. 1), all suffered from the absence of fresh water on site. In each case drinking water had to be supplied from outside, and such supplies could not be maintained if the garrison was unde...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe once deeply engrained {{idea that}} water {{management}} {{should be considered}} as a technical endeavour that is appropriately confined to hydrological science and hydraulic engineering has now largely ceded to the recognition that water issues also comprise important social and political dimensions that call for the involvement of social science and multiple stakeholders. As such, in recent years, increased {{attention has been paid to}} the nature and effects of water policies, the roles of different water users in decision-making, and the emergence of conflicts and cooperation around water at various scales. These social and political dimensions of water have been subject to significant theoretical advances, drawing especially on insights from the broadly-defined political ecology tradition (including elements of science studies and anthropology), that seek to transcend Cartesian dualisms between humans and the environment in favour of the co-constitution between society and nature. Unlike conventional studies that focus on the relationship between humans and water conceived of as two distinct categories that interact with one another, considering water as socioecological makes it impossible <b>to</b> <b>abstract</b> <b>water</b> from the social context that gives it meaning and from the socio-political processes that shape its material flows and its discursive representations. In line with this perspective, the notion of a hydrosocial, as opposed to a hydrological, cycle has gained traction as a means of both capturing and integrating the socio-political and biophysical processes that constitute water, as well as highlighting the limitations of traditional science and practice. The hydrosocial cycle is purposefully contrasted with the hydrological cycle, which is a dominant and enduring concept for portraying the physical states and flows of water, yet arguably regards water and water processes as asocial and apolitical. However, as the use of the term (alongside and beyond other uses of the term 'hydro-social' or 'hydrosocial') has proliferated, different meanings and usages have become apparent that suggest the need for further scrutiny. The concept of the hydrosocial cycle has hitherto been deployed to capture the deepening entanglement of water flows and power relations, and to shed light on the politicised nature of water management, with a view to reinterpreting the social and ecological implications that emerge as effects of power relations rather than of policy styles (Bakker, 2003 a, 2003 b; Swyngedouw, 2006, 2009). To date, the flows of water and social power embedded within the hydroso-cial cycle have been examined in a range of contexts and from different perspectives, including through the capitalist production of urban environments (Kaika, 2005; Swyngedouw, 2004), the historical construction and mobilisation of the concept of the hydrological cycle (Linton, 2008, 2010), and the production of hydrological assessments that reinforce unequal access to water (Budds, 2008, 2009) (see Linton and Budds, 2014, for a comprehensive review of previous scholarship employing the term 'hydrosocial cycle'). This special issue on the hydrosocial cycle responds to the need to more precisely define and theorise the concept as a means to interrogate and elucidate hydrosocial relations and change, as well as to explore and articulate its analytical and political purchase for critical water research and action. The endeavour commenced through a shared interest among the organisers in the politics of hydrology, and an aspiration to integrate this aspect more fully into the growing and vibrant body of work around political ecolo-gies of water, little of which had hitherto paid much attention to the construction and implementation of hydrological concepts, methods and data. We pursued this interest through a series of panel and paper sessions at the Association of American Geographers annual meetings in 2008 (Water, Science, Humans: Adventures of the Hydrosocial Cycle), 2009 (Water, Science, Humans: Advancing the Hydrosocial Cycle) and 2010 (The Hydrosocial Cycle: Between Hydrology and Critical Social Science), which attracted wide interest and participation from human geographers and cognate scholars. Through our engagement in these sessions, our initial aim to reflect on the nature and place of hydrology in political ecologies of water developed into a much broader endeavour to further understandings of the relationships between water, people and science, with a view to refine the nature of the concept of the hydrosocial cycle and contemplate the ways in which it might support and advance critical political ecologies of water within academic scholarship, that may in turn inform water policy and practice, as well as feed new perspectives into interdisciplin-ary water education. The primary aim of the collection of papers assembled in this special issue is thus to further consolidate the concept as a framework that focuses attention on the materiality of water flows in conjunction with the social and political practices and discourses that shape and are shaped by them. This need is justified by observations that hydrological processes are increasingly influenced by human activities and institutions with specific visions and motives, that hydrological data and knowledge are acknowledged as socially constructed and politically mobilised, that water is increasingly recognised as being characterised by multiple and context-specific cultural meanings, and that the material and symbolic characteristics of water also play an important role in shaping social relations and forms of governance. A core contention of this collection of papers, therefore, is that, while the hydrological cycle remains a widely used framework for understanding biophysical processes, it is lacking for the analysis of water governance, politics and conflict...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} work {{carried out}} {{as part of}} the BGS research project “Nitrate fluctuations in groundwater”. The aim of the project was to determine the mechanism(s) linking within-year fluctuations with groundwater level observed in many time series of nitrate concentrations in groundwater. Four conceptual models were prepared to represent scenarios where chalk recharge is taking place by only one mechanism. These mechanisms were winter piston flow through the unsaturated zone matrix, winter bypass flow {{from the base of the}} soil bringing high nitrate water directly to the water table, water table rise from water entering elsewhere in the catchment flushing out porewater and a change in flow path giving access to a greater percentage of shallow high nitrate water. These were evaluated in a very simplified way to determine whether different relationship between water levels and nitrate concentration arriving at the water table. It was concluded that flushing by a rising water table could potentially result in a delay between the water level rising and the nitrate concentration increasing, but the other mechanisms would be all likely to result in the more or less simultaneous rising of the water level and arrival of nitrate. However the distribution of nitrate in the porewater profile was predicted to be different and this may prove to be a moreuseful indicator. Three case study sites were selected for evaluation; two previous BGS research sites at Ogbourne St George, Wiltshire and at Bircham, Norfolk where there was considerable existing data and Morestead, Twyford, Hampshire which was selected as the research site for the current project. Ogbourne St George was found to be the most informative site, primarily due to the successful deployment of a multi-level sampler which obtained saturated zone samples from small discrete intervals and also to corresponding porewater data. At this site water with a nitrate concentration higher than the porewater was observed in the zone of water table fluctuation during periods of rising water levels. Additionally increases in nitrate concentration were possibly detected ahead of water level rises in a nearby observation borehole. These observations are inconsistent with piston flow through the matrix and correspond better with the fracture flow model or with lateral transfer of water from another part of the aquifer where nitrate concentrations are already higher. In the Bircham area four sites were chosen; Sedgeford, Fring, Osier Carr and Great Bircham. Two of these were looked at in more detail. The boreholes at Sedgeford had a very high response to water level variation, but in dry intervals nitrate peaks had either low amplitude or were lost. At Great Bircham the pattern was different with more subdued water level rises and a more protracted impact from drier periods. This was likely to be due to differences in the physical setting of the Bircham site which was in a shallow valley where the unsaturated zone was much thinner than at Sedgeford. The porewater profiles shape and the detection of higher nitrate water as soon as the water level rose into the zone of fluctuation were consistent with the winter high nitrate peaks being derived from increased permeability in the zone of water table fluctuation allowing a greater contribution of shallow, polluted groundwater <b>to</b> <b>abstracted</b> <b>water.</b> At Twyford where the porewater profile was measured after a long dry period, the distribution of nitrate in the unsaturated zone in the absence of other data did not rule out any of the mechanisms.

A detailed ground-water modelling study was done, to reveal the water pathways and the groundwater-surface water interaction. It was concluded that shutting down wells, nor reducing abstraction rates or reduction of well screen depth would result in significantly less <b>abstracted</b> <b>water</b> from brackish layers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Water</b> mass {{transformation}} in the North Atlantic is examined in an eddy-permitting simulation with the OC-CAM ocean general circulation model, forced by realistic surface fluxes over the period 1985 – 2002. Three Atlantic regions are considered – the subtropics, mid-latitudes, the northeast Atlantic – along with the Labrador Sea. The oceanic boundaries of each region coincide with hydrographic sections occupied in recent years. These regions broadly represent the formation sites of Eighteen Degre...|$|R
