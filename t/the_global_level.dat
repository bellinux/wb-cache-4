5|$|Thorpe's first {{international}} appearance {{in his home}} country, at the 1998 World Championships in Perth, began with the 4×200m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg after Klim and Hackett, Thorpe broke away from 200m butterfly Olympic champion Tom Malchow to set a split time of 1min 47.67s, just 0.26 seconds slower than Klim's winning time in the 200m final. By the end of Thorpe's leg, the Australians were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans, having extended the lead by two body lengths. Although anchorman Kowalski finished outside the world record, {{it was the first}} time that Australia had won the event at <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level</b> since 1956. Thorpe was ranked fourth in the world before the 400m final, which Hackett led from the outset. Hackett established a comfortable 2.29s lead over Thorpe by the 300m mark, and although Thorpe reduced the margin to 1.53s at the 350m mark, Hackett led until Thorpe passed him on the final stroke. Thorpe's time was the fourth fastest in history and made him the youngest ever male individual world champion, aged 15 years and 3 months.|$|E
25|$|The key {{challenge}} of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level.</b> As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match {{the diversity of interests}} and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance. Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> the classic tragedy of the commons, in which common resources become overexploited.|$|E

25|$|Lomborg's main {{argument}} is {{that the vast majority}} of environmental problems—such as pollution, water shortages, deforestation, and species loss, as well as population growth, hunger, and AIDS—are area-specific and highly correlated with poverty. Therefore, challenges to human prosperity are essentially logistical matters, and can be solved largely through economic and social development. Concerning problems that are more pressing at <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> such as the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming, Lomborg argues that these issues are often overstated and that recommended policies are often inappropriate if assessed against alternatives.|$|E

25|$|Animal {{husbandry}} and Integrated Crop Management (ICM) {{often are}} just two branches of one agricultural enterprise. In modern agriculture, animal husbandry and crop production must be understood as interlinked sectors which cannot be looked at in isolation, as the context of agricultural systems leads to tight interdependencies. Uncoupling animal husbandry from arable production (too high stocking rates) is therefore not considered {{in accordance with the}} principles and objectives of Integrated Farming (Lütke Entrup et al., 1998 1). Accordingly, holistic concepts for Integrated Farming or Integrated Farm Management such as the EISA Integrated Farming Framework, and the concept of sustainable agriculture are increasingly developed, promoted and implemented at <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} key {{differences}} in {{management of resources}} in the global commons {{from those of the}} commons, in general. There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level.</b> [...] Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools {{are less likely to be}} relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of unintended consequences that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere and species extinctions last forever. [...] Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> there are significant differences in externalities between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{the paradox}} assumes a closed economy in which savings are not {{invested}} abroad (to fund exports of local production abroad). Thus, while the paradox may hold at <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level,</b> {{it need not}} hold at the local or national level: if one nation increases savings, this can be offset by trading partners consuming a greater amount relative to their own production, i.e., if the saving nation increases exports, and its partners increase imports. This criticism is not very controversial, and is generally accepted by Keynesian economists as well, who {{refer to it as}} [...] "exporting one's way out of a recession". They further note that this frequently occurs in concert with currency devaluation (hence increasing exports and decreasing imports), and cannot work as a solution to a global problem, because the global economy is a closed system – not every nation can increase net exports.|$|E

[...] She explained her position in a New York Times op-ed by alluding to her experience as Israel's justice minister when Hamas participated in Palestinian elections in 2006: [...] "At the time, the counterargument was that the very participation in elections would act as a moderating force on extremist groups. With more accountability, such groups would be tempted to abandon their militant approach {{in favor of a}} purely political platform. But this analysis ignored the possibility that some radical groups sought participation in the democratic process not to forsake their violent agenda but to advance it." [...] Livni advocated that [...] "the international community must adopt at <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>level</b> what true democracies apply at the national one—a universal code for participation in democratic elections. This would include requiring every party running for office to renounce violence, pursue its aims by peaceful means and commit to binding laws and international agreements."

40|$|Studies on <b>the</b> <b>global</b> {{precedence}} effect {{have typically}} {{been concerned with}} the relative timing and interference of <b>the</b> <b>global</b> and local <b>levels</b> of a compound pattern. Navon (1977) purposed that global configurations are processed more quickly than are local components. Kinchla and Wolfe (1979) demonstrated that this global precedence was lost when <b>the</b> <b>global</b> stimuli exceeded 6 - 9 degrees of visual angle. Navon and Norman (1983) noted that Kinchla and Wolfe confounded size and eccentricity. They attempted to unconfound these two variables and concluded that global precedence was found with {{both large and small}} stimuU when eccentricity was not a confound. It is argued that the controversy in <b>the</b> <b>global</b> precedence hypothesis has partially resulted {{from the fact that the}} concepts of <b>the</b> <b>global</b> and local and the attributed relationship between these two vary in different experiments and among workers. In the present study a new approach to global-local relationships was introduced. Global-local relationships were classified into four groups: Inclusion, placeholder, dimensional, and featural relationships. Any of these relationships may or may not be accompanied by a semantic relationship between <b>the</b> <b>global</b> and local <b>levels.</b> <b>The</b> Stroop-type interference of <b>the</b> <b>global</b> and local <b>levels</b> refers to some sort of conventional semantic relationship between the levels. Based on an extensive study of the literature it was suggested that the perception of <b>the</b> <b>global</b> and local <b>levels</b> of a compound pattern is dependent on the type of relationship between two levels. The presented study was limited to test the effect of size and eccentricity of the compound pattern on the processing of <b>the</b> <b>global</b> and local <b>levels</b> with inclusion and placeholder relationships...|$|R
