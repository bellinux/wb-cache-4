Jonah Jameson is {{depicted}} as {{the publisher of the}} Daily Bugle and is Peter Parker's boss and as a harsh critic of Spider-Man, always saying negative <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> superhero in the newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson's publishing editor and confidant Robbie Robertson is always depicted as a supporter of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

25|$|Eight {{years after}} the series ended, there was {{speculation}} and rumors that the series would get a second spin-off or revamp. On August 14, 2015, a reunion with Raven and her former co-stars happened on The View, where they discussed all <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show and past times. Crystal Keymah and Sheridan were not present, but got a special mention from Symoné herself.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fantastical creatures carved of wood is that every piece is removable, it's how you can tell you have a piece carved by one of the original great carvers. The later carvers didn't learn the technique of making each piece fit so well that it could be removed and put back in again and again. Those pieces have more than tripled in value. The painting on these figures is also more intense and varied.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{future of}} the Central Waterfront are clear. The 2001 Nisqually {{earthquake}} revealed that the Alaskan Way Viaduct is unsound and the seawall is in very poor condition. Another earthquake could cause liquefaction of the soils, undermining the viaduct and placing massive pressure on the seawall. While there may be much question as to what will happen, {{there is no doubt}} that things cannot remain as they are. Elsewhere on the waterfront, the deteriorating Piers 62 and 63 also cannot remain as they are.|$|E
25|$|Anime News Network {{reviewed}} the series {{and gave a}} story rating of A-, stating a similar basis of Sword Art Online with improved characters. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the anime for its well-thought out story, relatable main character, and great villain protagonist, but criticizes the anime for its third arc. At the end, {{he says that the}} anime starts out strong, but ends on a weak note. Nifrigel declared great <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> anime in terms of soundtrack, characters, and story, but strongly criticized Reki Kawahara's lack of knowledge in the subject of virtual reality.|$|E
25|$|After {{the victory}} in the 2016 World Championship, the fourth in a row, President Putin {{received}} four players of the national team, Head Coach and Vice-President of the Russian Bandy Federation Sergey Myaus, the Russian Bandy Federation as well as Federation of International Bandy President Boris Skrynnik in The Kremlin. He talked, among other <b>things,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> need to give more support to Russian bandy. It {{was the first time}} a head of state had accepted a meeting to talk about Russian bandy. Attending the meeting were also Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth policy Vitaly Mutko and presidential adviser Igor Levitin. The month after, Igor Levitin held a follow-up meeting.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the Ephemeris {{attributed}} to Dictys of Crete, {{who claims to}} have been present at the Trojan War, was probably written in the 1st century CE or perhaps a little earlier. It falls into a tradition of anti-Homeric literature, based on the supposition that Homer got most <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Trojan War wrong by making virtuous people look like villains, and vice versa. It is important because later historians took Dictys as a historical record, including Sisyphus of Cos, John Malalas, George Cedrenus, John of Antioch, and others. Many Western mediaeval writers also accepted Dictys (in the Latin summary by Lucius Septimius) as the definitive account of the Trojan War.|$|E
500|$|James Robinson, {{the script}} editor for Planet B {{said that one}} of the main {{advantages}} of a series such as this is that it can be set anywhere saying, [...] "One week it's westerns, one week it's full-on sci-fi space operas, and that's one of the nice <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> best sci-fi concepts. I think, you know, the Doctor Who's and the Quantum Leap's, you kind of get a different show each week." ...|$|E
500|$|Halo Warss {{cinematics}} {{and voice}} acting were widely lauded, although one reviewer {{wrote that the}} characters were stereotypical and unlikeable. Dakota Grabowski of PlanetXbox360 considered the Arbiter the most confusing character in the game's story. Conversely, GamePro listed the Arbiter {{as one of the}} five best <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game, saying that while it was a different character than the Arbiter seen in Halo2 and Halo3, he was [...] "like an alien Jack Bauer amped up on drugs".|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{most memorable}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} {{was said to}} be Sert's luxurious Venetian themed sets and Bakst's costumes. Sokolova recalled Kuznetsova's costume as being particularly inspired: ...|$|R

500|$|The combat {{mechanics}} of the game received praise. Daniel Hindes of GameSpot felt that the intensity and variety of the combat in the game has granted the series [...] "a breath of fresh air", and believes that it managed to fulfill his nostalgic expectations from the series. Metros David Jenkins said that the combat in the game is the [...] "real deal", naming {{it one of the}} best recent single-player shooter games, while Ryan Taljonick of GamesRadar called it [...] "satisfying". Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com lauded the game's shooting and stealth mechanics, naming the former as [...] "solid". Similarly, GameSpot's Hindes noted that the stealth was [...] "simple but effective", and named it one of the best <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game. Steve Boxer of The Guardian also called out the stealth, calling it [...] "decent".|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-a-half stars out of five, and wrote that, while the episode [...] "stumbles around a lot", it gives the viewer [...] "the {{impression}} there's nothing else on TV quite like it". The two felt that the idea that Mulder and Scully were friends throughout their various lives was [...] "one of the best <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> story". They also wrote {{that the fact that}} Melissa and Mulder were somehow soul mates also prevented the story from being [...] "obvious and pat". However, Shearman and Pearson felt that Morgan and Wong added [...] "a few too many ingredients" [...] which yielded an uneven episode. Entertainment Weekly, on the other hand, was negative, giving the episode an [...] "F" [...] and describing it as [...] "stultifyingly awful".|$|E
500|$|... "Boys' Club" [...] {{was written}} by Alan Yang and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. McCullers co-wrote two of the Austin Powers films and directed Poehler in the comedy film Baby Mama. The cold open scene, with kids throwing bags of dog feces at Leslie, {{was added to the}} episode after the rest had already been filmed, and was directed personally by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The bags were actually filled with mashed potatoes. Daniels said of the opening, [...] "There {{were a lot of people}} who felt this was not in good taste, but to me, this was one of the most fun <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show." [...] The restriction prohibiting Pawnee employees from accepting gifts over $25 was based on real-life municipal regulations the Parks and Recreation producers encountered during their research. The scenes filmed in the town hall outside courtyard were filmed on a studio sound stage, and the ethics board review scene was filmed inside the city hall building of Pasadena, California.|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{claimed he}} [...] "didn't start {{thinking}} about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well. I learned lots of <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved {{back and forth on}} the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the 2012–13 season, Bridges signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Bury Town on a free transfer. On joining Bury Town, Bridges said — [...] "I'm good friends with Adam Tann and Craig Parker and they couldn't say enough good <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> club. They told me that the players are really well looked after and the club is full of good honest people". He left Bury Town in December 2013 due to the club's {{financial}} problems, and subsequently joined Brackley Town of the National League North in January 2014. Bridges made his debut for Brackley on 11 January 2014, coming on as an 87th-minute substitute in a 31 victory over Gainsborough Trinity. He made 15 appearances during the second half of the 201314 season whilst at Brackley, scoring two goals [...] both of his goals coming within the space of a week at the end of March 2014, in games against Altrincham and Workington respectively.|$|E
500|$|According to Greg Forman from The Post and Courier, {{the album}} shows that [...] "There's an {{important}} difference between {{having a great}} voice and being a great singer. Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey can sing circles (and octaves) around the most famous woman on the planet, but Madonna, through sheer force of personality sells her slow numbers with a panache few modern singers can match." [...] John Wirt from The Advocate said that the album shows that Madonna [...] "can craft slow songs as effectively as she knocks out dance numbers" [...] and found [...] "an unaffected simplicity and sincerity" [...] in her ballad singing. Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J. D. Considine believed that with the album [...] "Madonna not only reminds us that there's more to her music than dance tunes, but also demonstrates that her voice is nowhere near as thin and chirpy as her detractors imagine." [...] He further explained, [...] "one {{of the most amazing}} <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> album is how sultry and assured she sounds... The Madonna on display here not only has a richer, deeper voice than you imagined, but more interpretive insight as well." ...|$|E
5000|$|Orwell biographer D. J. Taylor {{notes that}} [...] "the most {{striking}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> novel is the extravagance of its language: {{a riot of}} rococo imagery that gets dangerously out of hand." ...|$|R
