5|$|The Pompilidae {{specialize}} in catching spiders to provision <b>their</b> <b>nests.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the drop in light level and air temperature, animals change their behavior during totality. For example, birds and squirrels return to <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> and crickets chirp.|$|E
5|$|Clutch size {{depends on}} the {{location}} and the food source, but generally Aerodramus swiftlets lay one or two eggs. The eggs are a dull white, and are laid every other day. Many, if not all, species are colonial nesters; some build <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> in high, dark corners on cave walls.|$|E
40|$|Young workers, {{experimentally}} {{removed from}} <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> {{and set in}} front of it, are {{not very good at}} finding the nest entrance and entering the nest. I examined how young ants learn <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> entrance characteristics, dealing only with the entrance sensu stricto, not with its vicinity. I observed that young ants have the innate behavior of trying to exit and re-enter <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b> I found that they are imprinted with the nest entrance odor while they are still living inside <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> and that they learn the visual aspect of <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> entrances, thanks to operant conditioning, when they exit <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> and succeed in re-entering {{in the course of their}} first short trips outside.

50|$|Cave {{swallows}} {{are most}} often heard singing from March to August in Texas and New Mexico, corresponding more or less to their breeding season. In general, birds are vocal throughout the day when <b>their</b> <b>nesting</b> colony is active, however, they are usually loud and vocal at <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> site, becoming quieter as they move away from <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} a unique nesting habit. They make <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> upon a broken, {{vertical}} branch and produce one egg with unerring aim into <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b> <b>Their</b> dead-leaf like movements make this effective camouflage for predators that would prey upon their offspring.|$|R
5|$|Most Iridomyrmex {{species are}} {{aggressive}} ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> or trails they forage on. This is noticeable with particular member {{species of the}} I. purpureus species group, where they will pour out of their nest and attack and kill all intruders. Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> to bite and spray iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical found in the genus. Because of their large numbers, aggression, and activeness, Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia, and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them. These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Often ingenious {{methods were}} {{developed}} for administering the weapons. The 10th-century Olga of Kiev {{is reported to}} have tied burning tinder to birds which, when released, flew back to <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> in the hostile town and set them alight.|$|E
5|$|Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked {{wading birds}} with long, stout bills. Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an {{important}} mode of communication at the nest. <b>Their</b> <b>nests</b> can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory.|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome Robin {{is a fine}} looker and a fine singer, and {{everybody}} loves him. But {{when it comes to}} housekeeping, he and Mrs. Robin are just plain dirty. They make the foundation of <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> of mud,--plain, common, ordinary mud. They cover this with dead grass, and sometimes there is mighty little of this over the inside walls of mud. I know because I've seen the inside of <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> often. Anybody with any eyes at all can find <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b> More than once I've known them to have <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> washed away in a heavy rain, or have it blown down in a high wind. Nothing like that ever happens to Winsome Bluebird or to me." ...|$|R
50|$|Nests can {{be found}} in {{sheltered}} areas, such as the eaves of a house, the branches of a tree, on the end of an open pipe, or on an old clothesline. Some species, such as Ropalidia romandi, will vary <b>their</b> <b>nest</b> architecture depending on where they build <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|R
50|$|They seldom travel {{more than}} 70 m from <b>their</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|R
5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|Adult solitary wasps {{spend most}} of their time in {{preparing}} <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse than those of social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees or against walls.|$|E
5|$|All Portia species eat eggs {{of other}} spiders, {{including}} eggs {{of their own}} species and of other cursorial spiders, and can extract eggs from cases ranging from the flimsy ones of Pholcus to the tough papery ones of Philoponella. While only P. fimbriata (in Queensland) captures cursorial spiders in <b>their</b> <b>nests,</b> all Portia species steal eggs from empty nests of cursorial spiders.|$|E

5|$|Another {{attraction}} is the Gomantong Caves, which {{is home to}} hundreds of thousands of swifts who build <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> high on cave walls and roofs. Other than swifts, the caves are also inhabited by millions of bats. Furthermore, the Sandakan Orchid House has a collection of rare orchids. Along the Labuk Road from Sandakan, there is a crocodile farm which houses about 1,000 crocodiles of various sizes.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} {{by a number of}} mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> are at the water's edge, common loon eggs are especially vulnerable if the adult is absent.|$|E
5|$|Macroolithus is an oogenus (fossil-egg genus) of dinosaur egg {{belonging}} to the oofamily Elongatoolithidae. The type oospecies, M. rugustus, was originally described under the now-defunct oogenus name Oolithes. Three other oospecies are known: M. yaotunensis, M. mutabilis, and M. lashuyuanensis. They are relatively large, elongated eggs with a two-layered eggshell. <b>Their</b> <b>nests</b> consist of large, concentric rings of paired eggs. There is evidence of blue-green pigmentation in its shell, which may have helped camouflage the nests.|$|E

5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birdlice are {{present on the}} birds and in <b>their</b> <b>nests,</b> and mites of the genus Knemidocoptes {{have been known to}} infest populations, {{resulting}} in lesions on the legs and toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow-fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality. Egg size does not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from large eggs grow faster.|$|E
5|$|Megachilid bees of {{the genus}} Anthidium use the hair (amongst that of various woolly plants) in making <b>their</b> <b>nests.</b> The seeds are {{generally}} too small for birds to feed on, although the American goldfinch {{has been reported to}} consume them. Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves (Hawaiian goose) or flowers (palila), or to use the plant as a source when foraging for insects (white-headed woodpecker).|$|E

5|$|Swans {{were kept}} by the Bishops of Lichfield on Bishops Fish Pool from the early 14th century. Special pens and nesting areas were constructed. Ownership of the birds passed to the Lichfield Corporation from 1548. In 1704 the lease owner of 'Swan Moggs' was {{required}} to allow the swans make <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> there. In this area today we get the street names Swan Road and Swan Mews reflecting {{the history of the}} land use.|$|E
5|$|The {{great spotted cuckoo}} (Clamator glandarius) {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in <b>their</b> <b>nests</b> in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and least weasel (Mustela nivalis) in England, and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Finland. The European pine marten (Martes martes) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests {{are part of a}} colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the boreal owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of <b>their</b> <b>nests,</b> occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
