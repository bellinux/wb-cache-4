500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV {{all the time and}} I guess I pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{represented}} {{the new school}} of thought, modernism, which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In Orthodoxy he writes: [...] "The worship of will is the negation of will … If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will {{is that it is}} particular." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, McCain said {{he would}} {{consider}} changing the U.S. military's don't ask, don't tell policy: [...] "The day that {{the leadership of the}} military comes <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it." [...] In December 2007, McCain said he supported the policy, citing reports from military leaders that [...] "this policy ought to be continued because it's working." [...] In January 2010, when Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen – the top civilian and uniform leadership of the military – came out in favor of repealing the policy, McCain said he was [...] "disappointed" [...] by their stance: [...] "At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services, we should not be seeking to overturn the Don't ask, don't tell policy," [...] which he described as [...] "imperfect but effective." [...] McCain also criticized Gates for what he saw as an attempt to usurp Congressional authority over the policy. In December 2010, McCain voted against repealing the policy.|$|E

2500|$|Meier founded MicroProse with Stealey in 1982, and by 1986 {{the company}} was using his name and face in {{advertisements}} for its games. MicroProse at first developed mostly simulation video games, such as Silent Service and F-19 Stealth Fighter. In 1987, the company released Sid Meier's Pirates!, which also began a trend of placing Meier's name in the titles of his games. He later explained that the inclusion of his name {{was because of the}} dramatic departure in the design of Pirates! compared to the company's earlier titles. Stealey decided that it would improve the company's branding, believing that it would make those who purchased the flight simulators more likely to play the game. Stealey recalled: [...] "We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> 'Bill, you should put Sid's name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.' And that's how Sid's name got on Pirates, and Civilization." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Kiefer Sutherland {{took the}} project, {{he did not}} {{understand}} that the series was set in real-time, having skipped the line that said, [...] "All events take place in real time." [...] Kiefer said it was, in fact, the interaction between the characters that prompted him to take the pilot. Sutherland was sent the script by director Stephen Hopkins, with whom he had a previous relationship. Sutherland was attracted to the shades of grey in the Jack Bauer character, as well as his status as a [...] "normal guy", citing Jack's inability to handle his own teenage daughter. The Tony Almeida character was originally called [...] "Geller" [...] in the original Pilot script, who Bernard called a [...] "backbiting Jewish techie guy". Bernard didn't understand why they had sent him the script, given his Hispanic ethnicity. Carlos and the crew came up with the Tony Almeida name fifteen minutes before shooting, but the legal department wouldn't let them use it. Legal told the crew that they could use the name 'Tonio', which Carlos found underwhelming. Bernard said, [...] "So we were filming the very first scene, Kiefer walking down CTU, and he turns <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Sorry man, I can't call you Tonio, I'm just gonna call you Tony.' I owe Kiefer everything: Tonio's the name of a guy who gets killed in the first episode." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mind {{and send}} me {{a large piece of}} cake," [...] I go up and whisper archly to old Mr. Ward: and we look on rather sentimentally at the couple, almost the last in the rooms (there, I declare, go the musicians, and the clock is at five)--when Grundsell, with an air effare, rushes up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "For e'v'n sake, sir, go into the supper-room: there's that Hirish gent a-pitchin' into Mr. P." ...|$|E

So we part in a huff; and next time we meet, which was to-night, he walks straight up <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Go to the Devil!'

[...] "Come off it," [...] I says {{to the best of}} my recollection. [...] "You struck this woman in my presence," [...] I says, [...] "and you come along!" [...] We were then at close quarters.

6000|$|The {{worship of}} will is the {{negation}} of will. To admire mere {{choice is to}} refuse to choose. If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Will something," [...] that is tantamount to saying, [...] "I do not mind what you will," [...] and that is tantamount to saying, [...] "I have no will in the matter." [...] You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will {{is that it is}} particular. A brilliant anarchist like Mr. John Davidson feels an irritation against ordinary morality, and therefore he invokes will--will to anything. He only wants humanity to want something. But humanity does want something. It wants ordinary morality. He rebels against the law and tells us to will something or anything. But we have willed something. We have willed the law against which he rebels.|$|E
6000|$|But, when we halted for the night, I {{found that}} Miss Maryon {{had spoken to}} Captain Carton {{concerning}} me.

Nobody shall supersede you in the distinction and pleasure of protecting that young lady." [...] I thanked his honour in the fittest words I could find, and that night I was placed on my old post of watching {{the place where she}} slept. More than once in the night, I saw Captain Carton come out into the air, and stroll about there, to see that all was well. I have now this other singular confession to make, that I saw him with a heavy heart. Yes; I saw him with a heavy, heavy heart.|$|E

I did not much like it, your honour, for I was among strangers, and so were you, you know. Well, then, I went to Master Rodolph: he was very kind to me, and seeing me in low spirits, and thinking me, I suppose, in love, or in debt, or that I had done some piece of mischief, or had something or other preying on my mind, he comes <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Essper,' said he; you remember Master Rodolph's voice, sir?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} of Harry has previously proved to outrage some viewers. Moore revealed {{that people had}} been angry {{at some of the}} stuff Harry had done.
