50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{solution}} {{to the issue of}} overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming depleted. Less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries, such as renewable energy and recycling technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden. A fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: anti-consumerism, freeganism, green economics, ecological economics, degrowth, frugality, downshifting, simple living, minimalism, and <b>thrifting.</b>|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Over {{the past}} decade, the {{explosion}} of social media has secured the Internet as a venue for political discussions of all sorts; {{as well as a}} realm of consumption and commodification. One population of women that has utilized social media in this way is the plus-sized fashion ("fatshion") community on the popular multimedia blogging site Tumblr. Through posting personal photos of 'outfits of the day' (OOTDs), participants use Tumblr to address the lack of size representation in the fashion industry as well as to share resources for finding fashionable, plus-sized clothing. This project examines how contributors to fatshion blogs negotiate identities as well as how participation in these blogs both supports and defies a neoliberal economic system that casts participating in fashion as a right, without considering how it contributes to oppression of other groups of women. The project discusses blogs as spaces for combatting the effects of sizeism, for negotiating racist images of women of color in the media, and, to a certain extent, for situating fatness within hegemonic femininity, and it also investigates {{the extent to which these}} blogs register or ignore the oppressive effects of the fashion industry in the global South. Some bloggers express an interest in repurposing and <b>thrifting</b> clothing, but their motivations are less explicit. The blogs provide clear answers to some of these questions and initiate only more questions about others, but regardless, the photos and commentary submitted to the blogs provide ample material for discussion. By attempting to answer these questions, it is possible to obtain a clearer picture of the relationship between systems of oppression and online environments, and how online communities might be used to challenge these systems...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{introduces}} a simple method to test between two general approaches to defining bank and <b>thrift</b> product markets. I estimate two models that endogenize market structure using data on banks and <b>thrifts</b> from 1, 884 rural markets {{for the year}} 2000. The first model assumes that banks and <b>thrifts</b> are in “independent product markets, ” i. e., that bank profitability depends only on competition from other banks and that <b>thrift</b> profitability depends only on competition from other <b>thrifts.</b> An alternative model is then estimated assuming that banks and <b>thrifts</b> are “perfect strategic substitutes, ” i. e., that a bank’s equilibrium profitability falls equally {{with the presence of}} another bank or an additional <b>thrift</b> (and vice-versa). A transformation of the likelihood for the “independent markets ” model allows me to test it against the “perfect strategic substitutes ” model using Vuong’s (1989) non-nested likelihood ratio test. The hypothesis that banks and <b>thrifts</b> compete in independent product markets is soundly rejected against the hypothesis that banks and <b>thrifts</b> are perfect strategic substitutes...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} quarterly return series from March 1984 through December 1989 for 10 {{classes of}} <b>thrift</b> assets using the statistical cost-accounting methodology of Hester and Zoellner (1966). We then use these return series to estimate mean-variance efficient frontiers for all <b>thrifts,</b> for <b>thrifts</b> that were well capitalized {{two years earlier}} and for <b>thrifts</b> that were insolvent two years earlier. Our results show that neither the asset restrictions existing before nor those in effect after passage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 would have prevented <b>thrifts</b> from reaching most of the portfolios along the efficient frontier. The actual portfolio chosen by well-capitalized <b>thrifts</b> {{is close to the}} estimated efficient frontier, while the actual portfolio chosen by insolvent <b>thrifts</b> is located far from the frontier in the high-risk end of investment space. These findings, coupled with the high proportion of nontraditional assets in the actual portfolio chosen by insolvent <b>thrifts,</b> support the hypothesis that moral hazard induced <b>thrifts</b> to take on investments that were excessively risky from the deposit insurer's point of view.

From the middle 1970 s {{to the early}} 1990 s, undercapitalized mutual <b>thrifts</b> used conversions to raise capital. Since then, however, converting <b>thrifts</b> typically already had considerable capital and economic value, which was transferred from mutuals’ members to insiders and outside investors. Long-ignored proposals addressed the capital and conversion problems of mutual <b>thrifts,</b> {{as well as of}} credit unions. In 1977, the US Government Accounting Office proposed that, in lieu of converting, mutual <b>thrifts</b> be allowed to count some bonds as capital.
