5|$|Local Action, a loose {{alliance}} of protesters on site, described the pier as {{a cornerstone of}} Hong Kong identity. By linking the pier with earlier social movements in late 1960s and early 1970s, it argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> {{was a symbol of}} Hong Kong civic activism and therefore should not be demolished.|$|E
5|$|Catherine was the {{daughter}} of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, {{one of the most powerful}} figures amongst Bosnian nobility, Grand Duke of Bosnia and the ruler of Zachlumia and Travunia. His domain later came to be known as Herzegovina, after the German title of herzog he adopted in relation to the Duchy of St. Sava. Catherine's mother was Jelena, daughter of Zeta's lord Balša III and the first of Stjepan's three wives. Catherine was the couple's first child but the precise date of her birth is not known; both 1424 and late August 1425 have been suggested by her biographers. It can be surmised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of her birth was either the Sokol Fortress, an old seat of the House of Kosača, or the feudal town of Blagaj, Stjepan's favourite residence.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by showing up at her door, {{and told him that}} she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.|$|E

5|$|The {{second of}} these {{theories}} is the genocide hypothesis, which {{asserts that the}} aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength of this argument is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin {{throughout much of the}} region. Its weakness is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial. Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E
25|$|The city {{emerged from}} a Neolithic {{settlement}} of the 3rd to 2nd millennium BCE, when pottery, fishing, agriculture, and hunting developed. Excavations have revealed several layers, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was attacked by neighbouring tribes and suffered from natural disasters. Ancient sanctuaries were found nearby, where idols of a pregnant woman, a fertility goddess, were prevalent.|$|E
25|$|A tomb {{containing}} King Taksin's {{clothes and}} a family shrine were found at Chenghai district in Guangdong province in China in 1921. It is believed that a descendant of King Taksin the Great must have sent his clothes to be buried there to conform to Chinese practice. This supports the claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was his father's hometown.|$|E

25|$|When Sorghaghtani {{asked for}} part of Hebei {{province}} as her appanage in 1236 {{after the end of}} the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty, Ögedei hesitated, but not for long. She shunned him into compliance by pointing out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was hers by right anyway, because her husband had conquered it. However, Ögedei also expanded his personal appanage, seizing some territories of Tolui and took most of Sorghaghtani's soldiers.|$|E
25|$|This stone, {{signed by}} the runemaster Öpir, is found at Sjusta near Skokloster. It is in style Pr4 and it is raised by a lady named Rúna in memory of her four sons who had died. She had it made {{together}} with her daughter-in-law Sigríðr who was the widow of Spjallboði. They added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where Spjallboði had died was i olafs kriki, and several scholars have discussed the meaning of these runes.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} by some that Hendon Wood Lane was {{originally}} a minor Roman road. Certainly the name, 'Grendel's Gate' (now Barnet Gate, and formally known as 'Grims Gate'), {{is associated with}} the monster from the Saxon epic, Beowulf. This implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was of modest importance as early as 1005. It may have been a centre of a small but significant community, founded on a woodland economy.|$|E

25|$|This runestone {{refers to}} a man who was in a place called karþum. One view holds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> name is Garðar, i.e. Garðaríki (Russia), and another view is that the name refers to Garda Parish not far from the stone. Omeljan Pritsak holds the first view to be the correct one, since having been to a {{neighbouring}} parish hardly merits a mention on a runestone. It is probably from {{the first half of the}} 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Albert {{explains}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> {{they occupy}} is called Summerland. Being {{a state of}} mind rather than a physical location, Summerland is practically endless and takes the form of the inhabitants' wishes and desires. There is no pain or death, but people maintain occupations of sorts and perform leisure activities. The book depicts Summerland at length, through Chris's eyes. Chris feels somehow uneasy, haunted by nightmares ending in Ann's death. Soon he learns that Ann has killed herself.|$|E
25|$|Menéndez had {{headed the}} attack on the {{south-west}} breach, and after repulsing its defenders, he came upon Laudonnière, who was running to their assistance. Jean Francois, the renegade Frenchman, pointed him out to the Spaniards, and their pikemen drove him back into the court. Seeing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was lost, and unable to stand up alone against his aggressors, Laudonnière turned to escape through his house. The Spaniards pursued him, but he escaped by the western breach.|$|E

25|$|The {{founding}} of Campina Grande is credited to Captain Teodósio de Oliveira Ledo {{who led a}} group of Ariús Indians to settle the land and begin farming on December 1, 1697. However, some historians {{do not agree with}} this version and suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was already a settlement and named Campina Grande when Teodósio arrived with the Ariús. This position is certainly supported by the fact that Campina Grande is in a critical geographic location for people travelling between the highlands and the coast.|$|E
25|$|After the {{successful}} defence of Puketutu (Te Mawhe) Pā {{on the shores}} of Lake Omapere, in accordance with Māori custom, the pā was abandoned as blood had been spilt there, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> became tapu. Hōne Heke returned to the pā he had built at Te Ahuahu. Tāmati Wāka Nene built a pā at Okaihau {{in the days that followed}} that battle at Puketutu (Te Mawhe) Pā, the warriors of Heke Tāmati Wāka Nene fought several minor skirmishes with the warriors of Heke and Kawiti.|$|E
25|$|As {{they attempt}} to secure the fortress, the Ghosts make {{numerous}} discoveries. There is no water source on site, the maps {{that they have been}} given of Hinzerhaus are inconsistent and incorrect, and strange echoes fill the halls. Many of the men become convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> is haunted. These findings only cause more issues when the Blood Pact attempt to storm Hinzerhaus, and the Ghosts are forced to mount a defence against a superior foe. At the same time, strange apparitions begin to eat away at the courage and morale of the men...|$|E

25|$|Ashby {{returns with}} the {{captured}} Ramerrez gang member, Castro. Upon seeing his leader, Johnson, in the saloon, Castro agrees to lead Rance, Ashby and the miners {{in a search}} for Ramerrez, and the group then follows him on a false trail and in what {{turns out to be a}} wild goose chase. But before Castro leaves, he whispers to Johnson that somebody will whistle and Johnson must reply to confirm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> is clear. A whistle is heard, but Johnson fails to reply.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 the Vartiokylä dumping ground was closed, but not because of its {{environmental}} impact. The official story was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was full and could not accommodate further waste materials. Since it had originally been a hole from which gravel had been taken, it did not stick out from the surrounding areas, such as the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Vuosaari dumping ground did and still do. (These two dumping grounds now replaced the Vartiokylä dumping ground.) Thus, when {{the construction of the}} Myllypuro neighbourhood was begun, the new residents most likely were oblivious {{to the fact that there}} had once been such a site there.|$|E
25|$|Around 1500–1000 BC {{the complex}} {{fell out of}} use and was despoiled by the later Bronze Age farmers. Fragments of pots {{appear to have been}} cast out of the chamber. This may have been just {{ordinary}} agriculture, but it may conceivably have been ritual cleansing. There {{appears to have been a}} later rebuilding of the tomb, but this may have been for domestic use as there is no evidence for any later ritual use of the monument. Between 1000 BC and 500BC the stones were covered by a thick layer of turf. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was abandoned around 800BC. Only in 1857 was the overlying 1.5metres of peat removed.|$|E
