500|$|While Dykstra's team {{handled the}} ships, the V'Ger cloud was {{developed}} by Trumbull. Trumbull wanted the cloud to have a specific shape to it—"it couldn't just be a blob of cotton," [...] he said, [...] "it had to have some shape <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> camera angles on." [...] A special camera support track was built that could pan and focus over a [...] piece of art, with the light strobed to provide depth. While the team planned on compositing multiple passes to provide physical movement to the cloud shots, Trumbull felt that it detracted from the sense of scale, and so small animations were subtly introduced in the final product. The torpedo effects were simulated by shooting a laser through a piece of crystal mounted on a rotating rod after experiments with Tesla coils proved insufficient. The same effect was recolored and used for the Klingons and the Enterprise; the aliens' torpedoes glowed red while the [...] "good guys" [...] had blue-colored weaponry. V'Ger's destruction of the ships was created using scanning lasers, with the multiple laser passes composited onto the moving model to create the final effect.|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Carey Meyer {{built the}} ship Serenity {{in two parts}} (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed {{as part of the}} set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: [...] "...you could pull it away or move something huge, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made." [...] There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer, and that there were not [...] "fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back". He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was [...] "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home". As Joss Whedon discusses in the DVD commentary, each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that as you move {{from the back of the}} ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the tail of the ship.|$|E
2500|$|She maintains, however, {{that she}} still refuses to sing [...] "Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)" [...] because she dislikes the monotony of the {{repeated}} chorus. [...] "They {{used to have a}} contest on the radio <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> two free tickets to Helen Reddy’s show if you could tell us how many times she sang 'leave me alone.'

2500|$|A Cavalier {{that won}} a Best-in-Show was {{revealed}} by Carter {{to have the}} condition. (One {{and a half months}} after the programme aired, Carter was removed from the Cavalier Club Committee for this [...] "breach of confidentiality".) Despite veterinarian advice not to breed from the dog, the dog went on to sire 26 litters, adding to the 8 litters sired before the diagnosis. Dr. Claire Rusbridge expressed her incredulity: [...] "If you took a stick and you beat a dog to create this pain <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> from Syringomyelia, you'd be prosecuted, but there's nothing to stop you from breeding a dog that can be painful." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{a curious}} thing that I remarked long ago and have often turned in my head that the old word for ‘holy’ in the German language—heilig—also means ‘healthy.’ And so Heilbronn means ‘holy well’ or ‘healthy well.’ We have in the Scotch ‘hale,’ and I suppose our English word ‘whole’—with a ‘w’—all of one piece without any hole in it—is the same word.

5000|$|Despite its low spectator {{capacity}} Apollo Stadium {{was known}} as one of the loudest venues in the NBL during its use from 1979 until 1991. With a capacity crowd of 3,000 sitting very close to the action it was an intimidating task for opposition teams with 36ers players often referring to Apollo as the teams [...] "6th Man". Award winning Adelaide based basketball journalist Boti Nagy, who also often doubled as a sideline television commentator during 36ers games, often described the seating at Apollo as being so close to the action <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> literally <b>get</b> hit with sweat from the players as they ran past.|$|R

6000|$|... "Rather a {{different}} scene {{from what it}} was that day," [...] the mate, whose name was Hoare, said. [...] "I thought it was all up with us, and even when we saw you coming we hardly believed <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> near enough to take us off; and now it is as smooth as glass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{came here}} on business," [...] said Stamford, sitting {{down on a}} high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my {{direction}} with his foot.

5000|$|When {{asked in}} a 2010 {{interview}} with Under the Radar {{as to why the}} single was released and deleted on the same day, Jez Williams stated, [...] "It was to do something different from the norm. Just wanted to try something different really. I can't remember exactly whose idea it was. It might have been the manager's, but we were kind of into it. A kind of statement, in a way. We liked the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> a hold of a certain amount of this or a certain amount of that.

5000|$|The two {{headed back}} up the gulch with Dodge noting <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> closer to within 100 feet of the fire due to the heat. The crew met Dodge and Harrison about half way to the fire. Dodge {{instructed}} the team to move off {{the front of the}} fire, and instead move down the gulch and cross over to the thinly-forested and grass-covered north slope of the gulch; [...] "sidehilling" [...] (keeping the same contour or elevation) and moving [...] "down gulch" [...] towards the Missouri River. They could then fight the fire from the flank and steer it to a low-fuel area. Dodge returned with Harrison to the supply area {{at the top of the}} gulch. The two stopped there to eat. From the high vantage point, Dodge noticed the smoke along the fire front boiling up indicating an intensification of the heat of the fire. He and Harrison headed down the gulch to catch up with the crew.|$|R
60|$|But {{it is not}} {{necessary}} to enlarge on his abilities. The figures against his name in Wisden prove a good deal. The fact that he had steered Kay's through into the last round of the house-matches proves still more. It was perfectly obvious to everyone <b>that,</b> if only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Fenn out for under ten, Kay's total for that innings would be nearer twenty than forty. They were an appalling side. But then no house bowler had as yet succeeded in getting Fenn out for under ten. In the six innings he had played in the competition up to date, he had made four centuries, an eighty, and a seventy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, when we don't know {{a word of}} the language," [...] added Mr. George, [...] "we cannot {{have any}} {{communication}} {{with the people of}} the country, but shall be confined entirely to each other.

6000|$|... "Yes, I want to {{take her}} place, Roberts. I should {{think that if you}} or Andrew were to tell her that you have a friend up from the country who wants just such a place, and is ready to pay five pounds to get one, she might be ready to take the offer; {{especially}} as you might say that you knew of a lady who is in want of an under-housemaid and you thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> her the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want any}} promise about it," [...] the poacher replied. [...] "I {{have made up}} my mind to leave Weymouth, for, after having been in jail two years, I shall always have the constables as well as the revenue men keeping their eye on me, so I had {{intended}} all along to take to the lugger again, and live on board her as I did before, and I only stayed here until I could settle accounts with Faulkner. I have no doubt that they will suspect me of this business. There are plenty of men who know that I had sworn to be even with him, and my disappearance is sure to be put down to that. Now, in the next place, will you promise not to try to escape, because if you do, I will get them to take these ropes off you? I dare say you have been thinking <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> free <b>you</b> would make a run for the mouth of the cave and dive in, for it is about high water now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, sir, you are {{lighter and}} more active than I am, and I was {{thinking}} <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{up to the}} top of this tree you would have a view down over the village. The leaves are pretty thick, and as the niggers are busy there is not much chance of their looking about for a man up a tree. You see the village ain’t above a hundred and fifty yards away, and the ground ain’t more than twenty feet above the river. I should say that this tree was seventy or eighty feet high, so that from the top you can get a view pretty well over the place; if there is one of our chaps there he may be lying tied up somewhere. Of course he might be in a hut, but it is much more likely that they would have just chucked him down until they wanted him. I think if you got on my shoulder you would be able to get hold of that lowest branch where it bends down, and climb along it to the trunk; after that the branches come pretty thick together.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my lad," [...] the squire said, [...] "you must {{acknowledge}} that the case looks very ugly against you. You {{are known to have}} borne bad feelings against the dog; naturally enough, I admit. A boy about your size was seen by Robert in the dark, coming out of the gate; and that he was there for no good purpose is proved {{by the fact that he}} ran away when spoken to. A quarter of an hour later, the dog dies of poison. <b>That</b> poison <b>you</b> certainly <b>could</b> <b>get</b> at home and, by your own admission, you were out and about at the time the dog was poisoned. The case looks very bad against you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should think," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, {{addressing}} me, [...] "that if {{you could}} manage to climb up to them second-story windows, you might find one of them <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> in, and then come down and {{open the door for}} us. Everybody is likely to forget to fasten some of the windows on the upper floors. I know it isn't right to force our way into other people's houses, but there's nothin' else to be done, and there's no need of our talkin' about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Ishmael," [...] {{answered}} Rachel calmly, [...] "you {{are making}} a very great mistake, about my scruples as to taking life I mean, amongst other things. Once when it was necessary you saw me kill a man. Well, if I am forced to it, what I did then I will do again, only not with my own hand. Mr. Ishmael, you said just now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> me out of Zululand. I take you at your word, not for my own sake, for I am comfortable enough here, but for that of my father and mother, who will be anxious," [...] and her voice weakened a little as she spoke of them.|$|E
6000|$|Arrived at Three Mile Cross, {{it was no}} {{surprise}} to find it no longer recognizable as the hamlet described in Our Village, but it was saddening to look at the cottage in which Mary Russell Mitford lived and was on the whole very happy with her flowers and work for thirty years of her life, in its present degraded state. It has a sign now and calls itself the [...] "Mitford Arms" [...] and a [...] "Temperance Hotel," [...] and we were told <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> tea and bread and butter there but nothing else. The cottage has been much altered since Miss Mitford's time, and the open space once occupied by the beloved garden is now filled with buildings, including a corrugated-iron dissenting chapel.|$|E
5000|$|Cleveland Watkiss has {{recalled}} {{his introduction to}} the jazz course initiated by Grigson: [...] "He {{was the head of}} this academy at the Guildhall... and they were recruiting and looking for kids to join. At <b>that</b> time <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> grants and stuff like that. Anyway I went for the audition and I remember Lionel Grigson saying to me after I did the audition, 'We need people like <b>you</b> here!' <b>That</b> was my introduction to the Guildhall. He said that to me, 'We need people like you in here!' I was like, 'Okay.' So anyway, I’m in the Guildhall - Alan Weeks is in the Guildhall, Michael Martin’s is in the Guildhall, Winston Clifford’s in the Guildhall, Jason Rebello’s in the Guildhall, Paul Hunt… The whole army of young musicians starting to come to the Guildhall. Lionel Grigson just created a space and said, 'Brothers, come on! We need you in here!' So Monday morning you’d go to the Guildhall and you’d stand in the foyer - blacker than black! I don’t think the Guildhall has ever been so ‘blacked’ out before or since. We’re talking mid-eighties.… Everyone came to the Guildhall, because we were all there, it was like a meeting place." ...|$|R
2500|$|However, in 1981, Faulkner {{discovered}} {{a book about}} neuro-linguistic programming called The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. The book's methodology described ways of affecting immediate and positive life changes by reprogramming speech, movement and thought patterns. That moment was a major turning point for Faulkner, as he understood <b>that</b> [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{to the root of}} the crucial relationship between language and beliefs, then <b>you</b> <b>could</b> change everything." [...] Upon the realization that Bandler and Grinder were developing innovations in areas where Northwestern University had not yet [...] "cracked the code," [...] Faulkner decided to forgo the pursuit of his degree and, instead, dive headfirst into NLP training. By 1987, he was a certified NLP trainer. Today, Faulkner describes Grinder and Bandler as having been at least 10 years ahead of their time.|$|R
5000|$|In {{meetings}} with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, including a 2006 session with former US Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ronald E.

[...] "We thought the concern expressed to Karzai might be enough {{to get him out of}} there," [...] one official said. President Karzai has resisted, however, demanding clear-cut evidence of wrongdoing, several officials said. [...] "We don't have the kind of hard, direct evidence <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take to <b>get</b> a criminal indictment," [...] a White House official said. Ahmed Wali Karzai dismissed the allegations as politically motivated attacks by longtime rival groups in his country.|$|R
