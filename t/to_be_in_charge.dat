5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the reform of the royal government.

5|$|Following Taboo Tuesday, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) {{were put}} in charge of Raw, after Eric Bischoff took the night off, {{following}} his match the night before. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch against Randy Orton, as he lost a steel cage match to Orton the previous night. Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at the November pay-per-view Survivor Series. Orton did not receive the opportunity, as he lost to Flair. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match involving Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Maven and Chris Benoit) facing off against Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge and Gene Snitsky) at Survivor Series.

5|$|Ministers may be {{designated}} by the Prime Minister <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office.

5|$|By 1310 the {{relationship}} between Edward II and his earls had deteriorated {{to the point where}} a committee of earls took control of government from the king. The earls disobeyed a royal order not to carry arms to parliament, and in full military attire presented a demand to the king for the appointment of a commission of reform. At the heart of the deteriorating situation was the peers' opinion of Edward II's relationship with Piers Gaveston, and his reputedly outrageous behavior. On 16 March 1310, the king agreed to the appointment of Ordainers, who were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the reform of the royal household. John of Brittany was one of eight earls appointed to this committee of21, referred to as the Lords Ordainers. He was among the Ordainers considered loyal to Edward II and was also by this time one of the older remaining earls.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E

5|$|The Cabinet {{generally}} directs {{and controls}} the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament. It also has significant influence over lawmaking. Ministers may be {{designated by the}} Prime Minister <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Singapore's ministers {{are among the best}} paid in the world. Prior to a salary review in 2011, the Prime Minister's annual salary was S$3.07 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers ranged between S$1.58 million and S$2.37 million. On 21 May 2011, a committee was appointed by the Prime Minister to review the salaries of the Prime Minister as well as the President, political appointment holders, and Members of Parliament. Following the recommended wage reductions by the committee which were then debated and subsequently accepted in Parliament, the Prime Minister's salary was reduced by 36% (includes the removal of his pension) to S$2.2 million (then about US$1.7 million). Nonetheless, the Prime Minister remains the highest-paid political leader in the world.|$|E
5|$|As Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) {{defeated}} Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky) at Survivor Series, {{they were}} given the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of Raw for a month; On the November 29 episode of Raw, Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight title Battle Royal. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, however, overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face {{the winner of the}} Battle Royal. The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge, as the final two participants, going over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match. Orton, acting as General Manager, booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Edge, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight title. The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface on Edge, only for Edge to manage to roll Benoit over, while the Crossface was still locked in, causing Benoit’s shoulders to touch the mat. The referee began counting, which moments later led to Edge to submit to the maneuver. The following week, with Chris Jericho in charge, Vince McMahon vacated the World Heavyweight title, concluding the match ended in a tie. On the December 13 episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff, who had resumed his position as General Manager, scheduled an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Benoit, Chris Jericho, Orton and Batista at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight title. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding a Special Guest Referee for the Elimination Chamber: Shawn Michaels. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign.|$|E
5|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) and Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky). On the October 25, 2004 episode of Raw, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) {{were put in}} charge of Raw, after General Manager Eric Bischoff took the night off.

Orton {{accepted}} Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series.
