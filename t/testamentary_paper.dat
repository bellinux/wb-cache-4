6000|$|It was {{the first}} time Flambeau had ever seen Father Brown vanquished. He still sat looking at the ground, with a painful and {{corrugated}} brow, as if in shame. It was impossible to avoid the feeling which the prophet's winged words had fanned, that here was a sullen, professional suspecter of men overwhelmed by a prouder and purer spirit of natural liberty and health. At last he said, blinking as if in bodily distress: [...] "Well, if that is so, sir, you need do no more than take the <b>testamentary</b> <b>paper</b> you spoke of and go. I wonder where the poor lady left it." ...|$|E
6000|$|FIRST, the [...] "Ahlden Heritage" [...] was {{one cause}} of disagreement, which lasted long. The poor Mother of George II. and of Queen Sophie had left {{considerable}} properties; [...] "three million THALERS," [...] that is 900,000 pounds, say some; but all was rather in an unliquid state, {{not so much}} as her Will was to be had. The Will, with a 10,000 pounds or so, was {{in the hands of a}} certain Graf von Bar, one of her confidants in that sad imprisonment: [...] "money lent him," [...] Busching says, [Beitrage zur Lebensgeschichte denkwurdiger Personen (Halle, 1783-1789), i. 306, ? NUSSLER. Some distracted fractions of Business Correspondence with this Bar, in Memoirs of Sophia Dorothea, --unintelligible as usual there.] [...] "to set up a Wax-Bleachery at Cassel:"--and the said Count von Bar was off with it, <b>Testamentary</b> <b>Paper</b> and all; gone to the REICHSHOFRATH at Vienna, supreme Judges, in the Empire, of such matters. Who accordingly issued him a [...] "Protection," [...] to start with: so that when the Hanover people attempted to lay hold of the questionable wax-bleaching Count, at Frankfurt-on-Mayn,--secretly sending [...] "a lieutenant and twelve men" [...] for that object,--he produces his Protection Paper, and the lieutenant and twelve men had to hasten home again. [Ibid.] Count von Bar had to be tried at law,--never ask with what results;--and this itself was a long story. Then as to the other properties of the poor Duchess, question arises, Are they ALLODIA, or are they FEUDA,--that is to say, shall the Son have them, or the Daughter? In short, there was no end to questions. Friedrich Wilhelm has an Envoy at Hanover, one Kannegiesser, laboring at Hanover, the second of such he has been obliged to send; who finds plenty of employment in that matter. [...] "My Brother the COMODIANT quietly put his Father's Will in his pocket, I have heard; and paid no regard to it (except what he was compelled to pay, by Chesterfield and others): will he do the like with his poor Mother's Will?" [...] Patience, your Majesty: he is not a covetous man, but a self-willed and a proud,--always conscious to himself that he is the soul of honor, this poor Brother King! ...|$|E
