5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> mirror and back, {{the light is}} reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E

5|$|A light novel titled Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness, {{written by}} Takashi Yano and {{illustrated}} by Kishimoto, stars Shikamaru as the main character and narrator.

5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object.

5|$|Also in {{the region}} was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing slowly along the North African coast after being {{detached}} from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters and illness rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly. Progress had been slow, and a northeasterly wind had also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he learned from a passing vessel that there was a French squadron {{in the region}}, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return. At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> ships were the enemy and he turned away from the French and tacked into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> British vessel and were ordered to give chase.|$|E

5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime.

This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
