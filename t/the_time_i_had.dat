I knew I wasn't {{going to be in}} that position for very long. I wanted to participate in gathering whatever information I could in <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> and I wanted to bring it all together, really to see what would happen. I needed time to work by myself.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E

500|$|Tarwater {{was raised}} in a Christian home, but growing up he [...] "sort of went through the motions" [...] and didn't really hold strong beliefs. By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where I knew what I was doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer. On his 2012 Olympic experience, he said [...] "It was a real gift from God. [...] I felt His presence so much the past few weeks. [...] It was an unbelievable feeling." [...] Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte.|$|E
500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until later that I realised I'd put myself under a hideously stressful situation, and that I should just be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> with her. I really got to know the character, and she had so many facets and was always fun to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Bridges {{began his}} career with local side Cambridge United, whom he joined {{at the age of}} 8, he progressed through the club's youth system before signing his first {{professional}} contract in February 2002. He broke into the first-team {{towards the end of the}} 2001–02 season, making his debut as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Huddersfield Town at the Abbey Stadium. He played six further games in the same season, scoring his first goal for Cambridge in a 2–1 home win against Tranmere Rovers. Bridges featured regularly in the opening half of the 2002–03 season, playing a total of 25 times and scoring once in a 3–0 victory against York City. However, a [...] "persistent" [...] ankle injury cut his run in the first-team short, and he did not feature from February onwards. He returned to first-team action in a 1–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2003, and played a further 22 times for the club throughout the 2003–04 campaign. However, Bridges left Cambridge at the end of the season after failing to agree a contract extension. On leaving Cambridge, Bridges said [...] "I was offered a contract that was almost a kick in the teeth after <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been at the club when players were coming in from all over the place who did not care about the club. They were getting paid five or six times what I was offered, and I thought it was probably time to move on". During his three seasons with the club, Bridges made a total of 55 appearances in all competitions,scoring four times.|$|E

2500|$|While {{serving in}} Taji, Iraq, West {{received}} information from an intelligence specialist about {{a plot to}} ambush his unit. The alleged plot involved Yahya Jhodri Hamoodi, an Iraqi police officer. West had his men detain Hamoodi. Soldiers testified that {{in the process of}} detaining Hamoodi, he appeared to reach for his weapon and needed to be subdued. Hamoodi was beaten by four soldiers from the 2/20th Field Artillery Battalion on the head and body. West then fired his pistol near Hamoodi's head, [...] after which Hamoodi provided West with names and information, which Hamoodi later described as [...] "meaningless information induced by fear and pain." [...] At least one of these suspects was arrested as a result, but no plans for attacks or weapons were found. [...] West said [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to base my decision on the intelligence I received. It's possible that I was wrong about Mr. Hamoodi." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Long Beach, on December 28, 1920, Earhart and {{her father}} visited an {{airfield}} where Frank Hawks (who later gained fame as an air racer) gave her a ride that would forever change Earhart's life. [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got two or three hundred feet [...] off the ground," [...] she said, [...] "I knew I had to fly." [...] After that 10-minute flight (which cost her father $10), she immediately determined to learn to fly. Working {{at a variety of}} jobs including photographer, truck driver, and stenographer at the local telephone company, she managed to save $1,000 for flying lessons. Earhart had her first lesson on January 3, 1921, at Kinner Field near Long Beach. Her teacher was Anita [...] "Neta" [...] Snook, a pioneer female aviator who used a surplus Curtiss JN-4 [...] "Canuck" [...] for training. Earhart arrived with her father and a singular request: [...] "I want to fly. Will you teach me?" [...] In order to reach the airfield, Earhart had to take a bus {{to the end of the}} line, then walk four miles (6km). Earhart's mother also provided part of the $1,000 [...] "stake" [...] against her [...] "better judgement".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1840s Maykov entered Belinsky's circle and {{became friends with}} [...] Nikolai Nekrasov and Ivan Turgenev. Along with his brother Valerian he started to attend Mikhail Petrashevsky's 'Secret Fridays', {{establishing}} contacts with Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Aleksey Pleshcheyev. Later, having been interrogated about his involvement, Maykov avoided arrest (he {{did not have a}} significant role in the group's activities), but for several years was kept under secret police surveillance. In the years to come Maykov, who never believed in the ideas of socialism, often expressed embarrassment over his involvement in the Petrashevsky affair. In an 1854 letter to M. A. Yazykov he confessed: [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> very vague political ideas and was foolish enough to join a group where all the government's actions were criticized and condemned as wrong a priory, many of [...] applauding every mistake, according to the logic of 'the worse they rule, the quicker they'll fall'. In the 1850s Maykov, now a Slavophile, began to champion 'firm' monarchy and strong Orthodox values. Writing to Aleksandr Nikitenko he argued: [...] "Only a form of political system which had been proven by the test of history could be called viable". In 1852 Maykov moved into the office of the Russian Committee of Foreign censorship, where he continued working for the rest of his life, becoming its chairman in 1882.|$|E
