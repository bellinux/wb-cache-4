5|$|In 2000, NSB {{started using}} Class 93 diesel {{multiple}} units on intercity trains, retiring the Di3. In March 2000, NSB announced {{the closing of}} several stations for the commuter train service. Fifty percent of the stations were responsible for only {{two percent of the}} traffic, and NSB instead wanted buses to transport people to the closest railway station, which would reduce overall <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> for most passengers. From 7 January 2001, a fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim. Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg were closed, but HiNT Røstad opened. From June 2001, NSB introduced additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, giving a half-hour headway. The Nordland Line had not received NSB's first generation of train radio, Scanet, so was among the first lines to receive GSM-R from 1 December 2004. In 2010, CargoNet started using Vossloh Euro locomotives. Sykehuset Levanger Station was closed on 11 December 2010. Despite generating some 90,000 annual patrons and being one of the busiest stations on the line, it was located too close to Levanger Station to meet safety requirements.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003, Linx {{reduced the}} number of daily {{services}} from Gothenburg to Copenhagen from ten to four. The company stated that this was because of insufficient ridership. Linx had offered tickets with a lower price than Scandinavian Airlines, who operated the airline service between Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. Ryanair also provided an airline service, but with fewer departures and with the same center-to-center <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> because it flew from the secondary Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. From 1 September 2003, Norwegian Air Shuttle started services from Gardermoen to Arlanda, and became a more direct competitor to Linx. From 27 October, Nordic Airlink (later FlyNordic) also started a flight between the same airports. With shorter travel time from center to center and comparable fares, Norwegian and Nordic started taking market shares away from Linx.|$|E
5|$|The first {{experiment}} allowed {{detection of}} three atoms of 283Cn but also seemingly detected 1 atom of 287Fl. This {{result was a}} surprise given the <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> of the product atoms is ~2s, so the flerovium atoms produced should have decayed to copernicium before adsorption. In the second reaction, 2 atoms of 288Fl and possibly 1 atom of 289Fl were detected. Two of the three atoms displayed adsorption characteristics associated with a volatile, noble-gas-like element, which has been suggested but is not predicted by more recent calculations. These experiments provided independent confirmation for the discovery of copernicium, flerovium, and livermorium via comparison with published decay data. Further experiments in 2008 to confirm this important result detected a single atom of 289Fl, and supported previous data showing flerovium having a noble-gas-like interaction with gold.|$|E

25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented near-field enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures. The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating light propagation, absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general design rule, tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The design rule suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to hole mobility ratio. In other words, the <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) should be the same. The general design rule can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of space charge limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background. It {{has been}} {{stated that the}} first 60 minutes {{following}} an accident often determines whether a patient will live or die. It is {{the objective of this}} study to determine if the Golden Hour theory is a valid concept that should continue to be applied to pre-hospital transport of the severely injured patient. Hypothesis: This study will test the null hypothesis that patient outcomes are independent of <b>transport</b> <b>times.</b> Methods: Data were obtained from a statewide trauma registry from the years 1993 to 1998 for this non-concurrent cohort study. The study sample consisted of 2, 621 patients 16 year of age or older with injury severity scores of {{greater than or equal to}} 25. Patients with <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> less than or equal to 60 minutes (n = 2121) were compared to patients with <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> greater than 60 minutes (n = 499). The primary dependent variable of this study was mortality. Results: The average mortality rate for severely injured patients transported in less than or equal to 60 minutes was higher than the average mortality rate for patients transported in greater than 60 minutes (36. 2 % versus 22. 2 %). Furthermore, patients with a penetrating mechanism of injury transported in less than or equal to 60 minutes encountered greater average mortality compared to similarly injured patients with <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> greater than 60 minutes (52. 0 % versus 36. 1 %). Patients with <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> greater than 60 minutes exhibited higher morbidity as evidenced by longer stays in the hospital and intensive care unit. However, morbidity was not significantly different for patients with penetrating injuries transported in greater than 60 minutes versus patients transported in less than or equal to 60 minutes. Conclusions: It is apparent from this research that pre-hospital time defined in the terms of a Golden Hour does not significantly decrease mortality. Basing trauma system transport standards only on time is inappropriate...|$|R
