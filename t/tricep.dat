50|$|Muscle coactivation allows {{muscle groups}} {{surrounding}} a joint {{to become more}} stable. This is due to both muscles (or sets of muscles) contracting at the same time, which produces compression on the joint. The joint is able to become stiffer and more stable due to this action. For example, when the bicep and the <b>tricep</b> coactivate, the elbow becomes more stable. This stabilization mechanism is also important for unexpected loads impeded on the joint, allowing the muscles to coactivate and provide stability to the joint in a quick fashion. This mechanism is controlled neuromuscularly, which allows the muscle(s) to contract. This occurs through a motor neuron sending a signal (through creating action potentials) to the muscle fiber to contract by releasing Acetylcholine. When signals are sent to all muscle fibers in a muscle group, the muscle group will contract as a whole.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman {{walking is}} a complex and rhythmic activity. It is well {{integrated}} effort of brain, nerves and muscles. It relies on the coordinated action of various muscles to control the jointed trunk and limbs and to generate the forces needed to counter gravity and propel the body forward. In this study, surface electromyography (EMG) signals of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, adductor longus, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, <b>Tricep</b> surae, rectus femoris and erector spine muscles were recorded on various subject walked over ground at normal walking speeds. Comparative study of the normal gait with clinical gait exhibited greater activation of the hamstring and <b>tricep</b> surae during mid-stance phase. The complete lack of triceps surae signal during the pushoff phase was also seen. Tibialis anterior showed activation {{throughout most of the}} gait cycle in clinical gait. During the walking, EMG activity of Adductor Longus, Hamstrings, Tibialis Anterior, <b>Tricep</b> Surae and Erector Spine muscles were significantly augmented (p< 0. 05) in both normal and clinical gait. There were no significant differences (p < 0. 050) shown for muscle EMG for the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and rectus femoris muscle.

Objectives: To analyze {{shoulder}} muscle activation when performing push-ups under different stability conditions and heights. Study design: Comparative study by repeated measures. Setting: Valencia University laboratory. Participants: 29 healthy males participated. Main outcome measures: Subjects performed 3 push-ups each with their hands at 2 different heights (10 vs. 65 cm) under stable conditions and using a suspension device. Push-up speed was controlled and the testing order was randomized. The average amplitudes of the electromyographic root mean square of the long head of the triceps brachii (<b>TRICEP),</b> upper trapezius (TRAPS), anterior deltoid (DELT) and clavicular pectoralis (PEC) were recorded. The electromyographic signals were normalized to the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). Results: Suspended push-ups at 10 cm resulted in greater activation in the <b>TRICEP</b> (17. 14 +/- 1. 31 %MVIC vs. 37. 03 +/- 1. 80 %MVIC) and TRAPS (5. 83 +/- 0. 58 %MVIC vs. 14. 69 +/- 1. 91 %MVIC) than those performed on the floor. For DELT and PEC similar or higher activation was found performing the push-ups on the floor, respectively. Height determines different muscle activation patterns.

Body composition was determined in 76 HIV-infected participants from Mbarara, Uganda after starting a thymidine-analog regimen, and annual change was determined using repeated measures analysis. We measured skinfolds (<b>tricep,</b> thigh, subscapular, and abdomen), circumferences (arm, hip, thigh, waist), and total lean and fat mass (using bioelectric impedance analysis). A cross-sectional sample of 49 HIV-uninfected participants was studied for comparison. At baseline, most body composition measures were lower in HIV-infected than uninfected participants, but waist circumference was similar. After 12 months on ART, there was little difference in body composition measures between HIV-infected and uninfected participants; median waist circumference appeared higher in HIV-infected participants (79 vs. 75 [*]cm; p[*]=[*] 0. 090). Among HIV-infected participants, increases were observed in total lean and fat mass, circumference, and skinfold measures; only the increase in <b>tricep</b> skinfold did not reach statistical significance (+ 1. 05 [*]mm; 95 % confidence interval: − 0. 24, 2. 34; p[*]=[*] 0. 11).

However, little is known regarding the relationship between these parameters. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of auditory stimuli of different intensities on the performance of a concentric bench-press exercise. Concentric bench-presses were performed by thirteen trained subjects in response to three different conditions: a visual stimulus (VS); a visual stimulus accompanied by a non-startle auditory stimulus (AS); and a visual stimulus accompanied by a startle auditory stimulus (SS). Peak RFD, peak velocity, onset movement, movement duration and electromyography from pectoralis and <b>tricep</b> muscles were recorded. The SS condition induced an increase in the RFD and peak velocity and a reduction in the movement onset and duration, in comparison with the VS and AS condition. The onset activation of the pectoralis and <b>tricep</b> muscles was shorter for the SS than for the VS and AS conditions. These findings point out to specific enhancement effects of loud auditory stimulation on the rate of force development.

Body-esteem was measured with Mendelson and White's Body-Esteem Scale. A 2 x 2 univariate statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine significance of effect. Overweight and average weight children were the independent variables. Self-esteem, body-esteem, and cardiovascular endurance were the dependent variables. Body composition (<b>tricep</b> skinfold measurement) was used to distinguish the two groups and determine weight loss due to the program. The ANOVA indicated no statistically significant Improvements In cardiovascular endurance, self-esteem and body-esteem in overweight children In comparison with average weight children after a 10 week aerobic movement program.

40|$|Background: The two-compartment (2 C) {{model is}} a {{relatively}} accessible, inexpensive and time efficient method for body composition measurement. There is very little validated research on the 2 C model in Asian Indians: a high risk population in terms of obesity and related disorders. This highlights the need for valid estimates of body composition from the 2 C model. Purpose: The goal was to compare 2 C model (predictor) estimates of body composition to those from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (criterion), an established gold standard measure of total adiposity {{in order to determine}} the validity of the 2 C model in the Asian Indian population. From this data it is hoped that a correction equation may be determined for more accurate prediction of Asian Indian body composition using 2 C model methods. Methods: 21 males (10 Asian Indian and 11 Caucasian, aged 18 - 55 yrs) had estimates of percent body fat from 2 C methods (sum of four skinfolds and anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis [Bodystat 1500 and Tanita segmental impedance analyser], air displacement plethysmography [Bod Pod] and hydrostatic weighing) compared to MRI measured body composition values. Agreement was assessed using multiple linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Differences were assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Regression analysis showed air displacement plethysmography predicts MRI body composition in Caucasian males (adjusted r 2 = 0. 74; SEE = 3. 27). In Asian Indians, <b>tricep</b> skinfold thickness and hydrostatic weighing predicted MRI body composition with a low prediction error (adjusted r 2 = 0. 90; SEE = 1. 75). Despite strong correlations and no significant difference between mean differences of the 2 C methods, used in the prediction model, and MRI, BlandAltman plots revealed no acceptable limits of agreement between the methods. Asian Indian body composition was underestimated by all two compartment devices compared to MRI. Conclusion: There appears to be potential for the use of <b>tricep</b> skinfold thickness and hydrostatic weighing to predict an established reference measure (MRI) in the high risk Asian Indian population. The 2 C model underestimated Asian Indian body composition, this suggests that un-validated, the 2 C model may misidentify obesity and in turn health risk. However the small sample tested, has implications for the interpretation of the findings. Further investigation is required with a greater sample size to validate the 2 C model against an established reference measure such as MRI as there is currently little published validation data in this ethnic group...|$|E
40|$|A 34 -year-old male patient {{visited the}} {{emergency}} room with complaint of right wrist drop and foot drop. The day before, he was intoxicated and fell asleep in a room containing barbeque briquettes; After waking up, he noticed that his right wrist and foot were dropped. Upon physical examination, his right wrist extensor, thumb extensor, ankle dorsiflexor, and big toe extensor showed Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 1 power. The initial laboratory tests suggested rhabdomyolysis induced by unrelieved pressure {{on the right side}} during sleep. Right foot drop was improved after conservative care and elevated muscle enzyme became normalized with hydration therapy with no resultant acute renal failure. However, the wrist drop did not show improvement and a hard mass was palpated on the follow-up physical examination. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging studies were conducted and an abnormal mass in the lateral head of the <b>tricep</b> was detected. Axonopathy was suggested by the electrodiagnostic examination. A surgical decompression was done and a fibrotic cord lesion compressing the radial nerve was detected. After adhesiolysis, his wrist extensor power improved to MRC grade 4. Herein, we describe a compressive radial neuropathy associated with rhabdomyolysis successfully treated with surgery and provide a brief review of the related literature...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present an {{experimental}} method of parameterising the passive mechanical {{characteristics of the}} bicep and <b>tricep</b> muscles in vivo, by fitting the dynamics of a two muscle arm model incorporating anatomically meaningful and structurally identifiable modified Hill muscle models to measured elbow movements. Measurements of the passive flexion and extension of the elbow joint were obtained using 3 D motion capture, from which the elbow angle trajectories were determined and used to obtain the spring constants and damping coefficients in the model through parameter estimation. Four healthy subjects {{were used in the}} experiments. Anatomical lengths and moment of inertia values of the subjects were determined by direct measurement and calculation. There was good reproducibility in the measured arm movement between trials, and similar joint angle trajectory characteristics were seen between subjects. Each subject had their own set of fitted parameter values determined and the results showed good agreement between measured and simulated data. The average fitted muscle parallel spring constant across all subjects was 143 N/m and the average fitted muscle parallel damping constant was 1. 73 Ns/m. The passive movement method was proven to be successful, and can be applied to other joints in the human body, where muscles with similar actions are grouped together...|$|E
40|$|Childhood obesity {{increases}} the risk of morbidity whether or not obesity persists into adulthood. Measurement of body fat content using bioimpedance analysis (BIA) is a useful tool in epidemiologic studies. Both <b>tricep</b> skinfold thickness (TST, mm) and body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) are indirect, simple methods and easy to perform for assessing body composition. These methods are generally accepted as good clinical measures for defining childhood obesity. The aim of our study was to evaluate fat mass (FM, kg and %) measurements using TST and BIA (50 kHz) in a cohort of 6 -year-old Italian children. A total of 228 southern Italian children (121 boys, 107 girls), randomly selected in nine local primary schools, were included in the study. The correlation between methods for measuring FM was calculated. Linear regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between FM measured with BIA and BMI (r= 0. 92, p< 0. 001) and with TST (r= 0. 79, p< 0. 001). We conclude that FM measurement using TST and BIA is comparable in different BMI ranges. However, BIA is a useful and alternative method for detecting body composition in children and may be a more precise tool than TST for measuring FM in epidemiological studies in pediatric populations...|$|E
