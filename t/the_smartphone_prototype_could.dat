40|$|Children often attend schools {{intermittently}} {{in rural}} areas in Africa and India due to socio-economic conditions which make pupils augment their family income by working. An e-Learning solution could aid in raising the level of education by {{making it easier for}} children to fit schoolwork into the day, acting as a complement to when they are able to attend school. Traditional distance learning solutions based on computers are not suitable due to lack of infrastructure support.

50|$|Recently, a <b>smartphone</b> <b>prototype</b> using <b>the</b> {{benefits}} of cartilage conduction has been manufactured by ROHM Co., Ltd. This type of <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> provides clearer sound compared with conventional phones, even under noisy circumstances. Furthermore, the {{sound pressure level}} can be easily modified by adjusting the physical pressure level of <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> pressed against <b>the</b> outer ear. Importantly, the cartilage vibration, which is a sound source, can be heard only by oneself but not by others because sound from cartilage vibration cannot be leaked outside. This makes talking in public easy. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>smartphone’s</b> surface can be kept clean because one’s face or ear does not directly contact <b>the</b> <b>smartphone’s</b> surface. <b>The</b> cartilage conduction phone {{can also be used}} simultaneously with conventional air conduction hearing aids, which is good news for hearing-impaired people.|$|R

40|$|Smartphone {{games are}} very popular {{and have the}} highest revenue of all {{smartphone}} application categories. Some even suggest that the the games can create an addiction. This addiction has however not been classified as a disorder and the components in the games that create an addiction have not been determined. This thesis had two goals. The first was to investigate and identify addictive components in <b>smartphone</b> games. <b>The</b> second goal was to use these components to develop an addictive proof of concept <b>smartphone</b> game <b>prototype.</b> <b>The</b> prototype was also to be evaluated regarding usability and how well it included the addictive components. The components in these games that create an addiction were identified using a literature study. After establishing a theoretical framework, eight different areas of addictive smartphone game components were found. These areas were further condensed into 16 guidelines of {{how to make a}} <b>smartphone</b> game addictive. <b>The</b> guidelines were used to create a prototype which later was evaluated with a supervised play test, a short interview, a usability questionnaire and a survey with questions regarding how well the guidelines were implemented. The usability of the game prototype was regarded as good and 13 of 14 implemented guidelines received positive results in the survey. In addition to this, all test users also regarded the game prototype as fun to play and wanted to play it again.

40|$|Smartphone {{capabilities}} {{have been}} increasing {{in the last}} years, and many applications have been developed {{in order to take}} advantage of these capabilities. Smartphone users, knowing that there are lots of applications to ease many daily tasks, or simply to have some fun, typically have <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> close by. One of the capabilities that have been explored is the detection of the physical state of <b>the</b> <b>smartphone,</b> through inertial sensors embedded in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone.</b> <b>The</b> smart-phone can detect its own orientation and even detect if it is being moved through sensors like the accelerometer, linear acceleration sensor or the gyroscope. Given that <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> can detect its own physical state and the fact that users often have their <b>smartphone</b> close by, <b>the</b> opportunity of developing a new natural and intuitive way of interacting with <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> arises, and this opportunity is related with gestures.

In January 2013, the Human Media Lab introduced the first flexible tablet PC, PaperTab, in collaboration with Plastic Logic and Intel Labs, at CES. PaperTab is a multi-display environment in which each display represents a window, app or computer document. Displays are tracked in 3D to allow multidisplay operations, such as collate to enlarge the display space, or pointing with one display onto another to pull open a document file.

50|$|<b>Smartphones</b> with <b>the</b> Earthquake Network {{application}} installed are nodes of {{the sensor}} network of the Earthquake Network project.

We explore five quality attributes of LMS (capability, usability, performance, reliability and documentation). Data from a survey of 193 students were analysed using ordered logit regression. Findings showed that while only usability and reliability significantly affected user satisfaction in the PC context; all the quality attributes except documentation had a significant influence on user satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> setting.
