5|$|Sicily {{was ruled}} as an {{independent}} kingdom by relatives or cadet branch {{of the house of}} Aragon until 1409 and thence as part of <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon. The Kingdom of Naples was ruled by the Angevin ruler René of Anjou until the two thrones were reunited by AlfonsoV of Aragon, after the successful siege of Naples and the defeat of René on June 6, 1443. Eventually, Alfonso of Aragon divided the two kingdoms during his rule. He gave the rule of Naples to his illegitimate son FerdinandI of Naples, who ruled from 1458 to 1494, and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon and Sicily to Alfonso's brother JohnII of Aragon. From 1494 to 1503 successive kings of France CharlesVIII and LouisXII, who were heirs of Angevins, tried to conquer Naples (see Italian Wars) but failed. Eventually the Kingdom of Naples was reunited with <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon. The titles were held by the Aragonese kings of <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon {{until the end of the}} Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg in 1700.|$|E
5|$|The forced {{conversions}} of Muslims in Spain were enacted {{through a}} series of edicts outlawing Islam in the lands of Spain. This effort was overseen by three Spanish monarchies during the early 16th century: <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Castile in 1500–1502, followed by Navarre in 1515–1516, and lastly <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon in 1523–1526.|$|E

5|$|By 1241, the Gran Castello or Cittadella on Gozo was {{definitely}} fortified, although a settlement {{on the hill}} had existed since the Bronze Age. The city's fortifications were improved over the years, and the northern walls {{of the city that}} still stand today were built around the 15th century by <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1512, Navarre was {{invaded by}} Castile and Aragon. The Spanish forces led by King Ferdinand quickly {{occupied}} the Iberian {{half of the}} kingdom, including the capital Pamplona; in 1513, he was proclaimed King. In 1515, Navarre was formally annexed by <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Castile {{as one of its}} kingdoms. With this conquest, the 1501–02 edict of conversion came into effect in Navarre, and the Inquisition was tasked with enforcing it. Unlike in Castile, however, few Muslims appeared to accept the conversion. Historian Brian A. Catlos argues that the lack of baptismal records and a high volume of land sales by Muslims in 1516 indicate that most of them simply left Navarre to escape through the lands of <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon to North Africa (<b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon was by this time inhospitable to Muslims). Some also stayed despite the order; for example, in 1520, there were 200 Muslims in Tudela who were wealthy enough to be listed in the registers.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, Spain was split between two realms: Crown of Castile and the smaller Crown of Aragon. The marriage between King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile united the two crowns, and ultimately their grandson Charles would inherit both crowns (as Charles I of Spain, but better known as Charles V, per his regnal number as Holy Roman Emperor). Despite the union, the lands of the two crowns functioned very differently, with disparate laws, ruling priorities, and treatment of Muslims. There were also Muslims living in the Kingdom of Navarre, which was initially independent but was annexed by Castile in 1515. Forced conversion varied in timeline by ruling body: it was enacted by <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Castile in 1500–1502, in Navarre in 1515–1516, and by <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>of</b> Aragon in 1523–1526.|$|E
