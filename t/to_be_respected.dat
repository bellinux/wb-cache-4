5|$|Ahimsa (Non-violence or Non-injury). Mahavira {{taught that}} every living being has {{sanctity}} and dignity {{of its own}} {{and it should be}} respected just as one expects one's own sanctity and dignity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected.</b> Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The concept applies to action, speech, and thought.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of nature}} were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} ramification of {{this policy}} was the prohibition {{on the construction of}} new synagogues within the Empire, though the repair of old synagogues was permitted. This prohibition was difficult to enforce, as archaeological evidence in Israel indicates that illegal synagogue construction continued throughout the sixth century. The synagogue did continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> as an inviolable place of worship until the reign of Justinian.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-French force then {{consolidated}} {{themselves in}} the fort. The French criticized the English, in particular Norreys for being brutal and cruel, and Aumont ordered any remaining survivors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> as prisoners of war. Out of 400 Spanish soldiers only thirteen survived; nine soldiers survived having managed to hide among the dead and taken prisoner, and four managed {{to make their way}} to the rocks towards the sea.|$|E

25|$|The Treaty {{states that}} Paraguay {{is to be}} blamed on all the {{consequences}} of the conflict and has to pay all the debt of war, Paraguay has to remain without any fortress and military force. Large portions of Paraguayan territories were to be taken by Argentina and Brazil {{at the end of the}} conflict, and the independence of Paraguay was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> only for five years. The Treaty sparked international outrage and voices favourable to Paraguay.|$|E
25|$|To the Western church {{images were}} just objects made by craftsmen, to be {{utilized}} for stimulating the senses of the faithful, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> {{for the sake}} of the subject represented, not in themselves. Although in popular devotional practice a tendency to go beyond these limits has often been present, the church was, before the advent of the idea of collecting old art, usually brutal in disposing of images no longer needed, much to the regret of art historians. Most monumental sculpture of the first millennium that has survived was broken up and reused as rubble in the re-building of churches.|$|E

The commission said it was considering offering support to independent media {{in the country and}} had set aside more than eight million euros from its budget to offer support for human rights activities. France expressed her solidarity with Poland on the issue of human rights in Belarus a day after the EU declared it was worried about the situation in that country. Several former Soviet Republics, including neighbouring Ukraine, also expressed their concerns about the development of the situation in Belarus.|$|E

25|$|In {{the papal}} {{document}} Amoris Laetitia, issued in 2016, Francis encouraged better understanding from {{all members of}} the church on the acceptance of gay people, without suggesting any specific doctrinal changes. Instead, he reiterated the need for every person <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> regardless of their sexual orientation, and to be free from threats of aggression and violence. He avoided any recognition of unions between same sex couples, but rather maintained that these were not equal to heterosexual unions. Some parts of the media interpreted his remarks as more moderate on the issue of homosexuality than that taken by church leaders in previous years.|$|E
25|$|The {{latter half}} of the eighteenth century {{continued}} to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the French language was expected for members of the European courts. The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, such as Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> officially, genre painting, landscape, portrait, and still life were extremely fashionable. Chardin and Jean-Baptiste Oudry were hailed for their still lives although this was officially considered the lowest of all genres in the hierarchy of painting subjects.|$|E
25|$|Surgery was {{formally}} taught in Italy {{even though it}} was initially looked down upon as a lower form of medicine. The most important figure of the formal learning of surgery was Guy de Chauliac. He insisted that a proper surgeon should have a specific knowledge of the human body such as anatomy, food and diet of the patient, and other ailments that may have affected the patients. Not only should surgeons have knowledge about the body but they should also be well versed in the liberal arts. In this way, surgery was no longer regarded as a lower practice, but instead began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> and gain esteem and status.|$|E

25|$|Guru Nanak {{stated that}} his Guru is God {{who is the}} same from the {{beginning}} of time to the end of time. Nanak claimed to be God's mouthpiece, God's slave and servant and even God's dog, but maintained that he was only a guide and teacher, was neither a reincarnation of God nor in any way related to God. Nanak stated that the human Guru is mortal and not divine, who is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> and loved but not worshipped. When Guru, or Satguru (The true guru) is used in Gurbani it is often referring to the internal soul rather than a living Guru.|$|E
25|$|He {{finally came}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> {{as one of}} the most {{intelligent}} cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Raphaël Géminiani knew him better than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques w{{as one of the}} most gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made Géminiani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.|$|E
25|$|Marriage {{to a great}} heiress {{came only}} with royal patronage, which in turn meant that Ranulf had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> and trusted by the king. Ranulf was probably, like his father, among the {{earliest}} and most loyal of Henry's followers, and was noted as such by Orderic Vitalis. Ranulf was however not recorded often at the court of Henry I, and did not form part of the king's closest group of administrative advisers. He witnessed charters only occasionally, though this became more frequent after he became earl. In 1106 he is found serving as one of several justiciars at York hearing a case about the lordship of Ripon. In 1116 he is recorded in a similar context.|$|E

He tells Charlotte that he left his home in Africa as a teenager, and had been a sailor ever since. He has never lived in America and has never been a slave. At the end of the book, it becomes clear that he does not realize what his social status would be, even as a free man in Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E

All Corsicans who had joined the French were granted an amnesty and their property was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected.</b> Paoli and his Corsicans were furious; Paoli's deputy Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo attempted to intervene and was rebuffed by Hood, and Moore suggested that Hood had granted these terms to embarrass the army, whom the admiral publicly blamed for the length and failures of the siege. Historian Desmond Gregory has suggested instead however that Hood needed the siege concluded primarily so that his fleet to return to urgent operations elsewhere in the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Appiah {{has been}} {{influenced}} by the cosmopolitanist philosophical tradition, which stretches from German philosophers such as Hegel through W. E. B. Du Bois and others. In his article “Education for Global Citizenship”, Appiah outlines his conception of cosmopolitanism. He therein defines cosmopolitanism as “universality plus difference”. Building from this definition, he asserts that the first takes precedence over the latter, that is: different cultures are respected “not because cultures matter in themselves, but because people matter, and culture matters to people.” But Appiah first defined it as its problems but ultimately determines that practicing a citizenship of the world and conversation is not only helpful in a post-9/11 world. Therefore, according to Appiah’s take on this ideology, cultural differences are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> in so far as they are not harmful to people and in no way conflict with our universal concern for every human’s life and well-being.|$|E
