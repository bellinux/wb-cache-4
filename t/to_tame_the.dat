5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed <b>to</b> <b>tame</b> <b>the</b> rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

25|$|Up {{to around}} 1500 the Sami were mainly {{fishermen}} and trappers, {{usually in a}} combination, leading a nomadic lifestyle decided by the migrations of the reindeer. Around 1500, due to excessive hunting, again provoked {{by the fact that}} the Sami had to pay taxes to Norway, Sweden and Russia, the number of reindeer started to decrease. Most Sami then settled along the fjords, on the coast and along the inland waterways to pursue a combination of cattle raising, trapping and fishing. A small minority of the Sami then started <b>to</b> <b>tame</b> <b>the</b> reindeer, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, who, although often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypical Sami lifestyle, only represent around 10% of the Sami people.|$|E

After hearing about the {{destruction}} of Soul Edge, she tries <b>to</b> <b>tame</b> <b>the</b> evil kodachi, but discovers that Toki has obtained more Soul Edge fragments and decides to keep both Soul Edge and Mekkimaru away from him. In Soulcalibur III (2005), Taki comes back to Japan and learns that because of Toki's madness, the Fu-Ma have descended into an internal conflict. Contacting the rebellious faction within the clan, led by her friend Chie, Taki faces the Soul Edge-corrupted Toki at the underground sanctum within the Hoko Buddhist temple, where he absorbs the Oni spirits within the shrine. She slays him and Chie becomes the new Fu-Ma leader, but the evil spirits that dwelled within Toki escape and travel west. Knowing they are seeking Soul Edge, and that the cursed sword's power was weak enough to allow its destruction, Taki begins a new journey to extinguish Soul Edge. In Soulcalibur IV (2008), Taki witnesses how a duel between Siegfried armed with the Soul Calibur and Soul Edge-wielding Nightmare unleashes a cataclysm, motivating her to destroy both Soul swords.|$|E

The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away. Alexander however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked <b>to</b> <b>tame</b> <b>the</b> horse, which he eventually managed. Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: [...] "My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you", and bought the horse for him. Alexander named it Bucephalas, meaning [...] "ox-head". Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as India.

Liggett Group, Inc. that tobacco was an addictive drug. In this proposed class action, instead of seeking damages attributable to smoking-related illnesses, the plaintiffs sought compensation for economic losses due to the injury of nicotine addiction, including emotional distress and funds expended in efforts to stop smoking.

500|$|The {{division}} of the legislature into an upper and lower house wasn't questioned either, despite the obscure origins of the English House of Lords and its role as {{the representative of the}} hereditary nobility. Americans had seldom known any but bicameral legislatures, both in Britain and in most state governments. The main exceptions to this were the dysfunctional Confederation Congress and the unicameral Pennsylvania legislature, which was seen as quickly vacillating between partisan extremes after each election. Experience had convinced the delegates that an upper house was necessary <b>to</b> <b>tame</b> <b>the</b> passions of the lower classes against the interests of wealthy merchants and landowners. Since America had no native hereditary aristocracy, the character of this upper house was designed to protect the interests of this wealthy elite, the [...] "minority of the opulent," [...] against the interests of the lower classes, who constituted the majority of the population.|$|E
500|$|Clearmountain {{was said}} to {{have been one of the}} first {{recording}} engineers to hang tissue paper over the tweeters of the NS-10 <b>to</b> <b>tame</b> <b>the</b> over-bright treble. Covering the tweeters with tissue paper {{was said to}} produce treble-deficient mixes when replayed on normal domestic hi-fi. The phenomenon became the subject of hot debate. [...] Recording engineer Bob Hodas investigated the alleged sonic effects of tissue paper. He found inconsistent results with different paper, but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering, where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed. [...] Hodas derided the tissue practice as [...] "aberrant behaviour", saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects. [...] He also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable. Newell et al. noted that had the speakers' grilles been used in studios, where they are routinely removed, they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised tissue paper filter.|$|E
500|$|In 430 BC, {{the army}} of Sparta looted Attica for a second time, but Pericles was not daunted and refused to revise his initial strategy. Unwilling to engage the Spartan army in battle, he again led a naval {{expedition}} to plunder the coasts of the Peloponnese, this time taking 100 Athenian ships with him. According to Plutarch, just before the sailing of the ships an eclipse of the sun frightened the crews, but Pericles used the astronomical knowledge he had acquired from Anaxagoras to calm them. In the summer {{of the same year}} an epidemic broke out and devastated the Athenians. The exact identity of the disease is uncertain, typhus or typhoid fever are suspected, but this has been the source of much debate. In any case, the city's plight, caused by the epidemic, triggered a new wave of public uproar, and Pericles was forced to defend himself in an emotional final speech, a rendition of which is presented by Thucydides. This {{is considered to be a}} [...] monumental oration, revealing Pericles' virtues but also his bitterness towards his compatriots' ingratitude. Temporarily, he managed <b>to</b> <b>tame</b> <b>the</b> people's resentment and to ride out the storm, but his internal enemies' final bid to undermine him came off; they managed to deprive him of the generalship and to fine him at an amount estimated between 15 and 50 talents. Ancient sources mention Cleon, a rising and dynamic protagonist of the Athenian political scene during the war, as the public prosecutor in Pericles' trial.|$|E

Feige added that Ross would appear briefly in the film, with the intent being to expand on the character's role in future films.

Jim Rash appears as a faculty member at MIT, while Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a FedEx deliveryman, and co-director Joe Russo cameos as Theo Broussard, a psychiatrist murdered by Zemo.
