5000|$|Tradition calls Prochorus {{the nephew}} of Stephen and a {{companion}} of John the Evangelist, who consecrated him bishop of Nicomedia in Bithynia (modern-day Turkey). He was traditionally ascribed <b>the</b> <b>authorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apocryphal <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> John, and {{was said to have}} ended his life as a martyr in Antioch in the 1st century. According to Caesar Baronius' Annales Ecclesiastici, now considered historically inaccurate, Nicanor was a Cypriot Jew who returned to his native island and died a martyr in 76. Other accounts say he was martyred in [...] "Berj," [...] an unidentified place possibly confused with Botrys. Timon was said to have been a Hellenized Jew who became a bishop in Greece or in Bosra, Syria; in the latter account, his preaching brought the ire of the local governor, who martyred him with fire. After preaching for years in Asia Minor, where Hippolytus of Rome claimed he was bishop of Soli (Pompeiopolis; though he may have been referring to Soli, Cyprus), Parmenas was said to have settled down in Macedonia, where he died at Philippi in 98 during Trajan's persecutions.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, Dover Wilson {{rejected}} Chambers, Sampley and Price, {{and instead}} supported Parrott and Timberlake, believing that Shakespeare edited a play originally written by Peele; [...] "we must look to George Peele for <b>the</b> <b>authorship,</b> not only <b>of</b> <b>Act</b> 1, but <b>of</b> {{most of the}} basic text upon which Shakespeare worked." [...] However, {{he goes on to}} assert that Shakespeare so thoroughly revised Peele [...] "that Meres and the editors of the Folio were fully within their rights in calling it his. The aesthetic responsibility for it is therefore his also." [...] He dismisses the involvement of Marlowe, Greene and Kyd and uses evidence of grammatical and metrical repetition in Act 1, especially the use of the vocative case. He lists many pages of parallels with Peele's work; the poems The Tale of Troy (1579), The Honour of the Garter, An Eclogue Gratulatory (1589), Polyhymnia (1590), Descensus Astraeae (1591) and the plays The Arraignment of Paris (1584), The Battle of Alcazar (1588), David and Bathsheba (1588) and Edward I (1593). His theory is that originally, Peele wrote a short play for provincial performance by a touring company during the plague years of 1592-1594. However, upon returning to London, the play was deemed too short, and needed expanding, which is where Shakespeare got involved. Dover Wilson suggests that the reason Shakespeare was asked was because he was working on the thematically similar poems Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece at the time. However, because Shakespeare was unhappy working on the play, he purposely wrote badly. According to Dover Wilson [...] "you can see him laughing behind his hand through most of the scenes he rehandled." ...|$|R
