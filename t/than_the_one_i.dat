And when I saw Harrison perform in 1974, {{he put on a}} far better show <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> would later see Wings do." [...] Writing in the posthumous Rolling Stone Press tribute, Harrison, in 2002, Mikal Gilmore similarly identified [...] "You" [...] as a highlight of the artist's work in the mid to late 1970s. In the same publication, Greg Kot deemed it to be [...] "a terrific single", adding: [...] "Its roaring Wall of Sound arrangement suits Harrison well, right down to its closing quote of the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby'." [...] In a January 2002 review of Harrison's solo releases, for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson described the song as [...] "magnificent".|$|E

[...] "Cinema became my real education, much more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> received from the priest", he said later in an interview. Almodóvar was influenced by Luis Buñuel.|$|E

I explicitly measure private and public capital stocks, and I find large differences in both types of capital across countries. Moreover, differences in private capital are larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> find for total capital for the richest and poorest countries.

The win was disputed because Mo {{was able to}} land many hard hands on Choi´s head, while the Korean missed most of his shots. However, due to a kick Choi delivered to Mighty Mo's groin {{in the second round}} that was inexplicably ruled a knockdown. Mighty Mo was quoted in the post-fight interview: [...] "He (Choi) seemed a little bit stronger because I hit him with some good shots and he didn't fall down so I was surprised, actually harder <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> hit him with before.

In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again." ...|$|E

40|$|The word Qing, {{the name}} of the last Chinese dynasty (1644 - 1912), is {{frequently}} employed as an adjective, as in Qing porcelain.

40|$|Recently I {{noticed that}} an old {{conjecture}} of mine got quite some interest {{of people working}} outside of my field, especially {{people who work in}} discrete mathematics, number theory, code theory, combinatorics, even cryptographers.
