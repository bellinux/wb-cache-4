On the day of departure he received a note from a client, which read [...] "You <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> are going to Germany. Don't go, we shall be at war within forty-eight hours". Hastings heeded this warning, and remained in England – war was declared between Britain and Germany less than two days later. Hastings himself volunteered to serve in the armed forces, but was rejected as medically unfit.|$|E
500|$|The novelization {{suggests}} that the shark may be acting {{under the influence of}} a vengeful voodoo witch doctor (who has a feud with the Brody family), and the shark's apparent revenge has magical implications. Therefore, the witch doctor is the 'revenge' and the shark is his tool. This also explains the strange psychic connection Ellen and the shark have with each other. The plot was deleted as it strayed too far away from the plot of the killer shark. However, {{at one point in the}} theatrical version, Michael Brody says, [...] "Come on, sharks don’t commit murder. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> don’t believe in that voodoo." ...|$|E

He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me".

500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so much that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E

2500|$|During this time, Pet Shop Boys {{began to}} work with playwright Jonathan Harvey on a stage musical project.

Minogue later performed the track live, during her 2005 [...] tour, singing to a pre-recorded Neil Tennant. This {{is not the first time}} that Pet Shop Boys have worked with Minogue: in 1994, they indeed wrote a song for inclusion on her eponymous Kylie Minogue album, called [...] "Falling", which was based on an unreleased remix of [...] "Go West" [...] with new lyrics by Tennant; however, Minogue and her record company did not like the production sound of Pet Shop Boys' demo and asked Farley & Heller to finally produce the track.|$|E
