2500|$|Stone Cold Steve Austin, who {{had turned}} heel at WrestleMania and formed an {{alliance}} with McMahon when he helped Austin win the WWF Championship, took a change in character during this time. Instead of being a beer-drinking redneck, he was more emotional and tried to cheer-up Vince McMahon, who was clearly stressed {{from the threat of}} The Alliance, by doing something generous like giving Vince a cowboy hat as a present. On the July 12 episode of SmackDown!, Austin played [...] "Kumbaya" [...] and [...] "We Are the Champions" [...] for McMahon, to which Vince was unresponsive. Later that night, Vince McMahon came out and asked Austin to come to the ring, announcing him as the man that would lead Team WWF into the pay-per-view and into victory. Upon entering, Vince McMahon told Austin that he had changed quite a bit since WrestleMania, and when the WWF goes up against The Alliance at the upcoming pay-per-view, he did not need an Austin that gave him hugs and gifts and baked him cookies. He needed the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold who was a [...] "beer-swilling, foul-mouthed SOB" [...] and the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold that [...] "didn't take shit from anyone". He asked Austin to knock him down, even yelling to the crowd, [...] "If you want Stone Cold to beat <b>the</b> living <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Vince McMahon, give me a hell yeah!" [...] to which the crowd responded enthusiastically. Austin, however, shook his head and proceeded to leave the ring, turning his back on Vince McMahon. Later that night when Diamond Dallas Page and Shane McMahon went up against the Undertaker and Kurt Angle, many members of the Alliance interfered. Kane and Jericho came to help their team, but the Alliance's numbers were too many, and without Austin to back up his teammates, Team WWF was overwhelmed.|$|R

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song another [...] "syrupy-sweet" [...] ballad on the album and that it [...] "harbors over-the-top performances worthy of [...] "Star Search" [...] (more than fitting considering the film's '80s-era rags-to-riches storyline)".

2500|$|A {{theological}} {{argument over}} <b>the</b> Harrowing of <b>Hell</b> led to several attacks on Bilson personally {{in what is}} now called the Descensus controversy. Bilson's literal views on the descent of Christ into Hell were orthodox for [...] "conformist" [...] Anglicans of the time, while the Puritan wing of the church preferred a metaphorical or spiritual reading. He maintained that Christ went to hell, not to suffer, but to wrest <b>the</b> keys <b>of</b> <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Devil’s hands. For this doctrine he was severely handled by Henry Jacob and also by other Puritans. Hugh Broughton, a noted Hebraist, was excluded from the translators of the King James Bible, and became a vehement early critic. The origin of Broughton's published attack on Bilson as a scholar and theologian, from 1604, is thought to lie in a sermon Bilson gave in 1597, which Broughton, at first and wrongly, thought supported his own view that hell and paradise coincided in place. From another direction the Roman Catholic controversialist Richard Broughton also attacked Anglican conformists through Bilson's views, writing in 1607. Much feeling was excited by the controversy, and Queen Elizabeth, in her ire, commanded Bilson, [...] "neither to desert the doctrine, nor let the calling which he bore in the Church of God, be trampled under foot, by such unquiet refusers of truth and authority." ...|$|R

Caption reads: October 13, 1988, {{was a special}} day to remember {{in the life of}} Johnny Nichols. It was his 47 th birthday (born at St. Joseph’s in Houston in 1941), and the night he was inducted into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame! 	Now in his 21 st year as a successful attorney in Houston, John is a partner in the firm of Nichols & Cole and specializes in family law, personal injury law, and civil trial law. He got his law degree from UH Law School in 1967, and has been honored {{as one of the best}} family lawyers in the country by Best Lawyers in America, 1 st & 2 nd editions. He began his career as a trial lawyer with Fulbright & Jaworski before his partnership with Warren Cole. 	Our interest, however is his sports deeds while at Rice Owl gridder from 1959 through that memorable 1963 campaign in the Jess Neely era at Rice, with Joe Davis his line coach. A treasured memory of the time? Johnny loves to tell it. “Our TCE game at Forth Worth was delayed until a week after the regular season ended because of the Kennedy assassination. By then I’d been given a bunch of honors - - all-SWC guard, team co-captain, an invitation to the North-South all-star game, and the Rice MVP George Martin Award. Early on at TCU their center knocked <b>the</b> livin’ <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me on a fierce block. As I staggered off the field, ol’ Joe Davis grumbled to me ‘I guess that guy didn’t read all about you, did he?,’” Johnny recalls. Now, as he looks back, Nichols says how much it meant to him to play with teammates and under coaches of such ‘class’ status like Neely and his staff, and with guys like Robert Johnston (a Rhodes Scholar), the King brothers Rufus and Boyd, and so many more. As befitting a man who practices in family law, Johnny is proud of his supportive parents, Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Nichols (his father was an owner in the construction chemicals field before retiring) of Galena Park. His wife is the former Deena K. Counts, and they have four children in Robyn (21), a model; Jack (20, a student at UT Austin); John, Jr. (19, a student at UH) and Travis (16). Johnny showed his leadership early when he was grid co-captain and student council president before graduating from Galena Park High.

Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important.

5000|$|The {{account of}} Maudgalyāyana {{looking for his}} mother after her death is widespread. Apart from being used to {{illustrate}} the principles of karmic retribution and rebirth, in China, the story developed a new emphasis. There Maudgalyāyana was known as [...] "Mulian", and his story was taught {{in a mixture of}} religious instruction and entertainment, to remind people of their duties to deceased relatives. Its earliest version being the Sanskrit Ullambana Sutra, the story has been made popular in China, Japan, and Korea through edifying folktales such as the Chinese bianwen (for example, The Transformation Text on Mu-lien Saving His Mother from the Dark Regions). In most versions of the story, Maudgalyāyana uses his psychic powers to look for his deceased parents and see in what world they have been reborn. Although he can find his father in a heaven, he cannot find his mother and asks the Buddha for help. The Buddha brings him to his mother, who is located in a hell realm, but Maudgalyāyana cannot help her. The Buddha then advises him to make merits on his mother's behalf, which helps her to be reborn in a better place. In the Laotian version of the story, he travels to the world of Yama, the ruler of the underworld, only to find the world abandoned. Yama then tells Maudgalyāyana that he allows the denizens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> <b>hell</b> to be free for one day, that is, on the full moon day of the ninth lunar month. On this day, <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> beings can receive merit transferred and be liberated from hell, if such merit is transferred to them. In some other Chinese accounts, Maudgalyāyana finds his mother, reborn as a hungry ghost. When Maudgalyāyana tries to offer her food through an ancestral shrine, the food bursts into flames each time. Maudgalyāyana therefore asks the Buddha for advice, who recommends him to make merit to the Saṃgha and transfer it to his mother. The transfer not only helps his mother to be reborn in heaven, but {{can also be used to}} help seven generations of parents and ancestors. The offering was believed to be most effective when collectively done, which led to the arising of the ghost festival.|$|R

On Carter and Stark's relationship moving into the second season, Atwell said, [...] "there’s a new comfort level between Stark and Peggy ... they’re on a bit more of an even level. She respects him hugely, but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him ... he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his Dionysian ways, but when it comes to Peggy, he doesn’t see her as big boobs and red lips.

In most versions of the story, Maudgalyāyana uses his psychic powers to look for his deceased parents and see in what world they have been reborn. Although he can find his father in a heaven, he cannot find his mother and asks the Buddha for help. The Buddha brings him to his mother, who is located in a hell realm, but Maudgalyāyana cannot help her. The Buddha then advises him to make merits on his mother's behalf, which helps her to be reborn in a better place. In the Laotian version of the story, he travels to the world of Yama, the ruler of the underworld, only to find the world abandoned. Yama then tells Maudgalyāyana that he allows the denizens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> <b>hell</b> to be free for one day, that is, on the full moon day of the ninth lunar month. On this day, <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> beings can receive merit transferred and be liberated from hell, if such merit is transferred to them. In some other Chinese accounts, Maudgalyāyana finds his mother, reborn as a hungry ghost. When Maudgalyāyana tries to offer her food through an ancestral shrine, the food bursts into flames each time. Maudgalyāyana therefore asks the Buddha for advice, who recommends him to make merit to the Saṃgha and transfer it to his mother. The transfer not only helps his mother to be reborn in heaven, but {{can also be used to}} help seven generations of parents and ancestors. The offering was believed to be most effective when collectively done, which led to the arising of the ghost festival.|$|R
