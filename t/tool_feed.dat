50|$|The {{industrial}} applications of PHM are quite diverse {{in terms of}} industry, with examples found in manufacturing, automotive, heavy industry, aerospace, power generation, and transportation. With respect to manufacturing, there has been considerable work for rotating machinery, including PHM development and solutions for the machine tool industry. Examples include methods and software for monitoring spindle bearing health based on vibration and motor current, a cloud based monitoring architecture for relating tool wear health to part quality, and numerous works on monitoring the health condition of a machine <b>tool</b> <b>feed</b> axis. A low cost and practical method for monitoring the machine <b>tool</b> <b>feed</b> axis was demonstrated in a production environment, in which only controller signals were used to detect the early symptoms of pulley degradation prior {{two weeks before the}} pulley axis failed. For automotive manufacturing, there has recent developments on monitoring the health condition of industrial robots, using available controller signals such as motor current; this approach represents a practical approach for monitoring a fleet of industrial robots. Methods based on frequency analysis and classification algorithms for detecting the early symptoms of surge for air compressors have also been successfully demonstrated and implemented for an automotive manufacturing plant. Data mining and advanced analytical approaches have also been developed for continuous manufacturing production lines and semiconductor manufacturing applications. In terms of success in the manufacturing sector for PHM solutions, there is some economic numbers that can be reported. For example, the National Science Foundation funded in independent economic impacts study on Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) and surveyed 5 industrial members of the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems; the 5 companies (predominantly manufacturing applications) reported a savings of over $855 Million U.S dollars based on the successful implementation of the predictive monitoring and PHM solutions.|$|E

30|$|Raster path {{is usually}} adopted for the {{fabrication}} of square-shaped optics. During polishing with raster path, the <b>tool</b> <b>feeds</b> along {{a straight line}} and then translates to another parallel line. This process is repeated to cover the whole surface. The pitch between adjacent path lines is commonly set identical (i.e. uniform pitch) on the whole surface, and the feeding velocity along each path is instantaneously controlled based on the local removal [14]. It is obvious that for a uniform removal map of a certain removal amount, the smaller the path pitch, the larger the feeding velocity. However, if the desired feeding velocity {{is larger than the}} largest one allowed by the machine, the actual feeding velocity has to be changed to the largest one, which will introduce extra dwell time leading to material over-removal. As the <b>tool</b> <b>feeds</b> fast at lower region while slowly at higher region with the uniform pitch path, the smallest removal region (lowest region) will commonly bring with such over-removal. Since, the decreased pitch is propitious to restraint of MSF errors [15].

Hence, it is needed to develop an optimized tool path planning method which can solve this problem.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Previous {{researches}} [1, 2] on Fused Deposition through Electrochemical Discharge (FDED) process have re-vealed {{that the}} periodic instantaneous current wave form (ICWF) is the {{characteristic of the}} process and it is significant to maintain the nature of current waveform {{in order to have a}} deposition of consistent metallographic properties. The pre-cise control of process parameters is essential for maintain-ing the current wave form. The standoff distance between electrodes (SOD) is the most critical parameter amongst all. Karnik, Ghosh and Shekhar [1] have shown that the piling up of metal occurring at the impingement zone during the depo-sition reduces the SOD resulting in higher current and higher rate of metal dissolution from the copper wire anode (tool). The higher metal dissolution from the anode eventually in-creases the SOD, resulting in lowering of current, the termi-nation of discharge and reduction in deposition rate which leads to discontinuities in the deposition. The SOD, the depo-sition rate and current waveform could be maintained by con-trolling the instantaneous <b>tool</b> <b>feed</b> rate. In the present in-vestigations, the instantaneous <b>tool</b> <b>feed</b> rate has been con-trolled in response to the feed back value of the ICWF as it indicates pile-ups as well as the instantaneous phase of the process.
