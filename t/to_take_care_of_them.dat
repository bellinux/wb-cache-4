5|$|The {{issue of}} the double burden is {{exacerbated}} in Asian countries due to the large cultural norm of women doing care work held by both men and women. In many developed countries, women drop out of work when they have children {{in order to have}} more time <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Fairfax Court House action, the Confederate force {{killed at}} least four of the Union troops and wounded or took {{prisoner}} most of the others. The Confederates suffered a similar number of killed and wounded according to the only report on their casualties by a Union sergeant. Some of the badly wounded Union prisoners were paroled {{at the site of}} the battle along with a few men <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Finding the prisoners from the 11th New York Cavalry and from other Union units to be too much of a burden on the march north, Stuart paroled them at Brookeville, Maryland on the night of June 2829.|$|E
25|$|As empress, she is {{particularly}} responsible for Momijiyama Imperial Cocoonery, a sericulture farm {{on the grounds}} of the imperial palace. She participates in the annual ceremony of harvesting silk, personally feeds silkworms with blackberries and is responsible <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> the frames, and the harvesting. The production and harvesting of silk are part of her ceremonial duties, linked to Shintoism, Japanese culture, and tradition. Since 1994, the Empress offers a part of the harvested silk of the koishimaru variety (the oldest species now kept in Japan) to the Shōsōin Treasure-house in the Buddhist temple Tōdai-ji in Nara to be used for the restoration of its treasures.|$|E

500|$|It {{appears that}} many Romanis {{chose to stay}} in the Basque Country to escape {{persecution}} elsewhere in Europe. Nonetheless, even here they were not safe from persecution. For example, the Royal Council of Navarre in 1602 passed an edict to round up all [...] "vagabonds" [...] (meaning Romani), who were to be condemned to 6 years of galley duty. By the 18th century however attitudes had changed, and the emphasis shifted towards integration. In 17801781 the Courts of Navarre passed Law 23, which called for [...] "the authorities <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> find them locations for settlement and honest occupations and ways of living..." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{failing to}} cross a musical and {{colorful}} bridge, the gang falls into a pit where sticky material becomes their zombie-like doppelgangers and moves to chase them. They escape through a Super Mario World-like environment {{and go to the}} house of a toy dog, where they are set up for a trap to eat crumpets with sleeping powder. Mac does not eat the crumpets (since the sleeping powder was thought to be powdered sugar, and he can't eat sugar without temporarily losing his mind) and is able to save the others. As they try to escape, they discover that the heroic man and several others they have met on their journey are all controlled by a single face—World—who can animate and control seemingly anything he latches onto. World is trapped on an apple and the gang leaves it at a desert; but latches on a horse, truly the guise of Mac and the gang rides by, and World is able to move once more. It gallops off to the castle, where the gang find Frankie and attempt to save her. However, Frankie reveals that World never kidnapped her, she was staying of her own free will and is happy to be away from the work at Foster's and Mr. Herriman's constant nagging. The friends then plead with Frankie to come home insisting that they need her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> She believes their pleas to be selfish and storms off as she is [...] "sick of taking care of everyone and everything without never even receiving a word of thanks, an ounce of help, or a tiny little smidgen of respect". They attempt to console her, but World gasses them and they fall asleep. When they awaken, they find themselves in a fake version of Foster's created by World, who shrank them into it.|$|E

Pharmacists were given emergency authority to dispense prescriptions and provide access to dialysis machines.

2500|$|The {{rejection}} of the [...] "Force C" [...] plan had not reached many of the maquis leaders operating out in the countryside and after the news of D-Day, the maquis attempted to seize [...] "redoubts", most notably at the Vercors plateau. Eugène Chavant, the FFI chief in the Isère region ordered all maquis bands {{to concentrate on the}} Vercors plateau after hearing of D-Day. By 9 June 1944, some 3, 000 maquisards had heeded the call and 3 July 1944 the [...] "Free Republic of the Vercors" [...] was proclaimed. Through the Allies did try to fly in supplies to the [...] "redoubts" [...] and the marquis fought bravely, all these operations ended with the Resistance defeated. In the middle of June, the Wehrmacht had taken the village of Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte from the Maquis du Vercors, which severed the link between the Vercors plateau and Grenoble. To celebrate Bastille Day, the US Army Air Force sent in 360 B-17s to drop supplies of weapons to the maquisards on the Vercors plateau. However, the weapons the American dropped were all light weapons and Chavant sent a radio message to Algiers on night of 21 July 1944 asking for heavy weapons to air-dropped, called the leaders in Algiers criminals and cowards for not arranging more support, and ended with the line: [...] "That's what we are saying criminals and cowards". [...] In the Battle of the Vercors Plateau, the SS landed a glider company and the marquis suffered very heavy losses. Many of the [...] "German" [...] units fighting on the Vercors were Ostlegionen (Eastern Legions), Red Army POWs, mostly Russians and Ukrainians, who had joined the SS after being taken prisoner in 1942 or 1943. By this point the Germans had taken such heavy losses on the Eastern Front that they needed the manpower of the Ostlegionen to compensate. While the same Alpine division that taken the Glières plateau in March stormed up the Vercors plateau supported by a tank unit based in Lyon, the SS landed via glider. The maquis lost about 650 killed during the fighting on the Vercors plateau and afterwards, the Germans shot about 200 maquisards, mostly wounded who had been unable to escape together with the medical team that had stayed behind <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In the aftermath of the Battle of the Vercors, the local people were victims of massive reprisals which included numerous cases of looting, rape and extrajudicial executions.|$|E
