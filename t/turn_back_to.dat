5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it had to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held {{personally}} responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Phraates III {{was assassinated}} by his sons Orodes II of Parthia and Mithridates III of Parthia, after which Orodes turned on Mithridates, {{forcing him to}} flee from Media to Roman Syria. Aulus Gabinius, the Roman proconsul of Syria, marched in support of Mithridates to the Euphrates, but had to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> aid Ptolemy XII Auletes (r.80–58; 55–51BC) against a {{rebellion}} in Egypt. Despite losing his Roman support, Mithridates managed to conquer Babylonia, and minted coins at Seleucia until 54BC. In that year, Orodes' general, known only as Surena after his noble family's clan name, recaptured Seleucia, and Mithridates was executed.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the {{previous}} depression and Tropical Storm Alda, Tropical Disturbance D2 developed in the Mozambique Channel, initially subtropical in nature. On February20, a cold front exited the African coast off Mozambique, spawning an area of convection. A weak low pressure area developed on February23, which proceeded to move southeastward. Due to unfavorable wind shear, the system failed to organize much, although initially it produced strong wind gusts. On February28, much of the convection {{was removed from the}} circulation, which looped over southwestern Madagascar to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the west. On March4, when Tropical Storm Davina was named, the disturbance was renamed E1. The next day, the circulation executed a small loop, dissipating on March6 over eastern Mozambique.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 30 May 1798 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{between a}} small British squadron and a small French squadron {{off the coast of}} Normandy, France during the French Revolutionary Wars. A British blockadeing force, which had been conducting patrols in the region {{in the aftermath of the}} battle of St Marcou earlier in the month, encountered two French vessels attempting to sail unnoticed between Le Havre and Cherbourg. Closing with the French, the British commander Sir Francis Laforey sought to bring the French ships to battle as they attempted to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Le Havre before the British squadron could attack. The French were unable to escape, and Laforey's ship, the fifth rate , engaged the French corvette Confiante, while two smaller British ships chased the Vésuve.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} ridge {{caused the}} storm to slow and <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the west. After the formerly hostile shear relaxed, Bindu became a tropical cyclone again on January11, redeveloping an eye. On the next day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph), while the JTWC estimated maximum 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). By that time, the cyclone had {{turned back to}} the south-southwest. Drier air and wind shear resulted in weakening, and Bindu was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on January14. At 18:00UTC the next day, the storm passed about 140km (85mi) southeast of Rodrigues island, by which time the circulation was exposed north of the dwindling convection. The MFR downgraded Bindu to tropical depression status on January16. An approaching trough turned the system to the south on the next day, and Bindu became extratropical late on January17. The remnants turned sharply eastward due to a ridge, later looping back to the west on January20. Another trough turned the storm southward on January21 and absorbed the circulation the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{group was}} named Force F; the convoy and escorts from Britain {{as far as}} the rendezvous, became Force P; the aircraft carriers Victorious, Argus and escorts were named Force M on the voyage to the meeting point. The aircraft carrier Eagle and its escort from Gibraltar to the rendezvous became Force J and the carrier Indomitable and its escorts from Freetown were called Force K. During Operation Berserk, all the carriers and escorts became Force G; Force R was made up of the fleet refuelling vessels RFA Brown Ranger, RFA Dingledale, escorted by four corvettes and an ocean-going tug, RFA Abbeydale a Dale-class oiler; escorts were named Force W also for Operation Berserk, Force X formed the close escort to Malta, Force Z was made up of the heavy ships of Force F, that were to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Gibraltar and Force Y was to conduct Operation Ascendant, a run from Malta to Gibraltar by the two ships that had reached the island during Operation Harpoon and escorts, when Pedestal entered the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Rita was {{the most}} {{damaging}} typhoon to affect northern Japan since 1965. A tropical depression developed on August9, 1975 over the South China Sea. The depression initially meandered offshore Taiwan, but after turning west, it was upgraded into a tropical storm on August19, only to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the east. While growing considerably in size, Rita strengthened into a typhoon during the afternoon hours of the August21. Rita then accelerated to the north-northeast {{in response to a}} shortwave trough. Midday on August22, the typhoon reached its peak intensity, with winds of 145km/h (90 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 965mbar (28.5inHg). That evening, the typhoon weakened slightly before making landfall 55km (35mi) west of Osaka, with winds of 130km/h (80mph). Quickly crossing central and northern Honshu, Rita veered slightly northward before weakening into a tropical storm early on August23. On the next day, Rita merged with a cold front before transiting into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was evidence of an eye feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{subsequent}} few days, wind shear caused the convection to wax and wane over Eline's center, limiting the thunderstorms {{to the southern}} periphery. The track shifted more to the west-northwest. On February11, Eline had weakened into a minimal tropical storm according to the MFR, about 1110km (690mi) south of Diego Garcia, and the JTWC operationally downgraded it to a tropical depression. Later that day, however, a decrease in shear allowed thunderstorms to refire. On February13, a weakness in the ridge caused the storm to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the west-southwest. Moving back beneath an anticyclone, conditions became more favorable for strengthening, allowing outflow and a central dense overcast to form, with the beginnings of an eye feature. Eline quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm late on February13. At 00:00UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded Eline to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane with 1‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). The MFR held off upgrading the storm, due to a passing trough increasing wind shear again. On February14, Eline passed about 85km (55mi) south of St. Brandon, and shortly thereafter resumed its strengthening after the shear dropped. Later that day, the storm bypassed Mauritius about 180km (110mi) to the northwest, with the small structure sparing the island from the strongest winds. Early on February16, Eline attained tropical cyclone status, with 10‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), while passing about 160km (100mi) northwest of Réunion. This was nine days after it had weakened to tropical storm status the first time.|$|E

25|$|On 28 May 1971, a Modern Air CV-990A with 45 {{passengers}} on board en route from Berlin Tegel to Bulgaria was unexpectedly denied permission to enter Bulgarian airspace, {{as a result of}} a new policy adopted by that country's then communist government to deny any aircraft whose flight had originated or was going to terminate at a West Berlin airport the right to take off and land at any of its airports. This resulted in the aircraft having to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Berlin, where it landed safely at the city's Tegel Airport.|$|E
