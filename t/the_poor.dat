5|$|Parishes {{arose from}} Church of England divisions, and were {{originally}} purely ecclesiastical divisions. Over time they acquired civil administration powers. The Highways Act 1555 made parishes {{responsible for the}} upkeep of roads. Every adult inhabitant of the parish was obliged to work four days {{a year on the}} roads, providing their own tools, carts and horses; the work was overseen by an unpaid local appointee, the Surveyor of Highways. <b>The</b> <b>poor</b> were looked after by the monasteries, until their dissolution. In 1572, magistrates were given power to 'survey the poor' and impose taxes for their relief. This system was made more formal by <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law Act 1601, which made parishes responsible for administering <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law; overseers were appointed to charge a rate to support <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> of the parish. The 19th century saw an increase in the responsibility of parishes, although <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law powers were transferred to Poor Law Unions. The Public Health Act 1872 grouped parishes into Rural Sanitary Districts, based on <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law Unions; these subsequently formed the basis for Rural Districts. Parishes were run by vestries, meeting annually to appoint officials, and were generally identical to ecclesiastical parishes, although some townships in large parishes administered <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law themselves; under the Parishes Act 1882, all extra-parochial areas and townships that levied a separate rate became independent civil parishes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Poor</b> Law system {{fell into}} decline at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century owing to factors such as the introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms and the availability of other sources of assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as piecemeal reforms which bypassed <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law system. <b>The</b> <b>Poor</b> Law system was not formally abolished until the National Assistance Act 1948, with parts of the law remaining on the books until 1967.|$|E

5|$|Charles DeWitt Watts (September 21, 1917 – July 12, 2004) was an African American {{surgeon and}} activist for <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Watts {{was the first}} surgeon of African American ancestry in North Carolina.

He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons.

5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E
5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> in England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E
