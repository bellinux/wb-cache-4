5|$|Maccabi Tel Aviv have {{a record}} 23 cup titles, {{followed}} by Hapoel Tel Aviv, who have 15, including two unmatched runs of {{three in a row}} (1937 to 1939, and 2010 to 2012). The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the next most successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major Tel Aviv clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba are presently the only club with more than one final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three <b>times,</b> <b>every</b> time they have reached it. By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon Tel Aviv have yet to lift the trophy. The most decisive cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar Tel Aviv beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E
5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few <b>times</b> <b>every</b> year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E

25|$|Technological {{change is}} a {{combination}} of more and of better technology. A 2011 study in the journal Science showed that the peak of the rate of change of the world's capacity to compute information was in 1998, when the world's technological capacity to compute information on general-purpose computers grew at 88% per year. Since then, technological change clearly has slowed. In recent <b>times,</b> <b>every</b> new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 160% of the computations that possibly could have been executed by all existing general-purpose computers in the year before. This still is exponential, but shows the varying nature of technological change.|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, {{the second largest}} terrestrial {{eruption of}} the 20th century, affected the climate substantially, subsequently global temperatures decreased by about 0.5°C (0.9°F) {{for up to three}} years. Thus, the cooling over large parts of the Earth reduced surface temperatures in 1991–93, the equivalent to a reduction in net radiation of 4 watts per square meter. The Mount Tambora eruption in 1815 caused the Year Without a Summer. Much larger eruptions, known as large igneous provinces, occur only a few <b>times</b> <b>every</b> fifty – one hundred million years – through flood basalt, and caused in Earth past global warming and mass extinctions.|$|E

25|$|The Hebrew {{calendar}} is a lunisolar calendar, {{meaning that}} months {{are based on}} lunar months, but years are based on solar years. The calendar year features twelve lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty days, with an intercalary lunar month added periodically to synchronize the twelve lunar cycles with the longer solar year. (These extra months are added seven <b>times</b> <b>every</b> nineteen years. See Leap months, below.) The beginning of each Jewish lunar month {{is based on the}} appearance of the new moon. Although originally the new lunar crescent had to be observed and certified by witnesses, the moment of the true new moon is now approximated arithmetically as the molad, which is the mean new moon to a precision of one part.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of any}} {{keyboard}} {{may cause}} serious injury (that is, carpal tunnel syndrome or other repetitive strain injury) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks {{to get up and}} walk around a couple of <b>times</b> <b>every</b> hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.|$|E
