In order to simplify the control of moving head lanterns, instead of assigning channels manually to the lantern, many desks also offer a fixtures section, where one can assign the lantern as a fixture, allowing <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> organise the data being transferred to the lantern on a much simpler scale for the operator. Fixtures may also incorporate smoke machines, snow machines, haze machines etc., allowing many special effects to be run from a single desk.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the saddle}} chair {{is higher than}} a normal office chair, <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> has <b>to</b> be higher as well.
