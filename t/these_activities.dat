Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. <b>These</b> <b>activities</b> were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that <b>these</b> <b>activities</b> portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E

5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was aware of <b>these</b> <b>activities,</b> and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E
5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. <b>These</b> <b>activities</b> may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E

5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee <b>these</b> <b>activities,</b> and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of <b>these</b> <b>activities</b> for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E

5|$|Later, {{during the}} Ramesside period, statues of Old Kingdom pharaohs {{including}} one of Nyuserre Ini were placed in a cachette (a hiding place) in the temple of Ptah in Memphis, suggesting their continued use for cultic purposes until that point.

40|$|The re-emission in the cores of the Ca II H & K and Hα lines, {{are well}} known proxies of stellar <b>activity.</b> However, <b>these</b> <b>activity</b> indices probe {{different}} activity phenomena, the first being more sensitive to plage variation, while the other one being more sensitive to filaments. In this paper we study the long-term correlation between R'_HK and I_Hα, two indices based on the Ca II H & K and Hα lines respectively, for a sample of 271 FGK stars using measurements obtained over a ∼ 9 year time span. Because stellar activity {{is one of the}} main obstacles to the detection of low-mass and long-period planets, understanding further this activity index correlation can give us some hints about the optimal target to focus on, and ways to correct for <b>these</b> <b>activity</b> effects.

5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. <b>These</b> <b>activities</b> of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E
