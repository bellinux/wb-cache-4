50|$|In {{aviation}} terminology, a rejected <b>takeoff</b> (RTO) or aborted <b>takeoff</b> is {{the situation}} in which it is decided to abort the <b>takeoff</b> of an airplane. There can be many reasons for deciding to perform a rejected <b>takeoff,</b> but they are usually due to suspected or actual technical failures, like an engine failure such as a compressor stall occurring during the <b>takeoff</b> run.|$|R
5|$|By the 1970s {{the airport}} was again {{in need of}} {{expansion}} and modernization. In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed passenger capacity. This plan included {{the building of a}} new terminal and a new parallel runway across Donelson Pike to handle increasing operations by reducing the time between consecutive <b>takeoffs</b> and landings.|$|E
5|$|Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer was the top-scoring night {{fighter pilot}} of World War II. He was {{credited}} with 121 aerial victories claimed in just 164 combat missions. His victory total includes 114 RAF four-engine bombers; arguably accounting for more RAF casualties than any other Luftwaffe fighter pilot and becoming the third highest Luftwaffe claimant against the Western Allied Air Forces. His flight book indicated 2,300 <b>takeoffs</b> and 1,133 flying hours.|$|E
5|$|Present weather, which present {{restrictions}} to visibility or {{presence of}} thunder or squalls, {{are reported in}} observations to indicate to aviation any possible threats during landings and <b>takeoffs</b> from airports.

40|$|The authors {{study the}} <b>takeoff</b> of 16 new {{products}} across 31 countries (430 categories) to analyze {{how and why}} <b>takeoff</b> varies across products and countries. They test the effect of 12 hypothesized drivers of <b>takeoff</b> using a parametric hazard model. The authors find that the average time to <b>takeoff</b> varies substantially between developed and developing countries, between work and fun products, across cultural clusters, and over calendar time. Products take off fastest in Japan and Norway, followed by other Nordic countries, the United States, and some countries of Midwestern Europe. <b>Takeoff</b> is driven by culture and wealth plus product class, product vintage, and prior <b>takeoff.</b> Most importantly, time to <b>takeoff</b> is shortening over time and <b>takeoff</b> is converging across countries.

50|$|The power sprint <b>takeoff,</b> or {{bounding}} <b>takeoff,</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} common elite styles. Very similar to the sprint style, the body resembles a sprinter in full stride. However, there is one major difference. The arm that pushes back on <b>takeoff</b> (the arm on the side of the <b>takeoff</b> leg) fully extends backward, rather than remaining at a bent position. This additional extension increases the impulse at <b>takeoff.</b>|$|R
5|$|The 2010 trial {{involving}} Continental Airlines {{over the}} crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during <b>takeoffs,</b> including a near-crash at Dulles Airport on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane's fuel tank and damaged the port-side engine, electrical cables, {{with the loss of}} two of the craft's hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the {{operations}} of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded {{on the development of the}} steam catapult, arresting gear, optical and radio landing systems. The pilots were trained at a new establishment in Crimea, named NITKA, for Aviation Research and Training Complex. In 1981, the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143.5 carriers, which also included cancelling the fifth Project 1143 carrier and the Varyag. A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where <b>takeoffs</b> would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers. Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (−3, −24 and −25), along with an Su-27UB, were used for <b>takeoffs</b> from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a ski-jump profile.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 960 sorties {{had been made}} during the trials, {{including}} 1,366 <b>takeoffs</b> and landings, {{by the end of}} evaluations in November 1965. One aircraft was destroyed in an accident and six others were transferred to the United States, assigned the US designation XV-6A Kestrel, and underwent further testing. The two remaining British-based Kestrels were assigned to further trials and experimentation at RAE Bedford with one being modified to use the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.|$|E

5|$|Both {{models were}} plagued from the onset by inefficient engines, but {{were capable of}} the short-distance <b>takeoffs</b> {{required}} by the Swiss (330meters for the P–16, 232meters for the N-20). After wind tunnel and engine tests, but before the N–20 could make its maiden flight, Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt cancelled the N-20project in 1953, leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued. Eventually, neither of the aircraft came into production, although {{the wings of the}} P-16 were later used {{in the development of the}} successful Learjet.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, 19 hijackers took control of four {{commercial}} airliners (two Boeing 757 and two Boeing 767) en route to California (three headed to LAX in Los Angeles, and one to SFO in San Francisco) after <b>takeoffs</b> from Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts; Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey; and Washington Dulles International Airport in Loudoun and Fairfax counties in Virginia. Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be heavily fueled.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical <b>takeoffs</b> and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E

40|$|The kinematics, {{temporal}} and sequential {{organization of the}} lower limb joints were assessed during jump downs at a constant height (45 cm) in seven practised subjects under four conditions: (SS) stiff <b>takeoff</b> and landing, (SC) stiff <b>takeoff</b> and compliant landing, (CS) compliant <b>takeoff</b> and stiff landing, and (CC) compliant <b>takeoff</b> and landing surfaces. The timing and sequencing of joint motions were unaffected by the compliance of the <b>takeoff</b> or landing surfaces. During <b>takeoff</b> ankle adjustments may {{have been influenced by}} proprioceptive inputs about the <b>takeoff</b> surface compliance, whereas knee adjustments could mean that the landing program interferes with the <b>takeoff.</b> Adjustments prior to, at, and post landing depended on the landing surface compliance and suggest that different strategies might have been employed to control joint motions.

5|$|On November 19, 2008, {{the police}} {{investigation}} was completed using 13,600 pages, which took 16 months {{of research to}} be produced, during which 336 people were heard. For federal prosecutors, {{the former director of}} ANAC Denise Abreu and then flight safety officer of the company, Marco Aurelio dos Santos de Miranda, should be convicted of attempt on air transport security in willful mode. In March 2006, Denise Abreu took over the management of air services of the newly established National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The investigation of the accident with the Airbus TAM, which killed 199 people in Congonhas, revealed that in February 2007, the São Paulo federal judge Cecilia Marcondes, who saw action restricting the landing planes in Congonhas on rainy days, received Denise Abreu one of ANAC document like a standard, but it was only a technical study. According to the complaint, the study presented as standard guarantee, in theory, security in landing operations at Congonhas airport in São Paulo. The study indicated that <b>takeoffs</b> and landings were forbidden in Congonhas case the track was with a water depth greater than 3mm. After the accident with the plane of TAM in July 2007 it revealed that the study was not a standard and thus there was no obligation to follow it. According to the testimony of federal judge Cecilia Marcondes to the Federal Public Ministry, the document was fundamental to the Federal Court to release the runway for <b>takeoffs</b> and landings of all equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{parliament}} first authorized approximately 871million Swiss francs {{to build}} 100Mirage IIIS under license. But this procurement was soon crushed under massive budget overruns {{and the government}} asked for an additional CHF 576million. The cost overruns {{were the result of}} fitting U.S. electronics to the French platform, installing hardpoints for moving the aircraft inside of the caverns by cranes, structural reinforcements for jet-assisted <b>takeoffs,</b> and other extras to improve the off-the-shelf Mirage IIIC. The wish to procure the Mirage IIIS was also boosted by the possibility that the Swiss could acquire aircraft-delivered nuclear weapons, either from France or by producing them themselves.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required <b>takeoffs</b> and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E
5|$|Responding to {{requests}} from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range {{version of the}} 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} <b>takeoffs</b> and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body {{twin-engine}} jet airliner {{that was}} designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow <b>takeoffs</b> from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet, the 767, and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common type rating {{that allows them to}} operate both aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The {{responses}} {{of people to}} special noise characteristics associated with short <b>takeoff</b> aircraft are discussed. The findings of studies which have yielded data that may be pertinent to community acceptance of short <b>takeoff</b> aircraft noise are presented. A three step program to evaluate public acceptance of short <b>takeoff</b> aircraft noise was conducted.

40|$|Advanced <b>takeoff</b> {{procedures}} were developed for a Mach 2. 62 high-speed civil transport configuration (HSCT) equipped with turbine bypass engines, {{with the goal}} of reducing the <b>takeoff</b> noise levels for certification to FAR 36, Stage 3 noise levels. The detailed <b>takeoff</b> and landing module for the Flight Optimizations System (FLOPS) computer program was used to generate <b>takeoff</b> profiles. All <b>takeoff</b> {{procedures were}} constrained to meet a FAR <b>takeoff</b> field length of 11, 000 feet, as well as the minimum required engine-out climb gradients for each airbome segment. Aircraft noise levels at the FAR 36 certification points were calculated using the Aircraft Noise Prediction Program (ANOPP). The study showed that using advanced <b>takeoff</b> procedures in noise certification could result in a 2. 25 dB reduction in the amount of noise suppression required to certify this configuration for Stage 3 noise limits. Advanced procedures also resulted in an 8 percent reduction in the 100 EPNdB noise footprint area compared to basic FAR 36 <b>takeoff</b> procedures. In addition, improvements in the lift-to-drag ratio using high-lift devices were shown to produce 1. 81 dB more noise reduction when used in combination with advanced <b>takeoff</b> procedures...|$|R
