5|$|Dame Primus– The {{embodiment}} of the Will, who consists in Sir Thursday of the First, Second, and Third parts of the Will. She is portrayed as caring little for others, becoming easily annoyed if <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> slowing the process of restoring the House.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E

5|$|The writer Ratazyayev, who {{jokes about}} using Devushkin as a {{character}} {{in one of his}} stories offends him, but genuinely seems to like him. Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money.|$|E
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Caucasoid types with light-colored hair.|$|E
25|$|They {{have not}} been charged, and <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prisoners of conscience.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fanning {{their own}} passions, adding {{fuel to the}} flames of their insensate wrath.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're very happy!" [...] said Mrs. Thornbury, looking benignantly after them. Rachel agreed; <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{so certain}} of themselves; <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{know exactly what}} they wanted.|$|R
60|$|I {{was rather}} {{at a loss}} for an answer. Lorenzo's eyes were fixed keenly upon me; <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trying <b>to</b> read my brain.|$|R
25|$|No Little People: Argues that Christians {{should never}} despair {{of having a}} {{significant}} life of realizations, small as <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
25|$|These have {{generally}} been joined together as if parts of the same work; but <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distinct poems, the first, called Phenomena ("Appearances"), consists of 732 verses; the second, Diosemeia ("On Weather Signs"), of 422 verses.|$|E
25|$|Boba's grades {{gradually}} begin improving while Ema starts seeing Terminator regularly as <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in {{the beginning}} stages of an affair. Giga who doesn't suspect much yet starts getting close to his secretary Dara and ends up sleeping with her one day.|$|E

25|$|To give {{compiler}} vendors greater freedom, the C++ {{standards committee}} {{decided not to}} dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation-specific features. The downside of this decision is that object code produced by different compilers {{is expected to be}} incompatible. There were, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems (for example C++ ABI), though <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> largely abandoned now.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} {{that it may be}} related to Cirroteuthis, and in that case the two posterior stumps, looking like arms, may be the remains of the lateral fins, for they seem too far back for the arms, unless pulled out of position. On the other hand, <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too far forward for fins. So that they are probably arms twisted out of their true position.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{there is}} the {{question}} of the last three poems that were found among her papers. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in her handwriting, which is why Killigrew’s father added them to her book. The poems are about the despair the author has for another woman, and could possibly be autobiographical if they are in fact by Killigrew. Some of her other poems are about failed friendships, possibly with Anne Finch, so this assumption may have some validity.|$|E
50|$|An after-action report {{written by}} Captain Wilder {{observed}} that the Italians were;...waiting for us, but <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very panicky and their fire was very wild.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{from the}} muffled {{plunging}} and tinkling that followed, <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{moving in the}} direction where the light had appeared. Then there was a pause.|$|R
60|$|Leaning {{upon the}} {{shattered}} taff-rail <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conversing together as quietly and unconcernedly {{as though they}} were unconscious of the deadly peril which surrounded them.|$|R
25|$|Mermaids- Stubborn, yet {{loyal and}} true to their word, mermaids have amazing voices that can hypnotize giants and humans. They {{are not easy}} to strike a deal with, as they {{frequently}} want something in return and usually take people as hostages to ensure the deal is kept. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do some magic as well, as they owned a cap able to make humans breathe underwater (similarly to the caps worn by merfolk in faery tales to walk on the shore).|$|E
25|$|The {{order is}} divided into three suborders, Tyranni (suboscines), Passeri (oscines), and the basal Acanthisitti. Oscines have the best control of their syrinx muscles among birds, {{producing}} a wide range of songs and other vocalizations (though some of them, such as the crows, do not sound musical to human beings); some such as the lyrebird are accomplished imitators. The acanthisittids or New Zealand wrens are tiny birds restricted to New Zealand, at least in modern times; they were long placed in Passeri; their taxonomic position is uncertain, although <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a distinct and very ancient group.|$|E
25|$|There {{is usually}} a hum of {{expectancy}} when Holmes and Sutcliffe appear, their faces wreathed in smiles, and chatting happily together. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sharing some all-absorbing joke. Holmes, proudly wearing his Yorkshire cap, walks with quick, short steps, shoulders erect and head in the air, {{doing his best to}} look as tall as (John) Tunnicliffe. Sutcliffe has dark, glossy hair and usually disdains the valued White Rose cap when batting. He strolls casually along by the side of Percy, keeping his weather eye open for the wicket-keeper's end and the honour of taking the first ball.|$|E
60|$|Rob {{stood up}} {{and waited for the}} strangers <b>to</b> draw near. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fishermen, and were much {{surprised}} at finding three people asleep upon the bluff.|$|R

60|$|He skated on, {{allowing}} {{the girl to}} rest on his arm as he did so. Soon <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out of the danger zone, and then he looked back.|$|R
25|$|Eric: Eric {{is portrayed}} as a {{diminutive}} teenager with visible Irish ancestry that influences his first story. As he has only had two stories in the first season before his character was cut, there is no visible theme in his storytelling but <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about incredibly powerful evil forces (ones never proved innocent or misunderstood like some others). In his short run on the show, Eric was shown to be rather snide and negative, spending {{most of the time}} making sarcastic remarks and antagonizing the other members, especially Frank. He is the only character to leave the show without any explanation for his departure.|$|E
25|$|According to Silva Lake, textual critic, {{the text}} of the codex is a {{somewhat}} dilute form of family Π, with a large number of peculiar readings, most of which are either misspellings or careless and ignorant mistakes. An educated scribe could hardly have produced the variants in Mark 4:1; 6:26; 9:4; 13:3; 14:38; 16:4. The readings which it does not share with other representatives of Family Π are supported outside that family and <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> connected with the late Alexandrian group (C, L, M, N, Δ), but the number of the Alexandrian readings is not high and according to Silva they are rather result of accident than influence of a foreign text-type.|$|E
25|$|That night, {{the family}} stays {{at a hotel}} where they {{try to come up}} with a plan and Jules shows Sandspur to his girlfriend, Cindy. Based on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Nick thinks about the {{possibility}} of asking the merfolk to lure the giants to the sea, since <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hypnotized by a nixie's singing. The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea if the kids bring them a fish that has never been in their sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Grocery {{shopping}} Monday meant {{standing in}} long lines and waiting ... Shoppers came in families. Sometimes {{there were six}} adults in a car. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shopping more from compulsion than need.|$|R
60|$|There's {{just one}} bit more. After {{dinner that night}} I came up for a smoke, and, strolling on to the foredeck, almost bumped into George and Stella. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> having an argument.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{have you}} seen them?" [...] exclaimed Dora. [...] "I have, {{but only for a}} minute at the station, and then I didn't know who they were, though I <b>was</b> told afterward. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very nice." ...|$|R
