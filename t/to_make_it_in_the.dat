25|$|Ever ambitious, {{the band}} now tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. They brought in Jim Slye to become their manager. He later sold their {{publishing}} rights to William McBurney for £4,000. In 1977 they produced Aliens, {{about the experience}} of the Irish in nineteenth-century America, which included very little folk music. They toured Britain, Germany, Canada and the United States. The night they played the Albert Hall in London was described by one critic as the loudest gig there since Hendrix. The Man Who Built America (1978), produced by Steve Katz of Blood, Sweat and Tears and Blues Project fame, concerned Irish emigration to the USA and was commercially their most successful album. The heavier sound did bring some acceptance in America but they lost their folk base and their freshness. Short Stories, Tall Tales (1979) was their last studio album and was panned by the record company and critics alike.|$|E

500|$|Kove {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had dreamed of being an artist, and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art world. However, he stood {{at the top of the}} stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E

Jude Adam of Third Way magazine gave the song a positive review, considering it as [...] "quirky, sunny, and sweet in perfect measures." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song as [...] "actually catchy". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that Madonna divulges in the song that not everyone who wants <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movies succeeds. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice commented that in the song, [...] "Madonna channels a generic teen-pop chanteuse". Dennis Ferrera from Out, while interviewing Madonna for her 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor, described the song as a [...] "killer single". Another positive review by J. J. Evans from Naperville Sun described [...] "Hollywood" [...] as a track which best exemplifies Madonna's [...] "silly way of writing" [...] but felt that it worked in this case. Chris Heath from Yahoo! Music commented that [...] "'Hollywood' breaks free of its inferior siblings to strike out as a sexy sliver of dance pop that's as good as anything on Music".|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Columbus severed {{their ties}} with Filatov, trading {{him to the}} Ottawa Senators in {{exchange}} for a third-round pick. Filatov left his family vacationing in the Dominican Republic and joined the Senators for their development camp at Scotiabank Place in Ottawa. He made the Senators out of training camp, but was a healthy scratch several times, splitting his time with Ottawa and the Binghamton Senators of the AHL. In November 2011, the Ottawa Citizens Allen Panzeri reported from sources in Columbus that Filatov had refused to play the style the Blue Jackets asked of him, saying to his coach, [...] "Filly [...] don't do rebounds." [...] In December, the Senators offered Filatov the choice to play {{the rest of the season}} with CSKA Moscow of the KHL and Filatov agreed. Senators General Manager Bryan Murray suggested it was better for his development as Murray felt that Filatov needed to work on becoming stronger and compete harder <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHL. Head Coach Paul MacLean felt Filatov's struggles in the NHL were surprising, considering he had 12 points in 15 games in the AHL. Filatov himself stated that he had to get better. MacLean had hoped that Filatov would have stayed and worked on his game in Binghamton, but Murray explained that it was more lucrative for Filatov to play in the KHL than at Binghamton, and did not block the transfer. Filatov did not immediately agree to terms with CSKA. For a few days it appeared that Filatov would not sign a contract with CSKA, so the Senators assigned him to Binghamton and threatened to suspend him in order to remove him from the Senators' salary cap. On December 18, 2011, Filatov agreed to a contract with CSKA Moscow.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} this time Kim Hansen became Herodes Falsk. According to his autobiography, when reading a short {{newspaper}} story about Frosk in 1972, {{he realized that the}} band and its members were [...] "too average", looking like regular long-haired boys with ordinary names, and that an image change was needed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music industry. Thus, Terje Jensen began using the stage name Jonas Fjeld, a name he still uses today. Hansen became Herodes Falsk, and the other bandmembers also picked eccentric stage names. Also, the band itself changed its name to Jonas Fjeld Rock n' Rolf Band, and the bandmembers began wearing outrageous outfits on stage. In line with this new image, Falsk would begin joining the band on stage, even though he did not sing or play any instruments, usually dancing around on stage, telling jokes or reading dirty poetry in-between songs as well as various other crazy antics.|$|E
