"Look at {{simplicity}} and hold fast to 樸 naturalness."; [...] "To <b>look</b> <b>at</b> simplicity corresponds <b>to</b> holding fast to {{simplicity and}} keeping to truth {{as well as}} <b>to</b> not <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> externals. <b>To</b> hold fast to 朴 naturalness corresponds <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> real naturalness {{in order to show}} it to the subjects.

5|$|In {{analysing}} {{systems such}} as urban and national parks, dams, farms and gardens, theme parks, open-pit mines, water catchments, one way <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events.|$|E
5|$|The oldest form of {{astronomy}}, optical or visible-light astronomy {{extends from}} approximately 400 to 700 nm. Positioning an optical telescope in space {{means that the}} telescope does not see any atmospheric effects (see astronomical seeing), providing higher resolution images.

50|$|Historically {{voyeurism}} {{has been}} treated {{in a variety of}} ways. Psychoanalytic, group psychotherapy and shock aversion approaches have all been attempted with limited success. There is some evidence that shows that pornography {{can be used as a}} form of treatment for voyeurism. This is based on the idea that countries with pornography censorship have high amounts of voyeurism. Additionally shifting voyeurs from voyeuristic behavior, <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> graphic pornography, <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the nudes in Playboy has been successfully used as a treatment. These studies show that pornography can be used as a means of satisfying voyeuristic desires without breaking the law.|$|R

5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language.

5|$|Akins {{began playing}} high school {{football}} at Starkville High School as a freshman. Due to his small size, Akins rarely played. As a senior, he was ruled ineligible for academic reasons but continued practicing with the football team throughout the season. Akins was also able to participate on the track and field team, running sprints. After Akins impressed his {{high school football}} coach by practicing despite his ineligibility, the coach invited East Mississippi Community College <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Akins. A representative of East Mississippi attended a track and field meet where Akins won the 100 metres and offered him a scholarship to play college football shortly afterward.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} the use of Fleiss' kappa may be the following: Consider {{fourteen}} psychiatrists are asked <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> ten patients. Each psychiatrist gives one of possibly five diagnoses to each patient. These are compiled into a matrix, and Fleiss' kappa can be computed from this matrix (see example below) to show the degree of agreement between the psychiatrists above the level of agreement expected by chance.|$|E
5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal {{was presented to the}} Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E

The book goes on <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the activities of the}} IDSO from the end of 1954 until the operation was closed down in April 1957, when its job was complete. Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of De Beers, Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that £10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika.|$|E

5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{it may not}} be {{a logical}} deduction, but to my {{imagination}} it is far more satisfactory <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, —ants making slaves, —the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, —not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.|$|E
