25|$|On July 6, 1964, {{one of the}} two {{registration}} {{days that}} month, John Lewis led 50 black citizens to the courthouse, but County Sheriff Jim Clark arrested them all rather than allowing them to apply to vote. On July 9, 1964 Judge James Hare issued an injunction forbidding any gathering of three or more people under the sponsorship of civil rights organizations or leaders. This injunction made it illegal for more than two people at a <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> civil rights or voter registration in Selma, suppressing public civil rights activity there for the next six months.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{likened the}} episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded [...] "vaguely and less {{successfully}} on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "the new Seinfeld wannabe, {{but it will}} never be as funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed.|$|E

Her spouse {{is a native of}} India. His son Woo-hyun was born in 1974 in India. He {{received}} an MBA from Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles, and works for an investment firm in New York. His younger daughter, Hyun-hee (born 1976), is a field officer for UNICEF in Nairobi. After his election as Secretary-General, Ban became an icon in his hometown, where his extended family still resides. Over 50,000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration of the result. In the months following his election, thousands of practitioners of geomancy went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person. Ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group and has declined to expound his beliefs: [...] "Now, as Secretary-General, it will not be appropriate at this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> my own belief in any particular religion or god. So maybe we will have some other <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> personal matters." [...] His mother is Buddhist.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{psycholinguistics}} {{was coined}} in 1936 by Jacob Robert Kantor {{in his book}} An Objective Psychology of Grammar and started being used among his team at Indiana University, but its use finally became frequent thanks to the 1946 article [...] "Language and psycholinguistics: a review," [...] by his student Nicholas Henry Pronko. It {{was used for the}} first <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> an interdisciplinary science [...] "that could be coherent" [...] {{as well as in the}} title of Psycholinguistics: A Survey of Theory and Research Problems, a 1954 book by Charles E.

40|$|The U. S. {{criminal}} justice system has undergone radical changes in the past generation. Crime is more complex; prosecutors are more powerful; and courts, corrections agencies, and defense services are burdened with larger case loads and tighter budgets.

5000|$|The {{production}} was filmed in Seattle.

[...] The production received attention when it was discovered that Bill Foulon, an escaped convict from the Oregon State Penitentiary, had managed to secure work as an extra on the film, and later (while still on the run) called the Los Angeles <b>Times</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his experience.|$|R
