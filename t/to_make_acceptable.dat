METHOD: We conducted interviews with 20 patients attending a pain management programme; prior to attending the programme, immediately following the programme and at one year. Our analysis focused on a theoretical sample of patients who either described dramatic life improvements at one year, and who described themselves as much worse. We used the methods of grounded theory. RESULTS: We found that finding hope was central to good outcome. Patients restored hope by making certain changes; (a) deconstructing specific fears, (b) constructing an acceptable explanatory model (c) reconstructing self identity by making acceptable changes. Those who had not restored hope retained fears of loss of self, remained committed to the biomedical model and were unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>acceptable</b> changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may help to operationalise the restoration of hope in patients with PLBP. Firstly, health care professionals need to identify and resolve any specific fears of movement.

At least three distinct policy paradigms have at different times been regarded as best practice for responding to water insecurity throughout the world. Yet, while the water management literature {{points to the need}} for a paradigm shift toward improved governance approaches, there has been little critical examination of whether the assumptions implicit within these theoretical paradigms are applicable to SIDS contexts. This study reviews the water management, governance, and island studies literatures to identify {{the ways in which the}} unique historical, geographical, and economic contexts of SIDS limit or enable the applicability of these paradigms. The analysis shows that each paradigm has a different underlying conceptualization of governance, and how institutions can regulate socialâ€“ecological relations for achieving water security. The conceptualizations of governance under the adaptive management paradigm seem to most closely reflect the complexity of governance in SIDS, and may therefore hold the most potential for addressing water insecurity. However, the analysis also highlights the need for further research to test the application of adaptive management in a way that can also cater for the unique socio-political relations that affect the outcomes of governance in SIDS...|$|E

Therefore the computations become harder and harder {{if we try to}} simulate very large systems. But the worth of our model can be measure even with the complexity of the system, it can deal with, hence we really should improve it to get real results. One solution is, that we should revise our strategy, and instead of calculating parameters directly, we should introduce an extra step: instead of a step, that has formed a unit so far, use two. It is not really easy, because we must change our approach, but in some cases this may worth while. The model, I studied, calculates QoS parameters by the help of the Markov Reward Model theory.

Although {{there are a few}} appraisal methods that consider negative long-term influences on forest regeneration, hitherto no approach has addressed the financial consequences of lost admixed tree species. A homogenised species composition may lead to an increased financial risk of a forest. Based on financial return and risk ratios of mixed forests, this paper derives the financial compensation that would be necessary <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>acceptable</b> the increased risk of pure forest for forest owners. In this conceptual case study we consider a two-species mixed forest (Norway spruce, Picea abies [L. ] Karst. and European beech, Fagus sylvatica L.) and calculate a tree species composition with maximum financial return per unit of risk. The financial indicators were generated via 1000 Monte Carlo scenarios, which consider natural hazard risks as well as timber price fluctuations. In case of an assumed reduction of European beech in different mixed forests by 30 percentage points, a compensation rate for ungulate browsing of between 16 and 23 [euro] ha-Ã‚Â  1 Ã‚Â yr-Ã‚Â  1 was estimated. Compared to the annual gains of mixed-forest between 89 and 113 [euro] ha-Ã‚Â  1 Ã‚Â yr-Ã‚Â  1 for admixtures of beech between 70 and 30 percent, we consider this amount substantial and conclude that the appraisal of game browsing effects should include the changed risk profiles between homogenised and mixed forests.

40|$|Background: In Sri Lanka, {{motherhood}} within {{marriage is}} highly valued. Sex {{out of wedlock}} is socially unacceptable and can create serious public health problems such as illegal abortions, suicide and infanticide, and single motherhood {{as a result of}} premarital sex is considered shameful. The way unmarried women facing single motherhood reflect on and make use of their agency in their social environments characterised by limited social and financial support has consequences for {{the health and well-being of}} both themselves and their children. The aim of this study was to explore and describe how unmarried women facing single motherhood in Sri Lanka handle their situation. Methods: This qualitative study comprised semi-structured interviews with 28 unmarried pregnant women or single mothers. The data were analysed by qualitative content analysis and the results related to the conceptual framework of social navigation. Results: The women facing single motherhood expressed awareness of having trespassed norms of sexuality through self-blame, victimhood and obedience, and by considering or attempting suicide. They demonstrated willingness to take responsibility for becoming pregnant before marriage by giving the child up for adoption, bringing up the child themselves, claiming a father for their child, refraining from marriage in the future, permanently leave their home environment, and taking up employment. Throughout the interviews, the women expressed fear of shame, and striving for familial and societal acceptance and financial survival. Conclusions: A social environment highly condemning of unmarried motherhood hindered these women from making strategic choices on how to handle their situation. However, to achieve acceptance and survival, the women tactically navigated norms of femininity, strong family dependence, a limited work market, and different sources of support. Limited access to resources restricted the women's sexual and reproductive health and rights, including their ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>acceptable</b> and healthy choices for themselves and their children...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMembrane {{separation}} processes {{have become}} a basic unit operation for process design and product development. These processes are used {{in a variety of}} separation and concentration steps, but in all cases, the membranes must be cleaned regularly to remove both organic and inorganic material deposited on the surface and/or into the membrane bulk. Cleaning/disinfection is a vital step in maintaining the permeability and selectivity of the membrane {{in order to get the}} plant to its original capacity, to minimize risks of bacteriological contamination, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>acceptable</b> products. For this purpose, a large number of chemical cleaning/disinfection agents are commercially available. In general, these cleaning/disinfection agents have to improve the membrane flux to a certain extent. However, they can also cause irreversible damages in membrane properties and performances over the long term. Until now, there is considerably less literature dedicated to membrane ageing than to cleaning/disinfection. The knowledge in cleaning/disinfection efficiency has recently been improved. But in order to develop optimized cleaning/disinfection protocols there still remains a challenge to better understand membrane ageing. In order to compensate for the lack of correlated cleaning/disinfection and ageing data from the literature, this paper investigates cleaning/disinfection efficiencies and ageing damages of organic ultrafiltration membranes. The final aim is to provide less detrimental cleaning/disinfection procedures and to propose some guidelines which should have been taken into consideration in term of membrane ageing studies. To carry out this study, this article will detail the background of cleaning/disinfection and aging membrane topics in a first introductive part. In a second part, key factors and endpoints of cleaning/disinfection and aging membranes will be discussed deeply: the membrane role and the cleaning parameters roles, such as water quality, storing conditions, cleaning/disinfection/aging agents/conditions/protocols. The third and last part will be developed the parameters, methods and ways of characterization at our disposal and commonly used to develop and implement membrane cleaning and/or ageing studies...|$|E

Conceptual models were developed using field data, estimates of hydraulic and transport properties, and assumptions regarding the types of processes occurring in the field plot. Using the field data and numerical models in an iterative approach revealed that adjustments to the parameterization of the conceptual models were necessary to allow for acceptable predictions of flow and transport. In addition, the numerical models delineated where the conceptual models needed adjustment and indicated where further analysis of the field data was necessary. Specifically, {{in regards to the}} unsaturated water flow, it was found that: (1) without increasing the laboratory determined value of Ks tenfold, it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>acceptable</b> predictions for the infiltration experiments; (2) the laboratory-derived hydraulic properties provided a superior first approximation to texturally based hydraulic properties taken from an internal database; (3) incorporation of hysteresis into the soil hydraulic functions resulted in predictions of the water contents through time and soil water content profiles that were marginally better than not incorporating hysteresis; and (4) based on the mean square errors of the predictions and a post-audit based on the adjusted hydraulic properties, the use of a homogeneous soil profile was supported. In regard to the unsaturated solute transport, it was found that: (1) inversion techniques to estimate the unsaturated transport properties at each location (local approach) yielded the best results with respect to the fit of the data compared to the techniques which fit data from all depths simultaneously (global approach); (2) predictions using unsaturated transport properties averaged from the global approach yielded the best results compared to the average local approach properties; (3) incorporating hysteresis had little effect on the predicted bromide breakthrough curves and concentration profiles, yielding only marginally better results than predictions from models with no hysteresis; (4) it was impossible to accurately predict the breakthrough of bromide at depths deeper than 200 cm without using a retardation factor less then one...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Viticulture and Oenology. Wine Biotechnology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Although bananas {{are widely}} grown {{worldwide}} in many tropical {{and a few}} subtropical countries, banana beverages are still among the fruit beverages processed by use of rudimentary methods {{such as the use}} of feet or/and spear grass to extract juice. Because banana juice and beer remained on a home made basis, there is a research drive to come up with modern technologies to more effectively process bananas and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>acceptable</b> banana juices and wines. One of the main hindrances in the production of highly desirable beverages is the pectinaceous nature of the banana fruit, which makes juice extraction and clarification very difficult. Commercial enzyme applications seem to be the major way forward in solving processing problems in order to improve banana juice and wine quality. The particular pectinolytic enzymes that were selected for this study are Rapidase CB, Rapidase TF, Rapidase X-press and OE-Lallzyme. In addition this study, investigate the applicability of recombinant yeast strains with pectinolytic, xylanolytic, glucanolytic and amylolytic activities in degrading the banana polysaccharides (pectin, xylan, glucan starch) for juice and wine extraction and product clarification. The overall objective of this research was to improve banana juice and wine by enzymatic processing techniques and to improve alcoholic fermentation and to produce limpid and shelf-stable products of clarified juice and wine. The focus was on applying the selected commercial enzyme preparations specifically for the production of better clarified banana juice and wine. This is because the turbid banana juice and beer, which contain suspended solids that are characterised by a very intense banana flavour, require a holistic approach to address challenges and opportunities in order to process pure banana beverages with desirable organoleptic qualities. The specific objectives of applying commercial enzymes in the processing of banana juice and wine, comparing with grape winemaking practices, use of recombinant yeast and analyses of various parameters in the juices and wines made have enabled generation of information that could be of help to prospective banana juice and wine processors. The research findings obtained could be used to establish a pilot plant or small-scale industry in the banana processing beverages producing large quantities,and finally the overall objective of obtaining limpid and shelf stable products would be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Each year across Canada, {{millions}} of dollars of damage to agricultural crops can be attributed to vertebrate pests. Estimates for 1975 indicated that approximately $ 240, 000, 000 damage was incurred by agricultural pests (Solman et al. 1975). Worldwide impact of these pests must certainly be staggering, especially during the current trend of rising production costs and demand for food. In Canada and the United States, pest control programs may be attacked by increaseingly active and vocal environmental groups. Recently, the killing of blackbirds (Icteridae) and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in Kentucky and Tennessee evoked strong objection (Graham 1976, 1978; Jackson 1976). As a result, politically sensitive civil servants may feel justified in avoiding programs which involve the killing of vertebrate pests. While decision-making within the government is subject to public scrutiny and criticism, prior knowledge of public attitudes toward potential policies may enable public servants <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>acceptable</b> decisions regarding wildlife management (Hendee and Potter 1973) Unfortunately, there is a paucity of sociological research addressing the question of public attitudes toward pest control. Arthur et al. (1977) assessed the attitudes of Americans toward the conflict between environmentalists and livestock ranchers regarding the killing of coyotes (Canis Iatrans), and Buys (1975) examined the attitudes of New Mexico ranchers toward coyotes and coyote control. From these studies it was found that ranchers harbor attitudes which are resistant to the implementation of non- lethal control techniques, and that, in general, the public was more concerned about the humaneness and species specificity of control than cost effectiveness. These facts are particularly relevant to the controversy concerning red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phaeniceus) damage to corn (Zea mays) in southwestern Quebec, where members of the agricultural communities have encouraged the use of lethal control measures to decrease blackbird populations (Weatherhead et al. these proceedings). The objectives of this paper are to examine and assess the attitudes of Canadians vis- a-vis agricultural pest control and to include Quebec farmersâ€™ evaulations of the blackbird population, crop damage and control techniques. To achieve these objectives, the results from 3 surveys conducted during the period 1975 - 1978 were examined. The first was a study of the attitudes of Quebeckers toward environmentally-related outdoor activities and agricultural pest control (Clark 1979). Next, a survey of Quebec farmers was used to locate roosts, obtain crop-damage estimates and assess attitudes toward blackbirds and their control. And third, a random survey of Canadians examined attitudes toward the control of red-winged blackbirds which damage crops and suggested several management strategies...|$|E
