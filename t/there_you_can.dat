25|$|To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), {{linking the}} towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After {{traveling}} nearly 40km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters you reach the far north of the region, more precisely {{at the foot of}} the massif 'Los Gigantes'. From <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> follow the same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing {{the towns of}} San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Raúl Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, and yet they can not access certain areas.|$|E
500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass <b>there,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} month of 2015–16, Donaldson {{provided}} four assists for teammates but did not score himself. At home to Bristol City on 12 September 2015, he completed a first-half hat-trick; the match ended 4–2. His fifth goal of the season came in a 5–2 away win against Fulham on 7 November 2015, the last match before he made his international debut for Jamaica. He returned with a groin injury that was predicted to keep him out for six weeks. Rowett suggested the damage could have been less serious had Donaldson not played the whole match despite being obviously unfit, but Jamaica coach Winfried Schäfer denied the accusations, stating that he had wanted to substitute Donaldson but the player insisted on continuing. He returned to first-team action on 26 December 2015, as a late substitute with Birmingham already 3–0 down at Sheffield Wednesday, and remained in the starting eleven thereafter, although it took some time for his rhythm and form to return. Donaldson was also used on the left wing in support of loan striker Kyle Lafferty. He said he enjoyed that position [...] "because strikers are always getting battered and from <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sneak in unopposed", although it had not gone as well for him this season as he had hoped. By the end of the season, which he finished as the club's top scorer with 11 goals from 40 league appearances as well as contributing 7 assists, he claimed to be [...] "back to [...] normal self".|$|E

2500|$|Chagall wrote as a boy; [...] "I felt {{at every}} step that I was a Jew—people made me feel it". During a pogrom, Chagall wrote that: [...] "The street lamps are out. I feel panicky, {{especially}} in front of butchers' windows. <b>There</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see calves that are still alive lying beside the butchers' hatchets and knives". When asked by some pogromniks [...] "Jew or not?", Chagall remembered thinking: [...] "My pockets are empty, my fingers sensitive, my legs weak and they are out for blood. My death would be futile. I so wanted to live". Chagall denied being a Jew, leading the pogromniks to to shout [...] "All right! Get along!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Sullivan ... {{was very}} much in touch with all the music of his time.... There are bits which are {{definitely}} Wagnerian: the use of dotted rhythms, always in 4/4 time – you get the whiff of Meistersinger or Lohengrin, I think. There is, also, for example, a remarkable duet at the end of act 2, I would say Verdian in its sweep. [...] There are, of course, the stand-up arias, never a full ensemble until right at the end. [...] Rebecca's aria is a very interesting piece. [...] Whenever she is singing he uses the cor anglais to stress the sort of Eastern quality, and Sullivan claimed that this theme was one he had heard as a student in Leipzig, when he had attended a service at the Synagogue <b>there.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> tell, and he quickly establishes it in the music, that he was not writing an operetta! [...] Look at this, very early on, some virtuoso stuff. [...] It needs a really accomplished orchestra. [...] He had always been cramped by the small orchestra, only ever one oboe, that he had to make do with at the Savoy. [...] Here he was really able to expand, you can feel it in the music." ...|$|E
