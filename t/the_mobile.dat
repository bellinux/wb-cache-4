40|$|We {{consider}} a packet switched wireless network {{in which a}} base station serves <b>the</b> <b>mobiles.</b> <b>The</b> packets for <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> arrive at <b>the</b> base station {{and have to be}} scheduled for transmission to <b>the</b> <b>mobiles.</b> <b>The</b> capacity of the channel from the base station to <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> is varying with time due to fading. We assume <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> can obtain different types of service based on the prices they are willing to pay. The objective of the base station is to schedule packets for transmission to <b>mobiles</b> to maximize <b>the</b> revenue earned. Our main result is that a simple greedy algorithm does at least # as good as the optimal offline algorithm that knows the complete future request pattern and channel conditions. We also show that no other online algorithm can do better...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} 'fair' scheduling the resources to one of <b>the</b> many <b>mobile</b> stations by a centrally controlled base station (BS). The BS is the only entity taking decisions in this framework based on truthful information from <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> on their radio channel. We study the well-known family of parametric -fair scheduling problems from a gametheoretic perspective in which some of <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> may be noncooperative. We first show that if the BS is unaware of the noncooperative behavior from <b>the</b> <b>mobiles,</b> <b>the</b> noncooperative <b>mobiles</b> become successful in snatching the resources from <b>the</b> other cooperative <b>mobiles,</b> resulting in unfair allocations. If the BS is aware of <b>the</b> noncooperative <b>mobiles,</b> a new game arises with BS as an additional player. It can then do better by neglecting the signals from <b>the</b> noncooperative <b>mobiles.</b> <b>The</b> BS, however, becomes successful in eliciting the truthful signals from <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> only when it uses additional information (signal statistics). This new policy along with the truthful signals from mobiles forms a Nash Equilibrium (NE) which we call a Truth Revealing Equilibrium. Finally, we propose new iterative algorithms to implement fair scheduling policies that robustify the otherwise non-robust (in presence of noncooperation) fair scheduling algorithms...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{multiple}} access channel (MAC) with perfect channel state information (CSI) {{at the base}} station and different types of CSI at <b>the</b> <b>mobiles,</b> i. e. without CSI, with long-term CSI and with perfect CSI. The average sumrate of the MAC depends on the statistics of the channel realizations and on the transmission strategy and CSI at <b>the</b> <b>mobiles.</b> In this work, we analyse {{the impact of the}} fading distributions on the achievable average sumrate. We show for the case in which <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> have no CSI, that the maximum sumrate is obtained for fading channels which have second order moments equally distributed. For the case in which <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> have information about the long-term statistics of the fading channels in terms of the fading variances, we derive the optimum power allocation and show that in this case the sumrate is maximised if one user has largest second order moment. Finally, in the case in which <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> have perfect CSI, only the best user is allowed to transmit. For this type of CSI, the average sumrate is maximal if one user has large fading variance and all other users have very low fading variances.

40|$|We {{present an}} idea to reduce {{the part of the}} {{downlink}} signaling traffic in wireless multiple access systems that contains scheduling information. The theoretical basis of the scheme is that the scheduling decisions made by the base station are correlated with the CSI reports from <b>the</b> <b>mobiles.</b> This correlation can be exploited by the source coding scheme that is used to compress the scheduling maps before they are sent to <b>the</b> <b>mobiles.</b> In <b>the</b> proposed scheme, this idea is implemented by letting <b>the</b> <b>mobiles</b> make tentative scheduling decisions themselves, and then letting the base station transmit "agreement maps" instead of raw scheduling maps to <b>the</b> <b>mobiles.</b> <b>The</b> agreement maps have lower entropy and they require less resources to be transmitted than the original scheduling maps do.
