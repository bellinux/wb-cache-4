5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is the time difference between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station's signal then aircraft's response) from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E

5|$|The Central Recreation Ground was a cricket {{ground in}} Hastings, East Sussex, used for {{first-class}} and List A cricket between 1864 and 1996. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> was frequently used by Sussex County Cricket Club {{as one of}} their outgrounds from 1865; in total, Sussex played 143 first-class and 17 List A matches at <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Between 1887 and the 1960s, the Central Recreation Ground also played host to the Hastings & St Leonards cricket festival, which attracted many other teams and notable players. In the early twentieth century, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> hosted seven Gentlemen v Players matches, and notable players to have played at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> include W.G.

5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado.
