5|$|Born into {{a family}} of {{mandarins}} from Hà Tĩnh Province, Phan continued his ancestors' traditions by placing first in the metropolitan imperial examinations in 1877. Phan quickly rose through the ranks under Emperor Tự Đức of the Nguyễn Dynasty, gaining a reputation for his integrity and uncompromising stance against corruption. Phan was appointed as the Imperial Censor, a position <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to criticise his fellow mandarins and even the emperor. As {{the head of the}} censorate, Phan's investigations led to the removal of many incompetent or corrupt mandarins.|$|E
5|$|Frears had {{a clause}} in his {{contract}} <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to direct any sequels. The success of The Deal prompted the production team {{to consider a}} new film—possibly surrounding Britain's commitment {{to the war in}} Iraq. In 2004, production was announced that the first follow-up would be produced for a theatrical film release in 2006, The Queen; that dramatises the weeks following the death of Princess Diana on 31 August 1997. Langan described the film as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.|$|E

His separation from the firm concluded in early 2002; He transferred his ownership to other partners and negotiated an agreement <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to receive a share of the profits as a retired partner in some Bain Capital entities, including buyout and investment funds. The private equity business continued to thrive, earning him millions of dollars in annual income.|$|E
5|$|Teller left Hungary in 1926, {{partly due}} to the discriminatory numerus clausus rule under Miklós Horthy's regime. The {{political}} climate and revolutions in Hungary during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller. When he was a young student, his right foot was severed in a streetcar accident in Munich, requiring him to wear a prosthetic foot, and leaving him with a lifelong limp. Werner Heisenberg said that it was the hardiness of Teller's spirit, rather than stoicism, <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to cope so well with the accident.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. His understanding of these events was, as he explained, similar to the experiences of biblical prophets. In the commentary to A Vision of the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A Vision of the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E

5|$|Bond veteran {{cameraman}} {{and professional}} skier Willy Bogner, Jr. {{was promoted to}} director of a second unit involving ski footage. Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh, allowing to film the vehicle or behind it, {{and a set of}} skis <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to ski forwards and backwards to get the best shots. In February 1981, {{on the final day of}} filming the bobsleigh chase, one of the stuntmen driving a sleigh, 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He {{used to say that}} he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E
5|$|Halleck {{appointed}} Pope {{to command}} the Army of the Mississippi (and the District of the Mississippi, Department of the Missouri) on February 23, 1862. Given 25,000 men, {{he was ordered to}} clear Confederate obstacles on the Mississippi River. He made a surprise march on New Madrid, Missouri, and captured it on March 14. He then orchestrated a campaign to capture Island No. 10, a strongly fortified post garrisoned by 12,000 men and 58 guns. Pope's engineers cut a channel <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to bypass the island. Assisted by the gunboats of Captain Andrew H. Foote, he landed his men on the opposite shore, which isolated the defenders. The island garrison surrendered on April 7, 1862, freeing Union navigation of the Mississippi as far south as Memphis.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 he was {{appointed}} the marriage registrar at the sharia court in Haifa by the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem, a role <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to tour the northern villages, whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives. According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam was:An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who {{was struck by the}} plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at {{the ways in which the}} old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians.|$|E
5|$|In January 1898, Kanō was {{appointed}} director of primary {{education at the}} Ministry of Education, and in August 1899, he received a grant <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to study in Europe. His ship left Yokohama on 13 September 1899, and he arrived in Marseilles on 15 October. He spent about a year in Europe, and during this trip, he visited Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Amsterdam, and London. He returned to Japan in 1901. Soon after returning to Japan, he resumed his post as president of Tokyo Higher Normal School, and he remained in this position until his retirement on 16 January 1920. He also helped establish Nada Middle High School in 1928 at Kobe, which later became one of highest-ranked private high schools in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In January 1920 Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to play a World Championship match in 1921, noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920. Because of the delay, Lasker insisted on a final clause <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to play anyone else for the championship in 1920, that nullified the contract with Capablanca if Lasker lost a title match in 1920, and that stipulated that if Lasker resigned the title Capablanca should become World Champion. Lasker had previously included in his agreement before World War I to play Akiba Rubinstein for the title a similar clause that if he resigned the title, it should become Rubinstein's.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a request from Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, the American commander of the South Pacific Area, the 3rd Division moved to New Caledonia on garrison duty while the American forces previously stationed there fought in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Conscious that his division was the only sizable non-American unit in a theatre of operations having an overall American command structure, Barrowclough requested, and received, a charter <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to seek instructions from the New Zealand Government if he felt the division was {{to be involved in}} operations that could result in significant casualties.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Deady {{spent the}} next four years working for his father on the family farm, engaged in manual labor, while also reading {{extensively}} in his spare time. On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmith’s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there until four months beyond the time that his blacksmith apprenticeship ended. The apprenticeship had paid {{for the first six months}} of school. At the school he earned a certificate <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R. Smith.|$|E
5|$|The glyphs {{are divided}} into three categories: in{{dependent}}, compound, and dependent (glyphs that only appear in combination with others). He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do not place importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which the characters are interwoven together through various combinations. He speculates {{that it was his}} background in graphic design <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to perceive this pattern, while other researchers relied too heavily on linguistics and epigraphy.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Ford wrote {{a thesis}} on malaria {{control in the}} South West Pacific, {{for which he was}} awarded his Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree by the University of Melbourne in 1946. He {{received}} a Rockefeller Fellowship <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where he gained a Diploma of Public Health with distinction in 1947. Ford became Director of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney in 1946, and Professor of Preventive Medicine in 1947, concurrently holding these two positions until his 1968 retirement. In addition, he was the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and a Fellow of the Senate from 1953 to 1957, and was Acting Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney from November 1960 until March 1961. He was involved in the establishment of the medical school at the University of Western Australia, and {{was a member of the}} council of Macquarie University.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín kept a {{regulation}} from the dictatorship <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> {{to regulate the}} level of wages. He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep {{them up to the}} inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher wages in response to it. The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure in spite of opposition from the unions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1140, Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, whose castles Stephen had confiscated the {{previous}} year, rebelled against Stephen as well. Nigel hoped to seize East Anglia and established his base of operations in the Isle of Ely, then surrounded by protective fenland. Stephen responded quickly, taking an army into the fens and using boats lashed {{together to form a}} causeway <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to make a surprise attack on the isle. Nigel escaped to Gloucester, but his men and castle were captured, and order was temporarily restored in the east. Robert of Gloucester's men retook some of the territory that Stephen had taken in his 1139 campaign. In an effort to negotiate a truce, Henry of Blois held a peace conference at Bath, to which Stephen sent his wife. The conference collapsed over the insistence by Henry and the clergy that they should set the terms of any peace deal, which Stephen found unacceptable.|$|E
