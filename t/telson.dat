5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long <b>telson</b> is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the <b>telson</b> can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|The opisthosoma {{consists}} of twelve or fewer segments that originally formed two groups, a mesosoma of seven segments and a metasoma of five, terminating with a <b>telson</b> or spike. The abdominal appendages of modern chelicerates are missing or heavily modified – {{for example in}} spiders the remaining appendages form spinnerets that extrude silk, while those of horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) form gills.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{is made up}} {{of twelve}} body {{segments}}, the last of which is fused to the first segment of the abdomen. There is no carapace, but each of the eleven free segments bears a pair of phyllopodia, which have a series of bristles pointing along the animal's midline. The abdomen consists of seven segments without appendages, and a slender <b>telson</b> which bears a pair of caudal rami.|$|E

25|$|Juvenile Eurypterus {{differed}} from adults in several ways. Their carapaces were narrower and longer (parabolic) {{in contrast to}} the trapezoidal carapaces of adults. The eyes are aligned almost laterally but move to a more anterior location during growth. The preabdomen also lengthened, increasing the overall length of the ophisthosoma. The swimming legs also became narrower and the <b>telsons</b> shorter and broader (though in E. tetragonophthalmus and E. henningsmoeni the <b>telsons</b> changed from being angular in juveniles to larger and more rounded in adults). All these changes are believed to be a result of the respiratory and reproductive requirements of adults.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to produce highly {{efficient}} antivenom from {{a small number of}} <b>telsons</b> in a short time. Venom solution was prepared through maceration of <b>telsons</b> from Androctonus crassicauda (Olivier, 1807) collected in the Southeastern Anatolia Region, Turkey. Lethal dose 50 % (LD 50) of the venom solution injected into mice was 1 ml/kg (95 % confidence interval; 0. 8 - 1. 3), according to probit analysis. Different adjuvants (Freund's Complete Adjuvant, Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant, and 0. 4 % aluminium phosphate), at increasing doses and combined with venom, were subcutaneously injected into horses on days 0, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 of the experiment. Antivenom was collected from the immunized horses on days 45, 48, and 51 using the pepsin digestive method. The antivenom effective dose 50 % (ED 50) in mice was 0. 5 ml (95 % confidence interval; 0. 40 - 0. 58), according to probit analysis. It was concluded that 0. 5 ml antivenom neutralized a venom dose 35 -fold higher than the venom LD 50. Thus, highly potent antivenom could be produced from about 238 <b>telsons</b> in 51 days...|$|R
5|$|Each somite, or body segment {{can bear}} {{a pair of}} appendages: on the {{segments}} of the head, these include two pairs of antennae, the mandibles and maxillae; the thoracic segments bear legs, which may be specialised as pereiopods (walking legs) and maxillipeds (feeding legs). The abdomen bears pleopods, and ends in a <b>telson,</b> which bears the anus, and is often flanked by uropods to form a tail fan. The number and variety of appendages in different crustaceans may be {{partly responsible for the}} group's success.|$|E
5|$|One {{or more of}} the {{abdominal}} segments, starting with the sixth segment, is fused to the <b>telson</b> (terminal section) to form a rigid pleotelson. The first five abdominal segments each bear a pair of biramous (branching in two) pleopods (lamellar structures which serve the function of gas exchange, and in aquatic species serve as gills and propulsion), and the last segment bears a pair of biramous uropods (posterior limbs). In males, the second pair of pleopods, and sometimes also the first, are modified for use in transferring sperm. The endopods (inner branches of the pleopods) are modified into structures with thin, permeable cuticles (flexible outer coverings) which act as gills for gas exchange. In some terrestrial isopods, these resemble lungs.|$|E
25|$|The abdomen {{ends in a}} <b>telson</b> {{and a pair of}} long, thin, multi-articulate caudal rami. The form of the <b>telson</b> varies {{between the}} two genera: in Lepidurus, a rounded {{projection}} extends between the caudal rami, while in Triops there is no such projection.|$|E
50|$|The kazacharthrans are {{distinguished}} from tadpole shrimp {{in that they}} were much larger (carapace length ranging from 0.6 to 5 centimeters), had uniquely shaped, heavily sclerotized, heavily mineralized carapaces, and plate-shaped <b>telsons</b> The carapace, or headshield had a distinctive pattern of tubercles, typically with a central-anteriorly located tubercle {{that may or may}} not have housed the compound eyes, and other, distinctively shaped tubercles that may represent attachment sites for mandibles.|$|R
40|$|The {{constituents}} of the amino acids {{composed of the}} protein in the exoskeletons of the crustacea, the prawn, Peneaus japonicus, the crab, Portuuns trituberculatus, and the lobster, Panulirus japonicus were analyzed quantitatively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Scorpions are venomous {{arthropods}} of {{the class}} Arachnida and are considered relatives of spiders, ticks and mites. There are approximately 1, 500 species of scorpions worldwide, which are characterized by an elongated body and a segmented tail that ends in a venomous stinger. No specific treatment is available for scorpion envenomation, except {{for the use of}} antivenom. The current study aimed at comparing protein content and lethality of Androctonus crassicauda venom extracted by two different methods (electric stimulation and maceration of <b>telsons).</b> The LD 50 calculated by probit analysis was 1. 1 mg/kg for venom obtained by electric stimulation and 39. 19 mg/kg for venom obtained by maceration of <b>telsons.</b> In the electrophoretic analysis, protein bands of the venom sample obtained by electric stimulation were between 12 and 53 kDa (total: five bands), and those of venom extracted by maceration appeared as multiple protein bands, relative to the other venom sample.

25|$|Based on {{the width}} and {{structure}} of each segment, they {{can be divided into}} the broad preabdomen (segments 1 to 7) and the narrow postabdomen (segments 8 to 12). The preabdomen is the broader segments of the anterior portion of the ophisthosoma while the postabdomen are the last five segments of the Eurypterus body. Each of the segments of the postabdomen contain lateral flattened protrusions known as the epimera {{with the exception of the}} last needle-like (styliform) segment known as the <b>telson</b> (the 'tail'). The segment immediately preceding the <b>telson</b> (which also has the largest epimera of the postabdomen) is known as the pretelson.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} 5–14 rings {{at the end}} of {{the body}} do not bear appendages. At the end of the body is a pleotelson (fusion of the last abdominal segment and the <b>telson)</b> connected to long, multisegmented uropods.|$|E
25|$|The abdomen {{is divided}} into two parts: the pleosome which bears {{swimming}} legs; and the urosome, which comprises a <b>telson</b> and three pairs of uropods which do not form a tail fan as they do in animals such as true shrimp.|$|E

25|$|A fertilised egg hatches into a nauplius: a one-eyed larva {{comprising}} a {{head and}} a <b>telson,</b> without a thorax or abdomen. This undergoes six months of growth, passing through five instars, before transforming into the cyprid stage. Nauplii are typically initially brooded by the parent, and released after the first moult as larvae that swim freely using setae.|$|E
25|$|The pleon {{is made up}} of six somites, each {{bearing a}} pair of pleopods, and {{terminating}} in a <b>telson.</b> The first somite is narrower than the succeeding somites, and the last pair of pleopods are modified into uropods, which flank the <b>telson.</b> The pleon is usually curled under the thorax, such that only the first three somites are visible from above. The form of the pleopods varies between the sexes. In females, the first one or two pairs are missing, while the remaining pairs are uniramous, and have long setae, to which the eggs can be attached. In males, the first two pairs are formed into gonopods, and are used to transfer the spermatophore to the female during mating; the first pair is often missing. The remaining pleopods can be {{similar to those of the}} females, or reduced in size, or entirely absent. In both sexes, the uropods are biramous.|$|E
25|$|The muscular abdomen has six {{segments}} {{and has a}} thinner shell {{than the}} carapace. Each segment has a separate overlapping shell, which can be transparent. The first five segments each have a pair of appendages on the underside, which are shaped like paddles and is used for swimming forward. The appendices are called pleopods or swimmerets, {{and can be used}} for more purposes than just swimming. Some shrimp species use them for brooding eggs, others have gills on them for breathing, and the males in some species use the first pair or two for insemination. The sixth segment terminates in the <b>telson</b> flanked by two pairs of appendages called the uropods. The uropods allow the shrimp to swim backward, and function like rudders, steering the shrimp when it swims forward. Together, the <b>telson</b> and uropods form a splayed tail fan. If a shrimp is alarmed, it can flex its tail fan in a rapid movement. This results in a backward dart called the caridoid escape reaction (lobstering).|$|E
50|$|Reaching {{a maximum}} of 130 mm, C. quinquecarinatus {{is one of the}} {{smallest}} in the genus Cherax. They vary in colour from light to black-brown. Their heads have five keels, two pairs of spines at rostrum, and none on their <b>telsons.</b> Their chelipeds are rounded and narrow and are often speckled. While restricted to southwestern Western Australia, it has the widest distribution in the biogeographic region. It is found in all habitats containing freshwater crayfish, congenors such as Cherax tenuimanus (marron), or the genus Engaewa.|$|R
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of Dardanus venosus has been little studied but the eggs are {{probably}} brooded attached to the female's abdomen. When the eggs hatch, the larvae are liberated into the water column and pass through several zoeal stages in the plankton before becoming glaucothoë larvae. These are relatively large and have elongated <b>telsons,</b> or rear segments, and characteristic hooks on the dactyls of the walking legs. After some time, the glaucothoë larvae settle out before metamorphosing into juveniles that needs to find shells in which to live.|$|R

25|$|Lobster anatomy {{includes}} the cephalothorax which fuses {{the head and}} the thorax, {{both of which are}} covered by a chitinous carapace, and the abdomen. The lobster's head bears antennae, antennules, mandibles, the first and second maxillae, and the first, second, and third maxillipeds. Because lobsters live in murky environments {{at the bottom of the}} ocean, they mostly use their antennae as sensors. The lobster eye has a reflective structure above a convex retina. In contrast, most complex eyes use refractive ray concentrators (lenses) and a concave retina. The abdomen includes swimmerets and its tail is composed of uropods and the <b>telson.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose and}} {{benefit of the}} paralysing toxin is not clear. Being arachnids, ticks are related to predatory {{arthropods}} (spiders, scorpions and mites). Spiders and scorpions have retained toxins and developed specialised delivery structures (fangs and <b>telsons)</b> while mites and ticks have lost this feature. Of the 800 species of ticks, 40-64 species (across 10 genera) have been reported as causing a form of toxosis. So as ticks have moved from a predatory existence to a parasitic existence, most species have lost their toxin {{which would have been}} a disadvantage for a parasitic lifestyle (parasites in general do not want to kill their host). Gene sequence of the tick toxin shows high homology to scorpion toxins.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Scorpions {{are common}} in {{urban and rural areas}} of Iran.

40|$|A rich {{assemblage}} (n = 223) of well-preserved phyllocarid crustacean {{remains is}} described from offshore calcareous shales of the Kopanina Formation (Silurian, Ludlow, early Ludfordian, Saetograptus linearis Biozone) exposed {{near the village}} of Všeradice, SE of Beroun. Specimens examined fall within the intraspecific variability of Ceratiocaris papilio Salter in Murchison, 1859, which is widely distributed in the Llandovery and Wenlock of Laurentia. Consequently, the Bohemian specimens represent the first occurrence of C. papilio outside of Laurentia. Additionally, the phyllocarid assemblage from Bohemia is younger than that of Laurentia. In Bohemia, Ceratiocaris papilio occurs in finely laminated calcareous shales. Its abundance varies distinctly from bed to bed, and phyllocarids are the dominant faunal component in only a few beds. Phyllocarids are associated with common graptolites and pelagic orthocerids while other benthic organisms are severely limited. Isolated or articulated furcae and <b>telsons,</b> and isolated mandibles are the most common components of this association, but articulated abdominal segments with caudal appendages (but without carapaces) also occur. An exceptional, slightly disarticulated specimen has articulated abdominal and partial thoracic segments, with mandibles preserved in situ. Additional possible occurrences of C. papilio and related species in Bohemia are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|Although {{they are}} {{classified}} as crabs, the larvae of Dromiacea {{are similar to those}} of the Anomura, which led many scientists to place dromiacean crabs in the Anomura, rather than with the other crabs. Apart from the Dromiacea, all crabs share a similar and distinctive larval form. The crab zoea has a slender, curved abdomen and a forked <b>telson,</b> but its most striking features are the long rostral and dorsal spines, sometimes augmented by further, lateral spines. These spines can be many times longer than the body of the larva. Crab prezoea larvae have been found fossilised in the stomach contents of the Early Cretaceous bony fish Tharrhias.|$|E
25|$|Behind the head, {{the body}} {{consists}} of 15 or more segments. Most of the segments bear {{a single pair of}} legs, with the maxillipeds projecting {{forward from the}} first body segment, and the final two segments being small and legless. Each pair of legs is slightly longer than the pair immediately in front of it, ensuring that they do not overlap, so reducing the chance that they will collide with each other while moving swiftly. In extreme cases, the last pair of legs may be twice the length of the first pair. The final segment bears a <b>telson</b> and includes the openings of the reproductive organs.|$|E
25|$|The order Notostraca {{comprises}} the single family Triopsidae, containing the tadpole shrimp or shield shrimp. The two genera, Triops and Lepidurus, are considered living fossils, having not changed significantly in outward form since the Triassic. They have a broad, flat carapace, which conceals {{the head and}} bears {{a single pair of}} compound eyes. The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs. The <b>telson</b> is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami. Phenotypic plasticity within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation in the mode of reproduction. Notostracans are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids {{are further}} {{distinguished}} from insects {{by the fact}} {{they do not have}} antennae or wings. Their body is organized into two tagmata, called the prosoma, or cephalothorax, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen. The cephalothorax is derived from the fusion of the cephalon (head) and the thorax, and is usually covered by a single, unsegmented carapace. The abdomen is segmented in the more primitive forms, but varying degrees of fusion between the segments occur in many groups. It is typically divided into a preabdomen and postabdomen, although this is only clearly visible in scorpions, and in some orders, such as the Acari, the abdominal sections are completely fused. A <b>telson</b> is present in scorpions, where it has been modified to a stinger, and in the Schizomida, whip scorpions and Palpigradi.|$|E
25|$|Like other decapod crustaceans, the {{crayfish}} {{possesses a}} hard, segmented exoskeleton that reflects muscular and neural segmentation. The anterior {{portion of the}} crayfish is the cephalothorax region. The region rostral to the cephalic grove, which separates the head and thorax region, {{is characterized by the}} presence of eyes, antennae and claws while the region caudal contains four pairs of walking legs. This is the crayfish's primary mode of locomotion. The abdominal section of the crayfish is divided into seven segments. These segments are flexibly interconnected, forming the tail. Normally, the tail is held in an extended position to aid in maneuvering and balancing. The first five segments are similar and the two terminal segments are modified into a tail fan, a region with high surface area that acts as the blade of a paddle in the escape response. This region contains the <b>telson.</b> The abdominal segments contain swimmerets, which aid in swimming.|$|E
500|$|There {{is a clear}} {{demarcation}} {{between the}} thorax and the six or seven-segmented abdomen. In most taxa, each abdominal segment except the last carries a pair of biramous pleopods used for swimming, burrowing, gas exchange, creating a current or brooding eggs. The first and second abdominal pleopods may be modified in the male to form gonopods (accessory copulatory appendages). The appendages of the last segment are typically flattened into uropods, which together with the terminal <b>telson,</b> make up the [...] "tail fan". It is the sudden flexion of this tail fan that provides the thrust for the rapid escape response of these crustaceans and the tail fan is also used in steering. [...] In Leptostraca, the appendages on the <b>telson</b> instead form caudal rami (spine-like protrusions).|$|E
