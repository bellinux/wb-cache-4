Jordan won the scoring title for a fifth consecutive season, {{but the team}} {{was no longer a}} one-man show of years past. Instead, Jordan distributed the ball with regularity, {{thanks in large part to}} the triangle offense instituted by head coach Phil Jackson and assistant Tex Winter. This gave the Bulls additional offensive weapons to choose from, ranging from wingman Scottie Pippen and post players Horace Grant and Bill Cartwright to shooters such as John Paxson and B. J. Armstrong. Jordan's improved all-around play earned him his second MVP award.|$|E
25|$|Howard {{returned}} to his business as a private eye, working {{in the same building}} as She-Hulk, in Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by the Black Cat. With the help of Tara Tam, his new friend and assistant, Howard managed to recover the necklace. But on his way to give it back to Richards, he found himself kidnapped by the Collector and allied with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the villain's collection. Upon returning to Earth, he confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him, after he was robbed by May Parker, Spider-Man's aunt. After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard was approached by Richards {{in the middle of his}} fight against the Ringmaster and Richards revealed himself to be Talos the Untamed, who revealed that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara located the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but were unable <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> together when Talos grabbed it, who proceeded to use it to wreak havoc on the city. Talos was confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara took cover. He was able to point out that Tara, who revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a Skrull, could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl'rt (Super-Skrull), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand. Talos was later apprehended by the Fantastic Four and everything went back to normal. Afterwards, with the help of new arrival Gwenpool, Howard prevented Hydra from infecting the world with a deadly virus. He also has a crossover event with The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. Howard the Duck was shown to be living in She-Hulk's apartment building when Patsy Walker moves out.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{an often}} laid back and sarcastic demeanor, Raynor is {{described}} in the novel Liberty's Crusade as a decent and honorable man that is well liked by those under his command. Robert Clotworthy noted that as such, Raynor is always {{willing to do the}} right thing, no matter how difficult it may be. His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan—the series' main antagonist—despite his former love for her early in the story arc is one of the sacrifices that in Clotworthy's eyes makes Raynor a [...] "true hero in the purest sense of the word". He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause, willing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves. It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted. Although often displaying an overzealous attitude, Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day, even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into a bad situation. Raynor himself acknowledges that he is not the most intelligent man there is, but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that [...] "it would be difficult not to admire Raynor, {{if for no other}} reason than his persistence" [...] in the face of abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they [...] "were actually talking to me" [...] and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting [...] "When was the last time you could say that about a character in a strategy game?" [...] A reader's poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming's top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy's voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> on the line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s the man you want to be fighting side by side with." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked Raynor as the 24th greatest soldier in video games.|$|E
2500|$|After scoring 65 not {{out in the}} drawn Second Test at Antigua, Waugh {{defied the}} Caribbean pacemen on a green pitch at Trinidad suited to their hostile bowling during the Third Test. In the first innings, he scored an unbeaten 63 of Australia's 128 and had a mid-pitch {{confrontation}} with Curtly Ambrose. After Waugh had evaded a bouncer from Ambrose, the pair exchanged glares. Waugh swore and told Ambrose {{to return to his}} bowling mark. An angry Ambrose had to be physically dragged away by his captain: a photograph of this moment {{has become one of the}} iconic images of cricket in the 1990s.

[...] When asked what his inspiration has been, McKinnon replied that its [...] "new stuff I'm listening to all the time, I listen to a bit of everything", then going on to name a few artists that he admires: Mumford & Sons, Living with Lions and Coldplay, among others. McKinnon was then asked whether or not those bands' sound might influence the album, McKinnon answered with [...] "Maybe, I guess I'll find out when we go through all the new ones", but then going on to say [...] "Everything influences me, but it'll be an A Day To Remember record."

50|$|The {{idea behind}} the proof of the no-trade theorem is {{that if there is}} common {{knowledge}} about the structure of a market, then any bid or offer (i.e. attempt to initiate a trade) will reveal the bidder's private knowledge and will be incorporated into market prices even before anyone accepts the bid or offer, so no profit will result. Another way <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> is: <b>all</b> the traders in the market are rational, and thus they know that all the prices are rational/efficient; therefore, anyone who makes an offer to them must have special knowledge, else why would they be making the offer?
