5|$|Not {{everything}} {{contained in}} the New Testament gospels {{is considered to be}} historically reliable.

5|$|The {{three major}} {{components}} of peat are humic acid, humins, and fulvic acid.

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is generally}} considered the best method for airway management under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, as it provides <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>reliable</b> means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.

5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>reliable</b> author of this era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact}} that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E

5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>reliable</b> dates, {{due to the}} use of {{radiocarbon dating}} on volcanic ash deposits, {{as well as some of}} the earliest MSA sites. Faunal preservation, however, is not spectacular, and standardization in site excavation and lithic classification was, until recently, lacking. Unlike northern Africa, shifts between lithic technologies were not nearly as pronounced, likely due to more favorable climatic conditions that would have allowed for more continuous occupation of sites. Central Africa reflects similar patterning to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region is certainly required.|$|E
5|$|For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is {{generally}} considered among scholars as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is {{equal to that of}} Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>reliable</b> witness of the text. In the Book of Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, Papyrus 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E
5|$|In 1852, Great Britain {{made her}} first voyage to Melbourne, Australia, {{carrying}} 630 emigrants. She excited great interest there, with 4,000 people paying a shilling each to inspect her.

5|$|In {{modern times}} {{dosimetry}} is done very differently.

Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin's dose, ranging from 287rad to 21sievert. Based on citations and supporting reasoning, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>reliable</b> estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10Gy(n) + 1.14 Gy(γ) for Slotin and 2 Gy(n) + 1.1 Gy(γ) for Daghlian. These doses are consistent with the symptoms they experienced.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered.

The Central Front suffered 15,336 irrecoverable casualties and 18,561 medical casualties, {{for a total of}} 33,897 casualties.
