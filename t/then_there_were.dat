5|$|Murder on the Orient Express {{retains the}} main plot {{elements}} of Agatha Christie's {{novel of the}} same name. An additional ending {{is presented in the}} game which differs from the conclusion of Christie's novel. As with And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None, Christie's novel is bundled with the game. Some reviewers of Murder on the Orient Express criticized the game because of the repetitive nature of tasks the player must complete, and also complained about the inefficient and cumbersome inventory system. Others have praised it for improved graphics compared to And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None, as well as convincing voice acting and audio effects. Murder on the Orient Express is followed by , the third installment in the Agatha Christie series.|$|E
5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas in Murder on the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E
5|$|The Manor Hall Amateur Dramatics Society, {{known as}} 'MAD', {{was formed in}} October 1933. Its first {{production}} was a nativity play, The Child in Flanders, by Cicely Hamilton, which was performed on 8 December 1933. Recent productions include Mostellaria, And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None, Road, The Crucible and The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole.|$|E

5|$|A major {{difference}} between And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty– but by <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no more survivors to be rescued. Carpathia had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships {{to carry out a}} final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express was {{announced}} in May 2006, as the second installment in The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series. As with the game's predecessor, And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None, Murder on the Orient Express was developed by AWE Productions, in collaboration with producer The Adventure Company. The production team remained largely the same, with Lee Sheldon reprising his role as Lead Designer, and Scott Nixon from AWE Productions reprising his position as Managing Director.|$|E
5|$|The episode borrows {{heavily from}} the 1985 comedy film Clue, the 1976 comedy film Murder by Death, and is largely {{based upon the}} 1939 Agatha Christie novel And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None. The opening scene of the episode {{is similar to that}} of Stanley Kubrik's The Shining. Once the Griffin family arrives at the mansion, Lois remarks on the estate's beauty, {{wondering}} if television host Jeff Probst has a similar home. As they walk into the mansion, Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it back with some suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize every aspect of the game as with And <b>Then</b> <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> None, and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the Orient Express, as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E
