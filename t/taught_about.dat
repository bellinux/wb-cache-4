5|$|Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany was {{a serious}} subject. He taught Linnaeus to {{classify}} plants according to Tournefort's system. Linnaeus was also <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> the sexual reproduction of plants, according to Sébastien Vaillant. In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in Lund University in Skåne. He was registered as , the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.|$|E
5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Isenhour and Rooney {{met with}} MSNBC news {{commentator}} Chris Matthews {{to discuss the}} possibility of Matthews running against Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter, although he ultimately did not run. Also that year, Isenhour and her Republican counterpart Luke Bernstein, {{executive director of the}} Republican Party of Pennsylvania, together taught a class about presidential elections at the Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Isenhour and Bernstein both believed it was the first class of its type, and said the two had a very cordial relationship despite representing opposite political parties. Isenhour also <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> electoral politics at other educational institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, Central Penn College and The Washington Center.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> the Raëlian {{perspective}} {{of the body and}} sexuality. She discussed these topics from a biological perspective, arguing that humans are essentially robots because they can be reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the freedom to choose from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit of femininity as a method of spiritual growth. The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as a role model.|$|E
5|$|Meher Baba gave {{numerous}} teachings on {{the cause}} and purpose of life, including teaching reincarnation and that the phenomenal world is an illusion. He taught that the Universe is imagination, that God is what really exists, and that each soul is really God passing through imagination to realize individually His own divinity. In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain Self-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths. He also <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> the concept of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called involution. His teachings are most importantly recorded in his principal books Discourses and God Speaks.|$|E
5|$|The novella {{begins with}} 5-Liu Hsing, as a child, being <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> Earth {{through the use}} of virtual reality tapes, an {{experience}} which her younger self takes exception to. She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E

25|$|Although Frederick William I {{was raised}} a Calvinist, he feared {{he was not}} of the elect. To avoid the {{possibility}} of Frederick being motivated by the same concerns, the king ordered that his heir not be <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> predestination. Nevertheless, although Frederick was largely irreligious, he to some extent appeared to adopt this tenet of Calvinism. Some scholars have speculated that he did this to spite his father.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} Christian writings {{that clearly}} speak of contemplative prayer {{come from the}} 4th-century monk St. John Cassian, who wrote of a practice he learned from the Desert Fathers (specifically from Isaac). Cassian's writings remained influential until the medieval era when monastic practice shifted from a mystical orientation to Scholasticism. During the 16th century, Carmelite saints Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross wrote and <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> advanced Christian prayer, which was given the name infused contemplation.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{public schools}} have a sex {{education}} program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect {{at the onset of}} menarche (often this takes place during the 4th grade). Historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model. Then, and to an extent now, menstruation was a private matter and a girl's menarche was not a community phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Almost all of {{the educated}} populace of the Comoros have {{attended}} Quranic schools {{at some point in}} their lives, often before regular schooling. Here, boys and girls are <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> the Qur'an, and memorise it. Some parents specifically choose this early schooling to offset French schools children usually attend later. Since independence and the ejection of French teachers, the education system has been plagued by poor teacher training and poor results, though recent stability may allow for substantial improvements.|$|E

A number of parents, right wing NGOs, and a judge have publicly protested against this initiative, and have written to the government and to the parliament and asked for these activities to cease immediately. The open letter contained complaints mostly based on religious grounds. There is now an official inquiry into this initiative.|$|E
25|$|About 20 matrilineal clans were {{recognized}} by the Acoma. Traditional child rearing involved very little discipline. Couples were generally monogamous and divorce was rare. Funerary rites involved ceremony and quick burial after death, followed by four days and nights of vigil. Women would wear cotton dresses and sandals or high moccasin boots. Traditional clothing for men involved cotton kilts and leather sandals. Rabbit and deer skin was used for clothing and robes, as well. In the seventeenth century horses {{were introduced to the}} Pueblo by the Spanish. Education was overseen by kiva headmen who <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> human behavior, spirit and body, astrology, ethics, child psychology, oratory, history, dance, and music.|$|E
25|$|He <b>taught</b> <b>about</b> free will, {{and opposed}} {{the use of}} the hallucinogenic Haoma plant in rituals, polytheism, over-ritualising {{religious}} ceremonies and animal sacrifices, as well an oppressive class system in Persia which earned him strong opposition among local authorities. Eventually, at the age of about forty-two, he received the patronage of queen Hutaosa and a ruler named Vishtaspa, an early adherent of Zoroastrianism (possibly from Bactria according to the Shahnameh). Zoroaster's teaching about individual judgment, Heaven and Hell, the resurrection of the body, the Last Judgment, and everlasting life for the reunited soul and body, among other things, became borrowings in the Abrahamic religions, but they lost the context of the original teaching.|$|E
