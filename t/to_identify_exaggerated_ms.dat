40|$|The Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS) {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{recently}} developed instruments designed <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> persons <b>exaggerating</b> and/or fabricating psychiatric and cognitive symptomatology. Preliminary analog research indicated that the SIMS showed some promise as a screening device for identifying malingerers. This study examined the utility of the SIMS for identifying malingerers and, more importantly, its ability to distinguish truly symptomatic persons from persons fabricating symptomatology. In a sample of 197 participants who completed the SIMS and Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R) under both honest and malingering instructional sets, sensitivity and specificity rates were generally high for the SIMS Total score and subscales. However, moderate correlations with the SCL- 90 -R were obtained in this sample, and specificity rates were lowest among a subset of participants reporting clinically significant levels of distress; both findings raise concerns regarding the potential for high false positive rates among clinical populations. Implications for clinical forensic practice are discussed and recommendations for future research are offere...|$|R
50|$|Aside from {{utilizing}} interpreters, {{healthcare professionals}} can improve their communication with deaf or {{hard of hearing}} patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient’s needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> words. <b>Exaggerated</b> pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it {{even more difficult to}} understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Biokinetics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Healthcare practitioners, whom perform {{accurate}} sub-maximal exercise {{tests in}} healthy individuals, {{need to understand}} the physiological demands and normal cardiovascular (CV) responses with exercise. Exercise testing delivers valid information about the physiological systems of individuals that may identify healthy individuals at risk of developing future cardiovascular disease (CVD). Exercise is a common way to assess physiological stress experienced by an individual, because CV abnormalities that are not present at rest, can be elicited during exercise testing and be used to determine the adequacy of cardiac function. Cardiovascular markers like, resting heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) have been used as simple non-invasive and useful biomarkers of the fundamental status of blood circulation and the CV system in healthy individuals. Studies have contributed to exercise under sub-maximal and maximal stress testing. Modern- day literature lacks information on the safe HR and SBP responses to an increase in workload during a sub-maximal exercise protocol in healthy individuals. Consequently, the first {{purpose of this study was}} <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the current evidence in the literature on CV response during a sub-maximal incremental exercise protocol. Different protocols and modalities contribute to various CV responses over a wide age group and gender. Heart rate and SBP increases in a linear fashion with an increase in workload, irrespective of protocol and modality. The amount of this increase, or the response of these markers, is still a grey area in the literature, especially in healthy individuals. The second purpose of this study was to analyse the HR and SBP response in healthy adults during a sub-maximal incremental exercise test, with an increase in workload (watt). The systematic review found mean changes from baseline for HR and SBP to be 75. 7 % and 63. 5 % respectively, on bicycle protocols (N = 3). The treadmill protocols (N = 2) found similar mean changes from baseline of 113. 3 % for HR and 36. 1 % for SBP. Descriptive measures as well as Linear regression analyses were performed, using Generalised estimated equations (GEE). An independent t-test was used to compare the males with the female participants: HR and SBP response to an increase in workload (watt). GEE adjustments were made for age, body mass index (BMI) and workload (watt). Significant difference levels were set at p ≤ 0. 05. The present once-off subject availability results revealed that male subjects were heavier and taller than their female counterparts (p ≤ 0. 05). They also had a noteworthy higher SBPrest, as well as BMI (p ≤ 0. 05). The results from the GEE analyses we presented prediction equation, with all variables significant, except for the BMI (p = 0. 972 females; p = 0. 169 males). In conclusion, the literature review indicated a lack of information on the HR and SBP response with workload in healthy adults. It is advised that further research is needed to test the prediction equations in healthy individuals to determine the validity and reliability. They need to be tested in a controlled clinical environment, where the participants are monitored more thoroughly. By putting these predicted equations to the test, healthcare practitioners will be able <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> an <b>exaggerated</b> HR and SBP response with an increase in workload. If the individual’s response is exaggerated, the healthcare practitioner can intervene to prevent future cardiovascular events. Master...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: Incidental {{recall of}} {{information}} used during a problem solving task is relatively insensitive to reduced motivation due to depression, and recognition tasks are relatively unaffected by memory impairment. This study validated a new test designed <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> intentional memory difficulties using incidental recognition for Similarities word pairs. Method:Recognition items {{were created by}} pairing Similarities words with incorrect semantically or phonemically related alternatives. The 38 -item forced choice test required recognition of the Similarities items immediately after the subtest (e. g., orange or juice?) and again following Block Design (e. g., apple or orange?). The test was administered to 56 nonlitigants with TBI (n = 24), dementia (n = 18), CVA (n = 7), and other disorders. Patients had significant immediate memory impairment on the HVLTR or Logical Memory (mean = 35 T) and reduced FSIQ (mean = 89). Thirty-four individuals instructed to malinger cognitive impairment for financial compensation, and four litigants that failed the TOMM also completed incidental recognition. Results: Patients accurately recognized an average of 89 % immediate, 92 % of delayed, and 90 % of total items. Malingerers were significantly less accurate, with 62 % immediate, 58 % delayed, and 60 % total items correct. A cutoff of 75 % correct accurately identified 87 % of the validation sample and all four litigants. Scores that were lower than those obtained by any patient with neurological disorder were obtained by 47 % of malingerers on delayed or total recognition. Three of four litigants scored more poorly than any patients. Conclusions: Incidental recognition of Similarities items may <b>identify</b> <b>exaggerated</b> memory difficulty.

30|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) has a potential {{role in the}} assessment of pericardial injuries in patients who survive the initial acute admission and are haemodynamically stable. The normal parietal pericardium is best visualised during systole on T 1 -weighted imaging, where it appears thin (< 2  mm) and returns low signal intensity. However, the normal parietal pericardium is often incompletely visualised. Cardiac MRI has been utilised to confirm the diagnosis of pericardial herniation and cardiac rupture following blunt trauma [23]. In the case presented by Sohn et al. [24], cine MR images in a coronal plane (using a breathhold balanced fast field echo sequence) <b>identified</b> <b>exaggerated</b> up and down motion of the cardiac apex which was distinct from the left hemi-diaphragm. In addition, there was clockwise rotation of the cardiac axis, and the finding of a large pericardial tear with cardiac herniation was confirmed intra-operatively. Like CT, cardiac MRI can be used to assess the pericardium, but it has the advantage of being able to assess cardiac motion and to assess the functional significance of pericardial injuries and effusions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) is {{important}} for combating bacterial infections in the lungs. Levels of NO in the lungs are regulated by L-arginine, arginases (ARG) and NO synthases (NOS). Expression levels of ARG and inducible NOS (iNOS) vary among different types of macrophages (M 0, M 1, M 2). Several events including infection, inflammation and tissue repair/resolution polarize macrophages (M 0) into either M 1 or M 2 types. In general, M 1 and M 2 macrophages express high levels of iNOS and ARG, respectively. Classically activated M 1 macrophages {{that are related to}} killing intracellular pathogens release TH 1 type cytokines (e. g., IFN, TNF, IL- 1, IL- 12) whereas the alternatively activated M 2 macrophages that are involved in humoral immune response release TH 2 type cytokines (e. g., IL- 4, IL- 10). Based on the activating cytokines, M 2 macrophages are further subdivided into M 2 a, M 2 b or M 2 c. Macrophage activation and polarization are also regulated by other soluble proteins such as the innate immune pattern-recognition collectins (collagenous lectins), surfactant protein (SP) -A and SP-D. These soluble defense molecules are known to recognize microbes, and agglutinate and/or form immune complexes to enhance pathogen clearance by macrophages. In the absence of SP-D, mouse alveolar macrophages show <b>exaggerated</b> <b>M</b> 1 -like phenotype. Certain microbial pathogens also modulate lung environment or macrophages to evade the nitric oxide-mediated immune response. In summary, interplay among microbes, cytokines, ARG, NOS and collectins regulate alveolar macrophage types and NO production in the lungs. The balance among these molecules appears to help eliminate microbial pathogens form the lungs with minimal inflammation...|$|R
