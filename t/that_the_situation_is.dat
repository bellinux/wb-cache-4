5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will {{no longer need to}} shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
5|$|With the Autobots gone, the Decepticons {{launch a}} {{full-scale}} assault on New York City, randomly annihilating buildings and causing mayhem {{as part of}} a simultaneous galaxy-wide assault. The initial human aerial counterattack is annihilated. Even opposed by Colonel Daniel Witwicky, the Decepticons decimate all further military assaults and destroy all bridges and tunnels leading into the city. The Decepticon assault moves to other cities in the country, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., as the Constructicons begin to build in what was once Manhattan. On Cybertron, the dispirited and beaten Autobots begin to fall apart as Ironhide clashes with Prowl over the traitor in their midst. Another group of Autobots under Kup's command crashed on the planet after the Decepticons gained the access codes, where it is revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> grave: Megatron has taken the Matrix. The humans attempt to send in a small commando team to assassinate Megatron, but the party is killed by Ratbat before even making across the river - all save their commander Spike. As the Decepticon assault spreads to other parts of Earth, the Decepticons begin to fall apart internally, with even Megatron worrying about the leadership challenges he will face now they have no enemy. The slaughter in Israel and Beijing worries other nations enough for them to contemplate using nuclear weapons on New York. On Cybertron the Swarm emerge, forcing the Autobots to flee once more.|$|E

For example, while smaller dinosaurs may have been true endotherms, the larger forms could have been inertial homeotherms, or many dinosaurs could have had intermediate metabolic rates.|$|E

25|$|Discourses in Tunisian Arabic {{are likely}} to use some rhetorical styles like metaphors. Furthermore, Tunisian Arabic styles and tenses hold several figurative {{meanings}}. For example, the use of past tense can mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> uncontrollable. As well, {{the use of the}} third person pronouns can be figurative to mean saints and/or supernatural beings and the use of demonstrative can have figurative meanings like underestimation. Moreover, the name of some parts of the body can be used in several expressions to get figurative meanings. That is entitled the embodiment.|$|E

25|$|Though {{their personalities}} differ at times, several of Naomi's issues {{parallel}} those of Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) {{from the original}} series. Early on in the show, she values her 'in-crowd' status and experiences repeated friction with a friend over a boy (as Kelly did). When Annie begins bonding with Ethan, Naomi reveals <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> likely to interfere with their friendship. Annie's eventual dismissal of this statement leads to a temporary rift between the girls. Also like Kelly, Naomi endures {{the experience of a}} family torn apart by adultery, and is later faced with the matter of an absent parent, as her mother departs town unexpectedly. After her parents have officially split, Naomi seeks temporary refuge in a hotel.|$|E

When Ned scolds Homer for allowing so many immoral activities to go on, Homer retorts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> Ned's fault as he has abused his power and literally played God over the town. Ned apologizes to the town for his interference, and he and Homer proceed to destroy all the cameras. The final scene reveals that Bakerbutcher has been using the footage to put together a British reality television series called The American Oafs, which Queen Elizabeth II enjoys watching because Ralph Wiggum reminds her of her son, Prince Charles.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts {{people who are not}} hired (or lose their jobs) when {{companies}} cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> much more complicated than the basic theory can account for. One complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets {{in the sense of the}} traditional 'company town,' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.|$|E

500|$|German {{scholars}} such as Brigitte Schön and Gerald Willms have {{commented that}} rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany: in their view, efforts to [...] "frame" [...] information {{in such a way}} as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities. In Schön's words, this includes both the [...] "efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong-worded statements" [...] and [...] "Scientology's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution"; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany, she adds that [...] "the American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes". Both Willms and Schön assert <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of Scientology. Schön as well as Irving Hexham, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada, have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars. Hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany, which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject, because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate.|$|E

500|$|Takumi {{found the}} game's first defendant, Larry Butz, to be {{particularly}} difficult to write, and had to re-write him several times. Originally, Larry {{was going to be}} an [...] "average Joe" [...] type of character, who only appeared in the game's fourth episode, but after his inclusion in the first episode, Suekane and Iwamoto told Takumi to give the character [...] "some oomph". Following this, Takumi wrote him as a [...] "prickly tough-guy" [...] who had the habit of telling people he was going to kill them. Some of the higher-ups at Capcom did not like this, so Takumi changed him into a character who laments his lot in life, saying [...] "I'm going to die!" [...] or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> killing him. The culprit of the third episode was originally going to be male, until Suekane pointed out that all villains in the game were male. The development team debated over what to do with the now female character; some staff members thought it would be odd to have a female character be the director of an action show, and some wondered what to do with the director role if she could not fill it. In the end, Takumi changed the scriptwriter character into a director, and made the culprit a [...] "strong, glamorous, fashionable, and cool-headed" [...] producer.|$|E
500|$|Susan meets Jim at the {{hospital}} and remembers him from the work he did on Lyn Scully's (Janet Andrewartha) house. They get talking and Jim reveals he just had a melanoma removed and he is a bit [...] "bewildered" [...] by {{the hospital}} process and Susan helps him out. Jim's condition grows worse and he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Susan learns he has no family and Woodburne said she instinctively wants to look after him. The actress said Susan crosses boundaries as she starts to neglect certain areas of her life, like her marriage. She tells Karl not to be selfish and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> not about him or her, it is about Jim. Woodburne explained to Channel 5 that Karl's reaction to Susan's friendship with Jim changes and he starts thinking he should not be selfish. However, when he notices his wife becoming more involved with Jim and neglecting her responsibilities, Karl gets angry as she is not thinking about anything else. Susan and Karl's eldest son, Malcolm, returns to Erinsborough to help his parents work through their issues. Woodburne thought Malcolm was initially on Susan's side because he can see she is helping someone who is ill, but as he looks more closely he understands why his father is so upset with Susan's behavior. Susan is upset when she misses Jim's last moments and blames Karl. They begin rowing, which becomes worse due to Susan's grief. Susan Hill of the Daily Star revealed Karl and Susan were to separate following a make-or-break holiday. Their decision leaves Malcolm devastated and he takes his anger out on his mother, but Karl then admits it was his decision to end the marriage. Woodburne said the Jim Dolan plot was [...] "a tremendous story which highlighted problems with Susan and Karl's marriage." [...] The actress said the storyline was challenging to play because it was emotional and she had to slap Fletcher. Of Susan's future, Woodburne said [...] "2012 will be a huge year of adjustment for Susan. She is now single and moves into an apartment of her own – and she has to find her own way. She discovers things about herself that will surprise people." ...|$|E
