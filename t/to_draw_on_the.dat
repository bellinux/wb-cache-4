5|$|Because he {{persistently}} programmed {{works that}} did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As {{a result of his}} estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, {{but it was not until}} father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> family fortune to promote opera.|$|E

It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981).

25|$|The {{significance}} of this conclusion {{is that it allows}} Davidson <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question can be answered affirmatively.|$|E
25|$|The FCC model {{predicts the}} {{specific}} form of reverse dominance display needed by female coalitions resisting would-be dominant or philanderer males. Females needed to signal 'No' by constructing themselves as inviolable using red cosmetics. To assert ritual power, {{they needed to}} go periodically on 'sex strike'. To defend themselves physically against harassment by non-kin males, defiant females needed <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> support of male kin—sons and brothers—as members of their reverse dominance coalitions. In order to reverse signals of sexual availability, it was logical to sing and dance an unmistakable message: 'Wrong species, wrong sex, wrong time!'. On this basis, FCC theory leads us to expect 'divine' or 'totemic' spiritual entities depicted in early rock art to be therianthropic ('wrong species'), gender-ambivalent ('wrong sex') and blood-red ('wrong time') (figure h).|$|E

25|$|The President, however, {{does not}} have the final say over certain decisions, as Parliament may {{override}} his veto with a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of all the elected MPs. For instance, this mechanism applies if the President vetoes key civil service appointments or withholds assent to bills that are likely <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nation's past reserves. A prerequisite for the exercise of the override mechanism is that the President must have disagreed with the recommendation of the Council of Presidential Advisers, which he is required consult before exercising these powers. The override mechanism shows that the President's discretionary powers pose no obstacle to a government which continues to enjoy untrammelled power so long as it controls a clear two-thirds parliamentary majority. The weaker the Government is, the stronger the presidential check is; and the stronger the Government, the weaker the presidential blocking mechanism.|$|E

500|$|Crawford lists {{numerous}} playwrights {{whose work}} owes {{something to that}} of Shaw. Among those active in Shaw's lifetime he includes Noël Coward, who based his early comedy The Young Idea on You Never Can Tell and continued <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> older man's works in later plays. T. S. Eliot, by no means an admirer of Shaw, admitted that the epilogue of Murder in the Cathedral, in which Becket's slayers explain their actions to the audience, might {{have been influenced by}} Saint Joan. The critic Eric Bentley comments that Eliot's later play The Confidential Clerk [...] "had all the earmarks of Shavianism... without the merits of the real Bernard Shaw". Among more recent British dramatists, Crawford marks Tom Stoppard as [...] "the most Shavian of contemporary playwrights"; Shaw's [...] "serious farce" [...] is continued in the works of Stoppard's contemporaries Alan Ayckbourn, Henry Livings and Peter Nichols.|$|E
500|$|By the Victorian {{period in}} the 19th century historians were more {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John's moral personality.

Historians in the [...] "Whiggish" [...] tradition, focusing on documents such as the Domesday Book and Magna Carta, trace a progressive and universalist course {{of political and economic}} development in England over the medieval period. These historians were often inclined to see John's reign, and his signing of Magna Carta in particular, as a positive step in the constitutional development of England, despite the flaws of the king himself. Winston Churchill, for example, argued that [...] "hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns".|$|E
500|$|Venezuela had in {{the course}} of the dispute {{repeatedly}} appealed to the US and to the Monroe Doctrine, but the US had declined to involve itself. This changed after Venezuela obtained the services of William L. Scruggs. Scruggs, a former US Ambassador to Colombia and Venezuela, was recruited in 1893 by the Venezuelan Government to operate on its behalf in Washington D.C. as a lobbyist and legal attache. Scruggs had apparently resigned his ambassadorship to Venezuela in December 1892, but in fact had been dismissed by the US for bribing the President of Venezuela. As a lobbyist, Scruggs published an October 1894 pamphlet entitled British Aggressions in Venezuela:, or the Monroe Doctrine on Trial. In the pamphlet, he attacked [...] "British aggression", claiming that Venezuela was anxious to arbitrate over the Venezuela/British Guiana border dispute. Scruggs also claimed that British policies in the disputed territory violated the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. Whilst for much of the nineteenth century the Doctrine had only rarely been invoked by the United States, a [...] "paradigm shift in U.S. foreign relations in the late nineteenth century" [...] saw the U.S. more actively support its increasingly significant economic interests in Central and South America. This [...] "'new diplomacy' thrust the United States more emphatically into the imperial struggle".
