5|$|The {{northern}} transept {{is named}} for Henry Gurdon Marquand, the benefactor of the Marquand Chapel, which {{burned to the ground}} in 1920 and which the present chapel was built to replace. An American flag flown by the USS Princeton hangs from the transept's north wall. The southern transept {{is named for}} Chester Alwyn Braman, the first donor to the University Chapel Fund. A staircase leads from the Braman Transept <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bright</b> Pulpit.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E

25|$|Yellow {{threads of}} their web shine like gold in sunlight. Xanthurenic acid, two quinones and an unknown fourth {{compound}} {{contribute to the}} yellow color. Experimental {{evidence suggests that the}} silk's color may serve a dual purpose: sunlit webs ensnare bees that are attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> yellow strands, whereas in shady spots the yellow blends in with background foliage to act as a camouflage. The spider is able to adjust pigment intensity relative to background light levels and color; the range of spectral reflectance is specifically adapted to insect vision.|$|E
25|$|In great {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> pristine {{nature of}} the stations, the dams are organic and entwined with the natural rock. They are generally arch dams, curved in plan, bearing onto the side walls of the valleys except in those dams where only {{one side of the}} valley is suitable for bearing. In these latter cases, the end of the dam straightens out, and the last section of gravity dam (where the weight of the dam itself resists the force of the water) then acts like a buttress to the more efficient arch dam.|$|E
25|$|Another {{etymology}} {{proposed by}} Nigidius Figulus is related by Macrobius: Ianus would be Apollo and Diana Iana, {{by the addition}} of a D for the sake of euphony. This explanation has been accepted by A. B. Cook and J. G. Frazer. It supports all the assimilations of Janus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> sky, the sun and the moon. It supposes a former *Dianus, formed on *dia- < *dy-eð2 from Indo-European root *dey- shine represented in Latin by dies day, Diovis and Iuppiter. However the form Dianus postulated by Nigidius is not attested.|$|E

30|$|However, {{the frontal}} bone is not <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel among <b>the</b> four pixels {{when the light}} source {{is far from the}} front. The side that faces the light is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel when <b>the</b> light source is {{completely}} from the side. Figure  2 b shows that <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel is not the frontal bone but the right side that faces the light. Therefore, the straight line from <b>the</b> center <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel is not the bridge of the nose. Under this condition, human eyes are nonsymmetrical relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> straight line from <b>the</b> center <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixels. Thus, JEER uses Step 2 (necessary condition for existence of the eye region area) to determine whether human eyes might be present in the possible areas of the eye region chosen by Step 1.|$|R
25|$|In the {{universities}} of the UK {{there are days}} called scarlet days or red letter days. On such days, doctors of the university may wear their scarlet 'festal' or full dress gowns instead of their undress ('black') gown. This is more significant for the ancient universities such as Oxford and Cambridge where academic dress is worn almost daily, the black undress gown being worn on normal occasions as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> red gowns. Since most universities have abandoned academic dress to the graduation ceremony (where doctors always wear scarlet), the significance of scarlet days has all but disappeared.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> lighting required).|$|E
25|$|Willing to {{give their}} {{children}} the best education possible, Victoria and her husband entrusted this task <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> but strict Calvinist philologist Georg Ernst Hinzpeter. Reputedly a liberal, Hinzpeter {{was in fact a}} staunch conservative who made William and Henry undergo a rigorous and puritanical upbringing, without praise or incentives. To complete their education, the princes were sent to a school in Kassel, despite the opposition of the King and court. Finally, William was enrolled at the University of Bonn, while his younger brother, who didn't show the same intellectual interests, was sent to the Navy at 16 years old. The education received by the children didn't allow them to have the open and liberal personalities that their parents wanted.|$|E

500|$|Calostoma is a genus of 29 {{species of}} gasteroid fungi in the {{suborder}} Sclerodermatineae. Like other gasteroid fungi, Calostoma {{do not have}} the spore discharge mechanism associated with typical gilled fungi (ballistospory), and instead have enclosed spore-bearing structures. Resembling round, orange to red gelatinous puffballs on thick stalks, species have been collected in regions of deciduous, temperate, tropical or subtropical forests. They have a worldwide distribution, including eastern North America, Asia, and Australasia. The common name given to some species, [...] "prettymouth", alludes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> red fruit bodies with openings that may somewhat resemble lips.|$|E
500|$|They have {{a rather}} frosty {{appearance}} {{with some of}} the guard hairs having pale tips with dark bands. The yellow-bellied marmot has a broad and flat skull, dark head, and a dark nose with a white furry patch. The pelage comprises coarse, long outerhairs and wooly, shorter underfurs. They have a brown coat, a white patch of fur on the snout in front of the eyes. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> yellow fur on their belly, sides of the neck, and throat, they get their scientific and common names. Their ears are small and round, measuring [...] in length, having a short white muzzle. Their back is reddish-brown in color with grizzled black and light-grey tan. Their feet is yellowish to dark brown to in color. They gain additional fat reserves in the autumn, in preparation for hibernation.|$|E
500|$|Another {{friend of}} Tripathi, Rashmi Pusalkar, {{designed}} the book cover {{according to his}} specifications, which were to keep a balance between reality and fantasy. Hence Pusalkar chose to just portray the back profile of Shiva, {{standing in front of}} a huge lake. Since Pusalkar had never designed any book covers before, she felt that the task was more daunting for her, and explained [...] "Shiva is a human of flesh and blood, he is not a God. The challenge was to show him as vulnerable. I portrayed him from the back, because Indian Gods are never seen from the back. He has battle scars and a sculpted physique." [...] Tripathi wanted the cover to have a symbolic meaning. The scenery behind Shiva's image is taken from Mount Kailash and Mansarovar Lake. He also created a clay model of the broken Pashupati seal, which was later photographed and used in the book inlay. The increasing brightness of the book covers, from the dull colors of The Immortals of Meluha <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> hue of The Oath of the Vayuputras, signified the triumph of good over evil, according to Tripathi.|$|E

500|$|Welders wear {{protective}} clothing, including {{light and}} thin leather gloves and protective long sleeve shirts with high collars, to avoid exposure to strong ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the absence}} of smoke in GTAW, the electric arc light is not covered by fumes and particulate matter as in stick welding or shielded metal arc welding, and thus is a great deal brighter, subjecting operators to strong ultraviolet light. The welding arc has a different range and strength of UV light wavelengths from sunlight, but the welder is very close to the source and the light intensity is very strong. Potential arc light damage includes accidental flashes to the eye or arc eye and skin damage similar to strong sunburn. [...] Operators wear opaque helmets with dark eye lenses and full head and neck coverage to prevent this exposure to UV light. Modern helmets often feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darkens upon exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> light of the struck arc. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
500|$|The Bohemian waxwing was {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Lanius Garrulus. The waxwings were moved to their own genus, Bombycilla, by Vieillot in 1808. The genus name Bombycilla comes from the Greek bombux, [...] "silk" [...] and the Modern Latin cilla, [...] "tail"; this is a direct translation of the German Seidenschwanz, [...] "silk-tail", and refers to the silky-soft plumage of the bird. The species name garrulus is the Latin for talkative and was applied to this bird, as [...] "Garrulus Bohemicus", by Conrad Gessner in 1555; the term is {{a reference to a}} supposed likeness to the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) rather than to the waxwing's vocalisations. The English name [...] "waxwing" [...] refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> red tips of the secondary feathers on its wings, which look like drops of sealing wax, while [...] "Bohemian" [...] follows Gessner's usage, and may refer to the Romani, alluding to the bird's wanderings, or to its presumed origin from Bohemia. [...] "Waxwing" [...] and [...] "Bohemian waxwing" [...] were first recorded in 1817, the former as a reference to Vieillot's separation of this bird from the [...] "chatterers".|$|E
