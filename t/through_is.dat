5|$|SH-32 {{continues}} {{east from}} Courtney, crossing over Mud Creek, then passing through unincorporated Rubottom. East of Rubottom, the highway {{comes to the}} intersection with SH-76. The next unincorporated community SH-32 passes <b>through</b> <b>is</b> Turner. Eight miles (13km) east of the SH-76 junction, at Dunbar, SH-32 serves as the northern terminus of SH-96, which serves Burneyville.|$|E
5|$|High-resolution {{images of}} Io {{acquired}} when Io is experiencing an eclipse reveal an aurora-like glow. As on Earth, {{this is due}} to particle radiation hitting the atmosphere, though in this case the charged particles come from Jupiter's magnetic field rather than the solar wind. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact Io's atmosphere. More electrons collide with its atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to Io (i.e. near the equator), because the column of gas they pass <b>through</b> <b>is</b> longest there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock with the changing orientation of Jupiter's tilted magnetic dipole. Fainter aurora from oxygen atoms along the limb of Io (the red glows in the image at right), and sodium atoms on Io's night-side (the green glows in the same image) have also been observed.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa County is {{the final}} Oklahoma county that both US-60 and US-69 will pass through. The two routes first pass through the town of Afton. The first highway {{junction}} in the county is with US-59, which concurs {{with the other two}} highways. Less than a mile north of the US-59 junction, the three highways pass through a cloverleaf interchange; proceeding north through this interchange places a motorist on US-59/US-69 bound for Miami, heading west leads to the toll booth for I-44, and turning east puts the motorist on US-60 eastbound. US-60, now with no other highways concurrent with it, will parallel the BNSF rail line for the remainder of its time in Oklahoma. The next town the route passes <b>through</b> <b>is</b> Fairland; here, it has a brief concurrency with SH-125. US-60 crosses the Neosho River (also known as the Grand River) into Twin Bridges State Park. Within the park, the highway serves as the southern terminus of SH-137. US-60 crosses the Spring River to exit the park. Northeast of Wyandotte, US-60 has a brief concurrency with SH-10. As it approaches the state line, US-60 Business splits from US-60, serving Seneca, Missouri. US-60 then leaves Oklahoma, continuing into Newton County, Missouri.|$|E

5|$|Scully, who doesn't want {{to abandon}} her Christmas plans, follows Mulder {{into the house}} to {{retrieve}} her car keys from him, and {{the door to the}} mansion slams shut. Inside the house, the agents experience strange phenomena: creaks are heard in the ceiling from the upper floor, and the shadow {{in the form of an}} old woman in a nightgown is seen, among other occurrences. Mulder and Scully reluctantly decide to investigate the floor above them. There, they find a massive library storing two corpses that have the same clothes and hairstyles as the agents, along with two gunshot wounds. They decide to go search other rooms, only to find that every door they walk <b>through</b> <b>is</b> the same library room they first entered. They then decide to split up, hoping to find a way out of the room.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him and stare at his idiosyncratic cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has been falling down the hole for years. Eventually, {{it turns out that}} the hole Jake and Seven are falling <b>through</b> <b>is</b> the chimney to the kitchen where Finn is being held captive. As such, Jake is eventually able to save Finn.|$|E
5|$|US-59 enters Oklahoma in Le Flore County, in the Ouachita National Forest, at {{the state}} line at Fogel, Arkansas. US-270 is {{concurrent}} with US-59 as it crosses the line. The two routes head westward from the state line, passing through a valley between Black Fork Mountain and Rich Mountain. The first Oklahoma town the two routes pass <b>through</b> <b>is</b> unincorporated Page. Northwest of town, US-59 and US-270 form the northern terminus of US-259, which heads south towards Longview, Texas and Nacogdoches, Texas crossing I-30 and I-20. After this junction, US-59 and US-270 curve around {{to the north and}} pass through the two small hamlets of Zoe and Stapp. US-59 and US-270 head north, paralleling the Black Fork Poteau River as they leave the national forest, into Hodgen. North of Hodgen, the highways cross the main branch of the Poteau River and pass through the Wister Wildlife Management Area. Upon landing on the north bank of the river, US-59 and US-270 curve to the northeast as they enter Heavener, where SH-128 terminates. On {{the north side of the}} town, US-270 splits away to the west. US-59 parallels the Kansas City Southern Railroad and passes Heavener Memorial Cemetery. The highway turns to the northwest, passing through Howe, and intersects with SH-83 at its northern terminus. North of this junction, US-59 crosses the Poteau River again.|$|E
