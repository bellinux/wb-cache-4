40|$|Two-dimensional {{flow past}} a {{cylinder}} {{close to a}} free surface at a Reynolds number of 180 is numerically investigated. The wake behaviour for Froude numbers between 0. 0 and 0. 7 and for gap ratios between 0. 1 and 5. 0 is examined. For low Froude numbers, where the surface deformation is minimal, the simulations reveal that this problem shares many features in common with flow past a cylinder close to a no-slip wall. This suggests that the flow is largely governed by geometrical constraints in the low-Froude-number limit. At Froude numbers in excess of 0. 3 – 0. 4, surface deformation becomes substantial. This {{can be traced to}} increases in the local Froude number to unity or higher in the gap between the cylinder and the surface. In turn, this is associated with supercritical to subcritical transitions in the near wake resulting in localized free-surface sharpening and wave breaking. Since surface vorticity is directly related to surface curvature, such high surface deformation results in significant surface vorticity, which can diffuse and then convect into the main flow, altering the development of Strouhal vortices from the <b>top</b> <b>shear</b> layer, affecting wake skewness and suppressing the absolute instability...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{pressure}} and wake velocity field fluctuations are investigated for a square cylinder {{mounted in the}} vicinity of a solid wall as functions of the boundary layer thickness and cylinder-to-wall gap heights for Reynolds numers between 20000 and 40000. The study focuses on the suppression of vortex shedding occurring around critical gap heights. Mean data are combined to identify three distinct flow regimes. Time and frequency analyses show that at large gap heights periodic vortex shedding is perturbed by underlying large-scale structures leading to phase jitter and long-term loss of correlation. For small gaps, {{there is no evidence of}} periodic motion. For intermediate gap heights, there is a gradual loss of correlation between the pressure field on the top and lower cylinder surfaces, which leads to periods of sinusoidal fluctuations interspersed with incoherent motion in the wake. It is found that the Reynolds number influence is negligible and that an increase in the boundary layer thickness results in a reduction of the critical gap height. Stability considerations suggest that a stable vortex street can only exist for a certain range of the <b>top</b> <b>shear</b> layer to bottom shear layer circulation ratio...|$|E

It {{is also available}} from [URL] time-dependent numerical model of a turbulent Mach 1. 5 flow over a rectangular cavity has been developed, to investigate suppression strategies for its natural self-sustained instability. This instability adversely affects the cavity form drag, it produces large-amplitude pressure oscillations in the enclosure {{and it is a}} source of far-field acoustic radiation. To suppress the natural flow instability, {{the leading edge of the}} two-dimensional cavity model is fitted with a simulated air jet that discharges in the downstream direction. The jet mass flow rate and nozzle depth are adjusted to attenuate the instability while minimising the control mass flow rate. The numerical predictions indicate that, at the selected inflow conditions, the configurations with the deepest nozzle (0. 75 of the cavity depth) give the most attenuation of the modelled instability, which is dominated by the cavity second mode. The jet affects both the unsteady pressure field and the vorticity distribution inside the enclosure, which are, together, key determinants of the cavity leading instability mode amplitude. The unsteadiness of the pressure field is reduced by the lifting of the cavity shear layer at the rear end above the trailing edge. This disrupts the formation of upstream travelling feed-back pressure waves and the generation of far-field noise. The deep nozzle also promotes a downstream bulk flow in the enclosure, running from the upstream vertical wall to the downstream one. This flow attenuates the large-scale clockwise recirculation that is present in the unsuppressed cavity flow. The same flow alters the <b>top</b> <b>shear</b> layer vorticity thickness and probably affects the convective growth of the shear layer cavity second mode...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the three dimensional characteristics of lightning flashes and severe storms observed in Central Florida during 1997 - 1998. The lightning time history of severe and tornadic storms were captured during the on-going ground validation campaign supporting the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) experiment on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). The ground validation campaign is a collaborative experiment {{that began in}} 1997 and involves scientists at the Global Hydrology and Climate Center, MIT/Lincoln Laboratories, and the NWS Forecast Office at Melbourne, FL. Lightning signatures that may provide potential early warning of severe storms are being evaluated by the forecasters at the NWS/MLB office. Severe storms with extreme flash rates sometimes exceeding 300 per minute and accompanying rapid increases in flash rate prior to {{the onset of the}} severe weather (hall, damaging winds, tornadoes) have been reported by Hodanish et al. and Williams et al. (1998 -this conference). We examine the co-evolving changes in storm structure (mass, echo <b>top,</b> <b>shear,</b> latent heat release) and kinematics associated with these extreme and rapid flash rate changes over time. The flash frequency and density are compared with the three dimensional radar reflectivity structure of the storm to help interpret the possible mechanisms producing the extreme and rapidly increasing flash rates. For two tornadic storms examined thus far, we find the burst of lightning is associated with the development of upper level rotation in the storm. In one case, the lightning burst follows the formation of a bounded weak echo region (BWER). The flash rates diminish with time as the rotation develops to the ground in conjunction with the decent of the reflectivity core. Our initial findings suggest the dramatic increase of flash rates is associated with a sudden and dramatic increase in storm updraft intensity which we hypothesize is stretching vertical vorticity as well as enhancing the development of the mixed phase region of the storm. We discuss the importance of these factors in producing both the observed extreme flash rates and the severe weather that follows in these storms and others to be presented...|$|E

40|$|Wave-modeling can be {{categorized}} in terms of different scales and theoretical frameworks. This dissertation focuses on the numerical modeling of wind-wave generation {{and its effects on}} wave growth and propagations. As categorized by scales and methodologies, wind-wave modeling in this dissertation covers two main topics: 1) Large-scale modeling: wind-wave development in real seas. As a phase-average model, SWAN is employed to study the wind-wave environment in the Persian Gulf and Qatar. The wind-wave generation is parameterized as source terms in a spectral model. The special wind condition, called shamal, is particularly investigated. An experimental tower is installed around Doha Port, and by using video imagery, the in situ wave features are extracted and compared. 2) Small-scale modeling: de-tailed wave development using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). A curvilinear surface-fitted moving grid model for three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is developed and used to simulate linear and non-linear waves with fully nonlinear surface conditions. Also, by simplifying it to a fixed rectilinear grid based on Cartesian formulations, a DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) model is developed with an air-water fully-coupled domain and improved coupled interface conditions. By using this DNS model, the detail of wind-wave generation is investigated from still water and the applied <b>top</b> <b>shear</b> wind. For the second topic, the CFD problems are solved by an in-house numerical tool, SPX. SPX is a general PDE (Partial Differential Equations) framework, developed by using C++ 1 y (shortened form of C++ 11 / 14 / 17), currently aiming at the structural domain. It is designed by modern software methodologies, such as generic programming, meta-programming and object-oriented programming. In addition, concept-based generic programming, an ongoing advanced software technology, is first introduced into the PDE numerical tool design. By using these modern design methodologies, all significant components used for solving PDE, particularly for fluid and wave problems, are all implemented in SPX. These components include high-performance numerical array, implicit solvers, grids, differential basis and operators, time integrators, and system infrastructures such as serializations and timer. On structured domain, a general PDE can be expressed by the arbitrary combination of any general differential operator and any arithmetic operator, which is the most challenging part of SPX design. This research proposes a general stencil operator design that integrates with the concept-based expression template. It is successfully demonstrated that the proposed design can automatically deduce the resulting stencils to represent the resulting field operator by giving an arbitrary PDE expression at any given grid point. With the deduced stencils, the user-defined PDE expression is therefore, numerically-solvable by using any solver. In consequence, SPX can be easily applied to any user-defined PDE problem on structural grids with arbitrary user-specified numerical components. Its design shows high flexibility and re-usability without sacrificing efficiency. The development of SPX, therefore, justifies the success of C++-Concept applications on the large-scale numerical framework design...|$|E
40|$|The mid-rise {{building}} with vertical combination of framing systems {{consists of a}} structural {{system in which the}} seismic-force-resisting-system (SFRS) of the upper structure is commonly a lightweight structural system such as cold-formed steel (CFS) frame or wood frame, while the SFRS associated with the lower one adopts a traditional structural system, such as reinforced concrete (RC) or structural steel frame. In current practice, the presence of: (a) vertical irregularities on mass and stiffness, and (b) damping difference between lower and upper structures creates challenges for the seismic design of such buildings. Presented in this thesis is research with aiming to solve the challenges arising from the foregoing two aspects in relatively simple and practical ways. Because of the mass irregularity in the vertical direction, the stiffness arrangement for the lower and upper structures in the combined framing system is quite {{different from that of the}} “regular” building. A simplified approach is proposed for the determination of storey-stiffness arrangements of such buildings based on the pre-determined mass distribution and specified storey drift limit. In addition, by considering both the mass and stiffness irregularities, two manually-based simplified methods, i. e., modified equivalent lateral force procedure (ELF) and two-stage analysis procedures, are proposed to evaluate seismic loads of the combined framing systems. The simplified approaches to determine the required storey-stiffness arrangements and compute seismic loads are developed based on the USA standard American Society of Civil Engineers 7 (ASCE 7) (ASCE, 2010) at first. Then, by considering the difference in seismic design provisions between ASCE 7 and the Canadian code National Building Code of Canada 2010 (NBCC 2010) (NBCC, 2010), several modifications are made on the simplified approaches based on ASCE 7 for their Canadian application. In the proposed approach to evaluate the storey-stiffness arrangements, the effects of the interaction between the lower and upper structures in terms of mass and stiffness on the seismic load are investigated. The feasible stiffness arrangements can be obtained based on the required relationship between the stiffness of the lower structure and that of the upper one determined by the proposed approach. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The result obtained from the proposed approach is justified by the code-specified modal response spectrum analysis. The two examples demonstrate that the relative seismic weight between the lower and upper structures has a significant influence on the required stiffnesses of the lower and upper structures. In general, when the number of the storey and total seismic weight associated with the lower structure are much greater than those of the upper one, the required stiffness of the upper structure will be greatly affected by the interaction between lower and upper structures in terms of mass and stiffness. On the other hand, if the number of the storey and total seismic weight associated with the lower structure are much smaller than those of the upper one, such interaction has less effect on the required stiffness of the upper structure. In such case, the required stiffness of the upper structure is based primarily on the characteristics of the upper structure. The modified ELF procedure is applied to the combined framing systems in which there is only one-storey upper structure. Both the applicable requirements and seismic load distributions associated with the modified ELF procedure are proposed. If the storey-stiffness ratio between lower and upper structures is less than a specific value designated as rkb 1, the lower structure is dominated primarily by the first mode and the traditional ELF procedure can be used to approximate the seismic load of the lower structure. However, the seismic load of the one-storey upper structure may still be underestimated as the behaviour of the upper structure may be dominated by higher vibration modes of the entire structure. Consequently, the shear force of the one-storey upper structure cannot be estimated based on the traditional ELF procedure. Equations for evaluating the shear force of the one-storey upper structure are presented in the modified ELF procedure. The two-stage analysis procedure prescribed in ASCE 7 (ASCE, 2006; 2010) ignores the interaction between lower and upper structures in terms of mass and stiffness and permits the lower and upper structure to be analyzed by the conventional ELF procedure, separately. New applicable requirements and seismic load distributions associated with the two-stage analysis procedures are proposed. The proposed procedure is compared with that prescribed in ASCE 7. It is found the stiffness requirement of ASCE 7 two-stage analysis procedure may be inappropriate, which may result in the underestimation of the base shear force of the upper structure in certain cases. Furthermore, the shear force for the top storey of the upper structure may also be considerably underestimated by the ASCE 7 two-stage analysis procedure. Therefore, an additional <b>top</b> <b>shear</b> force is to be applied to the top of upper structure. Equations to compute the additional <b>top</b> <b>shear</b> force are also provided. The accuracy of the proposed two-stage analysis procedure, either the one based on both ASCE 7 or the one based on NBCC 2010, is greatly improved compared to that prescribed in ASCE 7 (ASCE, 2006; 2010). Finally, damping difference between lower and upper structures in the combined framing system is investigated. By assuming the combined framing systems are classically damped, i. e., the damping matrix of the combined framing systems is orthogonal to the un-damped mode shape, an analytical method to approximate the equivalent modal damping ratio for the case where lower and upper structures have different damping ratios is proposed. However, as the combined framing system in fact is non-classically damped, if the lower and upper structures have different damping ratios, the proposed approximation of the equivalent modal damping ratio may lead to significant errors on seismic load in certain cases. Therefore, errors on seismic loads resulted from the classical damping approximation, which determine whether the proposed equivalent modal damping ratio is acceptable or not, are investigated. It is found large errors of seismic response associated with the proposed equivalent modal damping ratio usually occur when the dominating modes of the structures have closely spaced natural frequencies. However, for most combined framing systems in practice, the dominating modes have well separated natural frequencies and the proposed equivalent modal damping ratio is applicable to evaluate the seismic response of the combined framing systems. In addition, a new index of damping non-proportionality is suggested in this study to quantify the extent of non-proportional damping...|$|E

While, the resonance of heat transfer tube occur because the shedding frequency {{is similar to the}} natural frequency of tube. The coupling effect of vibration and temperature difference stress lead to the fatigue damage of tube. In ocean engineering, fatigue failure of marine risers due to flow-induced vibration {{is one of the most}} significant failure modes. Xue et al.

The effect of <b>top</b> velocity of <b>sheared</b> current, <b>top</b> tension, fluid density and the material of structure on the fatigue damage were discussed. Results reveal that the displacement of in-line vibration is much less than the value of cross-flow. However, there is a same important level for both fluid flows because high vibration frequency occurs in in-line vibration. The <b>top</b> velocity of <b>sheared</b> current plays a great role on the fatigue damage. The fatigue damage may be reduced 50 % owing to the 10 % reduction in <b>top</b> velocity of <b>sheared</b> current. Sun et al.

A typical apparatus has already been adopted by the current ASTM and NCMA test protocols and by literature studying of those test protocols, it is found that protocols recommend a fixed vertical actuator with roller or airbag configuration as a proposed vertical loading assembly. Previous research study demonstrated that vertical loading arrangement greatly influences the interface shear capacity of block systems and fixed vertical actuator with flexible airbag shows better loading arrangement for the blocks which have dilatant behavior. However, airbag arrangement is strenuous and time-consuming loading assembly compared to fixed vertical actuator which increases normal load with shear displacement due to bending of vertical actuator locked with the <b>top</b> block during <b>shear</b> loading.

5000|$|Shearer's Bar is {{the former}} name of a sports bar owned by Newcastle United and forming part of St James' Park, the team's stadium in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It was named in honour of the club's all-time <b>top</b> scorer, Alan <b>Shearer.</b> [...] The bar was renamed Nine in July 2013 by the club, who said that {{popularity}} of the venue had [...] "dwindled". The bar was opened in December 2004 and became {{an important part of}} the features at St James' Park. It is designed for the supporters and usually hosts up to 1000 people on a match-day. Since it opened it has become a city attraction and has won awards, including [...] "Best Bar None" [...] Award in 2007. The bar was refurbished in response to competition from The Terrace bar next door.|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) deep beams {{are usually}} used in tall buildings' or offshore structures. The presence of web opening in such beams {{can often be}} necessary to accommodate crucial services, for instance ventilating as well as air conditioning ducts. This research was conducted to {{study the effects of}} opening in RC deep beams with various sizes of Openings as a test parameter. The shape of choice is square opening. The square openings were placed at the <b>top</b> of <b>shear</b> span near support. A total six deep beams with same dimensions (100 mm x 500 mm) and the total length of 1200 mm were cast. Three control deep beams and the remaining deep beam with openings with size of 150 x 150 mm, 200 x 200 mm and 250 x 250 mm were studied. The beams were tested to failure under 4 -point bending. The results obtained from the test including load-deflection behaviour, and crack pattern. The reinforced concrete deep beams with openings develop shear-diagonal cracks at the openings corner, due to the stress concentration at sharp edges [...] The crack pattern development varies with opening sizes. The cracking development increased as the size of openings increased. The presence of openings in RC deep beams caused significant reduction in the beam strength. As compared to solid deep beam, the reduction of beam strength falls in the range of 43...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the Atlantic Ocean, the densest water mass Antarctic Bottom Water " AABW " {{can only}} cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from its southwestern to northeastern basins in limited, because deep, conduits. At the southwestern {{entrance}} {{of one of}} these, the equatorial Romanche Fracture Zone, AABW crosses a sill at 4550 m depth in a 7 km narrow channel before plunging into the deep. At the sill-slope, the rapidly flowing AABW causes shear-induced turbulent mixing with the overlying water masses. We present an excerpt of 1 Hz sampled, half-yearlong moored observations from 99 high-resolution temperature sensors that demonstrate and quantify the turbulence details. On <b>top</b> of quasi-steady <b>shear</b> flow, an internal tide modulates the mixing. Together, they constitute a means for an extremely long train of > 250 consecutive Kelvin-Helmholtz billows in a day that vary between 5 and 100 m in vertical scale...|$|R
40|$|Structural, thermobarometric, and thermochronologic {{investigations}} of the Kangmar Dome, southern Tibet, suggest that both extensional and contractional deformational histories are preserved within the dome. The dome is cored by an orthogneiss which is mantled by staurolite + kyanite zone metasedimentary rocks; metamorphic grade dies out up section and is defined {{by a series of}} concentric kyanite-in, staurolite-in, garnet-in, and chloritoid-in isograds. Three major deformational events, two older penetrative events and a younger doming event, are preserved. The oldest event, D 1, resulted in approximately E-W trending tight to isoclinal folds of bedding with an associated moderately to steeply north dipping axial planar foliation, S 1. The second event, D 2, resulted in a high strain mylonitic foliation, S 2, which defines the domal structure, and an associated approximately N-S trending stretching and mineral alignment lineation. Shear sense during formation of S 2 varied from dominantly <b>top</b> S <b>shear</b> on the south dipping flank of the dome to <b>top</b> N <b>shear</b> on the north dipping flank. The central part of the dome exhibits either opposing shear sense indicators or symmetric fabrics. Microtextural relations indicate that peak metamorphism occurred post-D 1 and pre- to early D 2 deformation. Quantitative thermobarometry yields peak metamorphic conditions of ∼ 445 °C and 370 MPa in garnet zone rocks, increasing to 625 °C and 860 MPa in staurolite + kyanite zone rocks. Pressures and temperatures increase with depth and northward within a single structural horizon across the dome and the apparent gradient in pressure is ∼ 20 % of the expected gradient, suggesting that the rocks were subvertically shortened after the pressure gradient was frozen in. Mica 40 Ar/ 39 Ar thermochronology yields 15. 24 ± 0. 05 to 10. 94 ± 0. 30 Ma cooling ages that increase with depth and young northward within a single structural horizon across the dome. Diffusion modeling of potassium feldspar 40 Ar/ 39 Ar spectra yield rapid cooling rates (∼ 10 – 30 °C/Myr) between ∼ 11. 5 and 10 Ma and apatite fission track ages range from 7. 9 ± 3. 0 to 4. 1 ± 1. 9 Ma, {{with a mean age of}} ∼ 5. 5 Ma. Both data sets show symmetric cooling across the dome between ∼ 11 and 5. 5 Ma. The S 2 mylonitic foliation, peak metamorphic isobars and isotherms, and mica 40 Ar/ 39 Ar isochrons are domed, whereas potassium feldspar 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and apatite fission track isochrons are not, suggesting that doming occurred at ∼ 11 Ma. Our data do not support simple, end-member metamorphic core complex-type extension, diapirism, or duplex models for gneiss dome formation. Rather, we suggest that the formation of extensional fabrics occurred within a zone of coaxial strain in the root zone of the Southern Tibetan Detachment System (STDS), implying that normal slip along the STDS and extensional fabrics within the Kangmar Dome were the result of gravitational collapse of overthickened crust. Subsequent doming during the middle Miocene is attributed to thrusting upward and southward over a north dipping ramp above cold Tethyan sediments. Middle Miocene thrust faulting in the Kangmar Dome region is synchronous with continued normal slip along the STDS and thrust motion along the Renbu Zedong thrust fault, suggesting that extension and contraction was occurring simultaneously within southern Tibet...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFully dynamic {{numerical}} simulations {{have been}} designed in order to asses how the orientation of mechanical layering in rocks controls the orientation of shear bands {{and the depth of}} penetration of strain in the footwall of detachment zones. Two parametric studies are presented. In the ﬁrst one, the inﬂuence of stratiﬁcation orientation on the occurrence and mode of strain localisation is tested. The second parametric study shows that results are length-scale independent and that orientation of shear bands is not sensitive to the viscosity contrast or the strain rate. Based on the results, a conceptual model for strain localisation under detachment faults is presented. In the early stages, strain localisation occurs at slow rates by viscous shear instabilities but as the layered media is exhumed, the temperature drops and the strong layers start yielding plastically, forming shear bands and localising strain at the <b>top</b> of the <b>shear</b> zone. Once strain localisation has occured, the deformation in the shear band becomes extremely penetrative but the strength cannot drop since the shear zone has a ﬁnite thickness...|$|R
40|$|Nonoptimal {{fluid flow}} {{patterns}} in the mold cause level fluctuations and excessive surface velocities at the <b>top</b> surface, which <b>shears</b> off and emulsifies liquid slag, leading to inclusions and other defects in the steel product. Physical water models are often used to investigate these phenomena. However of the solidifying shell, and the top-surface slag layer leads to {{significant differences in the}} flow behavior, relative to the real steel caster. Trying to include these effects presents other difficulties. Constructing smaller, scaled-down water models introduce further differences. These differences are investigated using computational models of both the water models and real casters. The Froude similarity criterion reasonably reproduces overall flow features for different scale models, so long as the flow regime stays fully turbulent. Flow in small scale water models behaves differently, if the flow regime becomes laminar. Neglecting the surface slag layer causes excessive surface velocities in a water model. Neglecting the solidifying shell causes unrealistic lower surface velocities and surface waves in the water model, especially for thinner cross sections. Thus, water models of thin slab casters may become unreliable...|$|R
40|$|Perth, Western Australia is a semi arid climate area. A soil {{characteristic}} at a near surface layer is relatively dry {{due to the}} deep water table, low humidity and high rate of evaporation. Subsurface exploration carried out in this study indicated that most soils in Perth are classified as poorly graded sand and remain dry along the year. Therefore, most Perth soils {{are considered to be}} in an unsaturated condition. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the unsaturated Perth soil properties. Conventional and modified direct shear apparatuses were utilized in the shear strength evaluation of the saturated and unsaturated Perth soils. Modification of the direct shear apparatus was conducted by attaching a low capacity tensiometer to the direct <b>shear</b> <b>top</b> cap to measure the matric suction of the soil samples. The results indicate that during shear, suction is relatively low for a range of saturation degree of 50 to 100 % and well within the tensiometer capacity, indicating that the modified direct shear apparatus is suitable for measuring the unsaturated poorly graded Perth sand...|$|R
