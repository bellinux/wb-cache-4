50|$|Modern {{attempts}} at classification have placed the Hysteriaceae in the Pseudosphaeriales, the Dothiorales, the Dothideales {{and in a}} separate order the Hysteriales, {{closely related to the}} Pleosporales. The Hysteriales were placed in the subclass Loculoascomycetes by Luttrell (1955), corresponding to the Ascoloculares first proposed by Nannfeldt (1932). Unlike the hymenoascomycetes, the loculoascomycete ascoma originates prior to karyogamy in the dikaryon, with the correlated character state being the functionally <b>two-walled</b> ascus which ruptures in a fissitunicate (like a Jack-in-the-box) fashion.|$|E
50|$|In {{a simple}} {{compression}} process, powder flows from a bin onto a <b>two-walled</b> channel and is repeatedly compressed vertically by a horizontally stationary punch. After stripping the compress from the conveyor, the compacted mass is introduced into a sintering furnace. An even easier {{approach is to}} spray powder onto a moving belt and sinter it without compression. However, good methods for stripping cold-pressed materials from moving belts are hard to find. One alternative that avoids the belt-stripping difficulty altogether is the manufacture of metal sheets using opposed hydraulic rams, although weakness lines across the sheet may arise during successive press operations.|$|E
50|$|Many {{years after}} his death, Kahn {{continues}} to provoke controversy. Before his Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park at {{the southern tip of}} Roosevelt Island was built, a New York Times editorial opined:There's a magic to the project. That the task is daunting makes it worthy of the man it honors, who guided the nation through the Depression, the New Deal and a world war. As for Mr. Kahn, he died in 1974, as he passed alone through New York City's Penn Station. In his briefcase were renderings of the memorial, his last completed plan.The editorial describes Kahn's plan as:...simple and elegant. Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt's defense of the Four Freedoms—of speech and religion, and from want and fear—he designed an open 'room and a garden' {{at the bottom of the}} island. Trees on either side form a 'V' defining a green space, and leading to a <b>two-walled</b> stone room at the water's edge that frames the United Nations and the rest of the skyline.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} [...] "any drink" [...] methods using bottles {{were similar}} to Hocus Pocus, simply on a smaller scale. Most variations used {{what appeared to be}} a bottle but was actually a tin container japanned (lacquered) green to appear like glass. The internal area is divided into sections and each one empties into a tube that ends just short of the neck. Very small holes drilled into the bottle allow them to be selected in the same fashion as Hocus Pocus, with the magician's hand holding the bottle so their fingers cover the holes; lifting one starts the pour. The tea kettle varieties simply moved the holes to the handle. A slight variation on the theme is the Magic Funnel, which uses a <b>two-walled</b> funnel holding liquid between the walls. The magician pours a small amount of liquid through the funnel as normal, but it continues to pour when they lift their finger from a hole on the handle.|$|E
40|$|During an arbuscular {{mycorrhiza}} fungal spore {{survey on}} a primary coastal sand-dune system in Goa {{on the west}} coast of India, entrophosporoid spores tightly covered with a dense hyphal mantle were recovered. When intact, the spores, at first sight, seemed to be identical in morphology to those of Sacculospora baltica (originally described as Entrophospora baltica) extracted from Polish maritime sand dunes and, to date, the sole member of the recently described genus Sacculospora in the new family Sacculosporaceae, phylum Glomeromycota. Later detailed morphological studies indicated that both fungi produce <b>two-walled</b> spores but the structure and phenotypic features of components of the outer spore wall in the novel fungus differ considerably from those of S. baltica. Differences between the fungi were subsequently confirmed in the phylogenetic analysis of SSU–ITS–LSU nrDNA sequences. Consequently, we describe the novel species as Sacculospora felinovii sp. nov...|$|E
40|$|Summary How the eye forms {{has been}} one of the {{fundamental}} issues in developmental biology. The retinal anlage first appears as the optic vesicle (OV) evaginating from the forebrain. Subsequently, its distal portion invaginates to form the <b>two-walled</b> optic cup, which develops into the outer pigmented and inner neurosensory layers of the retina. Recent work has shown that this optic-cup morphogenesis proceeds as a self-organizing activity without any extrinsic molecules. However, intrinsic factors that regulate this process have not been elucidated. Here we show that a LIM-homeobox gene, Lhx 1, normally expressed in the proximal region of the nascent OV, induces a second neurosensory retina formation from the outer pigmented retina when overexpressed in the chicken OV. Lhx 2, another LIM-homeobox gene supposed to be involved in early OV formation, could not substitute this function of Lhx 1, while Lhx 5, closely related to Lhx 1, could replace it. Conversely, knockdown of Lhx 1 expression by RNA interference resulted in the formation of a small or pigmented vesicle. These results suggest that the proximal region demarcated by Lhx 1 expression permits OV development, eventually dividing the two retinal domains...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the periodontal wound healing effect of particulate equine bone mineral on canine alveolar bone defects. Methods: Twelve adult male beagle dogs were used as study subjects. The mandibular second and fourth premolars were extracted prior to the experimental surgery, and the extraction sites were allowed to heal for 8 weeks. After periodontal probing, <b>two-walled</b> defects were created at the mesial and distal sides of the mandibular third premolars bilaterally, and the defects were filled with equine particulate bone with collagen membrane or bovine particulate bone with collagen membrane, or collagen membrane alone. The defects without any treatment served as negative controls. After probing depth measurement, animals were sacrificed at 10, 16, and 24 post-surgery weeks for micro-computed tomographic and histomorphometric analysis. Results: The equine particulate bone-inserted group showed significantly decreased values of probing depth and first bone contact compared to the negative control and collagen membrane alone groups at weeks 10, 16, and 24 (P < 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences}} in the new cementum length, newly-formed bone area, or newly-formed bone volume between equine particulate bone- and bovine particulate bone-inserted groups, both of which showed significantly increased values compared to the negative control and collagen membrane alone groups (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Equine particulate bone showed significant differences in probing depth, first bone contact, new cementum length, newly formed bone area, and bone volume fraction values when compared to the negative control and collagen membran...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the clinical outcome of infrabony defects following reconstructive surgery with the use of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) alone; TCP and citric acid (CA) root conditioning; and TCP, CA, and oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) membrane. Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine systemically healthy subjects with vertical infrabony defect were initially selected based on intraoral periapical radiographs and clinical examination to record probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). Only 21 defects revealed <b>two-walled</b> configuration on surgical debridement. These defects were selected and randomly allotted to the study groups. Group 1 defects were treated with TCP, group 2 with TCP+CA, and group 3 with TCP+CA+ORC. PPD, CAL, defect depth (DD), and level of alveolar crest (AC) were evaluated at the time of initial surgery and after 6 months at surgical re-entry. These measurements were utilized to calculate PPD reduction, CAL gain, defect fill (DF), %defect fill (%DF), and crestal resorption (CR). Statistical Analysis: A paired t-test was used for assessing changes in each group. Unpaired t-test was used for intergroup comparisons. Results: All three groups showed statistically significant PPD reduction, CAL gain, DF, and %DF, but insignificant CR at the end of 6 months. On intergroup comparison, no statistically significant differences were noted between the groups for all the parameters. Conclusion: Efficacy of combination techniques using TCP+CA; TCP+CA+ORC in treatment of periodontal infrabony defects is at least equal to that of TCP alone...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mucoperiosteal flap surgery stimulates varying {{amounts of}} {{alveolar}} bone loss due to accelerated osteoclastic activity [Regional Accelerated Phenomenon (RAP) ]. Alendronate sodium inhibits osteoclastic activity and {{is thought to}} result in a net increase in osteoblastic activity. We undertook a preliminary study evaluating the effect of adjunctive use of topically delivered bisphosphonate alendronate (ALN) along with regenerative bone graft material in the treatment of periodontal infrabony defects. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with <b>two-walled</b> or three-walled infrabony defects were selected. In each patient, the infrabony defect of one side of arch was designated as group A (control site) and received hydroxyapatite (HA) bone graft material, while the infrabony defect on the contralateral side of same arch was designated as group B (test site) and received HA + 200 μg drug solution of ALN. Results: Both the groups exhibited a highly significant reduction in probing depth and gain in clinical attachment level and linear bone fill at the end of 24 weeks. Comparative evaluation between the study groups revealed a statistically nonsignificant reduction in probing depth (P= 0. 128 NS) and mean gain in attachment level (P= 0. 218 NS). However, there was a statistically significant gain in linear bone fill (P= 0. 040 FNx 01) in group B as compared to group A. Conclusions: The results suggest that use of ALN along with graft material led to enhanced linear bone fill at the surgical site. This research provides a clue that bone-targeting properties of bisphosphonates can be harnessed along with regenerative materials to potentiate osseous regeneration...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{clinically}} and histologically evaluated healing of human intrabony defects following treatment {{with a combination}} of enamel matrix derivative (EMD) and bioactive glass (BG) or BG alone. Six patients displaying either combined one- and <b>two-walled</b> (five patients) or three-walled (one patient) intrabony defects around teeth scheduled for extraction were included. A notch was placed at the most apical extent of the calculus on the root surface to serve as a reference. Six months after surgery, the teeth or roots were extracted, together with some of their surrounding soft and hard tissues, and processed for histologic evaluation; a gain of clinical attachment was found in all cases. Healing in all three defects treated with EMD + BG was mainly characterized by new cementum with inserting collagen fibers and new periodontal ligament; most graft particles were surrounded by bone-like tissue, indicating ongoing mineralization. Treatment with BG resulted in epithelial down-growth and connective tissue encapsulation of the graft material in all three specimens. Reformation of cementum and periodontal ligament was observed in one of the specimens, limited to the most apical part of the defect. Formation of bone-like tissue around the graft particles was observed in only one of the three specimens treated with BG. Direct contact between the BG particles and root surface (cementum or dentin) was not observed in any of the six specimens. BG alone has low potential to facilitate periodontal regeneration. However, EMD + BG resulted in formation of new cementum with an associated periodontal ligament, as well as enhanced mineralization around the BG particles...|$|E
40|$|Long {{duration}} missions {{set high}} requirements for personalized astronaut support {{that takes into}} account the social, cognitive and affective state of the astronaut. Such support should be tested as thoroughly as possible before deployment into space. The in-orbit influences of the astronaut's state factors are hard to simulate on earth. Scenario-based evaluation might make the users feel as if they are in the eventual context of use, and are actually taking part in a scenario. In addition game-based evaluation can be used to simulate the space environment (e. g. planetary environment) in order to intensify this feeling. We investigated if evaluation of prototype systems in a game-based environment contributes to producing a more elaborate, in-depth and realistic user experience (cognitive task load, situation awareness, trust and emotion), better task involvement, valid performance and more realistic experience of events in the scenario. For testing our research question, we used the MECA (Mission Execution Crew Assistant) prototype that supports nominal and off-nominal operations taking into account, and adapting its support to, the cognitive and emotional state of its user, the task at hand and the environment. In an experiment, 25 participants played an astronaut role, exploring the Moon surface with a mobile device that provided the personalized support. One group was involved in a scenario-based evaluation, guided by a storyboard on a desktop-PC. The other group played the same scenario in a game-based evaluation, in which the environment was depicted on a <b>two-walled</b> cave. In the game-based evaluation, the participants showed higher arousal levels where expected, a more intense feeling of presence, better situational awareness, higher mental effort and faster performance when needed. So, a game-based evaluation seems to better address the social and affective aspects of the space mission. Consequently, we continued to apply this method to test a next MECA prototype version in a more elaborate multi-person scenario. In this evaluation, fifteen persons participated. Two participants played different astronaut roles concurrently, one in the habitat and the other on EVA. Additional virtual astronauts and rovers were present. The participants were very positive on the MECA support, and noted {{that there is a need}} for such support in the envisioned scenario and environmental conditions. Interesting was that the game-based participants were more positive about MECA's monitoring of cognitive load and emotional state than the scenario-based participants. Research is planned to study more long-term effects on the use of personalized support, for example during refreshment training in a game-environment in the Mars 500 program...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the effekt of the ceramic β-tricalciumphosphat (β-TCP) in the treatment of maxillofacial defects by the means of clinical, radiological and histological parameters. It should be determinded whether a secondary graft harvesting intervention that increases the surgical risk can be avoided by using this material. Between October 2004 and February 2006, 21 patients aged 7 to 85 years (mean age: 45, 1 years) from our clinic were included in the study. The patients presented with traumatic bone defects of the mandible (n= 7), bone defects after ablative tumor surgery (n= 5), bone cysts (n= 4) and other bone defects (n= 5) that were reconstructed with β-TCP granules. Defect size varied between 2 cm 3 and 4 cm 3. Postoperative clinical course controls and radiological controls (orthopantomogram) were performed in defined time intervals. From four patients a total of seven bone samples were obtained for histological evaluation. Postoperative wound healing was complication-free in most patients with traumatic bone defects (86 % normal wound healing). Good results could also be obtained in patients with cystic bone defects (100 % normal wound healing). In patients with bone defects after tumor surgery it came to impaired wound healing with subsequent implant loss or secondary wound healing in three cases (60 %). By means of Fisher´s exact test a significant association between impaired wound healing and tumor defects was shown (tumor vs. trauma, cyst, other: p = 0, 028). The chance to have normal wound healing was 22 times higher in non-tumor defects (Odds Ratio= 22, 5 / 95 %-CI=[2, 2; 233, 7]) than in defects resulting from tumor ablation. In the group of patients with other bone defects, clinical results were throughout positive (100 % normal wound healing). This points to the fact defects with a size of 2 to 3 cm 3 which are predominant in this group can be effectively reconstructed with β-TCP. However, statistically significant association between the defect size and postoperative wound healing (2 cm 3 vs. 3 - 4 cm 3) could not be shown (Fisher´s exact test, p= 0, 090). Radiological monitoring of augmentation volume and density and clinical examinations showed volume loss of the implant in the later follow-up (53, 8 % respectively 38, 9 % of examined cases). This points {{to the fact that the}} new bone formation may stay behind resorption of β-TCP, in particular in larger defects with 4 cm 3 size. Histological evaluations of the hard-tissue biopsies disclosed vital woven bone and in places lamellar bone what was a sign for ongoing physiological remodeling activity. At the time of metal removal after 6, 5 to 8 months a bone-like structure and stability in the augmented sites could be detected in all cases. Despite partial volume loss of the β-TCP-implant, it is assumed that defect augmentation with β-TCP provides a sufficient bone consolidation. Conclusion: The presented results show that with adequate soft-tissue coverage good clinical results can be obtained in up to 4 cm 3 large <b>two-walled</b> traumatic defects in combination with a function-stable osteosynthesis even without the admixture of autologous bone. Also cystic defects up to 4 cm 3 and other small defects up to 2 cm 3 can be reconstructed with β-TCP. Bone defects after surgical tumor ablation should not be augmented with β-TCP because of to frequent wound healing problems seen in {{this investigation}}. Free or vascular autologous transplants should be given preference as further therapy options in this case...|$|E
