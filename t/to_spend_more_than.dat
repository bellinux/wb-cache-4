5|$|The {{scenes of}} walrus, bowhead whale, and caribou hunting are all real. Because the hunting season for caribou, polar bear, walrus, and whale {{occur at the}} same time, the {{production}} was forced <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{a year in the}} Arctic (covering two hunting seasons) {{in order to get the}} necessary footage.|$|E

5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is not permitted <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $600,000 or 30 cents {{for each person}} on the electoral register, whichever is the greater amount. For the 2017 election, {{based on the number}} of electors as at 28 August 2017, {{the election}} expenses limit was $754,982.40. It amounts to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, the Walt Disney Studios {{acquired}} the film rights to Evita, and Glenn Gordon Caron {{was hired to}} direct the film, with Madonna set {{to appear in the}} lead role. Disney was to produce the film under its adult film label Hollywood Pictures. Although Disney had spent $2–3 million in development costs, it canceled the plans in May 1991 when the budget climbed to $30 million. Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg did not want <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $25.7 million on the film. In November 1993, Stigwood sold the film rights to Andrew G. Vajna's production company Cinergi Pictures. Vajna later enlisted Arnon Milchan of Regency Enterprises as a co-financier, and Stone returned as the film's director after meeting with Dan Halsted, the senior vice president of Hollywood Pictures. Production was set to begin sometime in 1995 after Stone and Milchan concluded filming of Noriega, a film chronicling the life of Panamanian general and dictator Manuel Noriega. Stone and Milchan disputed over the high production costs of Evita, Noriega (which was never filmed) and Nixon (1995), resulting in Stone leaving the project in July 1994.|$|E
5|$|Two more {{nuclear tests}} were {{conducted}} in the Monte Bello Islands as part of Operation Mosaic in 1956, the detonations taking place on Alpha and Trimouille Islands. By the 1980s the radioactivity had decayed {{to the point where}} it was no longer hazardous to the casual visitor, but there were still radioactive metal fragments containing cobalt-60, the remains of Plym. The island remained a prohibited area until 1992. A 2006 zoological survey found that the wildlife had recovered, and that the Aprasia rostrata, the legless lizard discovered by Hill, was not extinct. As part of the Gorgon gas project, rats and feral cats were eradicated from the Monte Bello Islands in 2009, and birds and marsupials were transplanted from nearby Barrow Island to Hermite Island. Today, the Monte Bello Islands are a park. Visitors are advised not <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an hour per day at the test sites, or to take relics of the tests as souvenirs. A pyramid-shaped obelisk marks the site of the explosion on Alpha Island.|$|E

25|$|A major {{criticism}} of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the emergence of gulf between the Premier League and the First Division. Criticism of the gap between clubs has continued, nevertheless, due to some clubs' increasing ability <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the other Premier League clubs.

25|$|The 1905 Revolution had a {{profound}} impact on Gippius.

25|$|Ney's {{opponent}} in the November general election was to be Zack Space, a Dover, Ohio lawyer and hotel developer.

For {{the first three months of}} 2006, Ney blamed legal costs for causing his re-election campaign <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> it raised. For the April–June period, it was unusually intense campaigning in his rural district that caused the six-term incumbent to spend $52,675 more than donors gave him in the last three months, he said.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s Vaile was {{involved}} in the Star route scandal. Charged with defrauding the government, he faced two trials, in 1882 and 1883: both of them ended in a not guilty verdict, but Vaile had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $100,000 in trial expenses. In February 1883, while he was in Washington, D.C., his wife Sophia, who had been diagnosed with stomach cancer, was found dead at home from a morphine overdose, in what was a case of suspected suicide. Vaile occupied the mansion until his death in 1895; immediately thereafter, his heirs contested ownership of the estate in a legal battle that lasted five years.|$|E
25|$|Gonzalez {{retained}} {{his place}} in the Niort first-team {{for the start of the}} 2007–08 season. He scored the only goal of the match in the 1–0 win against Montpellier on 24 August 2007. However, he suffered two broken ribs in the match and had to be replaced by Djibril Konaté at half time. The injury forced him <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two months out of the side, returning to the team for the 0–1 loss to Clermont Foot on 2 November. Gonzalez scored only once between November 2007 and May 2008 as Niort struggled in the league, occupying a relegation place for some part of the season. He netted his first goal in over eight months when he scored the third in a 3–0 win against Dijon on 2 May 2008. He was on the scoresheet again in the following match, opening the scoring in the 2–0 victory over Ajaccio. Niort entered the final match of the season against US Boulogne requiring a win or a draw to avoid relegation. Gonzalez was booked in the game and replaced by Benoît Leroy in the 68th minute while the match was still goalless. The team appeared to have done enough, but Boulogne scored in the third minute of injury time to relegate Niort to the Championnat National, meaning that Gonzalez would play in the third tier of French football for the first time in his career.|$|E

5000|$|Canada's system {{began in}} December 2002, when Alberta {{launched}} the first province-wide system.

We hope {{we never have to}} use it, but if a child is abducted Amber Alert is another tool police can use to find them and help them bring the child home safely." [...] The Alberta government committed <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> CA$1 million <b>to</b> expanding the province's emergency warning system so that it could be used effectively for Amber Alerts. [...] Other Canadian provinces soon adopted the system, and by May 2004, Saskatchewan was the only province that had not established an Amber Alert system. Within the next year, the program was in use throughout the country.|$|R
500|$|Wright was <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{ten years}} in Rome. During that time became an {{accomplished}} linguist {{as well as an}} established art connoisseur. He also became prosperous enough to build up a substantial collection of books, prints, paintings, gems and medals, including works attributed to Mantegna, Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian and Correggio. He acquired some forty paintings – perhaps as much through dealing as collecting. Richard Symonds, the amateur painter and royalist, catalogued Wright's collection in the early 1650s (and interestingly designated him as [...] "Scotus").|$|E

More recently, twice and even three times that amount has been paid for an exceptional work. Those pieces not retained by the museum are included in a [...] "Rejection Collection" [...] that may be sold at auction. In the past, some proceeds went to the Salvation Army for providing so many of MOBA's pieces; the museum itself usually benefits from most auctions.|$|E
500|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Mark R. Freeman, Assistant to the Solicitor General.

[...] Due to the lack of sufficient funding, the Secretary of the Interior has distributed the available funds on a pro rata basis among all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] The United States also pointed out that the Constitution prohibits payments unless those payments have been appropriated or authorized by Congress. [...] Freeman argued that the government's liability does not extend past {{the amount of money that}} Congress has appropriated for all of the contracts.
