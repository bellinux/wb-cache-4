5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil and {{constant}} devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> three lines of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly of sand and clay, were reinforced with gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{takes an}} {{interest}} in Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) but refuses to date him. Whitney applies for a new work experience at the local nursery which she later gets. When Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) tells his brother Tyler about Whitney's recent ordeal, he rejects her but later gives her his special Moon pendant <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Whitney agrees {{to go on a}} date with Tyler and they agree to have sex but Whitney is unsure as she remembers her past and runs out, telling Tyler she never wants to see him again. Tyler is hurt. He later tells Fatboy she needs a shrink which Whitney overhears. She runs out and kisses Fatboy and starts a relationship with him. Fatboy publicly declares his love for Whitney, but when he is unable to give her a driving lesson, Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) suggests that Tyler do it, because she knows that Tyler likes Whitney. Whitney starts to feel smothered by Fatboy's affections. Lucy teases Tyler by telling him that Fatboy plans to publicly propose to Whitney, so Tyler tells Whitney he likes her but Whitney says it is too late. Tyler then surprises Whitney by kissing her. Whitney, feeling guilty, refuses to go on holiday with Fatboy, and tells him to kiss her. He does, but she says it is like kissing her best friend. She then admits she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. Whitney then goes to see Tyler but finds him with Lucy, kissing. She then tells Tyler to leave her alone. However, Tyler later tells Whitney that he cannot, as he loves her. Whitney admits to feeling the same way, and they begin a relationship.|$|E

25|$|Forces {{under the}} command of the Mongol Empire were trained, organized, and {{equipped}} for mobility and speed. Mongol soldiers were more lightly armored than many of the armies they faced but were able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> with maneuverability. Each Mongol warrior would usually travel with multiple horses, allowing him to quickly switch to a fresh mount as needed. In addition, soldiers of the Mongol army functioned independently of supply lines, considerably speeding up army movement.|$|E
25|$|A typical episode {{generally}} {{follows a}} simple formula: Beaver or Wally (or both) {{get into a}} scrape and then face their parents for a lecture regarding the event. Lectures sometimes {{take the form of}} fables, with Ward allowing the boys to discover their moral meanings and applying those meanings to their lives. Occasionally, when offenses are serious, punishments such as being grounded are dealt the miscreants. The parents are sometimes shown debating the best approach to the situation. Other episodes (especially in earlier seasons) even reverse the formula, with Ward making a parenting mistake and having to figure out how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Abrash {{committed}} his division's 78th Armored Brigade in {{the northern}} sector at 22:00. He was behind schedule, but expected <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> if the 78th Brigade could reach and secure the Kuneitra-Mas'ade Road, {{four and a half}} kilometres west of its starting line. It was believed that achieving this mission would cause the Israeli defenses to collapse. Each of the 82nd Brigade's ninety-five T-55's tanks was equipped with a specially designed infrared nightscope. The night was brightly moonlit. The 82nd Brigade moved up the valley just two and a half kilometres from the Kuneitra-Masada Road. Ben Gal used his artillery for illumination, and ordered his men to remain silent until the Syrians were well within range. By 22:00, the Syrian tanks were within 800 meters of the Israeli positions. Both sides lost tanks to the terrain. Captain Yair Swet, a 77th Battalion company commander, was ordered to move to Booster and lost two tanks as a result. One crew managed to extricate its tank and use it to pull the other, but the delay distracted the battalion.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{military}} had officially barred or restricted the recruitment of Aborigines in earlier periods, these impediments were significantly relaxed after Japan entered World WarII, and Australia came under direct attack for the first time. Waters volunteered for service in the RAAF on 24August 1942, at Brisbane, and was accepted. He began training as an aircraft mechanic, but later volunteered for flying service, and commenced initial training at Somers, Victoria, in December 1943. The aircrew interviewer thought he looked [...] "a bit rough" [...] but [...] "should make a fighter". Waters believed his lack of education would be a disadvantage, and studied nights <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Keen to be a pilot, he was concerned {{that he would be}} allocated to duty as a wireless operator because he showed an aptitude for Morse transmission early on. He was also asked to imagine himself as the tail gunner in a Lancaster or Halifax heavy bomber, to which he replied, [...] "I had a very disappointed look on my face, sir!" [...] So convinced was he that he would not achieve his dream of becoming an aviator, Waters made three separate bets against himself being selected, and had to pay out £15 when he was nevertheless chosen.|$|E
500|$|The character's {{role in the}} anime {{adaptation}} of Persona 4 earned similar response. A reviewer from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews commented that Yu [...] "seems to be the aggregate of all the quirkiest possible choices you could make in the game," [...] making him likable character for his diverse scenes. When first watching the Persona 4 anime, Elliot Page from UK Anime Network noted that although Yu was not a silent character as in the video game, he had little dialogue and the pacing managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> In a later review, Andy Hanley from the same site said he liked how the protagonist was handled, as the staff used his [...] "blank state" [...] to create comedic interactions. Briana Lawrence from the Fandom Post shared similar feelings, stating that the staff [...] "somehow managed to give a silent protagonist a personality that's not only believable, but likable." [...] Lawrence appreciated how the character was developed across the series thanks to all the bonds he forms into a [...] "snarky, lovable main character who can keep a straight face while being kicked off a cliff." [...] While also commenting how Yu manages to reinforce both the comical and [...] "spooky" [...] elements of the plot, Blu-ray's Jeffrey Kauffman noted he [...] "remains something of a cipher throughout the series" [...] {{with the possibility of}} having the viewer relate with him.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, {{but it could have been}} so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure." [...] The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.|$|E

[...] Rob Copsey wrote for the Official Charts Company that 'One Last Time' [...] "suits her better than you’d think, [...] the singer reign in her powerful pipes on this breezy and wistful club track." [...] while Anne Zaleski of The A.V. Club thought the song [...] "channels a more powerful version of On The 6-era Jennifer Lopez," [...] also calling it an [...] "electronica-dusted [...]" [...] AXS's Lucas Villa praised her performance for [...] "exud sincerity and grace" [...] and added that [...] "his baby-come-back tune showcases a softer side to the singer that highlights her dulcet vocals." [...] FDRMX writer John Mychal Feraren gave [...] "One Last Time" [...] a rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "an excellent addition to her list of hit songs" [...] and claiming that [...] "its astounding musical production is effortlessly matched by [...] singer's sultry voice [...] transform an empty song into a masterpiece." [...] PPcorn.com went out to describe the song as [...] "an excellent addition to her list of hit songs", declaring: [...] "after the lyrical ambivalence of 'Love Me Harder', here comes a song that actually means something. It's about admitting your shortcomings in a previous relationship, and trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> However, doesn't it sound a bit pathetic when your ex-lover tells you, 'Need {{to be the one who}} takes you home / One more time / I promise after that, I'll let you go.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The root of one's {{intention}} is what conditions an action {{to be good}} or bad. There are three good roots (non-attachment, benevolence, and understanding) and three negative roots (greed, hatred and delusion). Actions which produce good outcomes are termed [...] "merit" [...] (puñña - fruitful, auspicious) and obtaining merit is an important goal of lay Buddhist practice. The early Buddhist texts mention three 'bases for effecting karmic fruitfulness’ (puñña-kiriya-vatthus): giving (dana), moral virtue (sila) and meditation. One's state of mind while performing good actions is seen as {{more important than the}} action itself. The Buddhist Sangha is seen as the most meritorious [...] "field of merit". Negative actions accumulate bad karmic results, though one's regret and attempts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> can ameliorate these results.|$|E

Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Ryan Blaney, Jimmie Johnson and Elliott all suffered damage in the wreck. Busch said afterwards {{that he thought he}} [...] "just missed the bottom groove by a few inches, got loose and the wreck was on. The way that our car was restarting it felt comfortable, it felt good. That inside with the rosin and the VHT, if you don’t hit it exactly right you lose a lot of time.
