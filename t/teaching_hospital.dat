40|$|We {{consider}} {{the impact of}} cohort turnover—the planned simultaneous exit {{of a large number}} of experienced employees and a similarly sized entry of new workers—on productivity in the context of <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Specifically, we examine the impact of the annual July turnover of residents in American <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> on levels of resource utilization and quality in <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> relative to a control group of non-teaching hospitals. We find that, despite the anticipated nature of the cohort turnover and the supervisory structures that exist in <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals,</b> this annual cohort turnover results in increased resource utilization (i. e., longer length of hospital stay) for both minor and major <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals,</b> and decreased quality (i. e., higher mortality rates) for major <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Particularly in major <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals,</b> we find evidence of a gradual trend of decreasing performance that begins several months before the actual cohort turnover and may result from a transition of responsibilities at major <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> in anticipation of the cohort turnover...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> have {{to balance}} patient and learner needs in their daily routines. To respond to these challenges, {{non-profit}} hospitals may perform differently than public and for-profit hospitals because of their non-distribution constraint. Purposes: This study analyzes patient satisfaction data of non-profit <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> in comparison to <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> with for-profit and public ownership status. Patient satisfaction {{is assumed to be}} an indicator of how patient needs are met regardless of the teaching goals. Approach: The average patient satisfaction ratings for German hospitals (n[*]=[*] 1461) that were published on the ‘klinikbewertungen. de’ German hospital rating platform were collected for a cross-section analysis. Findings: The data show that non-profit <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> are better rated than for-profit and public <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Non-profit hospitals seem to be more competent in handling the balance between societies’ needs for clinical training and patient needs for a favorable service experience. Practice implications: For-profits hospitals should revisit their business model once they get involved in the provision of public values such as education...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} labor {{turnover}} on productivity {{has received a}} great deal of attention in the literature on organizations. We consider the impact of cohort turnover [...] the simultaneous exit of a large number of experienced employees and a similarly sized entry of new workers [...] on productivity in the context of <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals.</b> In particular, we examine the impact of the annual July turnover of house staff (i. e., residents and fellows) in American <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> on levels of resource utilization (measured by risk-adjusted length of hospital stay) and quality (measured by risk-adjusted mortality rates). Using patient-level data from roughly 700 hospitals per year over the period from 1993 to 2001, we compare monthly trends in length of stay and mortality for <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> to those for non-teaching hospitals, which, by definition, do not experience systematic turnover in July. We find that the annual house-staff turnover results in increased resource utilization (i. e., higher risk-adjusted length of hospital stay) for both minor and major <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> and decreased quality (i. e., higher risk-adjusted mortality rates) for major <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Further, these effects with respect to mortality are not monotonically increasing in a hospital's reliance on residents for the provision of care. In fact, the most-intensive <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> manage to avoid significant effects on mortality following this turnover. We provide a preliminary examination of the roles of supervision and worker ability in explaining the ability of the most-intensive <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> to reduce turnover's negative effect on performance. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To detect {{differences}} in the education and workload of preregistration house officers working in <b>teaching</b> and non-teaching <b>hospitals.</b> DESIGN [...] A postal questionnaire.

RESULTS [...] Response rate was 61 % for <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> and 73 % for non-teaching hospitals. House officers in <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> had significantly fewer inpatients under their care (house physicians 16. 9 v 22. 9, house surgeons 17. 9 v 20. 3) and admitted fewer emergency patients per week (house physicians 7. 7 v 12. 7, house surgeons 6. 5 v 9. 8). More house officers in <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{reported that they had}} too few patients to provide adequate clinical experience.

CONCLUSION [...] Preregistration house officer posts at <b>teaching</b> <b>hospitals</b> provide less clinical activity and are perceived as less educationally satisfactory by their holders than those elsewhere...|$|R

5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro <b>Teaching</b> <b>Hospital</b> in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E
