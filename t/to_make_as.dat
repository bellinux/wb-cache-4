5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} {{has been}} done {{in many parts of the}} world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Allenby's {{plan for}} 13 November {{was to turn}} the right flank of the Ottoman line on the coast despite {{aircraft}} and cavalry reconnaissances revealing a considerable Ottoman force further inland on the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's own right flank. He assigned the task of dealing with this immediate threat to the Australian Mounted Division, which was ordered <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> big a demonstration of their operations as possible. This would further focus Ottoman {{attention away from the}} coastal sector where the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would advance northwards to attempt to turn the Ottoman right flank assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre the following day.|$|E

Gabe Newell, founder and president of Valve Corporation, added that it was an easy decision for the company <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> <b>as</b> they had high expectations for Left 4 Dead and considered themselves having a long-term relationship with Turtle Rock. After being acquired by Valve, Turtle Rock served as Valve's in-house satellite development team, and was renamed Valve South.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} {{version of}} the game {{was based on a}} popular online version from GSN's website. In this version, the online player has five minutes <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> many hands of 21 as they can using four columns. The player can play a card in any of their columns as long as the subsequent total is 21 or less; if the card cannot be played in any column, it must be discarded. Playing exactly five cards in a column earns the player a bonus, while the jacks of spades and clubs allow any column to be cleared no matter what.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr was {{challenging}} for Dreyer <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> {{it was his}} first sound film and had to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with silent film-styled title cards. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The audio editing was done in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were added to the film.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} workload—Hay {{wrote that he}} was busy 20 hours a day—he tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> normal a life as possible, eating his meals with Nicolay at Willard's Hotel, going to the theatre with Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and reading Les Misérables in French. Hay, still in his early 20s, spent time both in barrooms and at cultured get-togethers {{in the homes of}} Washington's elite. The two {{secretaries}} often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln's salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses. Despite the secretaries' objections, Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor and managed to spend almost 70% of her husband's salary in his four years in office.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley {{opened on}} December 15, 1930. Originally envisioned as a {{vaudeville}} venue, {{it was built}} by Frederick Guest, owner of a chain of theatres in Ontario, who reportedly {{fell in love with}} Vancouver and decided to build his dream theatre there. He hired Henry Holdsby Simmonds as the architect, who designed it with a neoclassical interior and an Art Deco exterior, with seating for 1,216 people. In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> high quality a theatre as possible, Simmonds used only the best materials he could find, including tindle stone from Winnipeg and tiles from Italy, along with chandeliers, carpets and furnishings from local merchants. Like the Stanley Cup and Stanley Park, the theatre was named after Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley.|$|E
5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} {{electric}} fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised {{by a set}} of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is {{the same as that of}} the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.|$|E

25|$|The {{essence of}} the D/L method is 'resources'. Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to use <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>as</b> many runs as possible: the number of overs they have to receive; {{and the number of}} wickets they have in hand. At any point in any innings, a team's ability to score more runs depends on the {{combination}} of these two resources. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.|$|E
