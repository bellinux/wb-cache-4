This measurement is based on polar method and it allows to get the spatial coordinates of points in 3 D local system.

50|$|The {{horizontal}} {{distance is}} inferred from the vertical angle included between two well-defined {{points on the}} staff and the known vertical distance between them. Alternatively, also by readings of the staff indicated by two fixed stadia wires in the diaphragm (reticle) of the telescope. The difference of height is computed from the angle of depression or elevation of a fixed point on the staff and the horizontal distance already obtained. The azimuth angle is determined as formerly. Thus all the measurements requisite to locate a point both vertically and horizontally {{with reference to the}} point where the <b>tacheometer</b> is centred are determined by an observer at the instrument without any assistance beyond that of a man to hold the staff.|$|E

40|$|Floor-by-floor {{survey of}} {{installed}} elements of an elevator shaft using coordinate method and <b>tacheometer</b> is also inhibited by {{the necessity to}} determine device installation points for floors of every mounting horizon that leads to additional measurements due to conditions of the completed building framework and presence of {{a great number of}} situational disturbances and then it entails significant time expenditure and diminution of accuracy in the obtained results. Technical capabilities of the modern electronic <b>tacheometer</b> substantially simplify an accomplishment of the mission because the device can be applied not only in function of vertical projection but it can be used for preand post-construction survey of the elevator shaft with the help of advanced radiation method. While using the given method the electronic <b>tacheometer</b> equipped with diagonal ocular is installed over a bearing sign in the elevator pit and control points of the elevator shaft are determined with the help of specially developed portable beam deflector in the form of disc with radius   r, which is fixed to a handle rod and orientated perpendicularly to a laser beam.

40|$|Engineering geodesy has {{undergone}} {{significant changes in}} recent years. The automation {{in the area of}} <b>tacheometer</b> measurement systems has begun years ago with automatic target recognition (ATR) and tracking features. Image processing has become a powerful tool of science and industry and is therefore an ideal enhancement for traditional tacheometers. Combining a conventional <b>tacheometer</b> with an imaging sensor poses a hybrid approach wherein a CCD or CMOS sensor is integrated in the optical path of the tacheometer’s telescope. Such an image-based <b>tacheometer</b> is capable of capturing mosaic panoramic images through camera rotation, if the axes of the system are driven by computer controlled motors.

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{functional}} limitation of zenith devices and introduction of modern high-accuracy electronic tacheometers {{should lead to}} substitution of the mentioned devices for tacheometers in geodesic works concerning vertical projection of pivot points of the constructed buildings and structures. However the electronic <b>tacheometer</b> has not been considered in the function of a zenith device in ТКП 45 - 1. 03 - 26 - 2006. Special experiemnts and practical works executed by UE “Geokart” has proved that in accordance with its design the electronic <b>tacheometer</b> equipped with a compensator for small inclinations and zenith prism attachment for ocular can be applied as a vertical projection device while setting sighting line of a telescope in a fixed vertical position. Corresponding experiments {{have been carried out}} for multi-storied building of business centre located in the M. Tank Street in Minsk in order to obtain comparative characteristics of vertical projection accuracy with the help of <b>tacheometer</b> TOPCON GPT 7501 and zenith device PZL- 100. An initial point of the staked grid has been situated at the elevation ± 0, 0 м, standard graph elevation has been equal to + 49, 5 м (concrete slab of the 14 th floor), projection height referred to the device has been equal to Н = 47, 8 м. Both devices have been set on the same stand using a purpose made adaptive device in order to exclude centering errors. Deviation in position of final projection points on the standard graph which were obtained with the help of two devices has been equal to 1. 2 mm, that testifies practical equal accuracy of the zenith device and <b>tacheometer</b> for vertical projection function. Additional advantage of the electronic <b>tacheometer</b> in comparison with special vertical projection devi ces {{lies in the fact that}} in the case of a certain misalignment of geodesic openings in intermediate floors ta- cheometer deviating from the vertical makes it possible to carry out initial point transfer to mounting horizon using inclined projection in the point with plane coordinates which differ from initial point coordinates within the limits of apparent standard graph area. Such point can be indicated with the help of dot L. E. D. located on standard graph. Its spatial polar and rectangular coordinates on horizontal plane are determined by angular measurements with readings along both bearing circles of the electronic <b>tacheometer</b> and projection height. Production practice and executed experiments have permitted to make the following conclusions: a modern electronic <b>tacheometer</b> equipped with ocular attachment for telescope sighting in the zenith direction can be and must be efficiently applied for vertical point projection of internal geodetic base of a constructed building or a structure. The mentioned device ensures transfer of geodetic base points to mounting horizon not only vertically but also with inclination of a projected beam within sequential visibility of openings in intermediate floors that allows to adapt projection trajectory to specific conditions of its passing...|$|E

40|$|The study {{raises the}} issues {{concerning}} the automatic system {{designed for the}} monitoring of movement of controlled points, located on the roof covering of the Forest Opera in Sopot. It presents the calculation algorithm proposed by authors. It {{takes into account the}} specific design and location of the test object. High forest stand makes it difficult to use distant reference points. Hence the reference points used to study the stability of the measuring position are located on the ground elements of the sixmeter-deep concrete foundations, from which the steel arches are derived to support the roof covering (membrane) of the Forest Opera. The <b>tacheometer</b> used in the measurements is located in the glass body placed on a special platform attached to the steel arcs. Measurements of horizontal directions, vertical angles and distances can be additionally subject to errors caused by the laser beam penetration through the glass. Dynamic changes of weather conditions, including the temperature and pressure also {{have a significant impact on}} the value of measurement errors, and thus the accuracy of the final determinations represented by the relevant covariance matrices. The estimated coordinates of the reference points, controlled points and <b>tacheometer</b> along with the corresponding covariance matrices obtained from the calculations in the various epochs are used to determine the significance of acquired movements. In case of the stability of reference points, the algorithm assumes the ability to study changes in the position of <b>tacheometer</b> in time, on the basis of measurements performed on these points...|$|E

40|$|Diploma work {{deals with}} the test of {{electronic}} <b>tacheometers</b> Leica TCR 803 by ISO 17123 standards. By ISO 17123 – 3 standard we test the accuracy of theodolit by measuring horizontal and vertical angles or zenithal distances. ISO standard 17123 – 4 describes the testing of elektro-optical distance meters and the setting of accuracy at distance measurement. And the last one, ISO 17123 – 5 standard describes the testing of electronic <b>tacheometers</b> and accuracy of spatial coordinates setting. ISO standard is the newer standard, which {{is divided into two}} possible tests, the siplified one and the full one and the complete one and I relied on the latter. Thee two tests differentiate from one another because of the differents modes of measurement execution, different modes of the calculations and different statistical analysis of the test results. Statistical tests are used for interpretion of the obtained results. We execute them because they give us answers to some questions, which are already brought up in before listed standards. Based on teh statistical test we determine whether the instrument satisfies the accuracy from declaration and whether we can execute the tasks, which it is made for. And this determination is the main purpose of this dissertation alongside of the detailed acquainting with the ISO 17123 standard. Before the measurement execution I thought that I won't have major problems with it, but the biggest problem was to find appropriate spaces and conditions for the execution of the test. For execution of measurements by ISO 17123 – 3 standard it was necessary to find a large horizontal surface so that the condition for apprppriate distance of reflectors from the instrument was satisfied, but considering my home area, that was not possible.

Automated system for deformation monitoring requires significant time and material expenditures, special training of specialists so simpler methods and criteria {{for assessment}} of building deformation state are also considered as rather actual for this purpose. There {{are more than}} ten conventional methods for determining building tilt. All these methods are based on angular measurements from the fixed base while using highly-accurate theodolites. The methods are rather labor-consuming {{and they do not}} provide operational efficiency and accuracy in measurements. Introduction of electronic tacheometers with large radius of refractorless measurements of distances has made it possible to calculate coordinates on the building surface with high accuracy and at various sections (heights) that results in possibility to obtain 3 D model of the building surface. Leica TCRA 1201 <b>tacheometer</b> has been set at the good visibility point of a tower construction, device orientation and plane coordinates of the temporary point have been determined with the purpose to assess a tilt value of an exhaust stack having 150 meter height. Then 3 D coordinates of six points on the building surface have been measured for every stack section. After that these points have been projected on the horizontal plane. LISCAD PLUS software complex has been used for processing and interpretation of geodetic data.

This multitemporal archaeological imagery is collected during 1998 - 2003. Images have been taken daily from the archaeological excavation site, namely the monastic complex of St. Aaron located near Petra, in Jordan. The images have been taken with non-metric digital camera and with non-metric video camera with varying imaging strategies. Large amount of images are convergent panoramic images taken by rotating the camera on the tripod around the projection center. Also separate images and some stereo pairs are available. The aim in the project has been to develop simple documentation methods for archaeologists and therefore minimum preparations are needed during the fieldwork to minimize the disturbance for excavation work. Use of signalised control points is minimized. During excavation season basic geometry of the site has been measured with a <b>tacheometer.</b> In some cases natural control points have been measured with the <b>tacheometer</b> and marked on the printouts. The 3 D <b>tacheometer</b> data {{can be used for}} solving the orientation parameters. The possibilities to use the collected imagery are presented. The {{progress of}} excavation is visualized in one example area – the chapel. The images have been organized by date and their rough orientation relating to the chapel is known. The images are taken from different angles relating to the excavation trenches (the chapel has been excavated in several steps).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} the influence of instrumental errors the consideration of calibration parameters {{is a very important}} issue for laser scanning instruments in practice. A new concept for the determination of the calibration parameters for different types of instruments has been derived based on adjustment planes.

40|$|Refraction is a {{detrimental}} {{problem in}} terrestrial optical measurements {{and can be}} regarded as major source of systematic errors in the precise determination of distances and directions.

One approach focuses on the determination of the refractive index gradient in measuring the turbulence of the air by scintillometry or CDD-based image processing, which is presently the key technology in tracking <b>tacheometers</b> and digital levels.
