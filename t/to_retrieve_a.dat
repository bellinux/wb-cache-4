5|$|Enrichto's role in Pharsalia {{has often}} been {{discussed}} by classicists and literary scholars, with many arguing that she serves as a antithesis and counterpart to Virgil's Cumaean Sibyl, a pious prophetess who appears in his work the Aeneid.

She also makes appearances in both Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 18th century play, Faust, as well as John Marston's Jacobean play The Tragedy of Sophonisba.|$|E

500|$|... 8–12 months: Coordination of Secondary Circular Reactions – This {{is deemed}} the most {{important}} for the cognitive development of the child. At this stage the child understands causality and is goal directed. The very earliest understanding of object permanence emerges, as the child is now able <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>an</b> object when its concealment is observed. This stage {{is associated with the}} classic A-not-B error. After successfully <b>retrieving</b> <b>a</b> hidden object at one location (A), the child fails <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> it at <b>a</b> second location (B).|$|R

5|$|Upon its release, {{the track}} {{garnered}} positive reviews from music critics. Some critics highlighted the song {{as one of}} Perfume's best singles from their album, and commended the composition. It was also successful in Japan, peaking at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart and Billboards Japan Hot 100 chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for physical shipments of 100,000 units. An accompanying music video was shot by Kazuaki Seki; it features the girls performing the song in a futuristic labyrinth, trying <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>a</b> suitcase by a mysterious man.

40|$|I {{find that}} the total {{retrieval}} time in word free recall increases linearly with {{the total number of}} items recalled. Measured slopes, the time <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>an</b> additional item, vary from 1. 4 - 4. 5 seconds per item depending upon presentation rate, subject age and whether there is a delay after list presentation or not. These times <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>an</b> additional item obey a second linear relationship {{as a function of the}} recall probability averaged over the experiment, explicitly independent of subject age, presentation rate and whether there is a delay after the list presentation or not. This second linear relationship mimics the relationships in recognition and cued recall (Tarnow, 2008) which suggests that free recall retrieval uses the same reactivation mechanism as recognition or cued recall. Extrapolation limits the time <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>an</b> additional item <b>to</b> a maximum of 7. 2 seconds per item if the probability of recall is near 0 %. Earlier upper limits for recognition and cued recall varied with the item type between 0. 2 and 1. 8 seconds per item (Tarnow, 2008). Implications include that there are only two types of short term memory: working memory and reactivation...|$|R
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{undertook}} her tour of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{in order}} <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>a</b> stolen treasure ship for her lover, Gilbert Imlay. Believing that the journey would restore their strained relationship, she eagerly set off. However, {{over the course}} of the three months she spent in Scandinavia, she realized that Imlay had no intention of renewing the relationship. The letters, which constitute the text, drawn from her journal and from missives she sent to Imlay, reflect her anger and melancholy over his repeated betrayals. Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is therefore both a travel narrative and an autobiographical memoir.|$|E
5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping <b>to</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>a</b> long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E
