5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2006 identified 216 {{species of birds}} known to have occurred in Petrified Forest National Park since <b>the</b> <b>park</b> became a protected area in 1906. Of those, 33 species breed within <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> 6 other species probably do, and 18 species live in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> year-round. Thirty-five species live in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> only {{during the summer and}} 11 species only during the winter. The greatest diversity of birds occurs during fall and winter migrations.|$|E
5|$|Access to <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{from the}} {{mainland}} {{is limited to the}} immediate vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling and scuba diving. Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>park</b> headquarters at Convoy Point. Farther south Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys. Matheson Hammock Park is near the north end of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|After the Exposition, <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{continued}} to be extremely popular and was a magnet for growth in the area. State fairs and holiday celebrations were held at <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Street car lines to <b>the</b> <b>park</b> increased. It was a generally prosperous time.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> reverse <b>parking</b> {{procedure}} is virtually identical to <b>the</b> parallel <b>parking</b> procedure. <b>The</b> driver approaches <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> space, moving forward and turning, positioning {{the car in}} place for backing into <b>the</b> reverse <b>parking</b> spot. <b>The</b> vehicle rear has to be facing <b>the</b> reverse <b>parking</b> spot, allowing <b>the</b> backup camera to 'see' <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> area. Shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the driver selects <b>the</b> reverse <b>park</b> guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen (the grid appears with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing the corner of <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> spot, and adjustment arrows; reverse parking adds rotation selection). After checking <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> space and engaging <b>the</b> reverse <b>park</b> procedure, <b>the</b> same exact <b>parking</b> process occurs as <b>the</b> car reverse <b>parks</b> into <b>the</b> spot.|$|R
5000|$|If no one {{picks up}} <b>the</b> <b>parked</b> call within <b>the</b> set time, the {{telephone}} system may ring back <b>the</b> <b>parked</b> call. This transfers <b>the</b> <b>parked</b> call {{back to the}} person who originally <b>parked</b> <b>the</b> call.|$|R
50|$|The Wildlife Estate {{includes}} eleven national parks: <b>the</b> Chimanimani National <b>Park</b> (including <b>the</b> Eland Sanctuary), Chizarira National <b>Park,</b> <b>the</b> Gonarezhou National <b>Park,</b> <b>the</b> Hwange National <b>Park,</b> <b>the</b> Kazuma Pan National <b>Park,</b> <b>the</b> Mana Pools National <b>Park,</b> <b>the</b> Matusadona National <b>Park,</b> <b>the</b> Matobo National <b>Park,</b> <b>the</b> Nyanga National <b>Park,</b> and Victoria Falls National Park and Zambezi National Parks.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} brow-antlered deer, {{which is the}} {{flagship}} species of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> other fauna found in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> are mammals, reptiles, and migratory and resident avifauna species.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using <b>the</b> <b>park</b> and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> during the deer's birthing season.|$|E
5|$|Bannerman Park is a Victorian-style park {{located near}} the downtown. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> was officially opened in 1891 by Sir Alexander Bannerman, Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland who donated the land to create <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Today <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{contains}} a public swimming pool, playground, a baseball diamond and many large open grassy areas. Bannerman Park plays host to many festivals and sporting events, most notably the Newfoundland and Labrador Folk Festival and St. John's Peace-a-chord. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> is also the finishing location for the annual Tely 10 Mile Road Race.|$|E
5000|$|The {{public does}} not have any legal right to use <b>the</b> <b>Parks,</b> as public access depends on the grace and favour of The Crown, {{although}} there are public rights of way across the land. Until 2017, <b>the</b> Royal <b>Parks</b> Agency managed <b>the</b> Royal <b>Parks</b> under powers derived from section 22 of the Crown Lands Act 1851. As part of its statutory management function the Agency permitted the public to use <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> for recreational purposes, subject to regulations issued under <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> Regulation Acts 1872-1926 which were considered necessary to secure proper management, preserve order and prevent abuse within <b>the</b> <b>Parks.</b> <b>The</b> Royal <b>Parks</b> and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997 then came into effect until a separate charity took over <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> from <b>the</b> Royal <b>Parks</b> Agency.|$|R
50|$|The Kew Constabulary are attested under <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> Regulations 1872, {{which was}} amended by <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> Regulations (Amendment) Act 1974.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parks</b> Board oversees {{all aspects}} of <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> Department. <b>The</b> <b>Parks</b> Board was created by {{ordinance}} and can consist of only four members all appointed by the Town Council President. <b>The</b> <b>Parks</b> Board is allowed by Indiana statute {{to buy and sell}} land, enter into and sever contracts, and create a budget to name a few. The Town Council has final budget authority and sets salaries in the salary ordinance. <b>The</b> <b>Parks</b> Board appoints a Park Superintendent and oversees <b>the</b> Town's three <b>parks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> although <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> there is little good hiking within <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|Fans {{started to}} arrive at <b>the</b> <b>park</b> with candles on 4 July in tribute to Jones, and the police allowed <b>the</b> <b>park</b> to be opened late so they could stay. By the {{following}} morning, there were already 7,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is popular}} in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Some {{of the finest}} fly fishing in North America {{can be found in}} the streams that flow through Glacier National Park. Though <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{requires}} that those fishing understand the regulations, no permit is required to fish the waters within <b>the</b> <b>park</b> boundary. The threatened bull trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught; otherwise, the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal.|$|E
5000|$|... 2008: Oakwood's Late night {{entertainment}} was cut to {{only one}} outdoor show (the blues brothers band) with {{the removal of the}} [...] "dancing" [...] fountains. <b>The</b> <b>parks</b> fireworks also re-located behind Speed due to <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> neighbouring site Bluestone. <b>The</b> <b>parks</b> future late night entertainment is now set to be doubtful due to <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> new ownership/management.|$|R

5|$|Full {{right of}} {{public access to}} <b>the</b> <b>park</b> was {{confirmed}} by Act of Parliament in 1872. However, people were no longer given the right to remove firewood; this is still the case and helps in preserving <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park {{has almost}} all its {{original}} native {{plant and animal}} species. Large mammals such as Grizzly bears, moose, and mountain goats, as well as rare or endangered species like wolverines and Canadian lynxes, inhabit <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Hundreds of species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species, and a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> has numerous ecosystems ranging from prairie to tundra. Notably, the easternmost forests of western redcedar and hemlock grow in the southwest portion of <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Large forest fires are uncommon in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> However, in 2003 over 13% of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> burned.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration {{corridor to the}} south of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to <b>the</b> <b>park</b> in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside <b>the</b> <b>park</b> have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give <b>the</b> <b>park</b> more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>parks</b> were {{managed by}} <b>The</b> Royal <b>Parks</b> (an {{executive}} {{agency of the}} Department for Culture, Media and Sport) until a charity--The Royal Parks--launched in July 2017. <b>The</b> <b>parks</b> are policed by <b>the</b> Royal <b>Parks</b> Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police (the English section of the previous force policing <b>the</b> <b>parks,</b> <b>the</b> Royal <b>Parks</b> Constabulary, has been abolished). The main form of funding for <b>the</b> Royal <b>Parks</b> is a central government grant.

5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing <b>the</b> <b>park</b> to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed <b>the</b> <b>park</b> in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 Victor Emmanuel II's {{grandson}} King Victor Emmanuel III {{donated the}} park's original 21 square kilometres (5,189 acres), and <b>the</b> <b>park</b> {{was established in}} 1922. It was Italy's first national park. There were approximately 4,000 ibex in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> when it was protected. Despite the presence of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> ibex were poached until 1945, when only 419 remained. Their protection increased, and there are now almost 4,000 in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E
40|$|Various {{methods and}} systems are {{provided}} for smart parking barriers. In one example, among others, a smart parking barrier system includes a movable parking barrier located {{at one end}} of a parking space, a barrier drive configured to control positioning of <b>the</b> movable <b>parking</b> barrier, and a parking controller configured to initiate movement of <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> barrier, via <b>the</b> barrier drive. <b>The</b> movable <b>parking</b> barrier can be positioned between a first position that restricts access to <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> space and a second position that allows access to <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> space. <b>The</b> <b>parking</b> controller can initiate movement of <b>the</b> movable <b>parking</b> barrier in response to a positive identification of an individual allowed to use <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> space. <b>The</b> <b>parking</b> controller can identify the individual through, e. g., a RFID tag, a mobile device (e. g., a remote control, smartphone, tablet, etc.), an access card, biometric information, or other appropriate identifier...|$|R
