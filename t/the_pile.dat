40|$|AbstractCyclic lateral-loading {{centrifuge}} {{tests were}} conducted on a new <b>pile</b> located at <b>the</b> center of 2 × 2 existing <b>piles,</b> to evaluate <b>the</b> effects of <b>the</b> existing <b>piles</b> on <b>the</b> new <b>pile's</b> lateral resistance when <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> of an old building are left derelict. Furthermore, two-dimensional FEM analyses of the horizontal cross sections of the pile–soil systems were carried out. The centrifuge test {{results show that the}} lateral resistance of a new pile, located among existing piles, shows slight increases. <b>The</b> existing <b>piles</b> increase <b>the</b> horizontal subgrade reaction of the upper part of <b>the</b> new <b>pile,</b> but slightly decrease that of the lower part of <b>the</b> new <b>pile.</b> Numerical analyses reveal that the key to whether an existing <b>pile</b> increases <b>the</b> horizontal subgrade reaction of a new pile or not, is the soil displacement at the location of <b>the</b> existing <b>pile.</b> An existing <b>pile</b> increases <b>the</b> horizontal subgrade reaction of a new <b>pile</b> when <b>the</b> existing <b>pile</b> displacement is less than the soil displacement caused by <b>the</b> new <b>pile.</b> Conversely, an existing <b>pile</b> decreases <b>the</b> horizontal subgrade reaction of a new <b>pile</b> when <b>the</b> existing <b>pile</b> displacement is greater than the soil displacement caused by <b>the</b> new <b>pile...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{stress field}} in a pile-supported 3. 9 -m-high {{embankment}} was interpreted through three-dimensional finite-element modeling, and evaluated by field measurements involving strain gauges on <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> and earth pressure cells {{at the top}} and bottom of a 0. 9 -m-thick geogrid-reinforced platform. Analyses of the numerical results and the experimental data suggest that a vaultlike arch developed within the embankment, such that the vertical stress at the top of the platform was concentrated above <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> and virtually no vertical stress was measured between <b>the</b> <b>piles.</b> A similar situation existed within the platform, where an almost stress-free region between <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> was experimentally detected and numerically verified. From a structural point of view, a supporting skeleton was formed from a <b>pile</b> extension through <b>the</b> platform, a type of stress diffusion problem, and an arching effect appeared mainly in the embankment due to the very large stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> in comparison to the surrounding media...|$|R
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E

5|$|Piel Castle, {{also known}} as Fouldry Castle or <b>the</b> <b>Pile</b> of Fouldray, is a castle {{situated}} on the south-eastern point of Piel Island, {{off the coast of}} the Furness Peninsula in north-west England. Built in the early-14th century by John Cockerham, the Abbot of neighbouring Furness Abbey, it was intended to oversea the trade through the local harbour and to protect against Scottish raids. The castle was built using stones from the local beach, and featured a large keep with surrounding inner and outer baileys. It was used as a base by the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487, but by 1534 it had fallen into ruin and passed {{into the hands of the}} Crown. Sea erosion began to cause significant damage to the castle in the early 19th century. In the 1870s the castle's owner, the Duke of Buccleuch, carried out extensive restoration work and erected outworks to protect it against further damage from the sea. In 1920 the castle was given to the town of Barrow-in-Furness and is now in the care of English Heritage.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the use of}} {{distributed}} fibre optic sensor (DFOS) technology to measure the temperature and strain of reinforced concrete test piles during construction and during static load tests. Eight test piles were recently instrumented with DFOS, on three construction sites in London, by the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CSIC), in collaboration with Ove Arup & Partners Ltd. The concrete curing temperature profiles of <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> were used to detect the presence of significant defects in <b>the</b> <b>piles.</b> <b>The</b> load test strain profiles {{along the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> were used to determine the load capacity of <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> and estimate <b>the</b> design parameters of the various soil strata, as well as the internal relative displacement of <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> under various loads.

Fixing <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> on <b>the</b> support layer increases the dynamic rigidity of the soil–pile–slab system especially for the ratios s/d[*]=[*] 2 and 10 (Figs.  6 and 8). For the three s/d ratios, the dynamic rigidity of <b>the</b> anchored <b>piles</b> is greater than the ones of <b>the</b> rested <b>piles.</b> <b>The</b> latter is superior to the ones of <b>the</b> floating <b>piles.</b> <b>The</b> vertical dynamic impedance for <b>the</b> anchored <b>piles</b> case is two times the one of <b>the</b> floating <b>piles</b> one for <b>the</b> ratio s/s[*]=[*] 2 – 10. The effect of the support layer on the damping is not negligible. The presence of a rigid layer induces a reduction of the damping especially for high s/d ratios and frequency (Fig.  8). The obtained results show that anchoring <b>piles</b> on <b>the</b> rigid layer is the best solution, therefore the anchoring of <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> is not a negligible factor in the deep foundation.|$|R
