5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{were well}} aware that their victory was still fragile, and <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as the Parthian king had dealt with the Hyrcanian rebellion, he would turn his {{attention}} to Armenia. Despite Vologases' reluctance to risk an all-out conflict with Rome, in the end, {{he was forced to}} act when Tigranes raided the Parthian province of Adiabene in 61. The enraged protests of its governor Monobazus, and his pleas for protection, could not be ignored by Vologases, whose prestige and royal authority were at stake. Vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with the Hyrcanians so as to be free to campaign against Rome, and called an assembly of the grandees of his realm. There he publicly reaffirmed Tiridates' position as king of Armenia by crowning him with a diadem. In order to reinstall his brother on the Armenian throne, the Parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under Monaeses, complemented by infantry from Adiabene.|$|E

This took place in late 1791, or early 1792.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 it {{was decided}} to acquire an area of land at Rocklea for use as a civil aerodrome in lieu of Eagle Farm.

The two existing hangars would be moved but the caretakers cottage on the site would remain.|$|E
25|$|Rinehart (2009) {{assessed}} the ontogenic growth of this genus using data {{gathered from the}} length of its upper leg bone (femur) and concluded that Coelophysis juveniles grew rapidly, especially {{during the first year}} of life. Coelophysis likely reached sexual maturity between the second and third year of life and reached its full size, just above 10 feet in length, by its eighth year. This study identified four distinct growth stages: 1-year, 2-year, 4-year, and 7+ year. It was also thought, <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as they were hatched, they would have to fend for themselves.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{featured}} an easy rout of the Filipino forces under Luna, numbering around 2,500, by Americans in Santo Tomas. In Funston's own account, {{he states}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as the Filipinos abandoned their trenches {{on the opposite}} bank of the lagoon, he sent two companies across to examine the vacated trenches and repair the railroad track that had been destroyed by the retreating Filipinos. However, when Lieutenant Colonel Cavestany brought up reinforcements consisting of about 1,600 men organized into eight companies, and crossed the bridge leading to San Fernando, Luna saw that the American advance could still be halted.|$|E
25|$|The twin sons of Poseidon and Iphidemia, Otos and Ephialtes, grew {{enormously}} {{at a young}} age.

The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.|$|E
25|$|In 152 BC the Lusitanians made a peace {{agreement}} with Marcus Atilius, after he conquered Oxthracae, Lusitania's biggest city. In Roman law, peregrini dediticii was the designation given to peoples who had surrendered themselves after taking up arms against the Romans. The terms offered were such <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as Atilius returned to Rome, they rebelled and broke the treaty. Then they attacked the tribes that were Roman subjects and that had sided with the Romans in helping to attack and plunder the Lusitanian towns. Possibly the Lusitanians recovered some of the booty the Romans had divided with those tribes.|$|E

Coelophysis likely reached sexual maturity between the second and third year of life and reached its full size, just above 10 feet in length, by its eighth year.

25|$|Historians, {{constitutional}} {{scholars and}} biographers all dismiss the claim. They {{point out that}} Atchison's Senate term had ended on March 4 as well, and he also was not sworn in for another term, or re-elected President pro tempore, until March 5. Furthermore, the Constitution doesn't require the President-elect to take {{the oath of office}} to hold the office, just to execute the powers. As Atchison never swore the oath either, that did not make him Acting President. Most historians and scholars assert <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as the outgoing President's term expires, the President-elect automatically assumes the office. Some claim instead that the office is vacant until the taking of the oath.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jimmy Savile scandal, Newsnight investigated the North Wales child abuse scandal. On 2 November 2012, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home was reported on Newsnight claiming that a prominent, but unnamed, former Conservative politician had sexually abused him during the 1970s. The rumour was spread by users of Twitter and other social media which identified the politician. After The Guardian reported a possible case of mistaken identity, Lord McAlpine issued a strong denial that he was in any way involved, asserting that the allegations were wholly false and seriously defamatory. The accuser unreservedly apologised, admitting <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as he saw a photograph of the individual, he realised he had been mistaken. The BBC also apologised.|$|E
