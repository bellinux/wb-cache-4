There are several factors responsible {{for the growth of}} ITO on a desired substrate like concentration of the salt solutions, spray volume per unit time, effect of solvents, nature of the particular substrate, etc. In the reported case, we have investigated only the effect of the substrate temperature on the growth of the ITO film keeping other factors constant. The film composition was investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and other electrical and optical properties of ITO films were compared according to substrate temperature.

The composition, microstructure, surface morphology, thermal, electrical, and optical characteristics have been analysed by FT-IR, UV–Vis, X-ray diffraction, SEM, EDAX, atomic force microscopy, electrical measurements, TGA, etc. X-ray diffraction measurements employing Cu-Kα radiation showed that the ITO films were polycrystalline with a cubic bixbyite structure.

Heat and light stabilization of polyvinylchloride polymer by organotins is now a principle application of that metal. The spectroscopic properties and crystal structures are determined for some estertin precursors of these stabilizers: mono and bis-(beta-carbomethoxyethyl) <b>tin</b> <b>chlorides,</b> {{as well as the}} bis-(beta-carbomethoxyethyl) tin dichloride analogue. The feasibility of using Mössbauer spectroscopy to determine the fate of the organotin species within the PVC is also assessed. The INDOR technique is used to obtain tin- 119 n. m. r. data for a series of trimethyl and dimethyltin(IV) compounds and the results interpreted in a manner illustrating the use of this method as a structural probe for the solution chemistry of organotin systems. In the case of lead, attention is given to the effects of use of that metal in petrol by examining its overall distribution pattern in the dust, soil, grasses, plants and fruit of a roadside environment. Additionally a new aetiology of lead poisoning involving some traditional Asian medicines and cosmetics is also described and a route for gastrointestinal absorption of lead sulphide from this source proposed. The effect of particle size on uptake rate is established. A chemical model for interaction between body-phosphate systems and lead derived from such sources as those studied is designed. The reactions found to occur between lead acetate, lead nitrate and dimethylphosphite and trimethylphosphate are interpreted. Preliminary studies show reaction between lead and adenosine di- and triphosphate and the data obtained from the model systems are used to elucidate the reaction pathway with these body-phosphate systems...|$|E

For the n-alkyl tin compounds the T 1 and HOE data indicated contributions to the total rate arising from the dipole-dipole interactions of tin- 119 with remote protons. The competing mechanism was spin-rotation. T 1 values were typically less than 5 seconds. Measurements of tin- 119 T 1 values in the hydrides were complicated by the magnitude of (> 1500 Hz) and only for nBuuSnH and Ph SnH have T and HOE factors n been determined.
