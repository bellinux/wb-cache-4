25|$|In early {{times the}} choir alone possessed seats, the nave being left bare. Gradually benches were introduced, {{and during the}} 15th century became universal. The poppyhead form of B {{ornament}} now reached perfection and was constantly used enc for seats other {{than those of the}} choir. The name refers en a. to the carved finial which is so often used to complete the top of the bench end and is peculiarly English in character. In Devon and Cornwall it is rarely met with (Ilsington, Devon). In Somerset it is more common, while in the eastern counties thousands of examples remain. The quite simple fleur-de-lys form of poppyhead, suitable for the village, is seen in perfection at Trunch, Norfolk, and the very elaborate form when the poppyhead springs from a crocketed circle filled in with sculpture, at St Nicholas, King's Lynn. Often the foliage contained a face (St Margaret's, Cley, Norfolk), or the poppyhead consisted of figures or birds only (Thurston, Suffolk) or a figure standing on a dragon (Great Brincton, Northampton); occasionally the traditional form was departed from and the finial carved like a lemon in outline (Bury St Edmuncis) or a diamond (Tirley, Glos.). In Denmark an ornament {{in the form of a}} large circle sometimes takes the place of the English poppy-head. In the Copenhagen Museum there is a set of bench ends of the 15th century with such a decoration carved with coats of arms, interlacing strap-work, etc. But the old 15th-century bench end did not depend entirely on the poppy-head for its embellishment. The side was constantly enriched with elaborate tracery (Dennington, Norfolk) or with tracery and domestic scenes (North Cadbury, Somerset), or would consist of a mass of sculpture in perspective, with canopy work, buttresses and sculptured niches, while the top of the bench end would be crowned with figures carved in the round, of the finest craftsmanship. Such work at Amiens cathedral is a marvel alike of conception, design and execution. In the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin some beautiful stall ends are to be seen. Out of a dragons mouth grows a conventional tree arranged and balanced in excellent proportion. On another, stall end a tree is carved growing out of the mouth of a fool. This custom of making foliage grow out of the mouth or eyes is hardly defensible, and was by no means confined to any country or <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> plenty of Renaissance examples of the same treatment.|$|E

500|$|The second edition, {{published}} in 1985, included several {{changes such as}} 37 new species, 12 new plates of illustrations, the inclusion of endemic species of the Baja California Peninsula, and new common names chosen to enhance clarity. In his 1986 review, Sweet remarked on the frankness of imperfect knowledge: [...] "For the first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a field guide that indicates clearly which taxonomic interpretations are tentative and where distributions and life history features remain poorly known." [...] Concerned {{about the impact of}} over-collecting, Stebbins reduced coverage of collecting and keeping animals, and also removed a section on handling venomous snakes.|$|E
500|$|Hancock was Peter Berg's {{first film}} with visual effects as {{critical}} cinematic elements. He considered the computer-generated fight his least {{favorite part of}} the film, citing limited control in making the scene successful. According to the director, [...] "Once the fight starts, you're very limited and you're at the mercy of your effects guys... unless they're really technically oriented... it's definitely the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the least amount of control as directors." [...] He and other filmmakers worked {{to cut down on the}} fight scene, believing that the film's success would come from the character study of Smith's character, John Hancock, similar to Robert Downey, Jr.'s acclaimed portrayal of Tony Stark in the previous May's superhero release, Iron Man.|$|E

Garran, along with others such as Atlee Hunt, worked essentially as secretaries to Barton's federation campaign, drafting correspondence and planning meetings. At one late night meeting, planning a speech Barton was to give in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, Barton coined the phrase [...] "For the first <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation"; Garran recalled that the now famous phrase [...] "would have been unrecorded if I had not happened to jot it down." ...|$|E

When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered: [...] "Kinda? I mean, you know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years.

500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most of the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But {{if you do it}} right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She {{noted that the}} episode [...] "suffers from a {{syndrome}} that has afflicted a great many X-Files episodes in recent seasons [...] the syndrome consists of the audience finding out early on who the guilty party is." [...] Vitaris, however, did note that the episode's [...] "saving grace" [...] was Vince Gilligan's satiric writing tone; she called the scene featuring Roberts hallucinating that the burgers he was frying were actually brains [...] "sick, but hilarious". Other reviews were more negative. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, noting that, although the change in perspective was unique and interesting, [...] "this bit of originality does not rescue the episode from a familiarity bordering on the mundane. It's not the first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen genetic mutants who have an affinity for human body parts." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a relatively negative review. Despite noting that the episode wasn't a [...] "horrible" [...] entry for The X-Files, Kessenich was unhappy with the characterization of Rob Roberts {{as well as the}} fact that the killer was revealed very quickly.|$|E

500|$|Olivia died of {{complications}} {{brought on by}} gall bladder disease on 3October1938. The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hillenburg halted {{production}} of the show after the third season had been completed {{to focus on the}} making of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which was set for release in 2004: [...] "I don't want to try and do a movie and the series at the same <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [...] really needs. It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory. He said that Engel [...] "truly was the most influential artistic person in [...] life." [...] The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie grossed $140 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics. The review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rates it 68 percent positive based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. Its consensus states in summary, [...] "Surreally goofy and entertaining for both children and their parents." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E
