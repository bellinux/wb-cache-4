5|$|The {{morning after}} the arrests the {{soldiers}} continued marching north, proceeding 10 miles (16 kilometers) further to <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> Fishing Creek and {{the base of the}} mountains in northern Columbia County.

The soldiers extensively searched the mountains of northern Columbia County for half a day, going as far north as <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> East Branch Fishing Creek in southern Sullivan County, where they {{climbed to the top of}} North Mountain in three groups. At <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> East Branch Fishing Creek the soldiers turned south again, then headed up West Branch Fishing Creek as far as the Sullivan County line.

50|$|In 1820, Cass led an {{expedition}} to the northwestern part of the Michigan Territory, in the Great Lakes region in today's northern Minnesota.

The Cass expedition erroneously identified what became known as Cass Lake as the Mississippi's source.
