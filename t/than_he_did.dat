5|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of the novel, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar elements of the story <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> when adapting the lesser-known stories. The script was intended to follow elements of the horror genre and make the episode scary. As opposed to traditional ghost stories, Gatiss's plot focused on more contemporary horrors, conspiracy theories and genetic modification. Filming was done throughout May 2011, with additional shots taking place as late as August. Location shooting took place mostly across South Wales, though parts were shot in Dartmoor. The hound was created using visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Constantine met {{his future}} wife, Norma Agatha Cox, in 1921. She had little {{interest}} in cricket and, although their relationship developed during the early 1920s, she resented that he gave more time to cricket <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to her. However, the relationship lasted and she began to take more of an interest in his sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928. Throughout their marriage, his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close. Norma died two months after her husband in 1971.|$|E

50|$|He was a {{very modest}} person, who insisted that even the {{ordinary}} plumber or electrician knows more about his craft <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>He</b> {{said he could not}} explain how <b>he</b> <b>did</b> what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> on the field of play, and that he just followed his instincts.|$|R
5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1989 season, All-Star safety Bennie Thompson {{left the}} Blue Bombers {{to join the}} New Orleans Saints of the National Football League, leaving an opening on the roster for a new {{starting}} safety. Allen was initially designated to fill this role, but it eventually went to Moustafa Ali. He found early success defensively, making two interceptions in his first five weeks. He also tied the CFL career record for fumbles recovered for touchdowns when he recovered his fourth career blocked punt in an August game against the Toronto Argonauts. In November of that year, Allen again blocked a punt which was recovered by Paul Clatney for a Blue Bombers touchdown. In addition to his large role on special teams, Allen contributed far more defensively in 1989 <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in his rookie year, recording 27 tackles in 16 regular season games. The Blue Bombers again qualified for the playoffs, but lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 10–14 in the East Final.|$|E
5|$|During the Mexican–American War, Beauregard {{served as}} an {{engineer}} under General Winfield Scott. He was appointed brevet captain for the battles of Contreras and Churubusco and major for Chapultepec, where he {{was wounded in the}} shoulder and thigh. He was noted for his eloquent performance in a meeting with Scott in which he convinced the assembled general officers to change their plan for attacking the fortress of Chapultepec. He {{was one of the first}} officers to enter Mexico City. Beauregard considered his contributions in dangerous reconnaissance missions and devising strategy for his superiors to be more significant than those of his engineer colleague, Captain Robert E. Lee, so he was disappointed when Lee and other officers received more brevets <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

5|$|At the 2012 World's Best 10K he came third, {{beaten by}} Sammy Kitwara and Vincent Chepkok. He won the Lisbon Half Marathon {{for the third}} {{straight}} year, but was slower than previous times (59:34) due to warm conditions and having the flu. A run at the 2012 London Marathon saw him perform better <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in 2010, but he lost touch with the leading pack after the halfway point and came fourteenth with a time of 2:10:41 hours. He was chosen as Eritrea's flag bearer at the 2012 London Olympics and ran in the 10,000 metres final. He set the pace early on in the race but was defeated in the sprint finish, finishing in sixth place some three seconds behind the winner Mo Farah. After the Olympics he ran at the 2012 World Half Marathon Championships. He dominated the race from just beyond the 5km point, and won it convincingly in a time of 1:00:19 hours, 32 seconds ahead of the runner-up, Deressa Chimsa. Only two weeks later he entered the Great Birmingham Run, but he appeared tired and finished third in a race where the top three all dipped under Haile Gebrselassie's course record.|$|E
5|$|Bird set fast laps while leading {{and kept}} the lead after his pit stop {{at the end of}} the 16th lap ahead of the yet-to-stop Binder, Ceccon and Evans. Bird was pushing when he slid after {{clipping}} the kerb on the track and glanced the barrier leaving Portier turn on lap 18. Abt was attacking Haryanto for 13th position on lap 28 and went to the outside of Haryanto by braking later <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> The resulting manoeuvre meant Abt punted Haryanto into the inside barrier with his car's front nose being broken as a consequence. The need for the safety car was avoided as Haryanto's car was extracted from the track quickly. Abt was adjudged to have been too aggressive towards Haryanto by the stewards and was handed a drive-through penalty and was shown a black flag with an orange disc requiring him to make repairs to his car. Dillmann attempted to pass Rosenzweig but ran deep at the Novelle Chicane. He was required to hand the position back to Rosenzweig. Binder made his pit stop on the 29th lap and emerged in seventh place behind Coletti. Bird continued to lead with a seventeen-second advantage over Ceccon who was fending off the faster Evans in third position who himself had Nasr and Calado close behind him.|$|E
5|$|In {{first-class}} matches during 1892, Peel scored 772 runs at 19.79 {{and took}} 121 wickets at 16.80. Additionally, in a non-first-class games against Leicestershire, he scored 226 {{as well as}} taking five wickets in Leicestershire's first innings. In the 1893 season, he took slightly more wickets at a lower average (126 at 14.51) but his run aggregate fell to 550 runs at 13.75. He {{was part of a}} successful Yorkshire team. The county won their first official County Championship title and the team was no longer as dependent on Peel with the ball—Ted Wainwright took more wickets <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> The Australians toured England once again, but Peel played in just one of the three Test matches. He did not take a wicket, did little with the bat, and was left out of the team for the second Test. As the Australians had proved poor on the field, Lord Hawke withdrew Peel and Stanley Jackson from the team for the third Test so that they could play for Yorkshire. In 1894, Peel scored 699 runs at 16.25, failing to score a half-century. With the ball, he took 145 wickets at 13.44. During the season, he was awarded a benefit match at Bradford, which raised £2,000. The retirement of George Ulyett that season made Peel the team's senior professional, an important position at the time.|$|E

5|$|On lap 20 it was {{announced}} that Vergne was under investigation by the stewards after he was observed speeding in the pit lane. He was issued with a drive-through penalty three laps later, ending his chances of battling for the victory. He remerged in fifth place ahead of both Audi Sport ABT cars but behind Prost, and Buemi inherited second place. Duval stopped on the track with powertrain problems on the 25th lap but was able to restart his car and continued in 18th position. Having made a pit stop one lap earlier {{than the rest of the}} field, Rosenqvist conserved electrical energy usage, allowing Buemi to close up to him at a rate of nearly two seconds per lap because he used Fan Boost, had more electrical energy available to him, and the requirement to lift and coast was minimal. Abt lost sixth place when was overtaken by teammate di Grassi at the sixth turn on lap 27. Shortly afterwards, Buemi drafted Rosenqvist, braked later <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and overtook him around the outside at turn eleven to take over the lead. López passed Frijns to move into tenth place. Vergne attempted to move ahead of Prost but was unable to pass, allowing di Grassi to close up to Vergne. Vergne defended his position, but di Grassi overtook him at turn seven to take over fifth place.|$|E
5|$|Only three pitchers, Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Early Wynn, {{joined the}} 300win club between 1924 and 1982, {{which may be}} {{explained}} by a number of factors: the abolition of the spitball, World WarII military service, such as Bob Feller's, and the growing importance of the home run in the game. As the home run became commonplace, the physical and mental demands on pitchers dramatically increased, which led to the use of a four-man starting rotation. Between 1982 and 1990, the 300win club gained six members: Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan, Don Sutton and Tom Seaver. These pitchers benefited from the increased use of specialized relief pitchers, an expanded strike zone, and new stadiums, including Shea Stadium, Dodger Stadium and the Astrodome, that were pitcher's parks, which suppressed offensive production. Also, the increasing sophistication of training methods and sports medicine, such as Tommy John surgery, allowed players to maintain a high competitive level for a longer time. Randy Johnson, for example, won more games in his 40s <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in his 20s.|$|E
