50|$|The {{election}} result forced Van Agt to start talks with Den Uyl. Although Van Agt had been Deputy Prime Minister {{in the cabinet}} Den Uyl, the two had never gotten along well. The animosity between them frustrated the <b>talks.</b> <b>After</b> <b>more</b> than 300 days of negotiations, they finally officially failed, and Van Agt was able to negotiate a cabinet with the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). The first Van Agt cabinet had a very narrow majority. The unexpected cabinet with the VVD led to split within the newly founded CDA between more progressive and more conservative members. The progressives remained within the party, and were known as loyalists. On 11 October 1980, the three original parties ceased to exist and the CDA was founded as a unitary party. After the 1981 general election, the VVD and the CDA lost their majority, and the CDA was forced {{to cooperate with the}} PvdA. Den Uyl became deputy prime minister under van Agt. The second Van Agt cabinet was troubled by ideological and personal conflicts, and fell after one year.|$|R
