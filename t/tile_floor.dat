5|$|During {{most of the}} 4th century, the Christian {{community}} was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members {{were not allowed to}} hold political office. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406. (Note that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not even exist.) Persecution against Christians did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a mosaic <b>tile</b> <b>floor</b> depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that the floor was donated in 508–509 CE by two merchant brothers. Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the colonization of slime-producing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) in 80 patient wards in Turkey (40 vinyl and 40 ceramic <b>tile</b> <b>floors).</b> A total of 480 samples that included 557 CoNS isolates were obtained. Slime production was investigated with the Christensen method and methicillin-susceptibility was tested by the disk-diffusion method. There {{was a significant difference}} in the percentage of slime-producing CoNS isolates on vinyl (12. 4 %) versus ceramic <b>tile</b> <b>flooring</b> (4. 4 %). From vinyl flooring, the percentage of slime producing methicillin-resistant CoNS (MRCoNS) (8. 9 %) was significantly higher than for methicillin-sensitive CoNS (MSCoNS) (3. 6 %), whereas there was no difference from ceramic <b>tile</b> <b>flooring</b> (2. 5 % MRCoNS versus 1. 8 % MSCoNS). The most commonly isolated slime-producing CoNS species was S. epidermidis on both types of flooring. It is concluded that vinyl flooring seems to be a more suitable colonization surface for slime-producing CoNS than ceramic <b>tile</b> <b>floors.</b> Further studies are needed to investigate bacterial strains colonized on flooring materials, which are potential pathogens for nosocomial infections...|$|R

500|$|Repairs of the {{earthquake}} damage began in 1908, despite misgivings from some university administration regarding its cost. The church and the Old Chemistry building {{were the only two}} buildings in the university's Inner Quad that were repaired. [...] The extent of the damage was such that the church had to be completely rebuilt. The entire church, except for its surviving crossing structure and offices, was dismantled stone by stone, which, along with the windows, were labelled and stored. [...] "To assure permanence" [...] in case of further earthquakes, the masonry was anchored to its thick, concrete-reinforced walls. [...] The stones were securely bolted to each other, [...] "making the whole structure practically one massive hollow rock on a great steel foundation skeleton". [...] The <b>tile</b> <b>floor</b> was replaced with cork. [...] The building's crossing received a tiled hipped roof and an oculus, which lit the interior of the church, and was added above the renovated dome, which had a frescoed ceiling decorated with bronze designs as opposed to the gold leaf present before {{the earthquake}}. [...] The original rose window above the front facade was replaced with one with a simpler arch shape because it was more similar to the style {{of the rest of the}} buildings in the Inner Quad.|$|E
500|$|The archaeological remains are {{recognised}} as a GradeI {{listed building}} and a scheduled ancient monument, and {{are considered to}} be the most important monastic remains in Cheshire. [...] They consist of the former undercroft and the foundations of the church and monastic buildings that were exposed during the excavations. The undercroft stands outside the museum building. It is a single-storey structure consisting of seven pairs of bays divided into two compartments, one of four and the other of three bays. It is entered through the portico added to the west front of the country house in 1886 by way of a pair of arched doorways in Norman style. The doorway to the right (south) is original, dating from the late 12thcentury, while the other doorway is a replica dated 1886. The older doorway has been described as [...] "the finest decorated Norman doorway in Cheshire". It is in good condition with little evidence of erosion and Greene considers that this is because it has always been protected from the weather. The portico leads into the four-bay compartment. This has a tiled floor and contains a medieval-style fireplace. The roof is ribbed vaulted. On the east wall is a two-arched doorway leading to the former cloisters. To the north another archway leads to the three-bay compartment. This also has a <b>tile</b> <b>floor</b> and contains the brick wine bins added in the 1780s. The roof of this compartment has groined vaults. The undercroft also contains a bell mould, reconstructed from the fragments of the original mould found in the excavations.|$|E
500|$|A {{large number}} of tiles and tile {{fragments}} that had lined {{the floor of the}} church and some of the monastic buildings were found in the excavations. The oldest tiles date from the early 14thcentury. The total area of tiles discovered was about , and is [...] "the largest area of a floor of this type to be found in any modern excavation". The site has [...] "the largest, and most varied, excavated collection of medieval tiles in the North West" [...] and [...] "the greatest variety of individual mosaic shapes found anywhere in Britain". The tiles found made a pavement forming the floor of the choir of the church and the transepts. The chancel floor was probably also tiled; these tiles have not survived because the chancel was at a higher level {{than the rest of the}} church, and the tiles would have been removed during subsequent gardening. A dump of tiles to the south of the site of the chapter house suggests that this was also tiled. In the 15thcentury a second <b>tile</b> <b>floor</b> was laid on top of the original floor in the choir where it had become worn. The tiles on the original floor were of various shapes, forming a mosaic. The tiles were all glazed and coloured, the main colours being black, green and yellow. Many of them had been decorated by impressing a wooden stamp into the moist clay before it was fired; these are known as line-impressed tiles. The line-impressed designs included masks of lions or other animals, rosettes, and trefoils. Other tiles or tile fragments showed portions of trees, foliage, birds and inscriptions. In the chapels of the north transept, the burial place of the Dutton family, were tiles depicting mail, thought to be part of a military effigy, and tiles bearing fragments of heraldic designs. The tiles from the upper (later) pavement were all square, and again were line-inscribed with patterns forming parts of larger designs. A related discovery at the excavation was the kiln in which most of the tiles on the site were fired.|$|E

Construction of an addition including new weight room, elevator and conference room was completed in August 1993.
