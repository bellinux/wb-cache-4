5000|$|Swinging trapeze (or {{swinging}} single trapeze) {{refers to}} an act performed on a trapeze swinging in a forward - backward motion. The performer builds up swing from a still position, and uses {{the momentum of the}} swing to execute the tricks. Usually tricks on a swinging trapeze are thrown on the peaks of the swing and involve dynamic movements that require precise timing. Most of the tricks begin with the performer sitting or standing on the bar and end with the performer catching the bar in his/her hands or in an ankle <b>hang</b> (<b>hanging</b> by the ankles by bracing them between the rope and the bar). This act requires a great deal of strength, grace, and flexibility. The trapeze bar is weighted and often has cable inside the supporting ropes for extra strength to withstand the dynamic forces of the swing.|$|R
