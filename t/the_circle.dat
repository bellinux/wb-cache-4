40|$|An {{alternative}} interaction method, called <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface, {{was developed}} and evaluated for individuals with disabilities who find it difficult or impossible to consistently and efficiently perform pointing operations involving {{the left and right}} mouse buttons. <b>The</b> <b>circling</b> interface is a gesture-based interaction technique. To specify a target of interest, the user makes a <b>circling</b> motion around <b>the</b> target. To specify a desired pointing command with <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface, each edge of the screen is used. The user selects a command before <b>circling</b> <b>the</b> target. Empirical evaluations were conducted with human subjects from three different groups (individuals without disability, individuals with spinal cord injury, and individuals with cerebral palsy), comparing each group's performance on pointing tasks with <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface to performance on the same tasks when using a mouse button or dwell-clicking software. Across all three groups, <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface was faster than the dwelling interface (although the difference was not statistically significant). For the single-click operation, <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface was slower than dwell selection, but for both double-click and drag-and-drop operations, <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface was faster. In terms of performance accuracy, the results were mixed: for able-bodied subjects circling was more accurate than dwelling, for subjects with SCI dwelling was more accurate than circling, and for subjects with CP there was no difference. However, if errors caused by circling on an area with no target or by ignoring circles that are too small or too fast were automatically corrected by <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface, <b>the</b> performance accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface would significantly outperform dwell selection. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface can be used in conjunction with existing pointing techniques and this combined approach may provide more effective mouse use for people with pointing problems. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>circling</b> interface can improve clinical practice by providing an alternative pointing method that does not require physically activating mouse buttons and is more efficient than dwell-clicking. It is also expected to be useful for both computer access and augmentative communication software...|$|R

5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. <b>The</b> <b>circle</b> in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E

The monogram, showing the letter R within the letter M, stands for the Roerich Museum. <b>The</b> <b>circle</b> and the three dots are the symbol of Roerich's Banner of Peace. He once said <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> represents eternity and unity and the dots the triune nature of existence.
