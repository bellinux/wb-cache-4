Many natural cyclic peptides have potent and potentially useful biological activities. Their use as therapeutic starting points is often limited by the quantities available, the lack of known biological targets and the practical limits on diversification to fine-tune their properties. We report the use of enzymes from the cyanobactin family to heterocyclise and macrocyclise chemically synthesised substrates so as to allow larger-scale syntheses and better control over derivatisation. We have made cyclic peptides containing orthogonal reactive groups, azide or dehydroalanine, that allow chemical diversification, including the use of fluorescent labels that can help in target identification. We show that the enzymes are compatible and efficient with such unnatural substrates. The combination of chemical synthesis and enzymatic transformation could help renew interest in investigating natural cyclic peptides with biological activity, as well as their unnatural analogues, as therapeutics.

40|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{ascertain}} the antidiabetic potential of Pseuduvaria monticola bark methanolic extract (PMm) using in vitro mechanistic study models. In particular, the study determined the effect of PMm on cellular viability, 2 -NBDG glucose uptake, insulin secretion, and NF-jB translocation in mouse pancreatic insulinoma cells (NIT- 1). Furthermore, in vivo acute toxicity and antidiabetic studies were performed using streptozotocin (STZ) -induced type 1 and STZ-nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetic rat models to evaluate various biochemical parameters and markers of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines. Five isoquinoline alkaloids and three phenolic compounds were tentatively identified in the PMm by LC/MS <b>Triple</b> <b>TOF.</b> The study results showed that PMm is non-toxic to NIT- 1 cells and significantly increased the glucose uptake and insulin secretion without affecting the translocation of NF-jB. Moreover, the non-toxic effects of PMm were confirmed through an in vivo acute toxicity study, which revealed that the serum insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly upregulated in type 2 diabetic rats and that no significant changes were observed in type 1 diabetic rats. Similarly, PMm was found to downregulate the levels of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines in type 2 diabetic rats by alleviating hyperglycemia. Therefore, we conclude that PMm may be developed as an antidiabetic agent {{for the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes-associated condition...|$|E
40|$|Study Rational: Lympangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a {{rare and}} {{progressive}} cystic lung condition that affects between 3 - 7 /million women. It manifests primarily in women of child-bearing age, with an average lag time between symptom onset and definitive diagnosis of upwards of 4 years. Currently no reliable biomarker exists for patients with LAM, therefore, identifying a predictive or prognostic disease biomarker could reduce diagnosis lag time, as well as increase {{our knowledge of the}} underlying disease mechanisms in this multifactorial condition. This study hypothesized that there were significant alterations in the protein content in serum between LAM patients and healthy aged-matched controls. Study Aim: Identification of potential candidate biomarkers in LAM patient serum. Methods: Serum from LAM patient volunteers (n= 3, n= 5) and healthy aged matched control volunteers (n= 4, n= 5) were pooled and two runs of high-throughput protein analysis were carried out using 4 -plex iTRAQ technology on a <b>Triple</b> <b>TOF</b> 5600 (AB Sciex).

40|$|Camellia nitidissima Chi, {{known as}} a {{medicinal}} and edible plant in China, exhibits multiple bioactivities, especially antibacterial activity. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of the dichloromethane fraction (DF) of C. nitidissima Chi flowers on the pyocyanin production, swarming motility, and swimming motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1, at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations. Results showed that the DF had a remarkable inhibitory effect on pyocyanin production without influencing P. aeruginosa PAO 1 growth, and concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on swarming and swimming motility. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) were 0. 158 ± 0. 009, 0. 139 ± 0. 004, and 0. 334 ± 0. 049 mg/mL for pyocyanin production, swarming motility, and swimming motility, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the DF significantly down-regulated the expressions of lasR (p < 0. 05) and rhlR (p < 0. 01). In addition, gallic acid, catechin, ellagic acid, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and kaempferol were identified in the DF by HPLC <b>Triple</b> <b>TOF</b> MS/MS analysis. All six identified compounds showed inhibitory effects on pyocyanin production, swarming motility, and swimming motility, though ellagic acid showed the strongest effects, with IC 50 values of 0. 067 ± 0. 002, 0. 024 ± 0. 008, and 0. 020 ± 0. 003 mg/mL, respectively. Thus, the inhibitory effects on P. aeruginosa PAO 1 virulence factors might be attributable to these six and/or other compounds in the DF of C. nitidissima Chi flowers. Consequently, the C. nitidissima Chi flower, especially the DF, might be a potential quorum sensing inhibitor of P. aeruginosa PAO 1...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{therapeutic}} recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has triggered concerns of misdiagnosis of a {{plasma cell dyscrasia}} in treated patients. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine if infliximab (INF), adalimumab (ADA), eculizumab (ECU), vedolizumab (VEDO), and rituximab (RITU) are detected as monoclonal proteins by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE). Methods: Pooled normal sera were spiked with various concentrations (ranging from trough to peak) of INF, ADA, ECU, VEDO and RITU. The peak concentration for VEDO and RITU was also added to samples with known monoclonal gammopathies. All samples were analyzed by SPEP (Helena Laboratories) and IFE (Sebia); sera containing peak concentrations of mAbs were reflexed to electrospray-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (AbSciex <b>Triple</b> <b>TOF</b> 5600) for the intact light chain monoclonal immunoglobulin rapid accurate mass measurement (miRAMM). Results: For all mAbs tested, no quantifiable M-spikes were observed by SPEP at any concentration analyzed. Small. fraction abnormalities were noted on SPEP for VEDO at 300 mu g/mL and RITU at 400 mu g/mL, with identification of small IgG. proteins on IFE. Using miRAMM for peak samples, therapeutic mAbs light chain accurate masses were identified above the polyclonal background and were distinct from endogenous monoclonal gammopathies. Conclusions: MAbs should not be easily confounded with plasma cell dyscrasias in patients undergoing therapy except when a SPEP and IFE are performed within a couple of days from infusion (peak). In ambiguous cases the use of the miRAMM technology could precisely identify the therapeutic mAb distinct from any endogenous monoclonal protein...|$|E

40|$|Oxidative post-translational {{modifications}} (oxPTMs) {{can alter}} the function of proteins, and are important in the redox regulation of cell behaviour. The most informative technique to detect and locate oxPTMs within proteins is mass spectrometry (MS). However, proteomic MS data are usually searched against theoretical databases using statistical search engines, and the occurrence of unspecified or multiple modifications, or other unexpected features, can lead to failure to detect the modifications and erroneous identifications of oxPTMs. We have developed a new approach for mining data from accurate mass instruments that allows multiple modifications to be examined. Accurate mass extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) for specific reporter ions from peptides containing oxPTMs were generated from standard LC-MSMS data acquired on a rapid-scanning high-resolution mass spectrometer (ABSciex 5600 <b>Triple</b> <b>TOF).</b> The method was tested using proteins from human plasma or isolated LDL. A variety of modifications including chlorotyrosine, nitrotyrosine, kynurenine, oxidation of lysine, and oxidized phospholipid adducts were detected. For example, {{the use of a}} reporter ion at 184. 074 Da/e, corresponding to phosphocholine, was used to identify for the first time intact oxidized phosphatidylcholine adducts on LDL. In all cases the modifications were confirmed by manual sequencing. ApoB- 100 containing oxidized lipid adducts was detected even in healthy human samples, as well as LDL from patients with chronic kidney disease. The accurate mass XIC method gave a lower false positive rate than normal database searching using statistical search engines, and identified more oxidatively modified peptides. A major advantage was that additional modifications could be searched after data collection, and multiple modifications on a single peptide identified. The oxPTMs present on albumin and ApoB- 100 have potential as indicators of oxidative damage in ageing or inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|Oysters are {{economically}} (aquaculture) and ecologically important bivalves, with a calcareous {{shell that}} offers mechanical strength and protects them from predators. The shell composition is {{a blend of}} inorganic crystals and shell proteins that form an organic matrix which encloses and protects the soft inner tissue of the oyster. It has been found that the mechanical properties of shells of different oyster species vary. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the composition of shell matrix proteins of two phylogenetically related species: the Hong Kong oyster (C rassostrea hongkongensis) and the Portuguese oyster (C rassostrea angulata) which differ in their shell hardness and mechanical properties. Hong Kong oyster shells are comparatively stronger than Portuguese oysters. In the present study, modern proteomics and bioinformatics tools have been used to understand the nature of the Organic Matrix Proteins (OMP) and the possible mechanism involved in the variations observed in the mechanical properties of these two species of oyster shells. After visualizing proteins on SDSPAGE (1 DE) and twodimensional electrophoresis (2 DE) gels, the protein spots and their intensities were compared using PDQuest software and fourteen proteins of C. hongkongensis were found to be significantly different (student’s ttest; p< 0. 05) when compared to the C. angulata. Furthermore, shell OMP separated on 1 DE gels were processed using <b>Triple</b> <b>TOF</b> 5600 mass spectrometry and 42 proteins of C. hongkongensis and 37 of C. angulata identified. A Circos based comparative analysis of the shell proteins of both oyster species were prepared and compared against the shell proteome of other shell forming gastropods, molluscs and the proteome database of the Pacific oyster (C. gigas), whose genome has recently been sequenced, to study the evolutionary conservation of OMP and their function. This pioneering comparative proteomics of the two closely related oyster species, yet with remarkably different mechanical properties, expanded our understating of the molecular mechanism behind the naturally occurring shells of Hong Kong and Portuguese oysters having different hardness and mechanical properties. From biomaterial perspectives, knowledge gained through this study will be useful in biomedical research fields to develop novel biomaterials. For example, OMP identified exclusively in the Hong Kong oysters could be a useful resource for crystallizing a much harder biomaterial. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|In Africa, the {{importance}} of medicinal plants in folklore medicine and their contribution to primary healthcare is well recognized. Across the continent, local herbal mixtures still provide the only therapeutic option for about 80 % of the population. The vast floral diversity and the intrinsic ethnobotanical knowledge has been the backbone of localized traditional herbal medical practices. In Africa, an estimated 5400 of the 60000 described plant taxa possess over 16300 therapeutic uses. Similarly, with a therapeutic flora comprising of approximately 650 species, herbal medical practitioners in South Africa, make use of a plethora of plants to treat different human diseases and infections. Over the years, studies have identified numerous plant species with potential against chronic metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Globally, the incidence and prevalence of T 2 DM have reached epidemic proportions affecting people of all ages, nationalities and ethnicity. Considered the fourth leading cause of deaths by disease, T 2 DM is a global health crisis with an estimated diagnosis and mortality frequency of 1 every 5 seconds and 1 every 7 seconds respectively. Though the exact pathophysiology of T 2 DM is not entirely understood, initial peripheral insulin resistance in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle with subsequent pancreatic β-cell dysfunction resulting from an attempt to compensate for insulin resistance is a common feature of the disease. The current approach to treating T 2 DM {{is the use of}} oral antidiabetic agents (OAAs), insulin, and incretin-based drugs in an attempt to achieve glycaemic control and maintain glucose homeostasis. However, conventional anti-T 2 DM drugs have been shown to have limited efficacies and serious adverse effects. Hence, the need for newer, more efficacious and safer anti-T 2 DM agents. Sutherlandia frutescens subsp. microphylla is a flowering shrub of the pea family (Fabaceae/Leguminaceae) found mainly in the Western Cape and Karoo regions of Southern Africa. Concoctions of various parts of the plant are used in the management of different ailments including T 2 DM. However, despite extensive biological and pharmacological studies, few analyses exist of the chemical constituents of S. frutescens and no Triple Time of Flight Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (<b>Triple</b> <b>TOF</b> LC/MS/MS) analysis has been performed. The initial aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the phytochemical profile of hot aqueous, cold aqueous, 80 % ethanolic, 100 % ethanolic, 80 % methanolic and 100 % methanolic extracts of a single source S. frutescens plant material using colorimetric and spectrophotometric analysis. The hot aqueous extractant was found to be the best extractant for S. frutescens, yielding 1. 99 g of crude extract from 16 g fresh powdered plant material. This data suggests that application of heat and water as the extractant (hot aqueous) could play a vital role in extraction of bioactive compounds from S. frutescens and also justifies the traditional use of a tea infusion of S. frutescens. Colorimetric analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids, flavonols, tannins, and phenols in all extracts with varying intensity. The organic extracts 100 % methanol, 80 % and 100 % ethanol exhibited high color intensity (+++) for flavonoids and flavonols respectively, while all the extracts exhibited a moderate color intensity (++) for tannins and phenols. Spectrophotometric analysis of S. frutescens extracts revealed that all the organic extracts contained a significantly higher concentration (in mg/g of extract) of flavonols and tannins when compared to the aqueous extracts. All extracts contained approximately equal levels of phenols. These data confirm the presence of all four groups of bioactive phytocompounds in the S. frutescens extracts used in this study, and also confirm that different solvent extractants possess the capability to differentially extract specific groups of phytocompounds. in individual extracts. Further comparison of these compounds with online databases of anti-diabetic phytocompounds led to the preliminary identification of 10 possible anti-diabetic compounds; α-Pinene, Limonene, Sabinene, Carvone, Myricetin, Rutin, Stigmasterol, Emodin, Sarpagine and Hypoglycin B in crude and solid phase extraction (SPE) fractions of S. frutesecens. Furthermore, using two hepatic cell lines (Chang and HepG 2) as an in-vtro model system, the anti-T 2 DM properties of crude aqueous and organic extracts of S. frutescents was investigated and compared. Both aqueous and organic extracts of S. frutescens were found to decrease gluconeogenesis, increase glucose uptake and decrease lipid accumulation (Triacylglycerol, Diacylglycerol, and Monoacylglycerol) in Chang and HepG 2 hepatic cell cultures made insulin resistant (IR) following exposure to high concentration of insulin and fructose. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), the aqueous and organic extracts of S. frutescens were confirmed to regulate the expression of Vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP 3), Mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK 8), and Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1) in insulin resistant hepatic cells. IR-mediated downregulation of VAMP 3, MAPK 8, and IRS 1 mRNA in IR HepG 2 hepatic cell cultures was reversed in the presence of aqueous and organic extracts of S. frutescens. The hot aqueous extract displayed the highest activity in all the assays, while all the organic extracts displayed similar potency. In conclusion, this study reports that aqueous and organic extracts of S. frutescens possess numerous anti-diabetic compounds that can be further investigated for the development of new, more efficacious and less toxic anti-diabetic agents. The presence of multiple compounds in a single extract does suggest a synergistic or combinatorial therapeutic effect. These findings support the burgeoning body of in-vivo and in-vitro literature evidence on the anti-diabetic properties of S. frutescens and its use in folklore medicine...|$|E
