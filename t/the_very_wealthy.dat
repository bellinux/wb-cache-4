5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{precious}} objects served an important {{aid in the}} religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthy</b> could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces {{as a means to}} guarantee salvation in the afterlife. Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on Byzantine prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the Cambrai Madonna is probably the best known. In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.|$|E
5|$|By the 14th century, castles were {{combining}} defences with luxurious, sophisticated {{living arrangements}} and landscaped gardens and parks. Early gunpowder weapons {{were used to}} defend castles {{by the end of}} the 14th century and gunports became an essential feature for a fashionable castle. The economics of maintaining castles meant that many were left to decline or abandoned; in contrast, a small number of castles were developed by <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthy</b> into palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid elaborate architecture. Smaller defensible structures called tower houses emerged in the north of England to protect against the Scottish threat. By the late medieval period, town walls were increasingly less military in character and more often expressions of civic pride or part of urban governance: many grand gatehouses were built in the 14th and 15th centuries for these purposes.|$|E

According to leftists who rioted during the First Quarter Storm, the increasing disparity of wealth between <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthy</b> and the very poor {{that made up the}} majority of the Philippines' population led to a rise in crime and civil unrest around the country. These factors, including the formation of the New People's Army and a bloody Muslim separatist movement in the southern island of Mindanao led by the Moro National Liberation Front backed by Malaysia and allegedly by Liberal Party senator Ninoy Aquino, contributed to the rapid rise of civil discontent and unrest in the country.|$|E

Cyrenaica fell easily, and Nicetas' deputy Bonakis was sent against Egypt with 3,000 Byzantines and many more Berber auxiliaries. According to the account of John of Nikiu, the prefect of the Mareotis was bribed to switch sides, and in a battle before Alexandria, Nicetas' forces defeated and killed Phocas' general. The city's populace rose up in support of Nicetas' forces, the Patriarch, governor and treasurer fled, and Nicetas had the populace proclaim his cousin as emperor.|$|E

50|$|A final {{level of}} {{education}} was philosophical study. The study of philosophy is distinctly Greek, but was undertaken by many Roman students. To study philosophy, a student {{would have to go}} to a center of philosophy where philosophers taught, usually abroad in Greece. An understanding of a philosophical school of thought could have done much to add to Cicero's vaunted knowledge of 'that which is great', but could be pursued by <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthiest</b> of Rome's elite. Romans regarded philosophical education as distinctly Greek, and instead focused their efforts on building schools of law and rhetoric.|$|R

25|$|In the UK {{there was}} {{initially}} a widespread {{belief that a}} corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its shares only partly paid, as where shares are partly paid, the investor would be liable {{for the remainder of}} the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthy.</b> During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866–1867) and the Long Depression (1873–1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} at this time more {{disposable}} income; one outlet for this was {{the growth in the}} number of leisure homes - previously the preserve of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthy</b> - preferably placed alone on one of the numerous isolated lakesides or the coastal waterfront. An essential part of the leisure home (occupied for summer holidays and intermittently during the spring and autumn, but close up for the winter) has been the sauna, usually as a separate building. Indeed, the sauna had traditionally been a rural phenomenon, and its popularity in modern homes was a consequence of its growth as a leisure-time activity rather than as a washing facility. The Finnish Association of Architects (SAFA) and commercial companies organised design competitions for standardised models of leisure homes and saunas, preferably built in wood. Architects could also use the summer house type and sauna as an opportunity to experiment, an opportunity that many architects still use today. In terms of size and opulence, Aalto's own summer house, the so-called Experimental House, in Muuratsalo (1952–53) fell between the traditions of middle-class splendor and modest rusticity, while its accompanying lakeside sauna, built from round logs, was a modern application of rustic construction. The 1960s witnessed more experimental summer house types, designed with the objective of serial production. The most noted of these was Matti Suuronen's Futuro House (1968) and Venturo House (1971), of which several were made and sold worldwide. Their success was short lived, however, as production was hit by the 1970s energy crisis.|$|E
50|$|However, {{despite its}} small size in {{comparison}} to its neighbors, Carbery was one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthiest</b> principalities in Ireland. This wealth came not, for the most part, from its predominantly rocky lands, but from its numerous excellent harbours, and greatest proximity to France and Spain. Some of the eastern portion of the principality was however quite fertile. The MacCarthys Reagh {{were reported to have}} the greatest income of all the Gaelic princes in Ireland. Only the Earls of Desmond, who were intermittently able to force the MacCarthys to pay them tribute in order to avoid continual harassment, were wealthier.|$|R

The broader context for this debate is the rising anger within the UK of the perceived injustice of the taxation system and stagnant levels of social mobility.|$|R
500|$|... "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] {{was written}} by Marc Wilmore and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore {{as part of the}} twenty-third season of The Simpsons (2011–12).

The title is a reference to Exit Through the Gift Shop, a 2010 street art documentary by graffiti artist Banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons episode titled [...] "MoneyBART" [...] (2010). The Richard Hawley song [...] "Tonight The Streets Are Ours", which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop, is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club noted in his review of [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] that the [...] "reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti-art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop.

30|$|It {{is true that}} {{families}} {{at the top of}} the income ladder in the United States have the highest current enrollment rates in private preschool programs. They would benefit the most financially in the short-run from a universal public program (though <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthiest</b> are likely to stay with private programs). As the proposal under evaluation here is for a half day program, it is possible that many higher-income parents could be induced to spend much of what they already spend to add on a second half-day of comparable quality, while public child care funds are used to add on second half-day of comparable quality for children from lower-income families.|$|R
50|$|The peerage has {{traditionally}} been associated with high gentry, the British nobility, and in recent times, the Conservative Party. Only a tiny proportion of wealthy people are peers, but the peerage includes a few of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>wealthiest,</b> such as Hugh Grosvenor (the Duke of Westminster) and Lord Salisbury of Hatfield House. Most of the largest stately homes belong to the National Trust due to forms of estate tax. A few peers own {{one or more of}} England's largest estates passed down through inheritance, particularly those with medieval roots: until the late 19th century the dominant English and Scottish land division on death was primogeniture.|$|R

The vast majority of carpets in 15th- and 16th-century paintings are either from the Ottoman Empire, or possibly European copies of these types from the Balkans, Spain, or elsewhere. [...] In fact these were not the finest Islamic carpets of the period, and few of the top-quality Turkish [...] "court" [...] carpets are seen.
