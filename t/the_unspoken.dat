While this is <b>the</b> <b>unspoken</b> assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E

"Circles" [...] was one {{of several}} songs that George Harrison wrote in Rishikesh, India, when he and his Beatles bandmates were {{attending}} Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation course in the spring of 1968. Aside from providing an opportunity to progress with meditation techniques, the two-month stay marked Harrison's return to the guitar after two years of studying the Indian sitar, partly under the tutelage of Ravi Shankar. Harrison biographer Simon Leng considers that [...] "Circles" [...] was composed on an organ, however, as most of Harrison's Indian-inspired melodies since 1966 had been. Leng writes of [...] "fugue-like keyboard parts" [...] on the song and [...] "bass figures" [...] that partly recall the works of Johann Sebastian Bach.
