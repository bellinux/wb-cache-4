5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with the manner in which <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was made and not whether <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

5|$|Early World Cups {{were given}} to {{countries}} at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
