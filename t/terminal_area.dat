5|$|In June 2015, the Airport Drive {{extension}} was completed, {{creating a}} second major {{link to the}} airport. The link starts at the M80 Western Ring Road and provides direct access to Melrose Drive 1.5 kilometres from the <b>terminal</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|AirTrain {{connects the}} airport {{terminals}} and parking areas with LIRR and subway lines in Queens. The system {{consists of three}} routes: one route each connecting the terminals with the Howard Beach and Jamaica stations, and one route looping continuously around the central <b>terminal</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|AirTrain JFK is free {{within the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>area</b> {{and to the}} hotel and car rental shuttle buses at Federal Circle. Entering or leaving the system at the Jamaica or Howard Beach {{stations}} requires that a $5 fare be paid using a MetroCard. A $1 fee is charged for all new MetroCard purchases. Transferring to the Q3, Q10, or B15 from Terminal 5 requires an extra $2.75 fare, since the MTA does not offer free transfers from the AirTrain. Consequently, entering the subway at either Jamaica or Howard Beach costs $7.75, and entering the LIRR at Jamaica costs $14.25 during peak hours and $9 during off-peak with the LIRR CityTicket.|$|E
50|$|Sheremetyevo International Airport {{has four}} {{operating}} passenger terminals and one special terminal {{reserved for the}} use of private and business aviation. The airport's terminals are divided into two groups based on geographical location: the north and south <b>terminal</b> <b>areas.</b> The two <b>terminal</b> <b>areas</b> are linked by regular internal and external bus services.|$|R

5|$|M-80 {{starts at}} exit378 along Interstate 75 (I-75) near Kinross. A short section of it runs {{concurrently}} with H-63 (Mackinac Trail) {{to connect to}} ramps in the interchange. This section runs northeast–southwest across the freeway from Mud Lake before the M-80 designation turns southeasterly along Tone Road running past Kinross Lake in a forested area. Tone Road curves sharply northeasterly and then southeasterly to run around {{the north end of}} the runway complex at the Chippewa County International Airport. The highway runs due east past the airport <b>terminal</b> <b>area</b> to the south and a prison and the residential area of the former Kincheloe Air Force Base to the north. Near Dukes Lake, M-80 crosses Gaines Highway and leaves the former base and runs through forest to the intersection with M-129 where M-80 terminates. The roadway continues eastward as 17Mile Road in Pickford Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminus}} for {{the high-speed}} line in London is St Pancras railway station. During the 2000s, {{towards the end}} of the construction of the CTRL, the entire station complex was renovated, expanded and rebranded as StPancras International, with a new security-sealed <b>terminal</b> <b>area</b> for Eurostar trains to continental Europe. In addition, it retained traditional domestic connections to the north and south of England. The new extension doubled the length of the central platforms now used for Eurostar services; new platforms have been provided for existing domestic East Midlands Trains and the Southeastern high-speed services that run along High Speed 1 to Kent. New platforms on the Thameslink line across London were built beneath the western margins of the station, and the station at King's Cross Thameslink was closed.|$|E
5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run every 2 minutes during peak hours, for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central <b>terminal</b> <b>area.</b> However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes during peak hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar to night service, with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process for bonding an electronic component, which has several aluminium <b>terminal</b> <b>areas</b> on its surface, to a substrate having {{a large number of}} pads, by means of contact metallizations formed between the aluminium <b>terminal</b> <b>areas</b> and the pads, whereby the contact metallizations consist of the connecting material gold, at least to a large extent. The pads on the substrate are therefore provided with bumps which consist to a large extent of gold (e. g. gold ball bumps), and furthermore, several aluminium <b>terminal</b> <b>areas</b> of the electronic component are aligned with the pads provided with bumps on the substrate and furthermore, under the exclusive effect of pressure and temperature, i. e. in particular without the application of ultrasound, a connection is made between the aluminium <b>terminal</b> <b>areas</b> and the bumps consisting to a large extent of gold on the substrate pads. The invention is therefore ideally suited for the flip chip assembly of non-bumped anorganic subst rates (e. g. ceramics) and organic substrates (e. g. FR- 4 PCB) ...|$|R

25|$|Early in the 20th {{century the}} PRR tried {{electric}} power for its trains. First was the New York <b>terminal</b> <b>area,</b> where tunnels and a city law restricting {{the burning of}} coal precluded steam locomotives. There a direct current (DC) 650-volt third rail powered PRR locomotives (and LIRR passenger cars). The system was put into service in 1910.|$|E
