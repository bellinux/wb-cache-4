2500|$|High-concentration [...] is {{referred}} to as [...] "high-test peroxide" [...] (HTP). It can be used either as a monopropellant (not mixed with fuel) or as the oxidizer component of a bipropellant rocket. Use as a monopropellant takes advantage of the decomposition of 70–98% concentration hydrogen peroxide into steam and oxygen. The propellant is pumped into a reaction chamber, where a catalyst, usually a silver or platinum screen, triggers decomposition, producing steam at over , which is expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. [...] monopropellant produces a maximal specific impulse (Isp) of 161 s (1.6 kN·s/kg). Peroxide was the first major monopropellant adopted for use in rocket applications. Hydrazine eventually replaced hydrogen-peroxide monopropellant thruster applications primarily because of a 25% increase in the vacuum specific impulse.

40|$|<b>Turbo-pumps</b> have weak points, such as {{when the}} pumping {{operation}} becomes unstable in the rising portion of the head characteristics and/or the cavitation occurs under the intolerably low suction head. To overcome both weak points simultaneously, this article proposes a unique pumping system with counter-rotating mechanism, which consists of two stage impellers and a peculiar motor with double rotors. The front and the rear impellers are driven by the inner and the outer rotors of the motor, respectively, keeping the relative rotational speed constant and counter-balancing the rotational torque. Such driving conditions not only smartly improve the unstable performance at lower discharge, but also suppress the cavitation at higher discharge, in the optimum cooperation with the impeller works and the rotor outputs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hot {{isostatic}} pressing (HIPping) technology {{is used for}} healing the casting defects for aerospace applications. Castings used for aerospace applications like <b>turbo-pumps</b> need to meet very stringent quality requirements. Complexity of the castings used in these applications, {{makes it difficult to}} meet the quality requirements in all the areas. Defects like gas holes, shrinkages, cavities etc. may occur in few locations and need to be repaired by welding or healed by HIPping. In the present study, we attempted to simulate the defect healing capability of HIP in a systematic manner. Artificial defects were created in Austenite-Martensite grade stainless steel cast rod. These rods were then subjected to HIP prcoss cycle at 1150 ˚C and at a pressure of 1620 bar. Healing of the defects was ensured through X-ray radiography. Detailed microstructural analysis using optical metallography and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDX was carried out before and after HIPping, to understand the defect healing mechanisms. These results are discussed in detail here...|$|R

40|$|<b>Turbo-pumps</b> have weak points, {{such as the}} pumping {{operation}} is unstable on the positive slope of the head curve and/or the cavitation occurs at the low suction head. To improve simultaneously both weak points, the first author invented the unique pumping unit composed of the tandem impellers and the peculiar motor with the double rotational armatures. The front and the rear impellers are driven by the inner and the outer armatures of the motor, respectively. Both impeller speeds are automatically and smartly adjusted {{in response to the}} pumping discharge, while the rotational torques between both impellers/armatures are counter-balanced. Such speeds contribute to suppress successfully not only the unstable operation at the low discharge but also the cavitation at the high discharge, as verified with the axial flow type pumping unit in the previous paper. Continuously, this paper investigates experimentally the effects of the tandem impeller profiles on the pump performances and the rotational speeds against the discharge, using the impellers whose loads are low and/or high at the normal discharge. The worthy remarks are that (a) the unstable operation is suppressed as expected and the shut off power is scarcely large in the smart control, (b) the blade profile contributes to determine the discharge giving the maximum/minimum rotational speed where the reverse flow may incipiently appears at the front impeller inlet, (c) the tandem impeller profiles scarcely affect the rotational speeds, while the loads of the front and the rear impellers ar...|$|R
40|$|Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) {{materials}} {{have been developed}} and used in many applications to reduce the weight of components where weight and deflection are the driving design requirement. MMC materials are being developed for use in some propulsion system components, such as <b>turbo-pumps</b> and thrust chambers. However, to date, no propulsion system valves have been developed that {{take advantage of the}} materials unique properties. The stiffness of MMC's could help keep valves light or improve life where deflection is the design constraint (such as seal and bearing locations). The low CTE of the materials might allow the designer to reduce tolerances and clearances producing better performance and lighter weight valves. Using unique manufacturing processes allow parts to be plated/coated for longer life and allow joining either by welding or threading/bolting. Additionally, casting of multi part pre-forms to form a single part can lead to designs that would be hard or impossible to manufacture with other methods. Therefore, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has developed and tested a prototype propulsion system valve that utilizes these materials to demonstrate these advantages. Through design and testing, this effort will determine the best use of these materials in valves designed to achieve the goal of a highly reliable and lightweight propulsion system. This paper is a continuation of the paper, The Application of Metal Matrix Composite Materials In Propulsion System Valves, presented at the JANNAF Conference held in April, 2002. Fabrication techniques employed, valve development, and valve test results will be discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{monograph}} {{is intended}} as a concise and self-contained guide to practitioners and graduate students for applying approaches in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to real-world problems that require a quantification of viscous incompressible flows. In various projects related to NASA missions, the authors have gained CFD expertise over many years by developing and utilizing tools especially related to viscous incompressible flows. They are looking at CFD from an engineering perspective, which is especially useful when working on real-world applications. From that point of view, CFD requires two major elements, namely methods/algorithm and engineering/physical modeling. As for the methods, CFD research has been performed with great successes. In terms of modeling/simulation, mission applications require {{a deeper understanding of}} CFD and flow physics, which has only been debated in technical conferences and to a limited scope. This monograph fills the gap by offering in-depth examples for students and engineers to get useful information on CFD for their activities. The procedural details are given with respect to particular tasks from the authors’ field of research, for example simulations of liquid propellant rocket engine subsystems, <b>turbo-pumps</b> and the blood circulations in the human brain as well as the design of artificial heart devices. However, those examples serve as illustrations of computational and physical challenges relevant to many other fields. Unlike other books on incompressible flow simulations, no abstract mathematics are used in this book. Assuming some basic CFD knowledge, readers can easily transfer the insights gained from specific CFD applications in engineering to their area of interest...|$|R

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} API-CIMS is a downsized {{version of}} the instrument used and described by Marandino et al. (2007). A schematic of the main components is given in Figure S 1. The ion source consists of a heated and temperature-controlled glass-lined stainless steel tube containing a radioactive 63 Ni foil, as described in Saltzman et al. (2009). Lens voltages for ion optics were supplied by a Gamma custom multichannel DC power supply and the quadrupole supply was an Extrel QPS 500 DC/RF power supply and mass command board. Ions were detected using an ion multiplier and discriminator/preamplifier. The primary difference between this instrument and the earlier CIMS instrument is the replacement of a <b>turbo-pumped</b> vacuum stage (1000 L s- 1; 5 x 10 - 3 Torr) in the vacuum system with a turbo charger/rough pumped (50 L s- 1; 1 Torr) collision chamber. The collision chamber is an Extrel API collision chamber with modified entrance configuration. A custom Labview™ program and multichannel A/D interface (NI USB- 6343, X Series DAQ) were used to provide the mass command signal and to acquire the ion counts. The same interface was used to acquire the saw tooth synchronizing signal and to output the ion counts as analog signals for logging by the multichannel data logger described above. The gas standard was supplied from a cylinder (11. 79 ppm) at a mass flow-controlled flow rate of 3 - 6 ml min- 1, resulting in a d 3 -DMS level of 440 – 885 ppt in the air stream.

50|$|Note that {{effective}} exhaust velocity and actual exhaust velocity can be significantly different, for example when a rocket is run within the atmosphere, atmospheric pressure {{on the outside of}} the engine causes a retarding force that reduces the specific impulse, and the {{effective exhaust velocity}} goes down, whereas the actual exhaust velocity is largely unaffected. Also, sometimes rocket engines have a separate nozzle for the <b>turbo-pump</b> turbine gas, and then calculating the effective exhaust velocity requires averaging the two mass flows as well as accounting for any atmospheric pressure.|$|E

The Viking airframe was designed and built under contract to NRL by the Glenn L. Martin Company. The engine, built by Reaction Motors Inc (RMI) of New Jersey, was the largest liquid-fueled rocket engine developed in the United States up to that time. It produced 89 kN (20000 lbf) of thrust.

5000|$|The KORD (Russian {{acronym for}} KOntrol Raketnykh Dvigateley—literally [...] "Control (of) Rocket Engines"—Russian: Контроль ракетных двигателей) was the {{automatic}} {{engine control system}} devised to throttle, shutdown and monitor the large cluster of 30 engines in Block A (the first stage). The KORD system controlled the differential thrusting {{of the outer ring}} of 24 engines for pitch and yaw attitude control by throttling them appropriately and it also shut down malfunctioning engines situated opposite each other. This was to negate the pitch or yaw moment diametrically opposing engines in the outer ring would generate, thus maintaining symmetrical thrust. Block A could perform nominally with two pairs of opposing engines shut down (26/30 engines), Block B with one pair of opposing engines shutdown (6/8 engines) and Block V with one engine shut down (3/4 engines). Unfortunately the KORD system was unable to react to rapidly occurring processes such as the exploding <b>turbo-pump</b> during the 5L launch. Due to the deficiencies of the KORD system a new computer system was developed for the last launch, vehicle 7L, called the S-530. It was the first Soviet digital guidance and control system.
