2500|$|In the {{contract}} they signed in July 1934, Shirley's parents agreed to four films a year (rather than the three they wished). A succession of films followed: The Little Colonel, Our Little Girl, Curly Top (with the signature song [...] "Animal Crackers in My Soup") and <b>The</b> <b>Littlest</b> Rebel in 1935. Curly Top and <b>The</b> <b>Littlest</b> Rebel were named to Varietys list of top box office draws for 1935. In 1936, Captain January, Poor Little Rich Girl, Dimples and Stowaway were released.

2500|$|In 1973, {{the film}} {{historian}} Donald Bogle, in {{his history of}} African Americans in American film, refers to Robinson's role in <b>The</b> <b>Littlest</b> Rebel and other Shirley Temple movies as the [...] "quintessential Uncle Tom." [...] Other critics noted that such criticism fails {{to account for the}} genuine affection and chemistry between Robinson and Temple that came through on the screen, and that the role represented a breakthrough for Hollywood stereotypes in that {{it was the first time}} a black man was made the guardian of a white life. Bogle later modulated his criticism by noting that the reliable, articulate Uncle Billy character in <b>The</b> <b>Littlest</b> Rebel was a cut above the characters portrayed by Lincoln [...] "Stepin Fetchit" [...] Perry.|$|E

2500|$|Robinson and Temple {{became the}} first interracial dance {{partners}} in Hollywood history.

2500|$|Most of the Shirley Temple {{films were}} inexpensively made at $200,000 or $300,000 per picture and were comedy-dramas with songs and dances added, sentimental and melodramatic situations, and {{little in the}} way of {{production}} values. Her film titles are a clue to the way she was marketed—Curly Top and Dimples, and her [...] "little" [...] pictures such as The Little Colonel and <b>The</b> <b>Littlest</b> Rebel. Shirley often played a fixer-upper, a precocious Cupid, or the good fairy in these films, reuniting her estranged parents or smoothing out the wrinkles in the romances of young couples. Elements of the traditional fairy tale were woven into her films: wholesome goodness triumphing over meanness and evil, for example, or wealth over poverty, marriage over divorce, or a booming economy over a depressed one. As the girl matured into a pre-adolescent, the formula was altered slightly to encourage her naturalness, naïveté, and tomboyishness to come forth and shine while her infant innocence, which had served her well at six but was inappropriate for her tweens (or later childhood years), was toned down.|$|E
