5|$|While his {{men were}} {{clearing}} up the remaining German positions, Ingram scouted ahead in search of machine gun nests in the village. He soon located one positioned in a house, which had been firing through <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> ventilator. Managing to enter the house, he shot the gunner through the ventilator. He fired several more shots into <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> before rushing {{to the head of}} <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> stairs. By thus cutting off any means of escape, a further thirty Germans were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The low granite block {{foundation}} {{of the house is}} more exposed {{on the west side of}} the house, allowing for a full-height door exiting from <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b> The stone stack supports four fireplaces that each support the hall, hall chamber, parlor and <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b> Also there is a smoke chamber in the stack in the attic. The original kitchen, now in the hall, features a large fireplace with bake oven in the rear wall of the firebox. The attic once housed a large loom that was later moved down to the west side of <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b> Amos G. Avery, who owned and restored the house prior to its 1992 National Register of Historic Places listing, removed a 1871 Victorian balustrade on the front staircase installed by the second Theophilus Avery.|$|E

50|$|Inspired by {{the success}} of Cabot Clothbound, the Kehlers went on to build <b>the</b> <b>Cellars</b> at Jasper Hill, a 22,000 square foot cheese aging {{facility}} built into the hillside of Jasper Hill Farm. <b>The</b> <b>Cellars</b> became operational in 2008, and now ages cheese made by Jasper Hill Farm, as well as products made by 4 other creameries local to northern Vermont and New Hampshire. <b>The</b> <b>Cellars</b> provides sales, marketing & distribution services for the products in its collection, with the goal of reducing the barriers to entry for small-scale cheesemakers. Cheeses aged at <b>the</b> <b>Cellars</b> are distributed nationally within the US; select products are exported for sale in Europe, Canada and Australia.|$|R

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, Mona Best decided to open a club in her cellar, and offered the Les Stewart Quartet a {{residency}} if they would help convert <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b> Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop the residency. This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned to calling themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting <b>the</b> <b>cellar,</b> the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959. The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> had no air conditioning and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. The Quarrymen were afforded the use of Brown's three input amplifier (which, along with McCartney's Elpico, meant that all four guitarists were electric), and sang through one microphone connected to the club's small PA system.|$|E

When Scotty plays it, the archaeologist's voice recites a series of incantations, resurrecting a mysterious, demonic entity. Cheryl becomes increasingly hysterical and locks herself in her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. Meanwhile, Ash gives Linda a silver necklace, which she absolutely loves. Cheryl is then attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. Unable to convince the others of what happened, she asks Ash to take her into town for the night. However, Ash soon discovers that the bridge has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape, learning {{that the only way}} to kill the entity is to dismember it when it possesses a host. Cheryl succumbs to the entity and attacks the others, stabbing Linda in the ankle with a pencil before Scotty is able to force her into <b>the</b> <b>cellar.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1843, {{the manor}} house was {{destroyed}} by fire, news of which was carried in The Illustrated London News. The estate passed into the Court of Chancery and was purchased by Daniel Higford Davall Burr.

Burr saved the 17th-century manor's wooden staircase, though all that remains of the building is a staircase to <b>the</b> <b>cellar</b> (which is now home to a colony of bats). By 1851 the new building was complete, costing £20,000 and having a Tudor-like appearance. Burr held the estate until his death 50 years later, when was inherited by his son, who sold it in 1893.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison.
