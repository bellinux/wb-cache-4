25|$|According {{to senior}} World Bank officials, Pakistan practiced {{extensive}} economic discrimination against East Pakistan: greater government spending on West Pakistan, financial transfers from East to West Pakistan, {{the use of}} East Pakistan's foreign-exchange surpluses to finance West Pakistani imports, and refusal by the central government <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>funds</b> allocated to East Pakistan because previous spending had been under budget; East Pakistan generated 70 percent of Pakistan's export revenue with its jute and tea. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested for treason in the Agartala Conspiracy Case, and was released during the 1969 uprising in East Pakistan which resulted in Ayub Khan's resignation. General Yahya Khan assumed power, reintroducing martial law.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of U.S. intention, in June 2007, Hamas {{gained control}} of the entire Gaza Strip by force, and {{subsequently}} PA President Abbas {{declared a state of}} emergency and formed a new cabinet without Hamas members. This cabinet included the appointed Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. The division led the U.S. and Israel <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>funds</b> to the PA and Israel increased coordination with PA forces again. Raids to hunt down Hamas members and fighters in the West Bank occurred with the approval of the U.S. and Israel. These circumstances led to the creation of the PASF training program, which became the predominant aspect of U.S. security assistance to the Palestinian Authority.|$|E

Abby's husband was adamantly opposed to the museum (as well as to modern art itself) and refused <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>funds</b> for the venture, which had to be obtained from other sources and resulted in the frequent shifts of location. Nevertheless, he eventually donated the land for the current site of the museum, plus other gifts over time, and thus became in effect one of its greatest benefactors.|$|E

The second president, Rev. Joel Smith Bacon, stayed two years (1830-1832), fighting court cases <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>funding</b> for the college before leaving out of frustration. The <b>funds</b> were not <b>released</b> until 1836, when Benjamin Franklin Farnsworth became the third president hired. By {{then there was a}} power struggle in progress; Farnsworth had been hired by the Baptists to frustrate the Campbellites who were attempting {{to take control of the}} college.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1968, WMATA polling {{suggested}} that citizens of Maryland and Virginia strongly supported Metro. After all, these people desperately needed a quick, efficient way of getting to their jobs in the District of Columbia. Eager {{to find some way}} to break ground and begin the construction of the subway system, WMATA asked voters in the two states to approve construction bonds for the subway. They overwhelming did so in November 1968, with 72 percent of voters in favor. Natcher also agreed in the fall of 1968 <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>funds</b> for architectural plans, engineering design, and land acquisition (but not construction) of Metro, and Metro broke ground in December 1969. But as Natcher continued to withhold construction funds through 1971, citizens of Maryland and Virginia began to think that the money they had invested in Metro would be wasted. Soon, political pressure was building on members of Congress from these two states to stop Natcher and move ahead with Metro.|$|E
500|$|At {{around the}} time the Chichester Festival opened, plans for the {{creation}} of the National Theatre were coming to fruition. The British government agreed <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>funds</b> for a new building on the South Bank of the Thames. Lord Chandos was appointed chairman of the National Theatre Board in 1962, and in August Olivier accepted its invitation to be the company's first director. As his assistants, he recruited the directors John Dexter and William Gaskill, with Kenneth Tynan as literary adviser or [...] "dramaturge". Pending the construction of the new theatre, the company was based at the Old Vic. With the agreement of both organisations, Olivier remained in overall charge of the Chichester Festival during the first three seasons of the National; he used the festivals of 1964 and 1965 to give preliminary runs to plays he hoped to stage at the Old Vic.|$|E
