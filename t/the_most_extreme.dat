5|$|In Serbia, Milošević {{condemned}} the Croatian attack, but the Milošević-influenced press also denounced {{the leadership of}} the RSK as being incompetent, while <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> politicians, including Vojislav Šešelj, demanded retaliation against Croatia. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić begged for the Yugoslav Army to help while accusing Milošević of treason.|$|E
5|$|NGC 6251 is {{an active}} supergiant {{elliptical}} radio galaxy more than 340 million light-years away from Earth. It has a Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus, {{and is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> examples of a Seyfert galaxy. This galaxy may be associated with gamma-ray source 3EG J1621+8203, which has high-energy gamma-ray emission. It is also noted for its one-sided radio jet—one of the brightest known—discovered in 1977.|$|E

5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} {{election}} to Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the Crittenden Compromise—authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with slavery in the territories and Washington, D.C.—was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> proposal to which the South would agree. Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.|$|E
5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E
30|$|The {{full range}} of {{response}} options was used for seven items, <b>the</b> three <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> levels of dissatisfaction (scores of 0 – 2) were not used in four items and <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> indications of dissatisfaction (scores of 0 - 1) were not used in four items. Overall the data were negatively skewed. Atkinson et al. (9) commented that reports of skewness and ceiling effects are particularly common in the patient satisfaction literature. This might raise concerns that the MacTSQ would be insensitive to improvements in satisfaction but, {{in spite of the}} skewed data, investigations into the sensitivity of the measure were promising.|$|R
5000|$|Battle Kommand Records (BKR) was an American {{underground}} {{record label}} founded by Blake Judd and Rebecca Clegg in 2004, based in St. Charles, Illinois. The company's stated intent is [...] "to bring some of <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> music to <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> audiences." [...] BKR {{has thus far}} concentrated on extreme metal genres such as black, doom and Death metal, {{as well as more}} experimental forms of noise rock and ambient music. The label is the home of Judd's bands Nachtmystium and Twilight, and has released records by Krieg, Leviathan, N.I.L., Sapthuran, and Xasthur, among others. Battle Kommand Records merged with Candlelight Records in January 2009.|$|R

5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme,</b> some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} was {{initially}} postponed, but was forfeited by the White Sox {{the next day}} by order of American League president Lee MacPhail. Disco Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists have described the event as expressive of racism and homophobia while others have denied this connection. Disco Demolition Night remains well {{known as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> promotions in major league history.|$|E
5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae {{occur when}} the {{exploding}} star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun). In <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> {{points of}} its perceptibility, {{it was felt}} with {{intensity}} II or III (Weak) at Healdsburg {{in the north and}} Santa Barbara in the south, Visalia in the central valley and Twain Harte in the Sierra Nevada foothills. It was also listed as having been felt (with no specific intensity level given) by residents in high-rise buildings in Reno, Nevada. Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage {{on the second floor of}} the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to be consistent with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats save for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as developing from a girl into {{a woman in the}} course of the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a woman in the grip of an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart.|$|E

5|$|On August14, Cindy {{passed over}} Martinique with rough winds and {{particularly}} violent rain, amplified by the storm's {{interaction with the}} rising terrain. The greatest quantities fell to the northeast of a line between Sainte-Marie and Fort-de-France, with day totals of more than 4in (100mm) recorded at every weather station in that region. The highest 1- and 24-hour rainfall rates were observed in Le Prêcheur, totaling 5.79in (147mm) and 12.0in (305mm), respectively. These amounts were well above the September average of 9.29in (236mm), making Cindy one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> rain events in the island's history. A maximum gust of 40mph (65km/h) was recorded during the storm, though sustained winds onshore did not reach tropical storm force.|$|E
5|$|On islands, birds can {{contribute}} {{as much as}} 60% of a cat's diet. In nearly all cases, however, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a 'mesopredator release' effect; where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey. Domestic cats are, however, {{known to be a}} contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction. The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, the New Zealand merganser, and the common diving petrel are a few from a long list, with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extreme</b> {{examples}} of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat. The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies {{of up to}} 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, {{while the rest of}} the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.|$|E
