The party competed against the parties affiliated with Pridi Phanomyong and the Progress Party (Thailand) of brothers Seni and Kukrit Pramoj. In the January 1946 elections, the Pridi-led coalition had won {{a majority in the}} Parliament. However, Pridi declined the nomination as prime minister and the parliament appointed Khuang as premier. Khuang resigned in March 1946, after being defeated on a bill, and was replaced by Pridi.

The by-elections were suspended by the Constitution Court while it deliberated whether to annul the main elections. In press interviews in exile, Thaksin was to insist on his technical majority.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, in Qajari ruled Persia (today Iran) <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>Party</b> (also {{translated}} as Democratic Party) during the constitutional period, {{was one of}} two major parliamentary parties at the time, alongside its rival the Moderate Socialists Party. Initially an offshoot of the Transcaucasia-based Social Democratic Party, it was largely composed of liberal middle-class intellectuals and stood for a representative political system and {{the separation of church and}} state, to limit the authority of the monarchy and the clergy. It influenced the Constitution of 1906 which created the Majlis (parliament) and the senate. However, due internal and external factors, the party couldn't grow significantly and was suppressed and when the Pahlavi Dynasty was established in 1925, fragmenting itself into different smaller associations.|$|E
25|$|Recently, liberal {{parties and}} {{institutions}} {{have made a}} major push for political power. On a continental level, liberals are organised in the Africa Liberal Network, which contains influential parties such as the Popular Movement in Morocco, the Democratic Party in Senegal, and the Rally of the Republicans in Côte d'Ivoire. In Asia, several Asian nations have explicitly rejected important liberal principles. Continentally, liberals are organized through the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats, which includes powerful parties such the Liberal Party in the Philippines, the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan, and <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>Party</b> in Thailand. A notable example of liberal influence {{can be found in}} India. In India, the most populous democracy in the world, the Indian National Congress has long dominated political affairs.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{his career}} as a journalist, he later founded Manager Daily {{newspaper}} as well as satellite broadcaster ASTV. Originally a strong supporter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, he later became a leader of the anti-Thaksin movement. Under his leadership, the PAD was the major player in the 2005–2006 Thai political crisis that led to the 2006 military coup that toppled the Thaksin government. When Thaksin-affiliated parties won the 2007 general election, Sondhi became the major player in the 2008–2009 Thai political crisis, leading the PAD in violent clashes with security forces and anti-PAD protestors as well as the seizure of Government House, Don Muang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Sondhi is more or less a supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>Party</b> and stopped the PAD's protests after Democrat leader Abhisit Vejjajiva was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} start of World War I, Iran {{declared}} neutrality. When the war erupted on a full scale, Tabriz and much of northwestern-northern Iran had already been de facto occupied by Russia for several years. In later years of World War I, the Ottoman troops intervened and {{took control of the}} city by defeating the Russian troops stationed there. By this time, the Ottoman army led by Enver Pasha threatened the whole Russian army in the Caucasus region. Russian troops recaptured the city from the Ottomans at a later stage of the war. By escalation of the revolution in Russia, the Russian armies in Iranian Azerbaijan were evacuated, and the actual power passed {{into the hands of the}} local committee of <b>the</b> <b>democrat</b> <b>party,</b> with Ismail Nawbari at its head. Following Russia's retreat, the Ottomans captured the city once again for a few months until the decisive end of the war, and retreated thereafter. After World War I, a new era in the county's history began. Reza Shah, brigadier-general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, declared himself the king of the country following a coup d'état. He started with promises of modernization programs in Iran which was concentrated on the unification of the country, under the idea of one country, one nation. This included centralization of the power and imposing restrictions on the local culture, heritages, and language in Iranian Azerbaijan, and the city of Tabriz. The modernization and nationalization plan of Reza Shah continued until the surge of World War II.|$|E
500|$|In early 1949 Sihanouk {{traveled}} to Paris {{with his parents}} {{to negotiate with the}} French government for more autonomy over Cambodia. The Modus Vivendi was replaced by a new Franco-Khmer treaty, which recognised Cambodia as [...] "independent" [...] within the French Union. In practice, the treaty granted only limited self-rule to Cambodia. While Cambodia was given free rein in managing its foreign ministry and to a lesser extent, its defence, most of the other ministries remained under French control. Meanwhile, dissenting legislators from the national assembly started attacking the government led by prime minister Penn Nouth over its failure to resolve deepening financial and corruption problems plaguing the country. The dissenting legislators, led by Yem Sambaur, who had defected from <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>party</b> in November 1948, deposed Penn Nouth. Yem Sambaur replaced him, but his appointment did not sit well with the Democrats, who in turn pressured Sihanouk to dissolve the national assembly and hold elections.|$|E
