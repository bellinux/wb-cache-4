40|$|The {{cumulative}} {{number of}} publications, {{in particular in}} the life sciences, requires efficient methods for the automated extraction of information and semantic information retrieval. The recognition and identification of information-carrying units in text - concept denominations and named entities - relevant to a certain domain is a fundamental step. The focus of this thesis lies on the recognition of chemical entities and the new biological named entity type histone modifications, which are both important {{in the field of}} drug discovery. As the emergence of new research fields as well as the discovery and generation of novel entities goes along with the coinage of new terms, the perpetual adaptation of respective named entity recognition approaches to new domains is an important step for information extraction. Two methodologies have been investigated in this concern: the state-of-the-art machine learning method, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), and an approximate string search method based on dictionaries. Recognition methods that rely on dictionaries are strongly dependent on the availability of entity <b>terminology</b> <b>collections</b> as well as on its quality. In the case of chemical entities the terminology is distributed over more than 7 publicly available data sources. The join of entries and accompanied terminology from selected resources enables the generation of a new dictionary comprising chemical named entities. Combined with the automatic processing of respective terminology - the dictionary curation - the recognition performance reached an F 1 measure of 0. 54. That is an improvement by 29 % in comparison to the raw dictionary. The highest recall was achieved for the class of TRIVIAL-names with 0. 79. The recognition and identification of chemical named entities provides a prerequisite for the extraction of related pharmacological relevant information from literature data. Therefore, lexico-syntactic patterns were defined that support the automated extraction of hypernymic phrases comprising pharmacological function terminology related to chemical compounds. It was shown that 29 - 50 % of the automatically extracted terms can be proposed for novel functional annotation of chemical entities provided by the reference database DrugBank. Furthermore, they are a basis for building up concept hierarchies and ontologies or for extending existing ones. Successively, the pharmacological function and biological activity concepts obtained from text were included into a novel descriptor for chemical compounds. Its successful application for the prediction of pharmacological function of molecules and the extension of chemical classification schemes, such as the the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC), is demonstrated. In contrast to chemical entities, no comprehensive terminology resource has been available for histone modifications. Thus, histone modification concept terminology was primary recognized in text via CRFs with a F 1 measure of 0. 86. Subsequent, linguistic variants of extracted histone modification terms were mapped to standard representations that were organized into a newly assembled histone modification hierarchy. The mapping was accomplished by a novel developed term mapping approach described in the thesis. The combination of term recognition and term variant resolution builds up a new procedure for the assembly of novel <b>terminology</b> <b>collections.</b> It supports the generation of a term list that is applicable in dictionary-based methods. For the recognition of histone modification in text it could be shown that the named entity recognition method based on dictionaries is superior to the used machine learning approach. In conclusion, the present thesis provides techniques which enable an enhanced utilization of textual data, hence, supporting research in epigenomics and drug discovery...|$|R

All data presented are collected from various sources, such as Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian Standard Dictionary), and added with data obtained from Oxford Advanced Leaner’s Dictionary, Indonesian proverb book, encyclopedia, <b>terminology</b> <b>collection</b> book, poetry anthology, song lyrics, and data of the author’s own creation as an Indonesian native speaker. Set aside from their literal meanings, the metaphorically used color words are collected and classified into two categories, i. e. achromatic and chromatic colors. Then, their universalities are determined by comparing them with English color metaphors. Finally the existence of specific Indonesian color metaphors are identified by correlating them with extra linguistic factors, such as environment, history, religion, politic and other socio cultural activities. A careful analysis on the data shows that there is nearly no significant difference in metaphorical uses of achromatic colors in English and Indonesian. However, despite universal nuances of chromatic color metaphors, some specific ones emerge due to various external factors, such as environment, education, history, politic, law, religion, literature, and other socio cultural facts that are specifically found and practiced in Indonesia...|$|E

40|$|This {{collaborative}} research project, {{supported by the}} British Library, used {{a case study of}} the library collection for social enterprise to develop a conceptual approach to the library collection in the digital world, exploring stakeholder perceptions of <b>collections,</b> <b>terminology</b> and <b>collection</b> development and management processes. A mixed-methods multiphase case study design was used to address the research questions. Three strands of data collection are described: a case study of the British Library’s collections and content for social enterprise, searches for relevant material on 88 publicly accessible UK library catalogues, and an exploratory sequential study involving stakeholder interviews (19 interviews with 18 people) followed by two surveys of a larger stakeholder population (149 completed responses in total). Findings from each strand are described and three core concepts of collection are identified: “collection-as-thing”, “collection-as-process” and “collection-as-access”. Conventional views of library collections may tend to focus more on the idea of “collection -as-thing”; this research emphasises the importance of taking a more dynamic view of collection. Three models of collection are described: a revised collection development hierarchy which suggests links to different levels of strategic management; a model of interrelationships between the three concepts of collection; and a model which examines how collection adds value to content by providing context. This research demonstrates that the concept of collection remains highly relevant in the digital world, although the onus is on libraries to embrace all dimensions of these three concepts of collection if they wish to add maximum value to the content they identify, select, hold, make accessible and to which they connect...|$|R
40|$|A {{method that}} could be used to populate, or more {{accurately}} to seed, <b>terminology</b> <b>collections,</b> and subsequently to seed models of specific domains, latterly called ontologies, is proposed, demonstrated and evaluated based on analysis of text collections, and with reference to recent work in international standards for terminology. The activity of populating ontologies is referred to elsewhere as ontology learning. Ontologies are considered by some as vital to the development of the Semantic Web and its Grid counterpart, and to the development of the emerging, yet elusive, "Knowledge Grids". Results of this work could be used to support activities of terminologists, document managers, developers of intelligent systems, and other language researchers. The research investigates the population of knowledge bases with systems of concepts extracted from texts in arbitrary domains. Such population is normally undertaken manually by domain experts. The method relies on identifying evidence of key domain concepts, expressed through terms used in place of these concepts, in the definition of these concepts and to express relationships between concepts. The work presented may contribute to the Semantic Web and related initiatives by helping to overcome the well-documented and unsolved AI problem of producing an initial model of an arbitrary specialist domain from background resources without significant hand-crafting effort and involvement of a domain expert: the so-called "Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck". This bottleneck is usually overcome through extensive interactions with domain experts, involving a number of expert interviews. The research explores issues of terminology extraction from domain texts, the need for and use of knowledge representation, and the means by which terminology extraction and knowledge representation can be combined with international standards for terminology to produce such an initial model of an arbitrary specialist domain. The result of applying the presented method, the initial domain model, can be validated by domain experts, reducing the need for expert involvement in the creation of this model...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assist terminologists in the {{compilation}} of <b>terminology</b> <b>collections</b> in specialist domains, a "text probing" {{approach to the}} acquisition of English terms from special language texts is specified, designed, implemented, and evaluated. This approach draws on aspects of general language corpus linguistics and computational lexicography, and follows current trends towards corpus-based terminology compilation work. Our text-probing approach is founded specifically on observations about the linguistic features of English terms and their collocational behaviour in special language texts, and represents an effort to extend the scope of existing collocation studies from general language to special language. It aims to be both domain- and text-type independent. By operating {{on the premise that}} a term is likely to reside in a special language text between boundary markers comprising closed class words/punctuation, it permits the acquisition of single- and multi-word terms spanning a range of word classes. Our approach has been implemented in a prototype computer program ("Termspotter") which has been written in Quintus Prolog. This program processes untagged special language texts, either individually or in batches. It functions by "probing" texts for closed class words and punctuation, extracting as term candidates those items which reside between them. A systematic evaluation of the text-probing approach is presented in which, using an innovative experimental design, the term acquisition efficiency of Termspotter is measured against the manual scanning output of domain experts, as well as compared with the scanning output of terminologists. Results in the special language texts studied so far indicate that, on average, Termspotter can accurately retrieve 80 % of the terms identified by a domain expert, and can typically partially retrieve the remaining 20 %. The program performed very favourably in comparison with human terminologists. Extensions of our text- probing approach to other languages are anticipated. Moreover, wider applications of the notion of text probing are envisaged, both within and beyond the terminology community, for abstracting other structures from special language texts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we report}} on the fusion of simple {{retrieval}} strategies with thesaural resources in order to perform large-scale text categorization tasks. Unlike most related systems, which rely on training data in order to infer text-to-concept relationships, our approach can be applied with any controlled vocabulary and does not use any training data. The first classification module uses a traditional vector-space re-trieval engine, which has been fine-tuned for the task, while the second classifier is based on regular variations of the concept list. For evaluation purposes, the system uses a sample of MedLine and the Medical Sub-ject Headings (MeSH) <b>terminology</b> as <b>collection</b> of concepts. Preliminary results show that performances of the hybrid system are significantly im-proved as compared to each single system. For top returned concepts, the system reaches performances comparable to machine learning systems, while genericity and scalability issues are clearly in favor of the learning-free approach. We draw conclusion on the importance of hybrids strate-gies combining data-poor classifiers and knowledge-based terminological resources for general text mapping tasks. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Linked Science is the {{practice}} of inter-connecting scientific assets by publishing, sharing and linking scientific data and processes in end-to-end loosely coupled workflows that allow the sharing and re-use of scientific data. Much of this data does not live in the cloud or on the Web, but rather in multiinstitutional data centers that provide tools and add value through quality assurance, validation, curation, dissemination, {{and analysis of the}} data. In this paper, we make the case for the use of scientific scenarios in Linked Science.

However, searching for desired data elements among the thousands of available elements and harmonizing differences in <b>terminology,</b> data <b>collection,</b> and structure, is arduous and time consuming. Materials and methods To speed up biobank data pooling we developed BiobankConnect, a system to semiautomatically match desired data elements to available elements by: (1) annotating the desired elements with ontology terms using BioPortal; (2) automatically expanding the query for these elements with synonyms and subclass information using OntoCAT; (3) automatically searching available elements for these expanded terms using Lucene lexical matching; and (4) shortlisting relevant matches sorted by matching score. Results We evaluated BiobankConnect using human curated matches from EU-BioSHaRE, searching for 32 desired data elements in 7461 available elements from six biobanks. We found 0. 75 precision at rank 1 and 0. 74 recall at rank 10 compared to a manually curated set of relevant matches. In addition, best matches chosen by BioSHaRE experts ranked first in 63. 0 % and in the top 10 in 98. 4 % of cases, indicating that our system {{has the potential to}} significantly reduce manual matching work.

Methodology The goal of the project was to assess EHR as a tool to improve providers' performance, quality and continuity of care, and the availability of data in PHC practice in Cameroon. A locally designed EHR system called MEDCAB was developed. The system was based on the International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC) and was designed taking into consideration the PHC practice environment in Cameroon. An original cohort of 14 users was involved in the experiment. Results Users generally showed good acceptance of the system. Monitoring the use of the system at the early stages of implementation was important to ensure immediate response to users' comments and requests. Some of {{the key issues}} identified during {{the development and implementation of}} the system were: user involvement, the choice of an appropriate <b>terminology,</b> pre-existing data <b>collection</b> culture and leadership issues.

40|$|Diseases {{that cause}} the {{premature}} decline and death of grapevines are {{a threat to the}} economic viability of vineyards everywhere. Although research has brought about major progress in the understanding of grapevine viral diseases, the same progress has not occurred with fungal diseases which can be equally devastating to the expected life span of vineyards. The role of pathogenic fungi in grapevine declines may be overlooked because of misattribution to other causes. For example, decline in grafted vines where the rootstocks are infected with species of Phaeoacremonium and/or Cylindrocarpon may be attributed to cultural practices or site conditions. Therefore, growers unknowingly plant (and replant) new vineyards with diseased material from nurseries who are unwittingly selling infected plants. Clearly, there can be no solution for a problem that remains unrecognized. Today, there is an urgent need for research into the significance of the spread of disease by Phaeoacremonium spp. -infected mother vineyards, particularly in American Vitis rootstock varieties. The economic hardship posed by these fungi extends beyond the grower to the nursery industry as well. Even those nursery suppliers who are aware of the potential presence of Phaeoacremonium spp. in their plant material do not know exactly what steps to take to eliminate it. Founded in 1998, the International Council on Grapevine Trunk Diseases (ICGTD) can work to improve communication among those studying the same diseases by developing common <b>terminology</b> and data <b>collection</b> protocols, as well as coordinating research projects to avoid redundancies. This multi-disciplinary approach will hasten progress in understanding the significance of pathogenic fungi in propagation material, as well as finding methods of controlling disease expression in infected vineyards.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to affect food and feed safety, including the occurrence of natural toxins in primary crop and seafood production; however, to date, quantitative estimates are scarce. This study aimed to estimate the impact of climate change effects on mycotoxin contamination of cereal grains cultivated in the terrestrial area of north west Europe, and on the frequency of harmful algal blooms and contamination of shellfish with marine biotoxins in the North Sea coastal zone. The study focused on contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol, and on abundance of Dinophysis spp. and the possible relationship with diarrhetic shellfish toxins. The study used currently available data and models. Global and regional climate models were combined with models of crop phenology, mycotoxin prediction models, hydrodynamic models and ecological models, with the output of one model being used as input for the other. In addition, statistical data analyses using existing national datasets from the study area were performed to obtain information on the relationships between Dinophysis spp. cell counts and contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish toxins {{as well as on}} frequency of cereal cropping. In this paper, a summary of the study is presented, and overall conclusions and recommendations are given. Climate change projections for the years 2031 – 2050 were used as the starting point of the analyses relative to a preceding 20 -year baseline period from which the climate change signal was calculated. Results showed that, in general, climate change effects lead to advanced flowering and harvest of wheat, and increased risk of contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol. Blooms of dinoflagellates were estimated to occur more often. If the group of Dinophysis spp. behaves similarly to other flagellates in the future then frequency of harmful algal blooms of Dinophysis spp. may also increase, but consequences for contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish toxins are uncertain. Climate change will also have indirect effects on toxin contamination, which may be equally important. For example, the frequency of cropping of wheat and maize in north Europe was projected to increase under climate change, which will also increase the risk of contamination of the grains with deoxynivalenol. Risk managers are encouraged to consider the entire range of the predictions of climate change effects on food safety hazards, rather than median or average values only. Furthermore, it is recommended to closely monitor levels of mycotoxins and marine biotoxins in the future, in particular related to risky situations associated with favourable climatic conditions for toxin producing organisms. In particular, it is important {{to pay attention to the}} continuity of collecting the right data, and the availability and accessibility of databases. On a European level, it is important to stress the need for harmonisation of <b>terminology</b> and data <b>collection...</b>|$|R

Para tanto, investigamos a linguagem das trÃs maiores empresas que desempenham essas atividades, respectivamente a MineraÃÃo Rio do Norte S. A. (MRN), a HYDRO ALUNORTE e a AlumÃnio Brasileiro S. A. (ALBRAS). A pesquisa foi fundamentada teÃrica e metodologicamente em duas correntes teÃricas terminolÃgicas - a Socioterminologia e Teoria Comunicativa da Terminologia. A coleta dos dados foi feita a partir de um corpus constituÃdo de 173 textos especializados e 18 DVDs institucionais distribuÃdos de acordo com as trÃs atividades desenvolvidas pelas empresas. Com este trabalho de coleta, extraÃmos os termos tÃcnicos, as definiÃÃes e contextos de ocorrÃncia dos termos. Esses dados foram digitalizados em um programa computacional chamado Lexique Pro, que automaticamente organizou a macro e as microestruturas do dicionÃrio. ApÃs uma versÃo provisÃria do dicionÃrio, checamos as informaÃÃes contidas no dicionÃrio junto a alguns especialistas das atividades envolvidas para verificar se tais informaÃÃes estavam corretas. A versÃo definitiva do dicionÃrio possui 1. 110 termos que representam um amplo universo da linguagem tÃcnica atual do ciclo de produÃÃo do alumÃnio, das quais 362 se relacionam Ã mineraÃÃo da bauxita, 228 se relacionam ao refino da alumina e 693 se relacionam Ã metalurgia do alumÃnio. Quanto Ãs categorias gramaticais, o dicionÃrio apresenta 564 substantivos masculinos, 516 substantivos femininos, 22 verbos e 8 adjetivos. Ao todo, 97 % dos termos sÃo substantivos. O dicionÃrio apresenta ainda, observando o modelo variacionista de Faulstich (2010) adotado para esta pesquisa, 214 variantes formais (variantes concorrentes), 164 sinÃnimos (variantes coocorrentes) e 50 emprÃstimos (variantes competitivas). O DicionÃrio que apresentamos tem como meta sistematizar a linguagem tÃcnica dessas trÃs principais atividades o ciclo de produÃÃo de alumÃnio. Nessa perspectiva, o {{principal}} intuito deste trabalho foi produzir um dicionÃrio tÃcnico que favoreÃa a comunicaÃÃo entre os interessados por essa atividade, entre o publico objeto da pesquisa, pesquisadores, docentes e estudantes. This study {{aimed to}} describe and present, in dictionary form, with a printed and an other electronics version, the technical language of the primary aluminum production cycle in ParÃ State, distributed in three activities: bauxite mining, alumina refining and metallurgy of aluminum. Therefore, we investigated {{the language of the}} three largest companies that develop these activities, respectively the MineraÃÃo Rio do Norte S. A. (MRN), HYDRO ALUNORTE and the AlumÃnio Brasileiro S. A. (ALBRAS). The research was based theoretically and methodologically in two terminological theoretical currents - the Socioterminology and Communicative Theory of <b>Terminology.</b> The data <b>collection</b> was taken from a corpus of 173 specialized texts and 18 institutional DVDs distributed according to these three activities developed by the companies. With this collection work, we extract technical terms, definitions and contexts of occurrence. These data were introduced into a computer program called Lexique Pro, which automatically organized the macro and microstructure of the dictionary. After a provisional version of the dictionary, we check the information contained in the dictionary with some experts of the activities involved to verify if the informations were correct. The final version of the dictionary has 1, 110 terms that represent a broad universe of current technical language of the aluminum production cycle, of which 362 are related to the mining of bauxite, 228 relate to the refining of alumina and 693 relate to the metallurgy of aluminum. As for the grammatical categories, the dictionary has 564 masculine nouns, 516 feminine nouns, 22 verbs and 8 adjectives. Altogether, 97 % of the words are nouns. The dictionary presents, according to the variationist model developed by Faulstich (2010), 214 formal variants (concurrent variants), 164 synonyms (coocorrentes variants) and 50 loanwords (competitive variants). The Dictionary that we present aims to systematize the technical language of these three main activities of the aluminum production cycle. In this perspective, the main purpose of this work was to produce a technical dictionary that favour communication between interested by this activity, between the public object of the research, researchers, teachers and students...|$|R
