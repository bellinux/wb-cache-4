5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E
500|$|I've {{heard it}} said about The Velvet Underground that while {{not a lot}} of people bought their albums, {{everyone}} who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Pixies song.|$|E

500|$|In A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is {{introduced}} {{as the third}} and youngest child of wealthy and powerful Tywin Lannister, the former Hand of the King, and Joanna Lannister, who dies giving birth to him. Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime {{is one of the}} Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard. Described as an ugly ("for all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gargoyle"), malformed dwarf with different colored eyes, green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them. While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his family, he is treated as a [...] "second class noble" [...] because of his stature. Tyrion's mother Joanna died giving birth to him and Tywin and Cersei loathe him because they blame him for her death. While Tywin bears no affection for Tyrion, he nevertheless feels a sense of duty to his son, raising him in the Lannister fold and extending Tyrion a share of the family wealth. In contrast to Tywin and Cersei, Jaime has great affection for Tyrion and treats him with kindness, respect, friendship and love. Lev Grossman of Time wrote in 2011: ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before leaving}} Brazil, Purim and Airto Moreira married. Around 1971, their {{daughter}} Diana Booker was born. In 1998, Diana married Krishna Booker, son of jazz bassist Walter Booker, nephew of saxophonist Wayne Shorter and godson of pianist Herbie Hancock. Diana later described {{life with her}} parents as [...] " [...] up on the road traveling <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gypsy".|$|E
2500|$|For reasons unknown, H. Bonciu {{refused to}} openly {{affiliate}} {{with any of}} the many interwar literary factions which thrived in Greater Romania. In his 1937 companion to 20th century literature, Eugen Lovinescu described him as a paradoxical, outdated and eccentric author: [...] "the eagerness for novelty, for situations and expressions dominates but since the novelty dates back to the age of Expressionism, it is currently more outdated than the most up-to-date literature." [...] Writing in 2005, Simona Vasilache presented Bonciu as [...] "a lonely dreamer, terrified by <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby is of bad dreams". Researcher Paul Cernat also presented Bonciu as isolated from the Romanian avant-garde, and as such [...] "perhaps a franc-tireur".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not of me; {{but you may}} ask it of himself, and {{depend upon}} it, he will say yes; for rather than any good action should walk through <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{unappropriated}} adjective in an ill-arranged sentence, he is always willing to stand noun substantive to it himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|John Burroughs, {{writing of}} Thoreau, says: [...] "He {{improves}} with age--in fact requires age {{to take off}} a little of his asperity, and fully ripen him. <b>The</b> <b>world</b> <b>likes</b> <b>a</b> good hater and refuser almost {{as well as it}} <b>likes</b> <b>a</b> good lover and accepter--only it likes him farther off." ...|$|R
60|$|Out on the {{extremity}} of the buck-stage (how she {{got there}} neither they nor she ever knew) crouched Honoria, her face idiotic with terror, while she stared with bursting eyes into the foam. A shriek of disappointment rose from her lips, as in a moment the colonel's weather-worn head reappeared above, looking for all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old gray shiny-painted seal.|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of extreme {{states of consciousness}} (perinatal experience and transpersonal experience) is outside the sphere of normal science. Experience goes beyond the empirically evidenced frames of consciousness and become transcendental towards rational manifestations.

6000|$|... {{never mind}} what. The band played {{the spring and}} I danced it round, while my cousin eyed me with extorted approval.

6000|$|... "But, notwithstanding, {{we hired}} {{a room that}} {{afternoon}} in the Calle de los Angeles, the main street that runs along the shore, and put our trunks there.

60|$|What {{impressed}} Saxon {{most was}} their excessive jollity, their childlike joy, and the childlike things they did. This effect was {{heightened by the}} fact that they were novelists and painters, poets and critics, sculptors and musicians. One man, with a refined and delicate face--a dramatic critic on a great San Francisco daily, she was told--introduced a feat which all the men tried and failed at most ludicrously. On the beach, at regular intervals, planks were placed as obstacles. Then the dramatic critic, on all fours, galloped along the sand for all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse, and for all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse taking hurdles he jumped the planks to the end of the course.|$|E

50|$|With {{the opening}} of the Moss shop in 1994, in SoHo, New York City, Moss was able to infuse basic {{principles}} of his previous careers into all aspects of the store—to dramatic effect.
