50|$|In 2003 {{the school}} had 1,647 {{students}} in grades 7-12 and employed 160 teachers. The school's yard was among the largest yards of any school in Israel and includes a commercial egg laying chicken coop, a dairy farm, a nursery, and a horse stable. The school also owns large citrus and Avocado orchards that allow students to conduct studies in fruit production. All {{the work in the}} different agricultural fields is conducted by the students, under the guidance of professional guides, and it is a part of every students course of studies at the school. All students must take one matriculation exam in an agricultural field of study. Until the end of the 20th century all student had the opportunity of getting a <b>tractor</b> driver's <b>licence</b> as part of their studies, a program that was stopped due to budget cuts.|$|R
40|$|Brain {{development}} and crash risk of young novice drivers; A literature study. Young novice motor vehicle drivers {{have a higher}} risk of crashes than older, more experienced drivers. Broadly speaking two possible causes may be given: 1) lack of experience, and 2) 'sowing oneâ€™s wild oats' related to the age and stage of development of the brain. The question in this report {{is the extent to which}} this second cause plays a role and what brain research teaches us. Then we will address the question of what this could mean for: * the age limits for the first active participation in motorized traffic; * the way in which driving lessons are given; and * the conditions under which young people may participate in traffic with a motor vehicle. This exploratory literature study has not been written to provide definitive answers to these questions, but is intended to inform those who engage in road safety and road safety policy, but are no neuroscientists, of relevant outcomes of brain research. The need of such a review occurred when experts who were involved in the introduction of the so-called <b>tractor</b> driver's <b>licence,</b> wondered whether 16 -year-olds, taking into account their immature brain, could safely participate in traffic on large agricultural vehicles. This review is not only about driving agricultural vehicles, but on traffic participation by young people on all types of motorized vehicles...|$|R
