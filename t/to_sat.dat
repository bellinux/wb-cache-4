5|$|Blake Harrison {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} that would become Flocabulary while in high school. Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest, Harrison wanted to combine the easy retainability of hip hop lyrics with educational content. Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English. He then moved to San Francisco, where he met Alex Rappaport, a music graduate of Tufts University. Harrison shared his idea with Rappaport, and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words. Within two months Sparknotes made the songs available for free streaming, and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website. Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the book at Barnes & Noble and Borders stores. The Hip Hop Approach <b>to</b> <b>SAT</b> Vocabulary sold 10,000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times. In 2005, Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools.|$|E

2500|$|The SAT {{has been}} renamed several times since its {{introduction}} in 1926. It was originally {{known as the}} Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 1990, a commission {{set up by the}} College Board to review the proposed changes to the SAT program recommended that the meaning of the initialism SAT be changed to [...] "Scholastic Assessment Test" [...] because a [...] "test that integrates measures of achievement as well as developed ability can no longer be accurately described as a test of aptitude". In 1993, the College Board changed the name of the test <b>to</b> <b>SAT</b> I: Reasoning Test; at the same time, the name of the Achievement Tests was changed <b>to</b> <b>SAT</b> II: Subject Tests. The Reasoning Test and Subject Tests were to be collectively known as the Scholastic Assessment Tests. According {{to the president of the}} College Board at the time, the name change was meant [...] "to correct the impression among some people that the SAT measures something that is innate and impervious to change regardless of effort or instruction." [...] The new SAT debuted in March 1994, and was referred to as the Scholastic Assessment Test by major news organizations. However, in 1997, the College Board announced that the SAT could not properly be called the Scholastic Assessment Test, and that the letters SAT did not stand for anything. In 2004, the Roman numeral in SAT I: Reasoning Test was dropped, making SAT Reasoning Test the new name of the SAT.|$|E

60|$|At {{the time}} when the man-of-war's boat rowed {{alongside}} of the little jetty of Fairway, an interesting couple chanced to be seated in a bower at the back of a very small but particularly neat cottage near the shore. The bower was in keeping with its surroundings, being the half of an old boat set up on end. Roses and honeysuckle were trained up the sides of it, and these, mingling their fragrance with the smell of tar, diffused an agreeable odour around. The couple referred <b>to</b> <b>sat</b> very close to each other, and appeared to be engaged in conversation of a confidential nature. One was a fair and rather pretty girl of the fishing community. The other was a stout and uncommonly handsome man of five-and-twenty, apparently belonging to the same class, but there was more of the regular sailor than the fisherman in his costume and appearance. In regard to their conversation, it may be well, perhaps, to let them speak for themselves.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} for solving the SAT problem. This approach consists in representing <b>SAT</b> instances thanks <b>to</b> an undirected graph issued from a polynomial transformation from <b>SAT</b> <b>to</b> the CLIQUE problem. Considering this graph, we exploit well known properties of chordal graphs <b>to</b> manipulate the <b>SAT</b> instance. Firstly, these properties allow us to define {{a new class of}} SAT polynomial instances. Moreover, they allow us <b>to</b> rewrite <b>SAT</b> instances in disjunctions of smaller instances which could be significantly easier to solve...|$|R
