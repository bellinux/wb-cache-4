5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of {{the energy of the}} compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E

5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

The Hero then meets Captain Blade, leader of Somnia's military which gives the potential soldier candidates a task to find a special item in a tower.

After a task which the Hero and Carver work together to get a horse for an old man, Carver also becomes a soldier of Somnia and himself and the hero are given permission {{to talk to the}} king where they learn to defeat Murdaw, they need the Mirror of Ra. The Hero and Carver discover another portal similar to the one near Haggleton, which eventually leads them to Port Haven, another town where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be seen.

5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be increased.|$|E
