40|$|Abstract- A design {{method for}} {{microstrip}} <b>to</b> <b>balanced</b> stripline transition is presented. The transition {{is suitable for}} application in feeding arrays of double-side printed antennas. The transition is a Chebyshev taper impedance transformer and the conversion from unbalanced <b>to</b> <b>balanced</b> line relied on a gradual change of the cross-section of the line. The transmission parameters of an asymmetric line are derived with a method based on the quasi-TEM wave approximation. Also, in this paper are presented calculated results for 50 microstrip <b>to</b> 100 <b>balanced</b> stripline and 100 microstrip <b>to</b> 50 <b>balanced</b> stripline transitions...|$|R
