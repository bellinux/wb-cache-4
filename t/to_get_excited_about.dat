500|$|In an {{interview}} with NME in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album Everyday Robots, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know. It {{would be fair to}} say, we have discussed it at least once." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Canning of IGN {{did not think}} there was anything [...] "terrible" [...] about the episode, {{but he did not}} think there was anything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about,</b> either. Canning thought {{there were a number of}} throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, there are a number of episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!" [...] Aughey would have liked to see Homer's storyline explored as an A story in its own episode rather than cut short as a C story.|$|E

500|$|Graphically, Wave Race 64 {{was praised}} for its fluid animations, {{realistic}} physics, clean waters, and textured polygons. IGN's Doug Perry commented, [...] "The {{way in which}} jetskis cut into the ocean's surface, lift off ramps, bounce into and off oncoming waves, or slide on icy surfaces is not only believable and engaging, but simply unparalleled." [...] Writing for The Electric Playground, Victor Lucas highlighted the game's distinct environments, saying that each course offers players something <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about.</b> He also gave high marks to the game's satisfying sound effects, particularly when players submerge under the waves, but described the music as [...] "undeniably shallow". GamePro agreed, describing the music as juvenile and the announcer's voice as irritating. In contrast, AllGame's Jonti Davies felt that the game's [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "distinctly '80s theme" [...] soundtrack combined with the announcer's [...] "hyperexcited cries" [...] gives the game a light and arcade feel.|$|E
500|$|Carter, Duchovny and Anderson {{celebrated the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} series at a July 18, 2013 panel at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by TV Guide. During the discussion, Anderson {{discussed}} Scully's influence on female fans, relating {{that a number of}} women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an X-Files miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an unrelated project, but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, [...] "You need a reason <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> going on and doing it again." [...] The series attained a degree of historical importance, as well. On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Some of the items included the original pilot script and the [...] "I Want to Believe" [...] poster from Mulder's office.|$|E

[...] Patrick Holm of Total Sci-Fi felt that the second episode [...] "equates the word 'adult' with sex and swearing – more of a playground definition than a serious drama. In the conclusion of his review, Jonathan Capps of Noise to Signal felt that the episode was [...] "certainly nothing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about,</b> but I think it won't be too indicative of later episodes, as we're still getting to know these characters, and that has to take the fore in the first few episodes. However, Chris' [...] painfully simplistic, heavy-handed and often clichéd interpretation of sci-fi (some of Jack's techno-babble is frankly embarrassing) could prove to be a worrying factor later in the series." [...] A reviewer of TV Fodder felt [...] "Day One" [...] was a [...] "great second episode", adding [...] "there doesn't seem to be anything I don't like about this show".|$|E

500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Psycho Therapy", which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee; the song has since grown {{into one of the}} most popular Ramones' song. Dee Dee recalled: [...] "I knew we needed a real 'Ramones song' for the album, and I knew [...] was {{depressed}} about how things were going. He needed that song <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> the band again." [...] The next track is another cover song, [...] "Time Has Come Today", which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers. The Ramones' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence, and was said by Eddy to have more of a [...] "garage" [...] feel to it, as compared to the original. [...] "My-My Kind of a Girl" [...] was directed specifically toward the band's female fandom. The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her. In Vanity Fair, the song was regarded as [...] a [...] "lingering affection for Phil Spector's pop grandeur." [...] Dee Dee's [...] "Time Bomb", which was track number eleven, was said by True to be [...] "more ridiculous than frightening."

500|$|Kneale's concept {{concerned}} [...] "the {{world of}} the future, {{and a way of}} keeping the population happy without being active". According to Kneale, the notion for the play came from the [...] "worldwide dread of populations exploding out of all control" [...] leading him to devise a world where pornography hooks the population [...] "on a substitute for sex rather than the real thing and so keeping the population down". Kneale was also influenced by the dropout counterculture of the late 1960s, recalling [...] "I didn't like the Sixties at all because of the whole thing of 'let it all hang out' and let's stop thinking [...] which was the all too frequent theme of the Sixties which I hated". Dissatisfaction with the youth culture of the time was a preoccupation of Kneale's—in the mid-sixties he had worked on The Big, Big, Giggle, an unmade script about a teenage suicide cult, and following The Year of the Sex Olympics he returned to the theme of youth out of control in his 1969 play Bam! Pow! Zapp!, and in the fourth and final Quatermass serial in 1979. Many cultural icons of the youth movement, including members of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Monty Python, were fans of Kneale's work. For The Year of the Sex Olympics Kneale extrapolated the possible consequences of the youth movement's desire for freedom from [...] "traditional" [...] cultural inhibitions, asking as the academic John R. Cook puts it, [...] "In a world of no limits, will the result quickly be apathy if there is nothing any more <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about,</b> nothing precious or illicit to fight for in the teeth of the censor?".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} twelve, Marcus {{would have}} been ready for {{secondary}} education, under the grammatici. Two of his teachers at this age are known: Andro, a [...] "geometrician and musician"; and Diognetus, a painting-master. Marcus thought of Diognetus {{as more than a}} mere painter, however. He seems to have introduced Marcus to the philosophic way of life. Marcus writes that Diognetus taught him [...] "to avoid passing enthusiasms; to distrust the stories of miracle-workers and impostors about incantations and exorcism of spirits and such things; not to go cock-fighting or <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> such sports; to put up with outspokenness; and to become familiar with philosophy" [...] and [...] "to write philosophical dialogues in my boyhood". In April 132, at the behest of Diognetus, Marcus took up the dress and habits of the philosopher: he studied while wearing a rough Greek cloak, and would sleep on the ground until his mother convinced him to sleep on a bed.|$|E
