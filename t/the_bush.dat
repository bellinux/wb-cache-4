5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} when French beekeepers succeeded in banning neonicotinoids, the Clinton {{administration}} permitted pesticides that were previously banned, including imidacloprid.

5|$|His tenure {{was marked}} by {{controversy}} as he defended <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, especially on the topics of abstinence-only birth control education, climate change policy, and stem cell research. Marburger defended <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration from these accusations, saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, especially {{on the issue of}} science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of hydraulically balanced external gear pumps, in particular on the lubricating gap between <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> and <b>the</b> gears. This topic is of key importance for the optimization of the machine efficiency because it both influences the mechanical-viscous friction and the volumetric losses. In this paper the intent is to investigate {{the role of the}} elastic deformation of <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> surfaces, to compare the analysis done with rigid and elastic surfaces and finally to correlate the results with the design of <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> balancing surfaces. A numerical procedure for the determination of the pressure distribution inside the gap bounded by gears sides and <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> internal surfaces is presented and applied. With respect to past works of the authors, the procedure has been integrated taking into account the elastic deformation of the internal surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> and <b>the</b> variation of the dynamic viscosity of fluid, two well recognized phenomena that can play a key role on the determination of <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> behaviour and lubricating gap pressure distribution. It is shown that, when the design of <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> rear surfaces determines a strong balancing thrust, <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> themselves need to tilt strongly with respect to the gears to generate an opportune widening thrust to avoiding contact with the gears. Useful suggestions for <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> balancing surface design may be drawn from the analysis of the balancing maps reported in the paper, which illustrate the widening thrust magnitude and position in both the pure hydrodynamic and elasto-hydrodynamic cases, for different tilted positions and operating conditions...|$|R
5|$|In March 2003, Huntsman {{resigned}} {{his post}} in <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent Governor Mike Leavitt, whom Huntsman strongly supported, {{decided not to}} run for re-election in order to become the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration. Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah. In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected governor with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.|$|E

5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E

50|$|A linear bushing is {{not usually}} pressed into a housing, but rather secured with a radial feature. Two such {{examples}} include two retaining rings, or a ring that is molded onto the OD of <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> that matches with a groove in the housing.

The differences became too great, and Scheib was fired by <b>the</b> <b>Bushes</b> in February 2005.
