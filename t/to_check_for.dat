5|$|Robben did {{not make}} his {{competitive}} debut for Chelsea until November 2004, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a metatarsal bone in his right foot in a challenge from Olivier Dacourt. During this time, he told club doctors that he had noticed an unfamiliar growth {{on one of his}} testicles. The medical team quickly did tests <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> testicular cancer, but he was subsequently given the all clear.|$|E
50|$|The BPSS is the {{entry-level}} National Security Clearance, {{and both}} CTC and EBS are effectively enhancements to the BPSS, with CTC relating <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> susceptibility <b>to</b> extremist persuasion, and EBS relating <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> susceptibility <b>to</b> espionage persuasion, {{the latter being}} needed for supervised access to SECRET material. The SC again is focused on susceptibility to espionage persuasion, and is required for an individual to have long-term unsupervised access to SECRET material and occasional access to TOP SECRET (TS) material, whilst for regular access to TS the DV is required.|$|R

5|$|The {{pipeline}} is surveyed {{several times}} per day, mostly by air.

The pipeline can be surveyed {{in as little as}} two hours, but most surveys take longer to ensure thoroughness. These external inspections are only part of standard maintenance, however. The majority of pipeline maintenance is done by pipeline pigs—mechanical devices sent through the pipeline to perform a variety of functions.|$|E
5|$|After some {{discussion}} he was persuaded to disembark {{so that the}} Helmuth could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took the Helmuth further downriver <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, {{he returned to the}} two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery {{of a large number of}} empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.|$|E

5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took a {{step toward}} {{institutional}} independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> consistency of color.|$|E
5|$|Amanita nothofagi {{mushrooms}} can {{be confused}} with A.australis if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> the presence of clamp connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in A.australis and absent from A.nothofagi. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble A.excelsa, which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of clamp connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from A.nothofagi largely {{on the basis of}} colour—it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older. Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dana Scully finds black oil in de la Cruz's skull {{during an}} autopsy—the oil {{is dead and}} {{seems to have been}} irradiated. She concludes that he may have had some {{immunity}} to the black oil because he is a Huecha Indian, or an indigenous Mexican national. Doggett and Mulder find proof of black oil on the platform and quarantine it, but de la Cruz's friend Diego Garza is missing. Ortega threatens to bring back the crew unless the agents can provide proof of an infection. Doggett and Mulder search for Garza who, like de la Cruz, also has Native American heritage. Mulder and Doggett later discover that somebody has set fire to the communications room. As the agents tackle the fire, Garza attacks Doggett and renders him unconscious. When he awakens, Garza, now mentally unstable, cuts his arm <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> the presence of black oil.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. <b>To</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E
