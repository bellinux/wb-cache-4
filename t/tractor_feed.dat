50|$|Due to the {{extremely}} precise alignment required for dot alignment between NLQ passes, typically the paper {{needed to be}} held somewhat taut in the <b>tractor</b> <b>feed</b> sprockets, and the continuous paper stack must be perfectly aligned behind or below the printer. Loosely held paper or skewed supply paper could cause misalignments between passes, rendering the NLQ text illegible.|$|E
50|$|Fan-fold, partly pre-printed ticket {{stock is}} {{produced}} on perforated thin card, {{for use in}} the dot matrix printers. It has <b>tractor</b> <b>feed</b> holes on detachable perforated strips on both sides. In British Rail days, the form reference of the stock was BR 4403/44; since privatisation, a slightly different layout has been used with code RSP 4404/46. The code is printed near the bottom left corner of the front of the ticket.|$|E
5000|$|... {{dot matrix}} impact {{technology}} remains {{in use in}} devices such as cash registers, ATMs, fire alarm systems, and many point-of-sales terminals. Thermal printing is gradually supplanting them {{in some of these}} applications, but full-size dot-matrix impact printers are still used to print multi-part stationery. For example, dot matrix impact printers are still used at bank tellers and auto repair shops, and other applications where use of <b>tractor</b> <b>feed</b> paper is desirable such as data logging and aviation. Some of these printers are even fitted with USB interfaces as standard to aid connection to modern computers without legacy ports.|$|E
50|$|Fairbanks Morse and Company was an American {{manufacturing}} {{company in the}} late 19th and early 20th century. Originally a weighing scale manufacturer, it later diversified into pumps, engines, windmills, coffee grinders, farm <b>tractors,</b> <b>feed</b> mills, locomotives and industrial supplies until it was merged in 1958. It used the trade name Fairbanks-Morse.|$|R

50|$|The Teletype Model 42 and Teletype Model 43 are {{electronic}} teleprinters providing character-at-a-time keyboard-printer send receive operation. The Teletype Model 42 is the Baudot {{variant of}} the Model 43, which is an ASCII teleprinter. The Model 43 has two transmission speeds, 100 words-per-minute and 300 words-per-minute, selectable by the operator to match the distant station speed. The Teletype Model 43 printer could print up to 80 characters per line using the friction feed printer option. Model 43 sprocket feed printers print messages with up to 132 characters per line using 12 inch wide sprocket feed paper. The <b>tractor</b> <b>feed</b> printer will print messages with up to 80 characters per line using 12 inch sprocket feed paper.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture employs 100 people. The Castlecomer {{district}} has 60 farms. These range between 10 and 100 hectares {{with a total}} of 2003 hectares being farmed. There are 4451 cattle and 768 sheep, and farming is done with grassland machines, tillage machines, <b>tractors,</b> winter <b>feeding</b> and milking equipment. Specialist farms include beef production, dairy and mixed grazing livestock.|$|R
5000|$|Farm Crew {{maintains}} the 300 acre of farm and pasture needed for cattle, pig, and chicken livestock.

40|$|For centuries {{there has}} been a process of human {{observation}} of animals and crops by producers that results in a plan (schedule) to take action by the use of equipment. There has always been an incentive to reduce required labour with most recent the use of milking robots and autonomous <b>tractors</b> and roughage <b>feeding</b> machines. Human observation was not possible for some important characteristics like soil chemical properties and the composition, eventual contamination of milk. Taking samples and sending them to a laboratory became practise and resulted in milk and soil property values determined following well described protocols. Appropriate measures could be taken by relatively simple decision rules...|$|R
40|$|Original held by ScreenSound Australia: Title No. 90133. Newsreel from 1944 about Land Army girls {{working on}} {{farms in the}} Griffith area of New South Wales. The item opens with shots of the Land Army women lined up in uniform and marching on parade; they are {{inspected}} by a female officer. The girls gather {{to listen to their}} instructions, and then travel to their jobs on a variety of transport: by bicycle, {{on the back of a}} truck, or by horse. A group of girls arrives at an orchard on the back of a horse-drawn cart, and there are close-up shots of them picking peaches, emptying the fruit from bags into boxes, and loading the boxes onto the back of a truck. Shots of a girl driving a team of four horses and another driving a tractor follow. Several girls load cabbages onto the back of a <b>tractor,</b> and <b>feed</b> them into the automatic planter as they are hauled on a sled (or 'rumble seat') behind the tractor. Others work in mud-filled furrows, hoeing crops and picking tomatoes and packing them into boxes. The item ends with shots of a woman on horseback, herding sheep and whistling to a sheepdog.

40|$|This {{study is}} about the factors {{influencing}} the purchases of fertiliser and prescription farming in general and Pivot fertilisers and the Pivot Prescription Farming in particular. The purchase of Pivot fertilisers {{in this study is}} defined to be a decision about Pivot as the main fertiliser company. Meanwhile, the purchase of Pivot Prescription Farming is defined as whether or not farmers purchase the Pivot Prescription Farming for the on going activities of their farms. Prescription farming, in this study, refers to services associated with farm inputs such as soil testing and plant analysis. Farmers' decision-making process on the farm inputs, including the choice within a product class, might be dominantly influenced by the problem-solving process. However, the human factors in the farmers' decision is also important. Thus, the farmer's decision-making process is likely to be based on a combination of cognitive and emotional models. In the context of farm income, farmers normally face three stages on the problem of their income allocation. First, allocation to production, consumption and savings. Second, allocation to the categories of generic products in farm activities such as <b>tractors,</b> compound <b>feed</b> and fertilisers. Third, allocation within a product class such as a particular product type or brand. Since the purchase of fertiliser and prescription farming might be categorised as an out-stock situation, the buying process for these inputs only involves stage three. Past research has indicated that the purchase of fertilisers from a particular firm might be affected by quality, price, service, availability of fertiliser, distribution coverage and a specific relationship with the firm. Past studies on the use of soil testing and plant analysis, which are some elements of prescription farming, have shown that price, turnaround time, reliability of results, service and follow up of the service have influenced the use of these services. Additionally, knowledge about available providers, which reflects the amount of information possessed, may influence the purchase. The quantitative analyses in this study use existing data from Pivot Ltd. The method used in this study is logistic regression. The decision on the purchase of Pivot Prescription Farming is involved in the model for the decision on Pivot as the main fertiliser company, and vice versa. For this particular sample, the results revealed that no variable was found to be significant in explaining the decision about Pivot as the main fertiliser company. Only the purchase of Pivot Prescription Fanning and some dummy variables for types of farm and states were significant. The result may indicate that subjective norm appears in the outcome. For the decision about the purchase of the Pivot Prescription Farming, knowledge about service provider, follow up, turnaround time and the decision on Pivot as the main fertiliser company significantly affected the purchase. Those results indicated that farmers who chose Pivot as their main fertiliser company were more likely to purchase the Pivot Prescription Farming, and vice versa. The results also revealed {{that there is a need}} to do further research to incorporate with the important issues such as brand loyalty, consumer attitude formation, and the multipersonal influence in farm enterprise, in a better survey with more exhaustive data collection methods.
