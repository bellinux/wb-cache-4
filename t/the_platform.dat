5|$|A trio {{of small}} Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common {{platform}} {{at the east}} end of the terrace, facing west. It is likely that <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> was purposely built to support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an early version of the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> being built to cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> to accommodate altar call gatherings, and <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. <b>The</b> <b>platform,</b> with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E

5|$|Platform A6 {{encloses}} {{the western}} extreme of the Group A plaza. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> has two levels, the upper {{of which has}} a vertical cornice. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> faces east onto the plaza; access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades terminating in vertical cornices. Platform A6 was built over an older {{version of the same}} building; this earlier construction phase was smaller and its stairways were destroyed in order to build the stairways of the final version. During restoration work carried out by archaeologists the back wall and a section of the facade were left exposed. Four funerary urns were found associated with <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> mostly interred under the front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Platform B4 {{encloses}} {{the north}} side of the Group B plaza. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> consists of a single level set upon a base and possesses corniced walls. Access was via an inset stairway in the centre of the south side. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> top was floored with slabs and possessed a low double terrace at the rear.|$|E
5|$|Platform E6 is {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the Group E plaza. It is roughly built from irregularly sized, poorly cut stones. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> faces east towards Pyramid E1 and has four access stairways. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> once supported perishable residences; these were built from maize stalks bound together with clay, as evidenced by the imprint of the maize stalks in the fragments of clay wall recovered during excavations. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> itself was once covered with stucco.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of two insular <b>platforms</b> while <b>the</b> western one is broader and more heavily used. There are 4 tracks available. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> are connected to each other with the pedestrian bridge. In the middle of <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> semi-transparent roofs are installed. The south end of <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> is curved. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> are surrounded by the depot tracks so the only way in and out is via the bridge.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> are <b>the</b> IND's usual {{length of}} 660 feet, and {{the width of}} <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> is 16 feet.|$|R

5|$|The hotel {{had its own}} railway platform, Track 61, {{that was}} part of the New York City Subway and was {{connected}} to the Grand Central Terminal complex. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> However, it is rarely opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>platform</b> bay at Paddock Wood {{from which}} most of the line's trains {{departed}} is now part of a car park, with the edge of <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> fenced off. Parts of the line are still visible, such as the embankment through Swig's Hole valley and the approach to Horsmonden tunnel. Some bridges still remain, although the plate girder bridge over Goudhurst Road, Horsmonden has been removed.|$|E
5|$|The site of North {{station has}} {{significantly}} changed. The ornate mausoleum of Sharif Al-Hussein Ben Ali (d.1998) stands directly opposite {{the remains of}} <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> The operators of the Shia Islamic section of the cemetery have planted Leylandii along the boundary of their section of the cemetery, which includes <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> of North station. Unless the trees are removed, {{the remains of the}} station will ultimately become hidden and destroyed by overgrowth.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} six tracks, {{including}} two loop lines, and has four <b>platforms.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>platform</b> is a side <b>platform</b> housing <b>the</b> station's entrance and the ticket counter, {{and the second}} and third are part of an island <b>platform.</b> <b>The</b> fourth <b>platform</b> borders <b>the</b> northern end of the station and is the longest of all <b>the</b> <b>platforms.</b> <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> are connected by means of a footbridge.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> at Sterling Street were {{lengthened}} {{during the}} 1950s to 510 feet so that <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> could accommodate 10-car trains.|$|R
50|$|Between 2003 and 2011, <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> had {{deteriorated}} into a decrepit state. All of <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> had been shortened for the Britomart Curve, sections of removed track were stacked {{up on top}} of each other adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>platforms,</b> and grass and weeds covered most of the site.|$|R
5|$|When {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} on a platform or stage, it must be above all decorations and be behind and above any person speaking from <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> or stage. If it is displayed from a staff standing on <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> or stage, it must {{be on the right}} side of the person speaking from <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> or stage. Finally, when the flag is hung, it must be hung against a vertical wall or other vertical flat surface, with the crescent and stars on the top left position as seen by any spectator facing the flag and the wall or surface.|$|E
5|$|Windows Mobile for Automotive and Windows Mobile {{software}} for Portable Media Centers are among some specialty versions of <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|A PlayStation {{version was}} in {{development}} and {{scheduled for release}} in summer 2001, and a Dreamcast version in late 2001. Both were cancelled. PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were due for release in 2002. Versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance were proposed, but never materialised. A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts {{were not interested in}} the Game Boy versions. Molyneux stated that the Dreamcast version was cancelled because it was taking time to convert the game for <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> and development had not progressed far enough for it to be worth continuing as interest in <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> was declining.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> of <b>the</b> Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld station are not {{barrier-free}} for the disabled. To get to <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> {{of tracks}} 2 to 5, {{it is necessary}} to use an underpass from platform 1. A door of the entrance building leads to a staircase leading to the pedestrian underpass to <b>the</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adjacent to {{the station}} is also a bus stop. All bus lines {{terminate}} here, the stop for exit is near <b>the</b> main <b>platforms,</b> <b>the</b> entrance <b>platform</b> near <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> in <b>the</b> loop.|$|R
50|$|The station {{comprises}} two side <b>platforms,</b> <b>the</b> westbound <b>platform</b> east of <b>the</b> intersection, and <b>the</b> eastbound <b>platform</b> west of <b>the</b> intersection, {{with a small}} shelter on <b>the</b> westbound <b>platform</b> and {{two small}} shelters on <b>the</b> eastbound <b>platform.</b> Diagonal parking is provided {{on both sides of}} Van Aken Boulevard adjacent to <b>the</b> westbound <b>platform</b> and off westbound Van Aken adjacent to <b>the</b> eastbound <b>platform.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E
5|$|A small {{platform}} {{was added}} to the East Platform in the Early Classic, the surface of <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> possesses a series of holes that may have supported banners. <b>The</b> <b>platform</b> covered a large pit that contained the bodies of seventeen sacrificial victims, including men, women and children, possibly sacrificed during a dedicatory ceremony for <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> itself. In the 4th century AD the first version of Structure 5D-82 was built, {{to the north of the}} East Platform. In the second half of the 4th century six tombs were built in the East Platform. Ceramic offerings in the tombs included effigy vessels representing monkeys and macaws. The high artistic and technical quality of the funerary offerings in these tombs identify the deceased as members of Tikal's elite; they may have been members of a line of the ruling dynasty that lost power among the political upheaval of the late 4th century and included the kings K'inichMuwaanJol and ChakTokIch'aakI. With the entry of Siyaj K'ak' and the establishment of a new political order in the city, the focus of royal funerary rites was shifted from the Mundo Perdido to the North Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Angle Lake station {{consists}} of a single island platform elevated above street level, {{on the west side}} of 28th Avenue South. The station has two entrances located on the north and south sides of South 200th Street, connected to <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> by stairs, escalators and elevators. The station also has secure bicycle storage facilities.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the wooden}} {{buildings}} on <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> have gone <b>the</b> <b>platforms,</b> {{and some other}} buildings such as the station house and signal box remain.|$|R
50|$|Access to <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> is at {{street level}} with car parks located {{on both sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> given {{excellent}} access for the disabled.|$|R
50|$|In September 1967, <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> were {{extended}} to accommodate eight-car trains, and <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> were again extended in November 1976 to accommodate ten-car trains.|$|R
5|$|Apple's App Store, which {{provides}} iPhone and iPad applications, imposes censorship of content, {{which has become}} an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> The Guardian newspaper described the role of Apple as analogous to that of British magazine distributor WH Smith, which for many years imposed content restrictions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} of {{platform}} 7 is the blocked up remains of the tunnel which took <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> 13 (originally number 10) through-line from the north, under the Butler Street entrance.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} end of platform 7, <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> edge curves away to the east but the line now turns westward to join the main line.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>platforms</b> are staggered, with <b>the</b> {{outbound}} <b>platform</b> further west. Crosswalks across Huntington Avenue to {{the station}} are present at Brigham Circle (to <b>the</b> outbound <b>platform),</b> between <b>the</b> two <b>platforms,</b> and at Wigglesworth Street (to <b>the</b> inbound <b>platform).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{south end}} of <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> has a staff-only bridge {{allowing}} access from <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> to <b>the</b> East 180th Street Yard directly to the west.|$|R
50|$|In a metro {{station or}} similar construction, a {{transept}} is a space over <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> and tracks of a station with side <b>platforms,</b> containing <b>the</b> bridge between <b>the</b> <b>platforms.</b> Placing <b>the</b> bridge in a transept {{rather than an}} enclosed tunnel allows passengers to see <b>the</b> <b>platforms,</b> creating a less cramped feeling and making orientation easier.|$|R
