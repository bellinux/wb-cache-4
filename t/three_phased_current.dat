However, the shortcomings of using it are low DC voltage utilization, and poor inverter transmission capability. In recent years, there is an increasing trend and more research concentration of using space vector {{pulse width modulation}} in adjustable speed drives and renewable energy systems because it has better DC bus utilization, better performance, lower loss, lower ripples, and wide application range. This paper introduces space vector pulse width modulation and applies to speed control of alternating current induction motor. The <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> alternating <b>current</b> induction motor is reviewed based upon space vector representation. The development of space vector pulse width modulation and implementation to speed control of induction motor is done using Matlab/Simulink. The simulation is conducted by analyzing the response of stator current, stator voltage, speed, voltage, frequency, and the electromagnetic torque. Simulation results shows that space vector pulse width modulation which generates the voltage patterns at real time is {{able to control the}} speed of a <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> alternating <b>current</b> induction motor.
