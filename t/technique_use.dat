2500|$|In {{order to}} play [...] "doubles", {{proponents of the}} [...] "heel up" [...] <b>technique</b> <b>use</b> either one of two techniques: the [...] "slide technique" [...] or the heel-toe technique. In the slide technique, the pedal is struck around the middle area with the ball of the foot. As the drum {{produces}} a sound, the toe is slid up the pedal. After the first stroke, the pedal will naturally bounce back, hit the toe as it slides upwards, and rebound for a second strike. In the heel-toe technique the foot is suspended above the foot-board of the pedal. The entire foot is brought down and the ball of the foot strikes the pedal. The foot snaps up, the heel comes off the footboard, and the toes come down for a second stroke. Once mastered either technique allows the player to play very fast double strokes on the bass drum. Noted players include Rod Morgenstein, Tim Waterson (who formerly held the world record for the fastest playing on a bass drum), Tomas Haake, Chris Adler, Derek Roddy, Danny Carey, Hellhammer. The technique is commonly used in death metal and other extreme forms of music.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Five {{methods are}} used to measure values of {{circumferential}} Young’s modulus and three methods {{are used to}} obtain shear modulus using the closed and open ring specimens. Based {{on the assumption that}} the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a strain gage must yield the correct value of Young’s modulus, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a closed ring specimen gives more consistent results than the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> an open ring specimen. For the simplicity of measurement, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a closed ring specimen under compression can be used as long as the thickness of the used specimen remains thin enough to neglect the effects of shear deformation. To measure the shear modulus, G 12, both <b>techniques</b> <b>using</b> the open and closed ring seems to have the same trend as a function of thickness. As expected from the loading scheme, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> an open ring gives more consistent results for the shear modulus...|$|R

50|$|Microstereolithography is {{a common}} {{technique}} based on stereolithography principles. 3D components are fabricated by repeatedly layering photopolymerizable resin and curing under an ultraviolet laser. Earlier systems that employ this <b>technique</b> <b>use</b> a scanning principle in which a focused light beam is fixed onto one location and the translation stage moves to fabricate each layer vector by vector. A faster alternate involves using a projection principle in which the image is projected {{onto the surface of}} the resin so that the irradiation of a layer is done in one step only. The high-resolution results allow for the fabrication of complex shapes that would otherwise be difficult to produce at such small scales.|$|E
50|$|A sample (analyte) is {{injected}} into a carrier solution which mixes through radial and convection diffusion with a reagent {{for a period}} of time (depending on the flow rate, coil length, and coil diameter) before the sample passes through a detector to a waste container. A peristaltic pump is the most commonly used pump in FIA instruments but new variants of FIA <b>technique</b> <b>use</b> computer controlled syringe pumps that generate discontinuous flow precisely choreographed to the needs of assay protocol. The result is dramatic decrease in sample consumption, reagent consumption, and waste generation. The new technologies broadened applicability of FIA techniques from laboratory serial assays to research applications and continuous monitoring of environmental and industrial processes.|$|E
50|$|Capillary electrophoresis-mass {{spectrometry}} (CE-MS) is {{an analytical}} chemistry technique {{formed by the}} combination of the liquid separation process of capillary electrophoresis with mass spectrometry. CE-MS combines advantages of both CE and MS to provide high separation efficiency and molecular mass information in a single analysis. It has high resolving power and sensitivity, requires minimal volume and can analyze at high speed. Ions are typically formed by electrospray ionization, but they can also be formed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization or other ionization techniques. It has applications in basic research in proteomics and quantitative analysis of biomolecules as well as in clinical medicine.Since its introduction in 1987, new developments and application has made CE-MS powerful separation and identification <b>technique.</b> <b>Use</b> of CE-MS has increased for protein and peptides analysis and other biomolecules. Understanding of CE, the interface setup, ionization technique and mass detection system is important to tackle problems while coupling capillary electrophoresis to mass spectrometry.|$|E

Linear regressions were also run to assess the predictive ability of each individual factor of temperament and object relations development on positive and negative spiritual coping. The combined Temperament and Object Relations Model {{was a significant predictor of}} both positive and negative spiritual coping use, accounting for a higher percentage of variance (23. 5 % and 22. 8 %, respectively) than the other proposed positive and negative spiritual coping models. The Temperament Model was a significant predictor of positive spiritual coping <b>technique</b> <b>use.</b> The Object Relations Model was a significant predictor of negative spiritual coping <b>technique</b> <b>use.</b> The hypothesis that early developmental constructs can influence and predict later spiritual coping use is supported by the results of this study. ...|$|E
