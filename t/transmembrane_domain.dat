25|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the {{potassium}} channel KCNE family and is one five single <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain</b> voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel ancillary subunits. KCNE2 is composed of three major domains: the N-terminal domain, the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain,</b> and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain protrudes out of the extracellular side of the cell membrane and is, thus, soluble in the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, the transmembrane and C-terminal domains are lipid-soluble to enable the protein to incorporate into the cell membrane. The C-terminal faces the intracellular side of the membrane and may share a putative PKC phosphorylation site with other KCNE proteins.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of receptors with known structures, transmembrane alpha helices constitute most of the transmembrane component. In certain receptors, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain</b> forms a protein pore through the membrane, or around the ion channel. Upon activation of an extracellular domain by binding of the appropriate ligand, the pore becomes accessible to ions, which then diffuse. In other receptors, the transmembrane domains undergo a conformational change upon binding, which effects intracellular conditions. In some receptors, such {{as members of the}} 7TM superfamily, the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain</b> includes a ligand binding pocket. Bacteriorhodopsin is an example, the detailed structure of which has been determined by crystallography.|$|E

40|$|The uniporter/symporter/antiporter {{superfamily}} is an evolutionarily related {{group of}} solute transporters. For the entire superfamily, {{we have used}} a new predictive program to identify the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains.</b> These <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> were then analyzed with regard to their overall hydrophobicity and amphipathicity. In addition, the lengths of the hydrophilic loops connecting the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> were calculated. These data, together with structural information in the literature, were collectively used to produce a general model for the three-dimensional arrangement of the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{protein is}} {{predicted}} to be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation and glycosylation. The protein {{is predicted to}} have four <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> in the nuclear membrane. The structure of the protein is predicted to be helical in the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains.</b> Disulfide bonds are predicted {{to be found in}} the region in between <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> 3 and 4, which indicates that this particular region is located in the nucleoplasm.|$|R
25|$|However, {{in other}} types of receptors that have been studied, wherein ligands bind {{externally}} to the membrane, the ligands of GPCRs typically bind within the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain.</b> However, protease-activated receptors are activated by cleavage of part of their extracellular domain.|$|E
25|$|Mucin 16 is a {{membrane}} associated mucin that {{possesses a}} single <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain.</b> A unique property of MUC16 is its large size.

25|$|Rising {{levels of}} sterols {{increase}} the susceptibility of the reductase enzyme to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and proteolysis. Helices 2-6 (total of 8) of the HMG-CoA reductase <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain</b> sense {{the higher levels}} of cholesterol, {{which leads to the}} exposure of Lysine 248. This lysine residue can become ubiquinated by the E3 ligase AMFR, serving as a signal for proteolytic degradation.|$|E
25|$|The common {{feature of}} all ABC {{transporters}} {{is that they}} consist of two distinct domains, the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain</b> (TMD) and the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The TMD, also known as membrane-spanning domain (MSD) or integral membrane (IM) domain, consists of alpha helices, embedded in the membrane bilayer. It recognizes a variety of substrates and undergoes conformational changes to transport the substrate across the membrane. The sequence and architecture of TMDs is variable, reflecting the chemical diversity of substrates that can be translocated. The NBD or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domain, on the other hand, {{is located in the}} cytoplasm and has a highly conserved sequence. The NBD is the site for ATP binding. In most exporters, the N-terminal <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain</b> and the C-terminal ABC domains are fused as a single polypeptide chain, arranged as TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD. An example is the E. coli hemolysin exporter HlyB. Importers have an inverted organization, that is, NBD-TMD-NBD-TMD, where the ABC domain is N-terminal whereas the TMD is C-terminal, such as in the E. coli MacB protein responsible for macrolide resistance.|$|E

25|$|Secreted PEDF binds a {{receptor}} on {{the cell}} surface termed PEDF-R. PEDF-R has phospholipase A2 activity which liberates fatty acids from glycerolipids. PEDF enhances gamma-secretase activity, leading to the cleavage of the VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain.</b> This action interferes with VEGF signaling thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. Laminin receptor is also a target for PEDF, and the interaction occurs between residues 24-57 of PEDF, a region known to regulate antiangiogenic function.|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} transmembrane {{portions of}} a protein {{can be detected}} by hydropathy analysis. A hydropathy analysis uses an algorithm that quantifies the hydrophobic character at each position along the polypeptide chain. One of the accepted hydropathy scales is that of Kyte and Doolittle which relies on the generation of hydropathy plots. In these plots, the negative numbers represent hydrophilic regions and the positive numbers represent hydrophobic regions on the y-axis. A potential <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain</b> is about 20 amino acids long on the x-axis.|$|E

40|$|Flavivirus {{envelope}} proteins {{have been}} shown {{to play a major role}} in virus assembly. These proteins are anchored into cellular and viral membranes by their C-terminal domain. These domains are composed of two hydrophobic stretches separated by a short hydrophilic segment containing at least one charged residue. We investigated the role of the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> of prM and E in the envelope formation of the flavivirus yellow fever virus (YFV). Alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis has been used to examine the role of the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> of prM and E in YFV subviral particle formation. Most of the insertions had a dramatic effect on the release of YFV subviral particles. Some of these mutations were introduced into the viral genome. The ability of these mutant viruses to produce infectious particles was severely reduced. The alanine insertions did not affect prM-E heterodimerization. In addition, replacement of the charged residues present in the middle of the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> had no effect on subviral particle release. Taken together, these data indicate that the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> of prM and E play a crucial role in the biogenesis of YFV envelope. In addition, these data indicate some differences between the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domains</b> of the hepaciviruses and the flaviviruses. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

PEN-2 associates with the complex via binding of a <b>transmembrane</b> <b>domain</b> of presenilin and, among other possible roles, helps to stabilize the complex after presenilin proteolysis has generated the activated N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. APH-1, which is required for proteolytic activity, binds to the complex via a conserved alpha helix interaction motif and aids in initiating assembly of premature components.|$|E
