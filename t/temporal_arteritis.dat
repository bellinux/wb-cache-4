25|$|One {{recommended}} diagnostic {{approach is}} as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging {{and possibly a}} lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test {{to look for a}} brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person, a temporal artery biopsy to look for <b>temporal</b> <b>arteritis</b> should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Temporal</b> (giant cell) <b>arteritis</b> is a {{systemic}} granulomatous vasculitis primarily involving {{branches of the}} carotid arteries in patients aged 50 years and greater. Its classic symptoms and signs are headache and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), {{but this is not}} the only presentation. This case is the first reported in a Korean, whose chief complaint was pain in the tongue and headaches and whose ESR was normal. The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Her symptoms abated when treated with prednisone, but she developed diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and compression fracture of lumbar vertebrae while being treated. Primary physicians should become aware of the atypical features of this disease, as well as the potential complications of treatment. (J Am Board Fam Pract 1991; 4 : 115 - 8.) <b>Temporal</b> (giant cell) <b>arteritis</b> is {{a systemic}} granu-lomatous vasculitis, which primarily affects branches of the carotid artery in patients aged> 50 years. 1 The clinical manifestations, epidemiologic features, and laboratory findings of this disease are well documented. 1 - 3 The patient described here, however, had atypical complaints, epidemiologic features, and labora-tory results. Case Report A 70 -year-old Korean woman came to the family medicine center complaining of severe tongue pain, which was gradual in onset and present for several weeks. During this time, she also described diffuse frontal headaches, mild to mod-erate in severity, and a general sense of malaise. She denied jaw or tongue claudication, visual symptoms, or weight loss. Her examination was remarkable for bilaterally tender temporal ar-teries, which were pulsatile but not enlarged. All other physical findings were normal includ-ing the tongue and oral mucosa. Her laboratory tests included a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 38 mmlhr (normal) and a hematocrit of 34 percent (normal red cell indices). Despite the relatively low ESR, the clinical diagnosis was that the patient had temporal arte-ritis, and she was treated with prednisone (6...|$|R

50|$|Arteritic {{anterior}} ischemic {{optic neuropathy}} (AAION or arteritic AION) {{is the cause}} of vision loss that occurs in <b>temporal</b> <b>arteritis</b> (aka giant cell arteritis). <b>Temporal</b> <b>arteritis</b> is an inflammatory disease of medium-sized blood vessels that happens especially with advancing age. AAION occurs in about 15-20 percent of patients with <b>temporal</b> <b>arteritis.</b> Damage to the blood vessels supplying the optic nerves leads to insufficient blood supply (ischemia) to the nerve and subsequent optic nerve fiber death. Most cases of AAION result in nearly complete vision loss first to one eye. If the <b>temporal</b> <b>arteritis</b> is left untreated, the fellow eye will likely suffer vision loss as well within 1-2 weeks. Arteritic AION falls under the general category of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which also includes non-arteritic AION. AION is considered an eye emergency, immediate treatment is essential to rescue remaining vision.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between human papillomavirus (HPV) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) of the temporal artery. Methods The study group consisted of 22 cases of histologically positive/biopsy confirmed GCA. The control groups consisted of 21 histologically negative temporal artery biopsies and fifteen cases of vascular margins of nephrectomies. For detection of the presence of HPV, two methods were used: 1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra, 2) Cervista™ HPV HR. All cases were from the files of the Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University in St. Louis. Results HPV DNA was detected by PCR and genotyping in 16 of 22 (73 %) histologically positive cases of GCA and in only five of 21 (24 %) histologically negative temporal artery biopsies. Among the vascular margin controls, only three of 15 (20 %) were positive for HPV DNA. The second, independent method (Cervista TM) confirmed the aforesaid results with 100 % concordance with the exception of three cases which had low genomic DNA for which {{it was not possible to}} perform the test. The differences in HPV positivity between the histologically positive and negative temporal artery biopsies and between the histologically positive temporal artery biopsies and controls were both statistically significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 001 and 0. 002, respectively). Conclusions The results of our study revealed a statistically significant association between HPV positivity and biopsy confirmed <b>temporal</b> giant cell <b>arteritis</b> GCA (p[*]=[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Inflammation of the {{arterial}} wall in giant cell arteritis induces {{a series of}} structural changes, including the formation of new vasa vasorum. To study the regulation of neoangiogenesis in giant cell <b>arteritis,</b> <b>temporal</b> arteries were examined for the extent and localization of microvessel generation and {{for the production of}} angiogenic factors. In normal arteries, vasa vasorum were restricted to the adventitia, but in inflamed arteries, capillaries emerged in the media and the intima. These capillaries displayed a distinct topography with a circumferential arrangement in the external one-third of the intima. Neovascularization was closely correlated with the formation of lumen-obstructing intima, the fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, and the presence of multinucleated giant cells. Comparison of tissue cytokine transcription in temporal arteries of giant cell arteritis patients with and without up-regulated neoangiogenesis identified interferon-γ and vascular endothelial growth factor but not fibroblast growth factor- 2 as mediators associated with vasa vasorum proliferation. Giant cells and CD 68 -positive macrophages at the media-intima junction were found to be the major cellular sources of vascular endothelial growth factor. These data demonstrate that formation of new vasa vasorum in vasculitis is regulated by inflammatory cells and not by {{arterial wall}} cells, raising the possibility that it represents a primary disease mechanism and not a secondary hypoxia-induced event. Increased neovascularization in interferon-γ-rich arteries suggests that the formation of new vasa vasorum is determined {{by the nature of the}} immune response in the arterial wall, possibly resulting from the generation and functional activity of multinucleated giant cells...|$|R
40|$|Amyloid {{is a form}} of {{abnormal}} protein aggregation within the living body. Massive deposits can lead to organ failure. There is also increasing evidence that smaller pre-amyloid aggregates exert direct toxic effects to cells. To date 25 different proteins are known to occur as amyloid deposition in human tissues, although not all of these conditions are known to be associated with clinical diseases. This thesis deals with the very common form of amyloid localized to the arterial media. The fibril protein called ‘medin’ was identified in 1999. Medin is a 50 amino acid residue internal fragment of the precursor protein lactadherin. Lactadherin, first found in human milk, is expressed in various tissues such as breast epithelium (including carcinomas), macrophages and aorta. The function of the protein is not known but it has several functional domains. There is an EFG like domain, including an RGD-sequence, in the N-terminal part of the molecule. The C-terminal part consists of C 1 and C 2 coagulation factor V and VIII like domains. Medin is from within the C 2 domain. This region is suggested to be involved in phosphatidyl serine binding, important in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Medin amyloid was originally described from studies of the aorta. It is shown here that deposits are more widely spread and can be found in many large arteries, particularly within {{the upper part of the}} body. The prevalence of medin amyloid increases with age and deposits are found, to a certain degree, in virtually everyone above the age of 60 years. The amyloid is not only found extracellularly but intracellular deposits may also occur. Amyloid is usually associated with elastic lamina or lamellae which often show signs of fragmentation. Given the localization of amyloid to elastic structures of the arterial media, three different vascular diseases were studied: <b>temporal</b> (giant cell) <b>arteritis,</b> thoracic aortic aneurysm and thoracic aortic dissection. Medin amyloid was found in temporal arteries with and without inflammation. In inflamed arteries, amyloid was mainly located along the broken internal elastic lamina. Medin was also demonstrated within giant cells. It is suggested that medin may be an antigen triggering autoimmune giant cell arteritis. In the study of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, we found significant less medin amyloid in diseased aortic tissues compared with a control material. On the other hand, immunoreactive medin, probably in the state of oligomeric aggregates, was regularly found in association with aneurysms and dissections but not in the control material. It is suggested that medin oligomers exert toxic effects on smooth muscle cells which may lead to weakening of the arterial wall with aneurysm or dissection as a consequence...|$|R
