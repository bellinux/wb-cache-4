5|$|As Ponsonby {{tried to}} rally his men against the French cuirassers, he was {{attacked}} by Jaquinot's lancers and captured. A nearby party of Scots Greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander. However, the French lancer who had captured Ponsonby killed him and then used his lance to kill three of the Scots Greys who had attempted the rescue. By the time Ponsonby died, the momentum had entirely returned in favour of the French. Milhaud's and Jaquinot's cavalrymen drove the Union Brigade from the valley. The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry.

5|$|The match itself {{swirled around}} {{controversy}} between Abiodun Okulaja's (the center referee) calls and officiating. The most questionable calls were associated {{the severity of}} cards distributed to players and a late-match decision to award a penalty kick to the United, in which many claimed was a fake <b>trip</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> box. One controversial call came from a reckless challenge by Galaxy midfielder, Beckham, to United forward, Josh Wolff in the 40th minute. Following the referee stopping play to call the foul, a verbal exchange between Beckham and United's Santino Quaranta resulted in a swarm of United and Galaxy players coming in to push the two apart. While Quaranta was not carded for his exchange with Beckham, Beckham was carded for his foul against Wolff in the 37th minute and Davies' penalty kick in the 91st. The goal received much national attention from the controversy surrounding the decision to award a penalty, and Davies' celebration for successfully converting the kick. Subsequent to the match, center referee Abiodun Okulaja ejected Galaxy midfielder Jovan Kirovski for cursing at him while sniping his decision.|$|E
