5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> {{of a unit}} and its realisation. <b>The</b> <b>definition</b> of each base unit of the SI is drawn up {{so that it is}} unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of a unit is the procedure by which <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} kinds of {{definitions}} of fractional integrals and fractional derivatives, such as <b>the</b> Riemann-Liouville <b>definition,</b> <b>the</b> Caputo <b>definition,</b> <b>the</b> Liouville <b>definition,</b> <b>the</b> Grünwald-Letnikov <b>definition,</b> <b>the</b> Erdélyi-Kober <b>definition</b> and <b>the</b> Hadamard <b>definition.</b> We adopt <b>the</b> Liouville right-sided <b>definition</b> on <b>the</b> half-axis ℝ+ {{for the purpose of}} this article.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> above <b>definitions</b> are {{inadequate}} for many technical applications. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> above are specializations of <b>the</b> following <b>definitions.</b>|$|R
25|$|These three {{definitions}} may {{be described}} as <b>the</b> ethno-linguistic <b>definition,</b> <b>the</b> religious-cultural <b>definition</b> and <b>the</b> patrilineal <b>definition,</b> respectively.|$|R
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. <b>The</b> <b>definition</b> is seen by some as {{arbitrary}} and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter <b>the</b> <b>definition.</b> Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in <b>the</b> <b>definition.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} no structural brain damage occurs {{according to the}} classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses. Also, by definition, concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness. However, <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this change {{is that the new}} definition makes <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of the kilogram dependent on the definitions of the second and the metre.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>definitions</b> of scalar {{bounding}} {{functions are}} a good many. In this paper, <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> in vector cases given are new and {{can be regarded as}} a kind of improvement and generalization. Of course, the conditions of <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> may be changed by the actual need. For example, we take Definition 2.1 to discuss the following.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{two-level}} criteria {{to check the}} consistency of <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> of continuum quantities in Molecular Dynamics. As examples, we follow the control- volume approach, derive <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> of <b>the</b> tractions and energy fluxes for EAM potential and Tersoff potential, and provide the pseudo code the computing. Then, we verify the consistency of <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> by analytical and numerical methods. Comment: 27 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>definitions</b> given {{above are}} for the {{classical}} scheme. <b>The</b> <b>definitions</b> can be adjusted to work with any semantic scheme. This includes three-valued schemes, such as Strong Kleene, with exclusion negation, whose truth table is the following.|$|R
25|$|Both the plaintiffs' {{counsel and}} the defendant's counsel {{made use of}} the dictionaries. The plaintiffs' counsel read in {{evidence}} from the same dictionaries <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> of <b>the</b> word tomato, while the defendant's counsel then read in evidence from Webster's Dictionary <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> of <b>the</b> words pea, eggplant, cucumber, squash, and pepper. Countering this, the plaintiff then read in evidence from Webster's and Worcester's dictionaries <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> of potato, turnip, parsnip, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot and bean.|$|R

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{universal}} agreement on <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of the second relied on quantum theory, <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} day, {{following}} 'secret' negotiations, a compromise began to emerge after the Executive Committee moved explicitly to exclude consideration of extra-solar planets and to bring into <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> a criterion concerning the dominance of a body in its neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of Minkowski addition, {{this last}} {{expression}} means that x = ∑qn for some selection of pointsqn in the convexhulls of the summand-sets, that is, where eachqn∈Conv(Qn).
