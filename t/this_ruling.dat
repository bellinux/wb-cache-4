5|$|One of the court's {{most crucial}} {{decisions}} during Owsley's tenure {{was in the}} case of Commonwealth of Kentucky v.

5|$|To {{refrain from}} wearing tefillin: <b>This</b> <b>ruling</b> of the Shulchan Aruch {{is based on}} kabbalah and the Zohar which {{strongly}} advocate refraining from laying tefillin on Chol HaMoed.

5|$|During the 2003-04 NBA season, Webber {{was on the}} {{disabled}} list until February. When he returned, the NBA suspended him for three games for his guilty plea. In September 2005, Judge Edmunds ruled that the conviction should be treated as a misdemeanor and that Webber should pay the maximum fine for such an offense, which was $100,000. <b>This</b> <b>ruling</b> came after Webber served 330 hours of public service and accumulated $78,000 of related out-of-pocket expenses.|$|E

50|$|Under {{a finding}} by the Illinois Supreme Court, {{election}} judges were ruled as {{officers of the}} county court, and that any election judge who tampered with votes or intimidated voters could be jailed for contempt. Under the same court decision, some 3,000 persons drawn {{from the ranks of}} the local bar association and other civic organizations were deputized as pollwatchers, and were empowered to compel a policeman to arrest anyone involved in vote fraud. The same ruling deprived Governor Small from the power to pardon politicians arrested under <b>this</b> contempt <b>ruling.</b> <b>This</b> unprecedented <b>ruling</b> was estimated to have the potential to cut the stolen votes from about 75,000 to 25,000 within Cook County.|$|R
25|$|In November 1994, California voters passed Proposition 187 {{amending}} the state constitution, denying state {{financial aid to}} illegal immigrants. The federal courts voided <b>this</b> change, <b>ruling</b> that it violated the federal constitution.|$|R
5|$|Forced {{to choose}} between {{accepting}} depreciated money in payment for outstanding debts or waiting long times to collect debts, creditors turned to the courts for relief. In 1822, Bourbon County circuit court judge James Clark ruled {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair that the replevin law violated the state and federal constitutions. <b>This</b> <b>ruling</b> was so unpopular with the Relief Party that they attempted to remove him from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Krikler {{comments}} that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, Matthew Hale, that {{the killing of}} innocents {{in the name of}} self-preservation was unlawful. <b>This</b> <b>ruling</b> was to prove important a century later in R v Dudley and Stephens, which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.|$|E
5|$|Veltmann {{scored a}} {{victory at the}} {{beginning}} of his defense: he moved and was granted that each officer's testimony could only be applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, <b>this</b> <b>ruling</b> was favorable, but in practice it would only benefit the men if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, reporters observed the court to be drowsy at times, with one particular judge regularly nodding off.|$|E

5|$|While {{the idea}} of {{national}} symbols was strange to the Japanese, the Meiji Government needed them {{to communicate with the}} outside world. This became especially important after the landing of U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry in Yokohama Bay. Further Meiji Government implementations gave more identifications to Japan, including the anthem Kimigayo and the imperial seal. In 1885, all previous laws not published in the Official Gazette of Japan were abolished. Because of <b>this</b> <b>ruling</b> by the new cabinet of Japan, the Hinomaru was the de facto national flag since no law was in place after the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
5|$|A judge banned all filming but <b>this</b> <b>ruling</b> was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging her. Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident made it into the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
5|$|Families of 45 of the 47 {{passengers}} sued Comair for negligence. (Families of {{the other}} two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation.) Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and <b>this</b> <b>ruling</b> was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E

5|$|In 1644, {{after the}} false {{news of the}} death of Adam Kazanowski, Wiśniowiecki took over his disputed estate of Rumno by subterfuge. For this he was at first sentenced to exile, but due to his influence, even the King could not realistically expect to enforce <b>this</b> <b>ruling</b> without a civil war. Eventually after more discussions at local sejmiks and then in the Sejm, he won the case and was granted the right for Rumno. In 1646, after the death of Koniecpolski, he became the voivode of Ruthenia. He invaded and took over the town of Hadiach which was also being claimed by a son of Koniecpolski, Aleksander Koniecpolski, but a year later, in 1647, he lost that case and was forced to return the town.|$|E
5|$|Kiwi was {{acquired}} by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 {{to prevent it from}} becoming a monopoly. Since <b>this</b> <b>ruling,</b> Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. By the end of 2010, Sara Lee's Household & Body Care division (which included KIWI) {{was acquired}} by S.C.Johnson & Son.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar had {{previously}} signed a non-compete clause {{in order to}} be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010. However, he decided to challenge <b>this</b> <b>ruling</b> in court. WWE responded with a counterclaim after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling show in 2004. In July 2005, the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, their official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company. The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21, but did not get solved.|$|E

5|$|Madzimbamuto petitioned for {{the right}} to appeal against his {{detention}} to the Privy Council in London; the Rhodesian Appellate Division ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway. It ruled in his favour on 23 July 1968, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether they were under the 1961 or 1965 constitution, and that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Elinder Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider <b>this</b> <b>ruling</b> binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice JR Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies's ruling on 12 August and four days later became Chief Justice of Botswana. Madzimbamuto would remain in prison until 1974.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} bail out. After <b>this</b> <b>ruling,</b> jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v.
