5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{there is}} a lot of unpaid time, usually at a Shipper or Receiver where the truck is idle {{awaiting}} loading or unloading. Prior to the 2010 HOS changes it was common for 4–8 hours <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> during this evolution. CSA addressed this and incorporated legal methods for drivers and trucking companies to charge for this excessive time. For the most part, loading/unloading times have fallen into a window of 2–4 hours although longer times are still endured.|$|E
25|$|Omeprazole, as well {{as other}} PPIs, are only {{effective}} on active H+/K+-ATPase pumps. These pumps are stimulated in the presence of food to aid in digestion. For this reason, patients should be advised to take omeprazole with a glass of water on an empty stomach. Additionally, most sources recommend that after taking omeprazole, at least 30 minutes should be allowed <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> before eating (at least 60 minutes for immediate-release omeprazole plus sodium bicarbonate products, such as Zegerid), though some sources say that with delayed-release forms of omeprazole, waiting before eating after taking the medication is not necessary.|$|E

30|$|We have {{proposed}} a new method for evaluating local muscle fatigue using NIRS. We focus on the change in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin under the operation and define ΔHbt as the differences between them. In the experiment, as for the muscle of biceps brachii, we find that ΔHbt is constant in case of non-fatigue. Whereas in case of exhaustion, it increases according <b>to</b> <b>elapsed</b> time and shifts upward following with cycles.|$|R

25|$|In 1984, Sam Amirante, one of Gacy's two defense {{attorneys}} at his 1980 trial, authored procedures that were incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly into the Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984. Amirante has since {{stated that the}} primary inspiration for this legislation {{was the fact that}} at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> before initiating a search for a missing child. The Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency—commonly known today as an Amber Alert.|$|E
25|$|At the April {{council meeting}} {{proposals}} {{were made for}} routes in the Sneinton area, and two were adopted, one via Bath Street and Manvers Street to Colwick Road, {{and the other to}} Trent Bridge via London Road. These were incorporated in the Nottingham Corporation Act 1905. The Colwick Road route was an amended version of that previously arranged via Sneinton Road and Sneinton Hollows to Colwick Road. Owing to the extremely narrow streets in the Sneinton area, Bath Street had to be widened, and it was necessary to encroach on the cemetery to achieve this, the bodies being interred elsewhere. On Manvers Street 65 houses had to be pulled down, the main reason for this being Aldworth’s strong objection to single lines with passing loops. Nearly two years were <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> before these two routes came into being.|$|E
25|$|In January 1855 Wagner {{proceeded}} to compose the full score {{without bothering to}} write an intermediate instrumentation draft {{as he had done}} for Das Rheingold. This was a decision he was soon to regret, as numerous interruptions made the task of orchestrating the Gesamtentwurf an exceedingly difficult one. If he allowed too much time <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> between the initial drafting of a passage and its later elaboration, he found that he could not remember how he had intended to orchestrate the draft. Consequently, some passages had to be composed again from scratch. Wagner, nevertheless, persevered with the task and the full score was finally completed on 20 March 1856. The fair copy was begun on 14 July 1855 in the Swiss resort of Seelisberg, where Wagner and his wife spent a month. It was completed in Zürich on 23 March 1856, just three days after the completion of the full score.|$|E

40|$|Neurons {{in several}} areas of the monkey frontal cortex exhibit rank selectivity, firing {{differentially}} {{as a function of}} the stage attained during the performance of a serial order task. The activity of these neurons is commonly thought to represent ordinal position within the trial. However, they might also be sensitive to factors correlated with ordinal position including time elapsed during the trial (which is greater for each successive stage) and the degree of anticipation of reward (which probably increases at each successive stage). To compare the influences of these factors, we monitored neuronal activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA), presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), supplementary eye field (SEF), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the performance of a serial order task (requiring a series of saccades in three specified directions), a variable reward task (in which a cue displayed early in the trial indicated whether the reward received at the end of the trial would be large or small), and a long delay task (in which the monkey had simply to maintain fixation during a period of time approximating the duration of an average trial in the serial order task). We found that rank signals were partially correlated with sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>elapsed</b> time and anticipated reward. The connection <b>to</b> <b>elapsed</b> time was strongest in the pre-SMA. The connection to anticipated reward was most pronounced in the SMA and SEF. However, critically, these factors could not fully explain rank selectivity in any of the areas tested...|$|R

25|$|A notice {{always had}} to be given several days before the {{assembly}} was to actually vote. For elections, at least three market-days (often more than seventeen actual days) had to pass between {{the announcement of the}} election, and the actual election. During this time period (the trinundinum), the candidates interacted with the electorate, and no legislation could be proposed or voted upon. In 98 BC, a law was passed (the lex Caecilia Didia) which required a similar three market-day interval to pass between the proposal of a law and the vote on that law. During criminal trials, the assembly's presiding magistrate had to give a notice (diem dicere) to the accused person {{on the first day of}} the investigation (anquisito). At the end of each day, the magistrate had to give another notice to the accused person (diem prodicere), which informed him of the status of the investigation. After the investigation was complete, a three market-day interval had <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> before a final vote could be taken with respect to conviction or acquittal.|$|E
500|$|The {{second draft}} was begun on 25 September 1877, {{just a few}} days after the first: at this point in his career Wagner liked to work on both drafts simultaneously, {{switching}} back and forth between the two so as not to allow too much time <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> between his initial setting of the text and the final elaboration of the music. The [...] of act 3 was completed on 16 April 1879 and the [...] on the 26th of the same month.|$|E
500|$|Although not {{the first}} to do so, 24 embraced the concept of real time. This idea started when {{producer}} Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing [...] "24 episodes in a season, with each episode lasting an hour". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a [...] "race against the clock". Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing <b>to</b> <b>elapse</b> during the commercial breaks. The exact time is denoted by the digital clock display {{at the beginning and end}} of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen. The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode. In line with the depiction of events in real time, 24 does not use slow motion techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first-season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours. As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.|$|E

Instead, they must foul {{as a means of}} terminating the opposing team's possession as soon as possible. Also, the effectiveness of this strategy is heightened as fatigue and pressure can affect the ability of the free-throw shooter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{position}} of a point particle is defined {{in relation to a}} coordinate system centered on an arbitrary fixed reference point in space called the origin O.
