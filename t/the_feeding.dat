40|$|In a stirred vessel {{used as a}} semi-batch reactor, one of the {{reactants}} {{is supplied}} via a feed pipe. In this project. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence was used for studying how <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> flow from such a feed pipe {{is influenced by the}} turbulent flow in the vessel (Re ? 9000). <b>The</b> <b>feed</b> flow was visualised by use of a horizontal laser sheet at several vertical positions under <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe. Measurements were performed with different feed pipe openings and at several impeller speeds. The digital images of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> flow were corrected for systematic noise. To separate <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> flow structures from the background, an objective threshold grey level was calculated. At the positions under <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe, average values of several parameters characterising <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> flow have been determined. The trends in the relation between an average parameter and the position under <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe are <b>the</b> same for different feed pipe openings and impeller speeds. These trends are mainly due to the wake behind the head of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe. At low impeller speeds, the wake is related to the shape of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe. When <b>the</b> impeller speed is high, the shape of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe is less important and the effect of the wake is smaller. From the trends for the decay in length scale of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> flow, it can be concluded that the decaying length scale depends on <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> pipe opening and the impeller speed {{in a way that is}} different from that predicted by theory.

5|$|Keene died {{at home on}} January 13, 2009, aged 85, from a {{respiratory}} condition. After her death, the Homer {{city council}} passed a new resolution banning <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> of eagles, crows, ravens and other predatory and scavenger birds by any person, effective March 19, 2009. The resolution's effective date was delayed until spring out of concern that the birds would either die of starvation or become highly aggressive if <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> ended {{in the middle of}} winter. A memorial to Keene is planned at a nearby hotel that was a favorite dining spot of Keene's and supplied much of her fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} estuaries of Hilton Head Island are <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> grounds, breeding grounds, and nurseries {{for many}} saltwater species of game fish, sport fish, and marine mammals. The dense plankton population gives the coastal water its murky brown-green coloration.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{condition}} of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> may be altered {{to reduce the}} reboiler duty.

50|$|In FO {{processes}} we {{may have}} solute diffusion in both directions depending on {{the composition of the}} draw solution and <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> water. This does two things; the draw solution solutes may diffuse to <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> solution and <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> solution solutes may diffuse to the draw solution. Clearly these phenomena have consequences in terms of the selection of the draw solution for any particular FO process. For instance the loss of draw solution may affect <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> solution perhaps due to environmental issues or contamination of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> stream, such as in osmotic membrane bioreactors.|$|R
5|$|A typical female {{vampire bat}} weighs 40grams and can consume over 20grams (1 fluid ounce) {{of blood in}} a 20-minute feed. This feeding {{behavior}} is facilitated by its anatomy and physiology for rapid processing and digestion of the blood to enable the animal to take flight soon after <b>the</b> <b>feeding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the {{existing}} airstrip at Turatam near the cosmodrome was small, {{the dogs and}} crew had to be first flown aboard a Tu-104 plane to Tashkent. From there, a smaller and lighter Il-14 plane took them to Turatam. Training of dogs continued upon arrival; one after another they {{were placed in the}} capsules to get familiar with <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend much of their time foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E
50|$|Matching the {{impedance}} of {{the antenna}} to {{the impedance of}} <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> line can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an antenna tuner, an impedance matching device. Installing the tuner between <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> line and <b>the</b> antenna allows for <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> line to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter's power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point impedance. Installing a tuner in between the transmitter and <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> line can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> line to one preferred by the transmitter. However, in the latter case, <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> line still has a high SWR present, with <b>the</b> resulting increased <b>feed</b> line losses unmitigated.|$|R
30|$|The {{pressure}} loss originates from the structural {{change of the}} polymer thin layer membrane material, which is being compressed in a dense form by <b>the</b> applied <b>feed</b> pressure of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> stream. This is expressed through {{the rise in the}} overall membrane resistance coefficient. The electrical power consumption of the pump is now increasingly being used to circulate <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> stream than over the membrane and back into <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> tank, rather than processing <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> stream though <b>the</b> membrane an increasing hereby the volume of the desired permeate stream.|$|R
30|$|In Fig.  2, p_mf and p_mp are <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> side vapour {{pressure}} of the membrane and the permeate {{vapour pressure}}, respectively, and can be calculated from the Antoine equation and from Raoult’s law (Phattaranawik et al. 2003; Mariah et al. 2006; Drioli et al. 2015). T_f is <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> side inlet temperature, T_mf is <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> side membrane temperature, T_mp is the permeate side membrane temperature and T_p is the permeate temperature. C_f, C_mf, C_mp and C_p are <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> side inlet concentration, <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> side membrane concentration, the permeate side membrane concentration and the permeate concentration, respectively. J and Q are the water flux and the heat flux, respectively.|$|R
5|$|In April 2001, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} for relief from {{judgment}} citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The Second District Court of Appeal upheld Greer's decision but remanded the issue {{in order to give}} the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. <b>The</b> <b>feeding</b> tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo {{filed a motion}} to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> tube be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E
5|$|Jean Keene (October 20, 1923 – January 13, 2009), {{also known}} as the Eagle Lady, was a former rodeo trick rider who became the subject of {{national}} attention due to her feeding of wild bald eagles on the Homer Spit in Homer, Alaska. Although she had many supporters for the feedings, she was also criticized for drawing a large population of eagles to the area. After her death, the city of Homer passed a law prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> of predatory birds.|$|E
5|$|Keene {{had been}} {{persistent}} in her efforts. In 1985 she broke her leg, {{but managed to}} keep to <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> schedule even on crutches. In the winter of 1994 {{she was diagnosed with}} breast cancer and on her doctor's advice underwent a mastectomy. She hired a friend to conduct feeding operations in her absence, but was back to do it herself three days after surgery.|$|E
50|$|Feed mixers {{are used}} in <b>feed</b> mills for <b>the</b> mixing of <b>feed</b> {{ingredients}} and premixes. The mixer plays {{a vital role in}} <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> production process, with efficient mixing being the key to good feed production. If feed is not mixed properly, ingredients and nutrients will not be properly distributed {{when it comes time to}} extrude and pelletize <b>the</b> <b>feed,</b> or if <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> is to be used as mash. This means that not only would <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> not have nutritional benefit, it would be bad for the animals that are eating it.|$|R
30|$|Input {{variables}} are not state variables. Instead, they are {{external to the}} system but affect the system (i.e. work on the system). For example, <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> temperature and composition of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> stream to a distillation tower or a chemical reactor or <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> temperature to a heat exchanger are input variables.|$|R
50|$|In simple antennas <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> usually {{consists}} of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> antenna (driven element), {{the part of}} the antenna which actually converts the radio frequency currents to radio waves or vice versa, and <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> line (transmission line), which connects <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> antenna with <b>the</b> receiver or transmitter. For example, in a rooftop Yagi television antenna, <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> {{consists of}} a dipole driven element, which converts the radio waves to an electric current, and a coaxial cable or twin lead transmission line which conducts the received signal from the driven element into the house to the television receiver. The rest of the antenna consists of rods called parasitic elements, which strengthen reception from a given direction.|$|R
5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli {{which may or may not}} be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E
5|$|Mammals {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales. The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or on two legs. The {{largest group of}} mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> of the fetus during gestation.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} {{of the purpose of}} whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E

40|$|We examine here {{a number}} of {{variations}} of Reflector Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs) that are useful when <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> arms are flexible. When feed arms are built using a conducting fabric or membrane, the end of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> arms are often contained entirely within the radius of a circular reflector, to keep <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> arms under tension. This displaces <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> arms toward <b>the</b> center of the reflector from the standard position where the charge center of <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> arms intersects <b>the</b> reflector rim. We investigate here the effect of that feed arm displacement while varying <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> impedance and feed arm position. We also investigate the effect of shaping the reflector to exclude {{the portion of the}} aperture that contributes destructively to the radiated field. For each of these configurations, we calculate the effective height, antenna gain, and sidelobe level. In this paper, we consider {{a number of}} configurations of the Impulse Radiating Antenna (IRA) that are useful with flexible feed arms. These IRA variations include the Para-IRA [1] and the Membrane IRA [2]. In such designs, <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> arms must remain under tension, so it is often easier to place <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> arms such that their outside edge intersects the outer rim of the paraboli...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} requirement of a radar {{system is that}} the aperture should be illuminated by a uniform phase front {{in order to obtain}} a beam of parallel rays.

5|$|Terri Schiavo died at a Pinellas Park hospice on March 31, 2005.

5|$|The {{island has}} a {{significant}} breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), 400 pairs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus), 2pairs of great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) and varying numbers of common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopodidae). <b>The</b> <b>feeding</b> habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pattern of}} {{electric}} and magnetic fields {{at the mouth}} of a parabolic antenna is simply a scaled up image of the fields radiated by <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> antenna, so <b>the</b> polarization is determined by <b>the</b> <b>feed</b> antenna.
