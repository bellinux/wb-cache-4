40|$|The {{properties}} of Escherichia coli mutant D 2 - 47 LT {{indicate that it}} is temperature-sensitive for a protein required for the initiation of chromosome replication. The results of several different experiments are consistent with this hypothesis, and no support was found for the alternate hypotheses tested. Although the strain is usually unable to initiate replication at 42 C, some of the initiation proteins are apparently synthesized at the restrictive temperature. This can cause initiation on partially replicated, but not completed, chromosomes. It appears that the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> is required for initiation on completed chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type {{adenovirus}} was coinfected with a mutant temperature sensitive for the immediate-early gene of pseudorabies virus. At the nonpermissive temperature, this mutant, tsG, strongly inhibited {{the transcription}} of all adenovirus early genes, including E 1 A. This inhibition {{was not observed}} with wild-type pseudorabies virus coinfection or with tsG coinfection at the permissive temperature. The level of repression was dependent upon the ratio of tsG to adenovirus in the infection. The {{results suggest that the}} <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> may be interacting with transcription factors on the viral DNA or with the DNA itself to inhibit adenovirus transcription...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{temperature}} dependence of single-channel conductance and open probability for outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Escherichia coli {{were examined in}} planar lipid bilayers. OmpA formed two interconvertible conductance states, small channels, 36 – 140 pS, between 15 and 37 °C, and large channels, 115 – 373 pS, between 21 and 39 °C. Increasing temperatures had strong effects on open probabilities and on the ratio of large to small channels, particularly between 22 and 34 °C, which effected sharp increases in average conductance. The data infer that OmpA is a flexible <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> that exists as a small pore structure at lower temperatures, but refolds into a large pore at higher temperatures...|$|E
40|$|A hybrid {{infectivity}} assay specific {{for primary}} transcription {{was developed to}} analyze the production of functional mRNAs by vesicular stomatitis virus. A template prepared from wild-type virions of the New Jersey serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus was reconstituted with RNA polymerase proteins from the wild type or temperature-sensitive mutants, and the in vivo temperature sensitivity of the polymerase was determined by infectivity assay. The data demonstrate that the New Jersey temperature-sensitive mutants A 1 and E 1 have non-temperature-sensitive transcriptases, whereas the B 1 and F 1 mutants both have <b>temperature-sensitive</b> L <b>proteins</b> which are defective in primary transcription...|$|R
40|$|The lipidic cubic {{phase of}} monoolein {{has proved to}} be a matrix well suited to the {{production}} of three-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. It consists of a single continuous bilayer, which is contorted in three-dimensional space and separates two distinct water channels. It has previously been proposed that on the addition of precipitants, membrane proteins embedded in the cubic phase migrate through the matrix to nucleation sites and that this process is dependent upon the stability of the lipidic cubic phase. Here, the effect of detergent type (C- 8 -C- 12 glucosides, C- 8 -C- 12 maltosides and C- 7 thioglucoside) and concentration (1 - 3 x the critical micelle concentration; CMC) on cubic phase stability are reported in the form of the temperature-dependent phase behaviour (268 - 313 K) in 40 % aqueous solution. The results are tabulated to show the best monoolein (MO) -detergent mixtures, mixing temperatures and crystallization temperatures identified. Monoolein-detergent mixtures suited for low-temperature in cubo crystallization of <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>proteins</b> are also reported for the first time. These mixtures can be prepared at low temperatures (mixed at less than or equal to 288 K) and remain stable at 277 K for a period of at least one month. They include MO- heptyl thioglucoside (1 x and 3 x CMC), MO-nonyl glucoside (3 x CMC), MO-octyl maltoside (3 x CMC), MO-nonyl maltoside (1 x CMC) and MO-decyl maltoside (1 x CMC) ...|$|R
40|$|Two high copy {{suppressors}} of <b>temperature-sensitive</b> TATA-binding <b>protein</b> (TBP) mutants were isolated. One suppressor was TIF 51 A, which encodes eukaryotic translation {{initiation factor}} 5 A. The other high copy suppressor, YGL 241 W, {{also known as}} KAP 114, is one of 14 importin/karyopherin proteins in yeast. These proteins mediate the transport of specific macromolecules {{into and out of}} the nucleus. Cells lacking Kap 114 partially mislocalize TBP to the cytoplasm. Kap 114 binds TBP in vitro, and binding is disrupted in the presence of GTPγS. Therefore, Kap 114 is an importer of TBP into the nucleus, but alternative import pathways must also exist...|$|R
40|$|A CP 1201 RIR 1 intein {{is found}} in the {{ribonucleotide}} reductase alpha subunit (RNR alpha subunit) protein of lytic bacteriophage P 1201 from Corynebacterium glutamicum NCHU 87078. This intein can be over-expressed and spliced in Escherichia coli NovaBlue cells. Mutations of C 539, the N-terminal residue of the C-extein in the CP 1201 RIR 1 protein, led to the changes of pattern and level of protein-splicing activities. A G 392 S variant was found to be a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> with complete splicing activity at 17 and 28 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C or higher. We also found that the cleavage at the CP 1201 RIR 1 intein C-terminus of the double mutant G 392 S/C 539 G was blocked, but other cleavage activities could be efficiently performed at 17 degrees C. G 392 S/C 539 G variant possessed the properties of low-temperature-induced cleavage at the intein N-terminus...|$|E
40|$|In a {{wild-type}} strain (relA+) of Escherichia coli, starvation of amino acid {{led to an}} immediate cessation of the synthesis of stable ribonucleic acids, together with the accumulation of an unusual nucleotide, guanosine 5 '-diphosphate 3 '-diphosphate, commonly known as ppGpp. This compound also accumulated during heat shock. When <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis elongation factor G (EF-G) was introduced into E. coli NF 859, a relA+ strain, the synthesis of ppGpp was reduced to approximately one-half that of wild-type EF-G+ cells at a nonpermissive temperature of 40 degrees C. Furthermore, fusidic acid, an inhibitor of protein synthesis which specifically inactivates EF-G, prevented any accumulation of ppGpp during the heat shock. We suggest that a functional EF-G protein is necessary for ppGpp accumulation under temperature shift conditions, possibly by mediating changes in the function of another protein, the relA gene product. However, EF-G is probably not required for the synthesis of ppGpp during the stringent response, since its inactivation did not prevent ppGpp accumulation during amino acid starvation...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptional {{activation}} of eukaryotic genes often requires {{the function of}} histone acetyltransferases (HATs), {{which is expected to}} result in the hyperacetylation of histones within promoter nucleosomes. In this study we show that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the steady-state levels of Gcn 5 -dependent histone acetylation within a number of transcriptionally active promoters are inversely related to the rate of transcription. High acetylation levels were measured only when transcription was attenuated either by TATA element mutations or in a strain carrying a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> component of RNA polymerase II. In addition, we show that in one case the low levels of histone acetylation depend on the function of the Rpd 3 histone deacetylase. These results point to the existence of an unexpected interplay of two opposing histone-modifying activities which operate on promoter nucleosomes following the initiation of RNA synthesis. Such interplay could ensure rapid turnover of chromatin acetylation states in continuously reprogrammed transcriptional systems...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome I {{have suggested that}} the majority (> 75 %) of single-copy essential genes on this chromosome are difficult or impossible to identify using temperature-sensitive (Ts-) lethal mutations. To investigate whether this situation reflects intrinsic difficulties in generating <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>proteins</b> or constraints on mutagenesis in yeast, we subjected three cloned essential genes from chromosome I to mutagenesis in an Escherichia coli mutator strain and screened for Ts- lethal mutations in yeast using the "plasmid-shuffle" technique. We failed to obtain Ts- lethal mutations in two of the genes (FUN 12 and FUN 20), while the third gene yielded such mutations, but only at a low frequency. DNA sequence analysis of these mutant alleles and of the corresponding wild-type region revealed that each mutation was a single substitution not in the previously identified gene FUN 19, but in the adjacent, newly identified essential gene FUN 53. FUN 19 itself proved to be non-essential. These results suggest that many essential proteins encoded by genes on chromosome I cannot be rendered thermolabile by single mutations. However, the results obtained with FUN 53 suggest that there may also be significant constraints on mutagenesis in yeast. The 5046 base-pair interval sequenced contains the complete FUN 19, FUN 53 and FUN 20 coding regions, as well as a portion of the adjacent non-essential FUN 21 coding region. In all, 68 to 75 % of this interval is open reading frame. None of the four predicted products shows significant homologies to known proteins in the available databases...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} {{transient}} {{expression of the}} wild-type vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G protein) from cloned cDNA to rescue a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> G <b>protein</b> mutant of VSV in cells at the nonpermissive temperature. Using cDNAs encoding G proteins with deletions in the normal 29 -amino-acid cytoplasmic domain, we determined {{that the presence of}} either the membrane-proximal 9 amino acids or the membrane-distal 12 amino acids was sufficient for rescue of the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> mutant. G <b>proteins</b> with cytoplasmic domains derived from other cellular or viral G proteins did not rescue the mutant, nor did G proteins with one or three amino acids of the normal cytoplasmic domain. Rescue correlated directly with the ability of the G proteins to be incorporated into virus particles. This was shown by analysis of radiolabeled particles separated on sucrose gradients as well as by electron microscopy of rescued virus after immunogold labeling. Quantitation of surface expression showed that all of the mutated G proteins were expressed less efficiently on the cell surface than was wild-type G protein. However, we were able to correct for differences in rescue efficiency resulting from differences in the level of surface expression by reducing wild-type G protein expression to levels equivalent to those observed for the mutated G proteins. Our results provide evidence that at least a portion of the cytoplasmic domain is required for efficient assembly of the VSV G protein into virions during virus budding...|$|R
30|$|The {{transition}} from primase-catalyzed RNA synthesis to Pol α-catalyzed DNA synthesis is mediated by Pri 2 that bridges Pri 1 and Pol α within the pol-prim complex (Arezi et al., 1999). Electron microscopy studies and computational modeling of the pol-prim complex reveal a dumbbell-shaped architecture with flexible {{association between the}} DNA polymerase and primase lobes (Nunez-Ramirez et al., 2011). Degradation of a Pri 2 <b>temperature-sensitive</b> mutant <b>protein</b> at the restrictive temperature abolishes co-immunoprecipitation of Pol 1 -Pri 1, whereas Pol 1 -Pri 2 interaction remains intact when Pri 1 is degraded (Longhese et al., 1993). Thus, the association between primase and Pol α appears to be directly mediated by Pri 2, in keeping with co-immunoprecipitation studies of human pol-prim subunits that were ectopically expressed in insect cells (Copeland and Wang, 1993).|$|R
40|$|The most {{documented}} extrahepatic {{manifestation of}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC). MC is characterised {{by the presence}} of <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> complexes: in type II MC, cryoglobulins are composed of a monoclonal rheumatoid factor (usually, IgMk) against polyclonal IgG. In type III MC, all components are polyclonal. The presence of microheterogeneity and other new types of cryoglobulins is a novel and recent observation. The production of different autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes, including the cryoglobulins, are responsible for systemic vasculitis and various organ damage. In a limited number of MC patients, a malignancy, that is B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or hepatocellular carcinoma, may also develop. Finally, results of interferon and=or ribavirin treatments in MC patients represent an indirect proof for the pathogenetic link between MC and HVC infection. The discovery of the relation between HCV infection and MC shows the striking association between a viral infection and an autoimmune disease and, thus, a potential link between the systemic autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{polarity}} suppression (Psu) protein of bacteriophage P 4 causes {{suppression of}} transcriptional polarity inEscherichia coliby overcoming Rho termination factor activity. Two newpsumutants defective in polarity suppression are described. Thepsu 5 mutation deletes codons 95 – 98 from {{about the middle}} of the gene, and the mutant protein is inactive. Thepsu 6 mutation changes Phe 169 to Val and encodes a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein.</b> Constitutive overexpression ofpsu+from a plasmid prevents colony formation, but overexpression of mutant genes (psu 5, psu 6) does not, suggesting that Psu disturbs essential host function(s). Rho protein synthesis is enhanced several-fold in cells containing wild-type Psu, due to readthrough at therhoattenuator, while the physical stability of Rho is maintained. As a consequence, Psu-producing cells accumulate significantly more Rho than normal cells, reminiscent of termination-defectiverhomutants. The polarity suppression activity induced by Psu is demonstratedin vitroby the efficient readthrough of Rho-dependent terminators λ tR 1 and TIS 2 during coupled transcription–translation. Purified Rho protein restores termination at TIS 2 when added to Psu-containing reactions but NusG does not. The data support the hypothesis that Psu has or elicits an anti-Rho function...|$|E
40|$|A mutant strain AA- 522, temperature-sensitive for protein synthesis, was {{isolated}} from a stringent strain (CP- 78) of Escherichia coli K- 12. The mutant strain has a relaxed phenotype at the nonpermissive growth temperature. Protein synthesis stops completely at 42 C, whereas {{the rate of}} ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis is maintained at 20 % of the 30 C rate. Sucrose-gradient centrifugation analysis of RNA-containing particles formed at 42 C indicated the presence of “relaxed particles. ” These particles possess 16 S and 23 S RNA and are precursors to normal 50 S and 30 S ribosomal subunits. A search for the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> responsible for the halt in protein synthesis implicated phenylalanyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase. Essentially no enzyme activity is detected in vitro at 30 or 40 C. Analysis of phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase activity in revertants of strain AA- 522 indicated the presence of intragenic suppressor mutations. Revertants of strain AA- 522 analyzed for the relaxed response at 42 C were all stringent; strain AA- 522 was stringent at 30 C. These data indicate that a single mutation in phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase is responsible for both a block in protein synthesis and the relaxed phenotype at 42 C...|$|E
40|$|Single-stranded progeny DNA is not {{formed when}} host cells are {{infected}} at the restrictive temperature with a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> coat <b>protein</b> mutant of øX 174. Once begun, {{the synthesis of}} single-stranded DNA is interrupted when an infected culture is shifted from the permissive to the restrictive temperature. The synthesis of double-stranded “replicative form” DNA is observed under restrictive conditions. Upon shifting an infected culture from restrictive to permissive conditions after 30 minutes of infection, single-stranded DNA synthesis starts almost immediately. In this instance, the initial single-stranded viral DNA is formed out of the pre-formed double-stranded replicative form DNA by degradation of the complementary strand. The attachment of coat protein to the viral strand {{and the release of}} the viral strand from the double-stranded precursor appear to take place simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Screening of {{expression}} libraries for bioactive clones that modulate {{the growth of}} mammalian cells has been limited largely to positive selections incapable of revealing growth suppressive or lethal genetic elements. We have developed a technique, selection–subtraction approach (SSA), that allows growth-modulating clones to be isolated based on alterations in their relative abundance in growing cell populations that have been transduced with an expression library. SSA utilizes tagged retroviral libraries in bacteriophage λ vectors (retrophages). Nylon prints from retrophage libraries are {{used to determine the}} relative abundance of tags in library-transduced cells to identify biological activity of individual clones. Applications of SSA for gene discovery, target discovery, and generation of mutant proteins have been demonstrated, by using p 53 and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) as models to isolate growth inhibitory proteins, peptides and antisense RNAs, and <b>temperature-sensitive</b> mutant <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

One region within the φX 174 major spike protein G tolerated 13 of 16 assayed insertions, ranging from 10 to 75 amino acids. The recombinant proteins were functional and incorporated into infectious virions. In the folded protein, the peptides would be icosahedrally displayed within loops that extend from the protein׳s β-barrel core. The well-honed genetics of φX 174 allowed permissive insertions to be quickly identified by the cellular phenotypes associated with cloned gene expression. The cloned genes were easily transferred from plasmids to phage genomes via recombination rescue. Direct ELISA validated several recombinant virions for epitope display. Some insertions conferred a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> (ts) <b>protein</b> folding defect, which was suppressed by global suppressors in protein G, located {{too far away from}} the insertion to directly alter peptide display...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{we found}} that {{different}} low molecular weight compounds, all known to stabilize proteins in their native conformation, are effective in correcting the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> folding defect associated with the deltaF 508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein. Here we examined whether the folding of other proteins which exhibit temperature-sensitive folding defects also could be corrected via a similar strategy. Cell lines expressing temperature-sensitive mutants of the tumor suppressor protein p 53, the viral oncogene protein pp 60 src, or a ubiquitin activating enzyme E 1, were incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (39. 5 degrees C) {{in the presence of}} glycerol, trimethylamine N-oxide or deuterated water. In each case, the cells exhibited phenotypes similar to those observed when the cells were incubated at the permissive temperature (32. 5 degrees C), indicative that the particular protein folding defect had been corrected. These observations, coupled with our earlier work and much older studies in yeast and bacteria, indicate that protein stabilizing agents are effective in vivo for correcting protein folding abnormalities. We suggest that this type of approach may prove to be useful for correcting certain protein folding abnormalities associated with human diseases...|$|E
40|$|CK {{syndrome}} (CKS) is an X-linked recessive {{intellectual disability}} syndrome characterized by dysmorphism, cortical brain malformations, and an asthenic build. Through an X chromosome single-nucleotide variant scan {{in the first}} reported family, we identified linkage to a 5 Mb region on Xq 28. Sequencing of this region detected a segregating 3 bp deletion (c. 696 _ 698 del [p. Lys 232 del]) in exon 7 of NAD(P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL), a gene that encodes an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We also found that males with intellectual disability in another reported family with an NSDHL mutation (c. 1098 dup [p. Arg 367 SerfsX 33]) have CKS. These two mutations, which alter protein folding, show <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> stability and complementation in Erg 26 -deficient yeast. As described for the allelic disorder CHILD syndrome, cells and cerebrospinal fluid from CKS patients have increased methyl sterol levels. We hypothesize that methyl sterol accumulation, not only cholesterol deficiency, causes CKS, given that cerebrospinal fluid cholesterol, plasma cholesterol, and plasma 24 S-hydroxycholesterol levels are normal in males with CKS. In summary, CKS expands the spectrum of cholesterol-related disorders and insight {{into the role of}} cholesterol in human development. Keith W. McLarren [...] . Jozef Gecz [...] . et al...|$|E
30|$|The {{filamentous}} <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein</b> Z (FtsZ) {{plays an}} important role in the bacterial cell division. In the process of bacterial cell division, FtsZ forms single-stranded filaments and then the highly dynamic Z-ring scaffold, followed by the recruitment of other cell division proteins. Once the recruitment is accomplished, the filaments bend and Z ring contracts, leading to the closure of the septum and then the completion of the cell division, otherwise the bacterial cell division will be interrupted, which eventually result in bacterial apoptosis (Bi and Lutkenhaus 1991; Sossong et al. 1999). Due to its essential role and high conservation in bacteria, FtsZ is considered as an attractive target to develop the antibacterial agents with selective toxicity to bacterial pathogens (Margalit et al. 2004; Haydon et al. 2008; Kaur et al. 2010; Sass et al. 2011; Chan et al. 2013). Recently, a high-throughput screening model, based on inhibition of the GTPase activity of FtsZ, has been used to identify small molecules that target assembly-dependent GTPase activity of FtsZ, and then FtsZ inhibitors were developed as antibacterial agents inducing bacterial lethality (Chan et al. 2013). This has elicited much interest among researchers for the cloning of FtsZ from all kinds of bacteria (Thakur and Chakraborti 2006; Kiran et al. 2009; Modia et al. 2014); however, there is little known about its enzymatic characteristics.|$|E
40|$|In the {{presence}} of partially purified pseudorabies virus immediate-early protein, multiple sites of DNase I protection were observed on the adenovirus major late and human hsp 70 promoters. Southwestern (DNA-protein blot) analysis demonstrated that the immediate-early protein bound directly to the sequences contained in these sites. These sequences share only limited homology, differ in their affinities for the immediate-early protein, and are located at different positions on these two promoters. In addition, the site-specific binding of a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> immediate-early <b>protein</b> was eliminated by the same heat treatment which eliminates its transcriptional activating function, whereas the binding of the wild-type protein was unaffected by heat treatment. Thus, site-specific binding requires a functionally active immediate-early protein. Furthermore, immediate-early-protein-dependent in vitro transcription from the major late promoter was preferentially inhibited by oligonucleotides which are homologous to the high-affinity binding sites on the major late or hsp 70 promoters. These observations suggest that transcriptional stimulation by the immediate-early protein involves binding to cis-acting elements...|$|R
40|$|HeLa and 293 {{cell lines}} that express biologically active {{adenovirus}} type 5 precursor terminal protein (pTP) have been made. The amount of pTP synthesized in these cell lines ranges from barely detectable to {{greater than that}} observed in cells infected with the wild-type virus.

A higher percentage of the stably transfected 293 cell lines expressed terminal protein, and generally at considerably higher levels, than did the HeLa cell lines. While 293 cells appeared to tolerate pTP better than did HeLa cells, high-level pTP expression in 293 cells led to a significantly reduced growth rate. The 293 -pTP cell lines produce infectious virus after transfection with purified viral DNA and form plaques when overlaid with Noble agar after infection at low multiplicity. These cell lines offer promise for the production of adenoviruses lacking pTP expression and therefore completely defective for replication...|$|R

It is suggested that reversible tempera-ture-dependent conformational changes in Ni 2519 TP are responsible for these phenomena nd that pro-duction of a TP which is only partially functional in transgenic plants confers on these plants a resistance to the virus owing to reduction of the level of cell-to-cell transport.

At 46 C, {{they did not}} lose heat resistance, dipicolinic acid, or absorbance, indicating that the temperature-sensitive blocks are {{very early in the}} sequence of initiation reactions. Strain JV- 9 was temperature sensitive for initiation by glucose alone, and strain JV- 10 was temperature sensitive for initiation by glucose, L-leucine, L-proline, KBr, or calcium dipicolinate. The kinetics of initiation were followed after two kinds of temperature change (shift-up and shift-down) experiments. Mutant spores incubated for different times at 46 C and then shifted down to 30 C showed no significant differences in the rates of absorbance decrease, i. e., no stimulation or inhibition. Conversely, when mutant spores were incubated for different times at 30 C, a fraction of the population initiated germination, and after shift-up to 46 C an additional fraction continued initiation while a third fraction stopped. This latter fraction did initiate germination when the temperature was lowered to 30 C. The kinetics of initiation after shift-up and shift-down in temperature suggest that the early events in initiation reagents, whereas the other four initiated sensitivity for all of the above initiation reagents, whereas the other four initiated very poorly.

40|$|These {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} {{in an attempt}} to determine the nature of the defect in a temperature-sensitive yeast cell division cycle (cdc) mutant, cdc 7. 4, which defines an essential step immediately prior to DNA synthesis. The in vivo characterisation of this mutant was extended. A yeast mating pheromone, α-factor, was purified and used for cell -synchronization purposes. Functional CDC 7 gene product was found to be necessary for nuclear and 2 μn plasmid DNA replication, but not for mitochondrial DITA replication, which was unaffected by α-factor. RNA, protein, phospholipid and phosphoprotein syntheses were shown to be unaffected by the mutation. The in vivo characterisation work suggested that the cdc 7. 4 mutation was due to a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>protein.</b> One- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to detect mutationally altered proteins. An abnormal protein present in the original cdc 7. 4 strain was shown to be unrelated to the lesion in DNA synthesis by a genetic analysis. A second temperature-sensitive defect was also discovered in this strain. An extensively characterised nuclear fraction was analysed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and another abnormal band pattern was observed. Various attempts were made to construct in vitro DNA synthesising systems. Controlled lysis of spheroplasts and the fusion of protein-filled liposomes with cdc 7. 4 spheroplasts were both nominally successful, but were considered unpractical. Reconstitution of a system from purified components was undertaken. A hybrid plasmid (pJDB 219) containing yeast 2 μn DNA sequences was used as the substrate. Several proteins implicated in DNA replication in other systems were partially purified, including DNA, polymerases, RNA polymerases, single-stranded DNA binding protein and DNA topoisomerase.

40|$|The {{maturation}} of pseudorabies virus DNA {{from the}} replicative concatemeric form to molecules of genome length was examined using nine DNA+ temperature-sensitive mutants of pseudorabies virus, each {{belonging to a}} different complementation group. At the nonpermissive temperature, cells infected {{with each of the}} mutants synthesized concatemeric DNA. Cleavage of the concatemeric DNA to genome-length viral DNA was defective in all the DNA+ ts mutants tested, indicating that several viral gene products are involved in the DNA maturation process. In none of the ts mutant-infected cells were capsids with electron-dense cores (containing DNA) formed. Empty capsids with electron-translucent cores were, however, formed in cells infected with six of the nine temperature-sensitive mutants; in cells infected with three of the mutants, no capsid assembly occurred. Because these three mutants are deficient both in maturation of DNA and in the assembly of viral capsids, we conclude that maturation of viral DNA is dependent upon the assembly of capsids. In cells infected with two of the mutants (tsN and tsIE 13), normal maturation of viral DNA occurred after shiftdown of the cells to the permissive temperature in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>proteins</b> involved in DNA maturation became functional after shiftdown. Furthermore, because cycloheximide reduces maturation of DNA in wild-type-infected cells but not in cells infected with these two mutants, we conclude that a protein(s) necessary for the maturation of concatemeric DNA, which is present in limiting amounts during the normal course of infection, accumulated in the mutant-infected cells at the nonpermissive temperature. Concomitant with cleavage of concatemeric DNA, full capsids with electron-dense cores appeared after shiftdown of tsN-infected cells to the permissive temperature, indicating {{that there may be a}} correlation between maturation of DNA and formation of full capsids. The number of empty and full capsids (containing electron-dense cores) present in tsN-infected cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, as well as after shiftdown to the permissive temperature in the presence of cycloheximide, was determined by electron microscopy and by sedimentation analysis in sucrose gradients. After shiftdown to the permissive temperature in the presence of cycloheximide, the number of empty capsids present in tsN-infected cells decreased with a concomitant accumulation of full capsids, indicating that empty capsids are precursors to full capsids...|$|R

Plants were infected with SHMV or Ni l l 8 and, 5 days after superinoculation with RCMV B component, protoplasts were isolated from the infected leaves and inoculated with RCMV M component. About 30 % of such protoplasts multiplied RCMV (identified by immunofluorescence microscopy) whereas only 3 to 5 % of protoplasts from similarly treated plants not initially infected with SHMV or Nil 18 multiplied RCMV. Thus B-RNA spread from mixedly infected (SHMV + B-RNA or Nil 18 + B-RNA) cells {{in the absence of}} M-RNA to the neighbouring cells. RCMV B-RNA spread in leaves infected with the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> coat <b>protein</b> TMV mutant Nil 18 and grown at non-permissive temperature. Thus TMV coat protein is not involved in enabling RCMV RNA to be transported...|$|R
40|$|In an assay {{measuring}} virus-directed RNA synthesis, {{infection of}} BHK cells by a standard test dose of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was inhibited by ultraviolet light-irradiated wt VSV and by is 045, {{one of a}} number of thermolabile, <b>temperature-sensitive</b> G <b>protein</b> mutants of VSV. After heat treatment for 1 h at 45 ° C, the thermolabile mutants were no longer able to inhibit the VSV infection. contrast, the thermolabile M protein mutant is G 31 and the nonthermolabile G protein mutant is 044 could still inhibit the test VSV dose. Thus,the presence of G protein in its native conformation was necessary for inhibition of infection. There was little difference in the binding to cells or the internalization to a trypsinresistant state of is 045 or wt VSV before and after heat treatment, and there was no evidence of specific saturable receptors on the cell surface. None of the irradiated virions at concentrations that gave maximal inhibition of infection could prevent binding of infectious VSV to, or internalization by, BHK cells. Th...|$|R
40|$|Using an intragenic {{complementation}} screen, {{we have identified}} a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> TATA-binding <b>protein</b> (TBP) mutant (K 151 L,K 156 Y) that is defective for interaction with certain yeast TBP-associated factors (TAFs) at the restrictive temperature. The K 151 L,K 156 Y mutant appears to be functional for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and Pol III transcription, and {{it is capable of}} supporting Gal 4 -activated and Gcn 4 -activated transcription by Pol II. However, transcription from certain TATA-containing and TATA-less Pol II promoters is reduced at the restrictive temperature. Immunoprecipitation analysis of extracts prepared after culturing cells at the restrictive temperature for 1 h indicates that the K 151 L,K 156 Y derivative is severely compromised in its ability to interact with TAF 130, TAF 90, TAF 68 / 61, and TAF 25 while remaining functional for interaction with TAF 60 and TAF 30. Thus, a TBP mutant that is compromised in its ability to form TFIID can support the response to Gcn 4 but is defective for transcription from specific promoters in vivo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEscherichia coli RNase P is a {{ribonucleoprotein}} {{composed of}} a large RNA subunit (M 1 RNA) and a small protein subunit (C 5 protein). We examined if C 5 protein {{plays a role in}} maintaining metabolic stability of M 1 RNA. The sequestration of C 5 protein available for M 1 RNA binding reduced M 1 RNA stability in vivo, and its reduced stability was recovered via overexpression of C 5 protein. In addition, M 1 RNA was rapidly degraded in a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> C 5 <b>protein</b> mutant strain at non-permissive temperatures. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the C 5 protein metabolically stabilizes M 1 RNA in the cell...|$|R

The polypeptide p 36 CDC 28 is a phosphoprotein of apparent Mr 36, 000. Immune complexes prepared from yeast cell lysates by using anti-CDC 28 antibody were found to possess a protein kinase activity, {{as determined by the}} transfer of label from [gamma- 32 P]ATP to a coprecipitated Mr 40, 000 protein of unknown identity or function (p 40).

40|$|The MSN 2 gene was {{selected}} as a multicopy suppressor in a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> SNF 1 <b>protein</b> kinase mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MSN 2 encodes a Cys 2 His 2 zinc finger protein related to the yeast MIG 1 repressor and to mammalian early growth response and Wilms' tumor zinc finger proteins. Deletion of MSN 2 caused no phenotype. A second similar zinc finger gene, MSN 4, was isolated, and deletion of both genes caused phenotypic defects related to carbon utilization. Overexpression of the zinc finger regions was deleterious to growth. LexA-MSN 2 and LexA-MSN 4 fusion proteins functioned as strong transcriptional activators when bound to DNA. Functional roles of this zinc finger protein family are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{studies of}} Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) {{infection}} using virus derivatives expressing functional,dysfunctional, and <b>temperature-sensitive</b> movement <b>protein</b> (MP) mutants {{indicated that the}} cell-to-celltransport of TMV RNA is functionally correlated with the association of MP with microtubules. However, therole of microtubules in the movement process during early infection remains unclear, since MP accumulates onmicrotubules rather late in infection and treatment of plants with microtubule-disrupting agents fails tostrongly interfere with cell-to-cell movement of TMV RNA. To further test the role of microtubules in TMV cellto-cell movement, we investigated TMV strain Ni 2519, which is temperature-sensitive for movement. Wedemonstrate that the temperature-sensitive defect in movement is correlated with temperature-sensitivechanges in the localization of MP to microtubules. Furthermore, we show that during early phases of recoveryfrom non-permissive conditions, the MP localizes to microtubule-associated particles. Similar particles arefound in cells at the leading front of spreading TMV infection sites. Initially mobile, the particles becomeimmobile when MP starts to accumulate {{along the length of}} the particle-associated microtubules. Ourobservations confirm a role for microtubules in the spread of TMV infection and associate this role withmicrotubule-associated trafficking of MP-containing particles in cells engaged in the cell-to-cell movement ofthe TMV genome...|$|R
40|$|The spherical {{anatomy of}} human and rat liver lobules implies that more central cells have less time {{to carry out their}} {{function}} than more peripherally located cells because blood flows past them more rapidly. This problem could be overcome if more centrilobular cells could operate at higher temperatures than periportal cells. This study presents evidence for such a temperature gradient. Firstly, we use mathematical modelling to demonstrate that temperature increases towards the centre of the lobule. Secondly, we examine the distribution of a heat-generating protein and of a heat-sensitive protein across the rat and human liver lobules. Double-antibody staining of healthy liver from rat and human was used for visual scoring and for automated histomorphometric quantitation of the localisation of uncoupling protein- 2 (known to generate heat) and of the transient receptor potential-v 4 protein (known as a highly <b>temperature-sensitive</b> membrane <b>protein).</b> Both these proteins were found to be located predominantly in the centrilobular region of liver lobules. These findings support the suggestion that temperature gradients across the liver lobule may have evolved as {{a solution to the problem}} of reduced contact time between blood and cells at the centre as compared to the periphery of mammalian liver lobules...|$|R
