5|$|After being underfed {{and forced}} into long, grueling marches through rough terrain {{for nearly two}} months, the Batetela in Dhanis' column mutinied against their {{officers}} in February 1897. The mutiny {{broke out in the}} advance guard, which had been pushed the hardest of those in the expedition, but soon spread to the main army, where the massively outnumbered Belgian officers were detained by their men and killed. Dhanis himself escaped the massacre by hiding in the forest, although his brother did not manage to survive. The now disbanded army went on to rampage throughout the immediate area, terrorizing the northern Congo and causing great consternation among the Belgian officials whose jobs it was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lewis MacKenzie, in 1992, {{served in}} the Sarajevo {{division}} of United Nations Protection Force which was mandated <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> in Croatia. Off describes MacKenzie as being indifferent as hostilities began in Sarajevo because his mandate did not include intervention in Bosnian affairs. MacKenzie's distrust of all participants in the hostilities grew following a botched prisoner exchange, the Breadline Massacre, and broken ceasefire arrangements. MacKenzie helped negotiate UN control of the Sarajevo International Airport which allowed humanitarian shipments. MacKenzie gave many media interviews but Off criticizes him for portraying both the Serbs and the Bosnians as aggressors and recommending against intervention.|$|E
5|$|The Huns {{destroyed}} Drobeta and Sucidava in the 440s, but the forts were restored under Emperor Justinian I (527565). Eastern Roman coins {{from the}} first half of the 6thcentury suggest a significant military presence in Olteniaa region also characterized by the predominance of pottery with shapes of Roman tradition. Although Eastern Roman emperors made annual payments to the neighboring peoples in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> in the Balkans, the Avars regularly invaded Scythia Minor from the 580s.

Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E

5|$|As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony {{maintained}} {{a distance from}} politics throughout {{the reign of the}} new monarch, RadamaII, instead preferring to focus on his military responsibilities. Meanwhile, disputes between Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and King Radama grew frequent as the young sovereign pursued radical reforms that had begun to foment displeasure among the traditional masses. The situation came to a head on 7 May 1863, when Radama insisted on legalizing duels, despite widespread concern among the king's advisers that the innovation would lead to anarchy. The Prime Minister initiated the arrest of the menamaso, the prince's influential advisers, while Rainilaiarivony enacted his brother's instructions <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> in the capital city. However, the situation deteriorated in dramatic fashion and, by the morning of 12 May, King RadamaII was declared dead, having been strangled on the Prime Minister's orders.|$|E

He takes her to a wedding as his guest, but Pushpa arrives, introducing herself and exposing Dan's lie. Shirley then breaks up with him. The Ferreiras help Shirley {{to deal with her}} neighbour from hell, Gavin Sharp (Steve Nicolson), which leads to Shirley and Ash becoming close and starting a secret relationship. Shirley is unhappy that Ash refuses to tell anyone about their relationship, as he knows his father will be furious if he discovers them together. Ash reveals to Shirley that he is a compulsive gambler and he lost his house and ruined his marriage in the process; Dan had bailed him out. He says he owes his father everything and he is not willing to hurt him. Dan attempts to woo Shirley again, forcing her to confess her relationship with Ash. This causes friction between the Ferreiras, and Ash breaks up with Shirley <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace.</b> In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E

5|$|On January 1, 1830, Bowie left Louisiana for {{permanent}} residency in Texas. He stopped at Nacogdoches, at Jared E. Groce's farm on the Brazos River, and in San Felipe, where Bowie presented {{a letter of}} introduction to Stephen F. Austin from ThomasF. McKinney, one of the Old Three Hundred colonists. On February 20, Bowie took an oath of allegiance to Mexico and then proceeded to San Antonio de Bexar. At the time, the city was known as Bexar and had a population of 2500, mostly of Mexican descent, and Bowie's fluency in Spanish helped him establish himself in the area. Bowie was elected a commander, with the rank of colonel, of the Texas Rangers later that year. Although the Rangers would not be organized officially until 1835, StephenF. Austin had founded the group by employing 30men <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> and protect the colonists from attacks by hostile Indians. Other areas assembled similar volunteer militias, and Bowie commanded a group of the volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Tensions in Johnson County {{remained}} high. On May 10, a Marshal named George Wellman, who {{had been}} appointed deputy U.S. Marshal by Marshall Rankin, was ambushed and killed by locals {{en route to the}} small community of Buffalo. The incident received national attention, with Wellman being the only Marshal to die in the war. His death was grieved by a large crowd, and his funeral service took place in St. Lukes Church, Buffalo. The 6th Cavalry who was sent to relieve the county of its violence, was said to be influenced by intense local political and social pressure, and they were unable <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace.</b> In one incident, a group of men set fire to the Post exchange and planted a homemade bomb in the cavalry's barracks. Noted officer Charles B. Gatewood was seriously injured by the bomb blast in the barracks; shattering his left arm and disabling him from serving in the Cavalry anymore.|$|E
5|$|Despite Isabeau's efforts <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace,</b> the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War {{broke out}} in 1411. John gained the upper hand during the first year, but the Dauphin began to build a power base; Christine de Pizan wrote of {{him that he was}} the savior of France. Still only 15, he lacked the power or backing to defeat John, who fomented revolt in Paris. In {{retaliation}} against John the Fearless' actions, Charles of Orléans denied funds from the royal treasury to all members of the royal family. In 1414, instead of allowing her son, then 17, to lead, Isabeau allied herself with Charles of Orléans. The Dauphin, in return, changed allegiance and joined John, which Isabeau considered unwise and dangerous. The result was continued civil war in Paris. Parisian commoners joined forces with John the Fearless in the Cabochien Revolt, and {{at the height of the}} revolt a group of butchers entered Isabeau's home in search of traitors, arresting and taking away up to 15 of her ladies-in-waiting. In his chronicles Pintoin wrote that Isabeau was firmly allied with the Orléanists and the 60,000 Armagnacs who invaded Paris and Picardy.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Neville {{was from}} the branch of the Neville family based at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire, rather than that of Westmorland. It has been claimed that he, as a 'landless younger son' was {{partially}} to blame for his family's long-running feud with the Lancastrian Percy family of Northumberland. The first outburst of violence that took place {{was a result of}} the 1 May 1453 royal licence for John Neville's brother, Thomas Neville to marry Maud Stanhope being issued. News of this must have reached the north within the fortnight, for by the twelfth, one of the Earl of Northumberland's younger sons, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, began recruiting men. In August 1453, John Neville raided the Percy castle of Topcliffe, possibly with the intention of seizing Egremont. Failing to find him, Neville resorted to threatening the Percy tenantry who were in residence. He and Egremont were subsequently summoned to appear before the Royal Council, a summons which was ignored by both. Feuding continued through summer 1453, and even though they had been instructed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace,</b> by the 27 July, the council was issuing letters to Northumberland and Salisbury regarding their sons. This was followed by more letters to the sons. In Knaresborough, the locals generally aligned themselves with John Neville due to the unpopularity of Sir William Plumpton (the king's man), from whom they began stealing with impunity, which resulted in severe injuries when the Neville brothers demonstrated a 'show of force' in January 1454.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh {{used their}} {{personal}} wealth to fund expeditions each summer, then spent the winter publishing their discoveries. Small armies of fossil hunters in mule-drawn wagons or on trains were soon sending literally tons of fossils back east. The paleontological digs lasted fifteen years, from 1877 to 1892. The workers for both Cope and Marsh suffered hardships {{related to the}} weather, as well as sabotage and obstruction by the other scientist's workers. Reed was locked out of the Como train station by Carlin, {{and was forced to}} haul the bones down the bluff and crate the specimens on the train platform in the bitter cold. Cope directed Carlin to set up his own quarry in Como Bluff, while Marsh sent Reed to spy on his former friend. As Reed's Quarry #4 dried up, Marsh ordered Reed to clear out the bone fragments from the other quarries. Reed reported he had destroyed all the remaining bones to keep them away from Cope. Concerned that strangers were encroaching on Reed's quarries, Marsh sent Lakes to Como to assist in excavations, and in June 1879 visited Como himself. Cope likewise toured his own quarries in August. Although Marsh's men continued to open new quarries and discover more fossils, relations between Lakes and Reed soured, with each offering his resignation in August. Marsh attempted to placate the two by sending each to opposite ends of the quarries, but after being forced to abandon one bone quarry in a freezing blizzard, Lakes submitted his resignation and returned to teaching in 1880. The departure of Lakes did not ease tensions among Marsh's men; Lake's replacement, a railroad man named Kennedy, felt {{he did not have to}} report to Reed, and the fighting between the two caused Marsh's other workers to quit. Marsh tried separating Kennedy and Reed, and sent Williston's brother Frank to Como in an effort <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace.</b> Frank Williston ended up leaving Marsh's employ and taking up residence with Carlin. Cope's own digging in Como began faltering, and Carlin's replacements soon quit work altogether.|$|E
