We then give algorithms to generate <b>the</b> <b>necklaces</b> and <b>the</b> lexicographic compositions. We compare our algorithms to an exhaustive algoritm for generating <b>the</b> <b>necklaces.</b> We also give an algorithm for generating all necklaces of a specific density...|$|R

5|$|The Brazil Parure {{is one of}} {{the newest}} items of {{jewellery}} in the collection. In 1953, the president and people of Brazil presented Elizabeth II with the coronation gift of a necklace and matching pendant earrings of aquamarines and diamonds.

The Queen had the drop set in a more decorative diamond cluster and it is now detachable. She was so delighted with the gift that in 1957 she had a tiara made to match <b>the</b> <b>necklace.</b> The tiara is surmounted by three vertically set aquamarines.

5|$|A flint dagger was {{discovered}} on the site. This type of artefact {{is rare in}} Greater Manchester; the nearest comparable site is in Saddleworth.
