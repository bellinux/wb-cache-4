The hymn title appears twice on empty pages in the {{autograph}} manuscript of Orgelbüchlein, where Bach listed the planned chorale preludes for the collection: the 111th entry on page 127 was to be the hymn of Altenburg; and the 112th entry on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>page</b> was for Rodigast's hymn.|$|E
500|$|Freedom and responsibility, {{individuality}} and society, {{and love and}} death are among the binaries the symbolic work abounds in. [...] Cartoonist Art Spiegelman comments that Ward had mastered a fluid rhythm of pacing with his third book, achieveing a flow that minimized {{the need for the}} reader to spend time deciphering images before moving to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>page,</b> while encouraging multiple readings and interpretations. [...] At the same time, Spiegelman writes, the images reward a closer look on rereading.|$|E

[...] This {{seems to have been}} done hastily, as most left offset marks on the opposite pages from the book being closed before the ink was dry. [...] This seems to indicate that the book was used at least once as the gospel book for a Mass for the Dead, perhaps on the occasion of Cuthbert's elevation in 698. [...] In the example illustrated at left, the start of the reading at line 10 is marked with a cross, and de mortuorum ("for the dead") written beside.

Thomas Fensch also notes the rollicking rhythm of the verse in Mulberry Street and Geisel's other books, writing, [...] "Children can read the lines; they can sing the lines; they can SHOUT! the lines; they can dance to the lines." [...] Fensch marks Mulberry Street as the start of what he calls [...] "escalating sequences or escalating action", a technique Geisel used in most of his books, in which the action builds with each page.

500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>page.</b> I bet they put him in someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't put something in me, I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E
500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If {{there is}} no place for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly speaks to a child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>page</b> before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Atypical of most daily newspapers, {{the paper}} does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition {{serves as the}} weekend edition (although USA Today has {{published}} special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past, the first being published on January 19, 1991, when it released a Saturday [...] "Extra" [...] edition updating coverage of the Gulf War from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions {{for the first time}} on July 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of Atlanta and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the Summer Olympics). USA Today prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>page</b> of that section). On certain days, the news or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.|$|E

2500|$|Wildwood is more soft fantasy than hard fantasy, in that {{historical}} and technological consistency and plausibility {{are not a}} high priority, giving the book a whimsical, or stream of consciousness, tone.

No attempt was made to maintain a consistent level of technological advancement or to rationalize why a particular piece of equipment was used; rather, Meloy said, they could [...] "pick coolest version of whatever piece of technology" [...] they wanted, and Ellis said they [...] "just picked whatever we liked."
