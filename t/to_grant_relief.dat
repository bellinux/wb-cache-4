500|$|The {{reasonable}} doubt standard is primarily effectuated by jury instructions, but it retains its relevance when {{the trial judge}} considers a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and when an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence. On federal habeas review of a state conviction for sufficiency of the evidence, <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>relief,</b> the reviewing court must find that [...] "upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a {{reasonable doubt}}." [...] In a successive, abusive, or defaulted federal habeas review of a state conviction, a defendant claiming [...] "actual innocence" [...] must show that [...] "it is {{more likely than not}} that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." ...|$|E
500|$|The Human Rights Act 1998, {{which came}} into force in 2000, brought the European Convention on Human Rights into British {{domestic}} law. Article 8 {{of the convention}} covers [...] "the right to respect for private and family life", and during {{the passage of the}} Act through Parliament, elements of the press were concerned that this could affect their freedom of expression. As such, Section 12 of the Act provides that, if a court is considering whether <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>relief</b> which infringes on the right to freedom of expression (such as an injunction), it must [...] "have particular regard to the importance of the Convention right to freedom of expression", although recognising the other limits put on this right. Where a relief (such as an injunction) is granted {{in the absence of the}} respondent, the court must be satisfied that the claimant has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the defendant was notified, unless there are compelling reasons why they should not be. The court must also not grant relief that would restrict publication before trial, unless satisfied that it is [...] "more likely than not" [...] that the trial will establish that publication should not be allowed.|$|E

The exception is that the writ can reach certain constitutionally significant errors like jurisdictional defects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{state of}} New South Wales is {{particularly}} {{well known for}} {{the strength of its}} Equity jurisprudence. However, it was only in 1972 with the introduction of reform to the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) that empowered both the Equity and Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>relief</b> in either equity or common law. In 1972 NSW also adopted one of the essential sections of the Judicature reforms, which emphasised that where there was a conflict between the common law and equity, equity would always prevail.

60|$|Now, {{what the}} Newspaper Press Fund proposes {{to do with}} its money is <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>relief</b> to members in want or distress, and to the widows, families, parents, or other near {{relatives}} of deceased members in right of a moderate provident annual subscription--commutable, I observe, for a moderate provident life subscription--and its members comprise the whole paid class of literary contributors to the press of the United Kingdom, and every class of reporters. The number of its members at this time last year was something below 100. At the present time it is somewhat above 170, not including 30 members of the press who are regular subscribers, but have not as yet qualified as regular members. This number is steadily on the increase, not only as regards the metropolitan press, but also as regards the provincial throughout the country. I have observed within these few days that many members of the press at Manchester have lately at a meeting expressed a strong brotherly interest in this Institution, and a great desire to extend its operations, and to strengthen its hands, provided that something in the independent nature of life assurance and the purchase of deferred annuities could be introduced into its details, and always assuming that in it the metropolis and the provinces stand on perfectly equal ground. This appears {{to me to be a}} demand so very moderate, that I can hardly have a doubt of a response on the part of the managers, or of the beneficial and harmonious results. It only remains to add, on this head of desert, the agreeable circumstance that out of all the money collected in aid of the society during the last year more than one-third came exclusively from the press.|$|E
