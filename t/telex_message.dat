When Nazi Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945, Baba was able to broadcast in Japanese, after seeing the incoming <b>telex</b> <b>message.</b> This was the first voiced information to the world, with translations for other languages taking 30 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|By 1984 {{the basic}} Mailbox service had been {{extended}} to give automatic access to the Telex service {{which at the time}} was still relatively common in business and was the standard way to reach remoter parts of the globe. Using a special Telex Link page, the message was composed in the usual way and then the destination country chosen and the Telex number entered before sending just like a standard message. Telex Link added the necessary Telex codes as required and tried to send the message as many times as required before positively confirming receipt by means of a special Mailbox message. Telexes could be sent to Prestel Mailbox users from a standard Telex terminal by using Telex Link number and inserting [...] "MBX" [...] and the relevant mailbox number as the first line of the <b>telex</b> <b>message</b> itself. The incoming <b>telex</b> <b>message</b> appeared to the Prestel recipient just as an ordinary Mailbox message but with the telex number inserted {{at the top of the}} frame.|$|E
50|$|The General Directorate for Technical Operations was a {{key part}} of the Securitate.

50|$|The Janata Party {{being the}} {{majority}} party in the Karnataka State Legislature had formed Government {{under the leadership of}} S.R. Bommai. In September 1988, the Janata Party and Lok Dal merged into a new party called Janata Dal. The Ministry was expanded with addition of 13 members. Within two days thereafter, K.R. Molakery, a legislator of Janata Dal defected from the party. He presented a letter to the Governor along with 19 letters, allegedly signed by legislators supporting the Ministry, withdrawing their support. As a result, on 19 April, the Governor sent a report to the President stating therein there were dissensions and defections in the ruling party. He further stated that in view of the withdrawal of the support by the said legislators, the chief Minister, Bommai did not command a majority in the Assembly and, hence, it was inappropriate under the Constitution, to have the State administered by an Executive consisting of Council of Ministers which did not command the majority in the state assembly. He, therefore, recommended to the President that he should exercise power under Article 356(1). However, on the next day seven out of the nineteen legislators who had allegedly written the said letters to the Governor sent letters to him complaining that their signatures were obtained on the earlier letters by misrepresentation and affirmed their support to the Ministry. The Chief Minister and his Law Minister met the Governor the same day and informed him about the decision to summon the Assembly, even by bringing forward the scheduled session, to prove the confidence of assembly in his Ministry. To the same effect, he sent a <b>telex</b> <b>message</b> to the President. The Governor however sent yet another report to the President on the same day i.e., 20-4-1989, and stated that the Chief Minister had lost the confidence of the majority in the House and repeated his earlier request for action under Article 356(1). On that very day, the President issued the Proclamation in question with the recitals already referred to above. The Proclamation was, thereafter approved by the Parliament as required by Article 356(3).|$|E

Groom retired in January 1978, selling the newspaper.|$|R
50|$|ARQ-M, {{short for}} Automatic Repeat reQuest, Multiplex, is a radio {{telegraphy}} protocol used to reliably forward <b>telex</b> <b>messages</b> over partially reliable radio links. It is a low-speed {{system designed to}} match the performance of landline telex systems and allow those messages to be forwarded over long distances using shortwave radios. The first ARQ-M link {{was built in the}} Netherlands, and began exchanging messages with a counterpart in New York in 1947.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Telex</b> <b>messages</b> are routed by {{addressing}} {{them to a}} telex address, e.g., [...] "14910 ERIC S", where 14910 is the subscriber number, ERIC is an abbreviation for the subscriber's name (in this case Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson in Sweden) and S is the country code. Solutions also exist for the automatic routing of <b>messages</b> to different <b>telex</b> terminals within a subscriber organization, by using different terminal identities, e.g., [...] "+T148".|$|R
50|$|The telex system, which {{developed}} {{out of the}} telegraph system, is based on defined electric current levels that are interpreted as a mark or space signal. These are normally sent over well-defined networks with considerable infrastructure that keeps error rates very low. In contrast, radio communications are subject {{to a wide variety}} of noises and other signal problems that leads to losses. To forward <b>telex</b> <b>messages</b> successfully over radio links, some form of error correction should be applied.|$|R
500|$|When Hubbard {{established}} the Sea Org he publicly {{declared that he}} had relinquished his management responsibilities. According to Miller, this was not true. He received daily <b>telex</b> <b>messages</b> from Scientology organizations around the world reporting their statistics and income.

Among the alleged fatalities of the 15 April retaliatory attack by the United States was Gaddafi's adopted daughter, Hannah.|$|R
50|$|The aim of AIXM is {{to allow}} for the {{management}} and distribution of AIS data in a digital format. This includes information such as airport area data, airspace structures, organisations and units, points and navaids, procedures, routes and flying restrictions. Current versions are also designed to be able to manage and distribute the full timeline of aeronautical data, including temporary updates. These features form {{a key part of the}} EUROCONTROL backed move from AIS to Aeronautical Information Management (AIM), the transition from using data based on paper documentation and <b>telex</b> <b>messages</b> to using solely digital data.|$|R
50|$|One use of telex circuits, in use {{until the}} widescale {{adoption}} of X.400 and Internet email, was {{to facilitate a}} message handling system, allowing local email systems to exchange messages with other email and telex systems via a central routing operation, or switch. One of the largest such switches was operated by Royal Dutch Shell as recently as 1994, permitting the exchange of messages between a number of IBM Officevision, Digital Equipment Corporation ALL-IN-1 and Microsoft Mail systems. In addition to permitting email {{to be sent to}} telex, formal coding conventions adopted in the composition of <b>telex</b> <b>messages</b> enabled automatic routing of telexes to email recipients.|$|R
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was capable}} of transmitting voice, data, facsimile and <b>telex</b> <b>messages</b> to and from ships at sea through special shore stations at Southbury, Connecticut and Saint Paul, CA, which were interconnected with existing domestic terrestrial networks. The system was initially utilized primarily by the U.S. Navy, with {{a limited amount of}} satellite capacity provided in different frequency bands (L band), through separate satellite transponders, for maritime communications services to commercial entities and other interested users. At such time as the Navy's requirements terminate (late 1970s) susstantial satellite capacity will become available for commercial maritime purposes. Following launch, satellite operation was nominal. It was placed in geosynchronous orbit at 15 degrees west and using propulsion FW-5.|$|R
50|$|Telex {{provided}} the first common medium for international record communications using standard signalling techniques and operating criteria as {{specified by the}} International Telecommunication Union. Customers on any telex exchange could deliver messages to any other, around the world. To lower line usage, <b>telex</b> <b>messages</b> were normally first encoded onto paper tape and then read into the line as quickly as possible. The system normally delivered information at 50 baud or approximately 66 words per minute encoded using the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2. In the late days of the telex networks, end-user equipment was often replaced by modems and phone lines as well, reducing the telex network to what was effectively a directory service running on the phone network.|$|R

50|$|The SMS {{concept was}} {{developed}} in the Franco-German GSM cooperation in 1984 by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert. The GSM is optimized for telephony, since this was identified as its main application. The key idea for SMS was to use this telephone-optimized system, and to transport messages on the signalling paths needed to control the telephone traffic during periods when no signalling traffic existed. In this way, unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost. However, it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to 128 bytes (later improved to 160 seven-bit characters) so that the messages could fit into the existing signalling formats. Based on his personal observations and on analysis of the typical lengths of postcard and <b>Telex</b> <b>messages,</b> Hillebrand argued that 160 characters was sufficient to express most messages succinctly.|$|R
50|$|Stofor {{was aimed}} {{squarely}} {{at the bottom}} end {{of the market and}} its competitors were from companies such as Chernikeeff (now John Lilley and Gillie Ltd) and Racal but Stofor was soon outselling both with ease. The Stofor range was based on a 4 MHz Zilog Z80 processor with 64K RAM and provided from 4 to 64 ports. Early models, and some later ones, were floppy disk based but later and larger versions had 10Mb Winchester technology hard disks for storage. Stofor was the only message switching system of its size to boast a custom text editor designed by Fenwood with the needs of the telex user in mind. Its main workload was in the sending and receiving of <b>telex</b> <b>messages</b> but it was also put to work {{in a wide range of}} other communications areas including fax.|$|R
2500|$|In aviation, ACARS ( [...] ; {{an acronym}} for {{aircraft}} communications addressing and reporting system) is a digital datalink system for transmission of short messages between aircraft and ground stations via airband radio or satellite.
