This caused the Syrian Crisis of 1957 after which Syrians intensified their efforts to unite with Egypt. [...] Nasser told a Syrian delegation, including President Shukri al-Quwatli and Prime Minister Khaled al-Azem, {{that they needed to}} rid their government of communists, but the delegation countered and warned him that only <b>total</b> <b>union</b> with Egypt would end the [...] "communist threat". According to Abdel Latif Boghdadi, Nasser initially resisted a <b>total</b> <b>union</b> with Syria, favoring instead a federal union. However, Nasser was [...] "more afraid of a Communist takeover" [...] and agreed on a total merger. The increasing strength of the Syrian Communist Party, under the leadership of Khalid Bakdash, worried the Syrian Ba'ath Party, which was suffering from an internal crisis from which prominent members were anxious to find an escape. Syria had had a democratic government since the overthrow of Adib al-Shishakli's military regime in 1954, and popular pressure for Arab unity was reflected in the composition of parliament.|$|R
