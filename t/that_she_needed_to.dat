5|$|After the World Cup, Taylor was disheartened by {{both her}} own, and England's, lack of success. She bemoaned that the sacrifices {{she had made}} had come to nothing, and after talking to psychologists, she {{realised}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking condenser. Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain with the ship in the event <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be towed. Despite the problematic turbine, Cöln managed to steam into port, the last ship in the German line.|$|E
5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E

25|$|Wollaston {{was educated}} at {{a mixture of}} service and {{civilian}} primary schools, later attending a girls' grammar school in Watford where she was Head Girl in 1979-1980. While at secondary school, Wollaston took {{on a range of}} part-time jobs, including a Saturday job at her local branch of John Lewis. She left sixth form with high grades in science subjects at A-level <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> study Medicine at university.|$|E
25|$|Cassatt {{saw that}} works by female artists were often {{dismissed}} with contempt unless {{the artist had}} a friend or protector on the jury, {{and she would not}} flirt with jurors to curry favor. Her cynicism grew when one of the two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.|$|E

25|$|His own {{far left}} inclinations were by then {{contrasting}} with his civil service positions, which he maintained {{even as his}} daughter Ecaterina was becoming a persona non grata. In 1923, Arbore published a new installment of his memoirs, as În temnițele rusești ("In the Russian Dungeons"). In March 1924, he replaced Vasile Ghenzul as editorial director of Furnica ("The Ant"). The cooperativist and agrarian bimonthly was published in Bessarabia, and printed a Russian-language supplement. He was still {{a contributor to the}} central leftist press: in December 1926, Adevărul published his piece about the Serbian politician Nikola Pašić, defunct leader of the People's Radical Party. During this interval, Ecaterina tried to return to Romania. According to one interpretation, she was trying to hide her growing disillusionment with communism under the pretext <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> take care of her ailing father. The Romanian authorities did not allow her entry into the country, and she was forced back. Zamfir and his wife had earlier adopted Dumitru's young child, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ritual {{practices}} and beliefs {{are associated with}} birth among the Tanala. In the past, after delivery of a baby the mother would wash {{her hands in the}} blood of a freshly sacrificed chicken, bathe herself in hot water, and then rest upright beside a fire to make her sweat out impurities. The period <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> stay beside the fire varied; noblewomen might stay beside the fire for as long as several months, but more commonly the duration was eight days. Immediately after this period beside the fire was concluded, a party was held, which the mother had to attend regardless of her condition; the event was marked by the slaughter of zebu. Immediately after birth, the baby would be bathed in cold water, and a sorcerer would declare certain days to be lifelong fady (taboo days); if a baby was born on a day that was fady for both the mother and father, the child would be abandoned to die. In addition, there are eight fady days per month for all Tanala, and historically if a child was born on one of these days, it would be drowned by holding its head in a water-filled winnowing pan.|$|E
500|$|... "Like a Prayer" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Madonna, {{from her}} fourth studio album of the same name. Sire Records {{released}} it as the album's lead single on March 3, 1989. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the track denoted a more artistic and personal approach to songwriting for Madonna, who believed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> cater more to her adult audience. The song is about a passionate young girl in love with God, who becomes the only male figure in her life.|$|E

The statement sparked controversy, following which Aram Mp3 apologised and added that what he said {{was meant to be a}} joke. Wurst accepted the apology, by stating, [...] "I have to say that if it's a joke it's not funny... but he apologised and that's fine for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} establishing Ellie's physical appearance was [...] "critical". They felt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> appear {{young enough to}} make her relationship with Joel—who is in his 40s—believable, but old enough to be credible as a resourceful teenager capable of surviving. A redesign of Ellie's physical appearance was publicized in May 2012; Druckmann stated that the change was to make her look more like Johnson. Prior to the redesign, comparisons were made between Ellie and actress Ellen Page; in June 2013, Page accused Naughty Dog of [...] "ripping off [...] likeness". The team felt that Ellie was important for the game's marketing; Druckmann said that, when asked to move the image of Ellie {{from the front of the}} game's packaging to the back, [...] "everyone at Naughty Dog just flat-out refused".|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Feng Jianmei, {{who was a}} 22-year-old {{woman from}} the small village of Yuping in Zeng Jia Township, Shaanxi province, became {{pregnant}} with her second child.

[...] After listening to the advice of relatives, Feng and her husband, Deng Jiyuan, had believed they would be allowed to have a second child since they had waited five years between children and lived in a rural area. [...] According to Zhenping County officials, authorities had contacted Feng in March 2012 and told her <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> obtain documentation, including a new household registration (referred to as hukou), in order to file an application to have the child.

500|$|Marjory {{left for}} college in 1908, despite having grave misgivings about her mother's mental state. Her aunt and {{grandmother}} shared her concerns, but recognized <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> leave {{in order to}} begin her own life. She was a straight-A student at Wellesley College, graduating with a BA in English in 1912. She found particular gifts in a class on elocution, and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates. She was elected as [...] "Class Orator" [...] at Wellesley, {{but was unable to}} fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities. During her senior year while visiting home, her mother showed her a lump on her breast. Marjory arranged the surgery to have it removed. After the graduation ceremony, her aunt informed her it had metastasized, and within months her mother was dead. The family left making the funeral arrangements up to Marjory.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Swift became {{interested}} in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her [...] "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since [...] "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I {{need to figure out}} a way to be different".|$|E
500|$|The game's story, {{primarily}} {{written by}} Sato, was based around a central narrative complemented by side-stories. The setting and gameplay were decided upon before Sato was brought on board, {{with the result}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> consult {{the rest of the}} team when she wished to use one of Eorzea's main locations in a certain way. The story's main conflict was to be among the five main races of Eorzea and the Beastmen, with the Garlean Empire acting as a third force. The placement of the Garlean Empire to the northeast of Eorzea was not meant to simulate a real-world location, but naturally ended up there as the map of Hydaelyn was being created. The game's logo, designed by Amano, was designed around the importance of weapons and the concept of a wheel: the [...] "wheel" [...] in question was a wheel of adventurers, arranged so their backs were exposed and they needed to rely on their comrades and friends for support.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010, Perry revealed that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was the first song she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour (2009). Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells, who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry considers it {{to be like that}} of a two-part song because she had started working on [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] before she met Brand, and completed it after they began dating. She stated it is a [...] "really special" [...] song to her because, at {{the first part of the}} track, it is a story <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> let out, which was claiming to know something that you do not actually know. Perry later expressed relief at being able to put all of her feelings into [...] "Not Like the Movies".|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the {{personal}} horror stories Falle heard from {{other women in}} her situation convinced her <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get out of prostitution. Her substance dependence became so severe that she almost died. Her best friend was killed by her pimp. By this point, many of her friends in the sex industry had died, and she thought {{that she would be}} next. One night, Falle was hiding alone in a hotel room when she found a Bible placed there by Gideons International. She began reading the Psalms and later said, [...] "For the first time I understood what God was saying to me. That night my life began to move in a new direction." [...] On her 27th birthday, Falle left her husband and returned to her mother. Because of the delusions, Falle did not recognize her mother, thinking she had been replaced with a clone. Falle told her mother about being dependent on cocaine, entering prostitution, and marrying her pimp. Her mother accepted her back. It took several more years before Falle gave up hope that her husband would change.|$|E
500|$|Alongside {{a series}} of unpopular films, {{problems}} arose from Hepburn's attitude. She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she could be rude and provocative. When asked {{if she had any}} children, she snapped back, [...] "Yes I have five: two white and three colored." [...] She would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned her the nickname [...] "Katharine of Arrogance". The public was also baffled by her boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular figure. Hepburn sensed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> leave Hollywood, so she returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre. It had a successful tour, but, uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of The Lake, Hepburn decided against taking the show to Broadway. Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, [...] "I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years." ...|$|E
