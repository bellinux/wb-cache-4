5|$|A {{squadron}} of three galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived {{to reinforce the}} city on 17 March, but <b>to</b> <b>little</b> avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man only one {{in two or three}} crenelles, and they were deficient in both armament and morale: news of Murad's approach at the head of an army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace.|$|E

5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 10 was renumbered to Route 5. Plans {{at the time}} were to build a new {{alignment}} from east of Ridgefield <b>to</b> <b>Little</b> Ferry southeast of Hackensack and form Route S5 (now Route 93) along the old road from Little Ferry to Ridgefield. The new Route 6 would share the alignment of Route 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, where it would turn southeast onto a new alignment <b>to</b> <b>Little</b> Ferry, then run with Route 5 again to east of Ridgefield and split onto its own alignment to the George Washington Bridge.|$|E

50|$|The 2009 {{municipal}} election {{was held on}} 19 October. Elisapee Sheutiapik and former councillor, Jim Little, were both running for mayor. Sheutiapik won with 57.7% of the vote <b>to</b> <b>Little's</b> 42.3%.|$|R

5|$|Subway {{service would}} be {{extended}} eastward along Hillside Avenue <b>to</b> <b>Little</b> Neck Parkway. The line {{would be an}} extension of the IND Queens Boulevard Line as a four-track line to 212th Street, and then as a 2-track line to its terminus at Little Neck Parkway. The segment to 184th Street was to have cost $3,455,000, while the segment to 212th Street was to have cost $16,355,000.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists {{immediately}} {{opened fire}} upon the Free State force, {{who remained in}} cover behind a rocky outcropping some ways from the Mahdist line. For half an hour the Mahdists continued to fire at Chaltin's companies <b>to</b> <b>little</b> effect, their shots passing harmlessly above the rocks. Meanwhile, Free State soldiers moved a Krupp gun into position which, under Sergeant Cajot, fired several shells into the Mahdists' ranks.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography. While the Supreme Court has generally refused to give obscenity any protection under the First Amendment, pornography is subject <b>to</b> <b>little</b> regulation.

60|$|He pointed <b>to</b> the <b>little</b> sandy knoll {{with its}} sparse {{covering}} of grass, deserted--with scarcely a sign, even, {{that it had}} been the resting place of the caravan. The Professor gave vent <b>to</b> a <b>little</b> exclamation.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs Frog {{acted on}} this advice, and thus was enabled {{to earn a}} {{sufficiency}} to enable her to pay her daily rent, to clothe and feed herself and child, <b>to</b> give a <b>little</b> <b>to</b> the various missions undertaken by the Institutions near her, <b>to</b> put a <b>little</b> now {{and then into the}} farthing bank, and even <b>to</b> give a <b>little</b> in charity <b>to</b> the poor! ...|$|R
5|$|A {{break in}} the weather allowed the RAF to finally fly combat {{missions}} against the German forces surrounding Urquhart's men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe {{over the next two}} days but <b>to</b> <b>little</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted <b>to</b> <b>little</b> more than cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, {{whether or not they}} had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 on 13 April Stopford {{gave the}} order for the inshore {{squadron}} to withdraw back to Gambier's fleet. Cochrane was again furious, and even suggested taking Imperieuse and Indefatigable on a desperate attack on the still-grounded Océan. Captain John Tremayne Rodd on the latter refused. Frustrated, Cochrane remained in the anchorage, joined by Pallas and the smaller vessels as the larger ships returned to more open waters. At 08:00 he ordered a renewed attack on the remaining grounded ships {{at the mouth of}} the Charente, and by 11:00 the small vessels were in position and opened fire on the French flagship. Although Aetnas gun split, forcing her withdrawal, the barrage otherwise continued throughout the day, although <b>to</b> <b>little</b> effect. It was not until 16:00 when the battered Océan and Régulus, most of their stores thrown overboard, were able to safely retreat towards the mouth of the Charente.|$|E
50|$|The title refers <b>to</b> Grady <b>Little,</b> {{manager of}} the Red Sox from 2002-2003, and <b>to</b> <b>Little's</b> {{controversial}} decision not to replace pitcher Pedro Martínez {{in the eighth inning}} of Game Seven of the 2003 American League Championship Series. The Yankees tied the game on a hit from the very next batter, and went on to win, costing the Red Sox a chance at the World Series and causing great frustration and consternation among the Red Sox fan base.|$|R

5|$|At Denville, Route 5 turned south, while Route 12 {{continued}} east {{along the}} Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike to Pine Brook. The route left the old turnpike there to head northeast towards Paterson, {{starting with the}} Pine Brook Road (now Fairfield Road and Little Falls Road) <b>to</b> <b>Little</b> Falls. A bypass was planned around {{the south side of}} Little Falls, taking it under the Erie Railroad at Union Boulevard. From there Route 12 would use Union Boulevard, Totowa Road and McBride Avenue into Paterson. Pre-1927 Route 10, which was legislated in 1917, continued east on Market Street {{on the other side of}} Paterson to Edgewater, where it connected to the Fort Lee Ferry across the Hudson River. The new alignments were generally built as planned, except at Little Falls, where a bypass was to be built for Route 12.|$|E
5|$|Before the Spanish conquest, Chiapas was {{inhabited}} {{by a variety}} of indigenous peoples, including the Zoques, various Maya peoples, such as the Lakandon Ch'ol and the Tzotzil, and an unidentified group referred to as the Chiapanecas. Soconusco had been incorporated into the Aztec Empire, centred in Valley of Mexico, and paid the Aztecs tribute. News of strangers first arrived in the region as the Spanish penetrated and overthrew the Aztec Empire. In the early 1520s, several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land, and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast. The first highland colonial town in Chiapas, San Cristóbal de los Llanos, was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527. Within a year, Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River, Comitán, and the Ocosingo valley. Encomienda rights were established, although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted <b>to</b> <b>little</b> more than slave-raiding rights.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was born}} Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948; his mother then moved the family <b>to</b> <b>Little</b> Rock, Arkansas. This move {{was made for}} a variety of reasons, {{including}} escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving <b>to</b> <b>Little</b> Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.|$|E

500|$|Before its {{original}} airing, [...] "Say Hello <b>to</b> My <b>Little</b> Friend" [...] was highly anticipated by commentators. In a review for [...] "Slack Water", The A.V. Club claimed that [...] "Say Hello <b>to</b> My <b>Little</b> Friend" [...] would be [...] "very cool" [...] because Michael will [...] "face a crisis when he stops {{waking up in}} [...] ". In a review for the same episode, Sepinwall called [...] "Say Hello <b>to</b> My <b>Little</b> Friend" [...] and the following episode [...] "quite good".|$|R
5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted <b>to</b> <b>little</b> more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E
5|$|Episcopalianism had {{retained}} supporters {{through the}} civil wars and changes of {{regime in the}} seventeenth century. Since most Episcopalians gave their support to the Jacobite rebellions {{in the first half}} of the early eighteenth century, they suffered a decline in fortunes. The remoteness of the Highlands and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later eighteenth century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the SSPCK missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced <b>to</b> <b>little</b> more than a poorly run mission. There was Evangelical Revival from the 1730s, reaching its peak at the Cambuslang Wark in 1742. The movement benefited the secessionist churches who gained recruits.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} to make minor appearances in television throughout the 1980s; in 1987, he auditioned {{for the role of}} Dave Lister in the BBC North science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf. The part eventually went to Craig Charles but Bathurst was given a role in the first episode of the first series as Frank Todhunter, second officer on the ship, who is killed in the first ten minutes. Ten years later, Bathurst was invited to reprise the role when a storyline in the series allowed former characters to return, but filming commitments prevented him from appearing. In 1989, he appeared in Malcolm Bradbury's Anything More Would Be Greedy for Anglia Television, playing Dennis Medlam, MP. The programme was broadcast in 1990 <b>to</b> <b>little</b> fanfare. In 1990, he performed on Up Yer News, a live topical programme broadcast on BSB.|$|E
