5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} are required for good health, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity.

Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.|$|E

5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} MAR {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start {{to be able to be}} upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{contribution}} that thrips make to their ecosystem is the damage {{they can cause}} during feeding. This impact may fall across a broad selection of prey items, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> breadth in host affinity across the order, and even within a species, varying degrees of fidelity to a described host remain. Family Thripidae in particular is notorious for members with broad host ranges, {{and the majority of}} pest thrips come from this family.

5|$|The species' genetic {{diversity}} {{is similar to}} that of other pocket gophers occupying a larger geographic range and diversity of habitat. Compared to Townsend's pocket gopher, which is distributed across a much larger area, but less diverse habitat, it is more genetically heterogeneous. Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> differentiation between separate populations of camas pocket gophers, their genetic variability does not affect the mammal's appearance. Study of the effects of genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species' entire geographic area about 13,000 years ago. Such an event would cause a population bottleneck, leading to scattered, isolated populations.|$|E

5|$|The {{water pipit}} has a {{complete}} moult between July and September, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into {{what looks like}} non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage {{as soon as a}} month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult {{is similar to that of}} the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> {{debate about}} whether the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of the {{relevance}} of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>considerable</b> {{migration}} {{between the}} Nordic countries, but {{owing to the}} similarity between the cultures and languages (with the exception of Finnish), expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not stand out as a group.

Similarly, there were 16,915 reported Swedish speakers in Canada from the 2001 census. Although there are no certain numbers, some 40,000 Swedes are estimated to live in the London area in the United Kingdom. Outside Sweden and Finland, there are about 40,000 active learners enrolled in Swedish language courses.|$|E
