5|$|The {{moral code}} {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of <b>the</b> <b>perils</b> <b>of</b> pride and arrogance.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{contacted}} by Atlas via radio, and is guided to safety from the Splicers and <b>the</b> <b>perils</b> <b>of</b> the run down city. Atlas requests Jack's help in stopping Ryan, directing {{him to a}} docked bathysphere where he claims Ryan has trapped his family. When Jack encounters a wandering Little Sister and its fallen Big Daddy, Atlas urges Jack to kill the Little Sister to harvest her ADAM for himself; Dr. Tenenbaum overhears this and intercepts Jack before he harms the Little Sister, urging him to spare the child and any other Little Sisters he encounters, providing him with a plasmid that would force the sea slug out of her body. Jack eventually works {{his way to the}} bathysphere, but Ryan destroys it before Jack can reach it. Enraged, Atlas directs Jack towards Ryan's mansion through Ryan's army of Splicers and Big Daddies. At times, Jack is forced to travel through areas controlled by Ryan's allies that have now become deranged, such as Sander Cohen, a former musician that now takes enjoyment in watching the death and misery of others.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Peril</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific (1916), by J. Allan Dunn, {{describes}} a Japanese {{invasion of the}} western U.S. in 1920, positing a treasonous alliance between immigrant Japanese-Americans and the Japanese navy. The narrative language reflects contemporaneous racist anxiety over the social status of Japanese-Americans, most of whom lived in California, and who were exempt from anti-immigration legislation {{in accordance with the}} Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907. The thematic implication <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Peril</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific is that the primary loyalty of Japanese-Americans is to Imperial Japan.|$|R
