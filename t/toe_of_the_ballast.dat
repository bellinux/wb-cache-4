40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} significantly influences <b>the</b> mechanical response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> under low confining pressure. However, particle breakage usually occurs and unfavorably degrades the particle {{size distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> when sufficient load is applied. To model the triaxial stress-strain behavior and its associated evolution of {{particle size distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast,</b> a specific bounding surface model is proposed. The proposed model {{is based on the}} traditional bounding surface plasticity and a modified particle breakage index, which correlates the initial gradation and the ultimate gradation together with the current gradation. Simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental results from the triaxial compression tests shows that the proposed model can predict the strain softening and volumetric expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> under relatively lower confining pressure. It is also able to simulate the strain hardening and volumetric compression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> under relatively higher confining pressure. Most importantly, the proposed approach was observed to have a great potential in predicting <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particle size distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the grain size distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>ballast</b> using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and image analysis. The proposed approach relies on the hypothesis that <b>the</b> dimension (grading) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> aggregates can influence the back-reflected spectrum received by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> GPR. This assumption was confirmed by the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GPR signal, which were run by using the numerical simulator package gprMax 2 D. A regression model was developed which related <b>the</b> "equivalent" diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> aggregates and <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peak within the received spectrum. The model was validated in the laboratory environment by means of a 155 cm x 155 cm x 50 cm methacrylate tank, filled up with railway ballast. An air-coupled GPR system equipped with a 2000 MHz central frequency antenna was used for testing purposes. A total of three spatial distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> aggregates within <b>the</b> tank were investigated, by emptying out and filling up thrice the tank with the same material. The geometric information on <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> grading obtained from the simulation-based regression model was compared to the actual grading curve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast.</b> To this effect, an algorithm based on the automatic image analysis was developed. The comparison showed that the modelled aggregate diameter corresponded to <b>the</b> 70 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material sieved out in the laboratory.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two aspects}} {{concerning}} <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> on vibrations <b>of</b> railway bridges. <b>The</b> {{first one is}} the additional stiffness due to <b>the</b> <b>ballast.</b>  For that, a special finite beam element with a non-linear longitudinal stiffness associated to the slip at the interface between <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> and <b>the</b> bridge is implemented and used to calculate vertical accelerations during and after <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> a train. <b>The</b> second one is <b>the</b> load distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axle loads through <b>the</b> <b>ballast.</b> To investigate this, a parametric study is carried out on a two dimensional model with plane elements. Based on this load distribution, different load shapes are created, which are used in dynamic analyses in Matlab on three different bridge models. The conclusions are that a linear and a bi-linear longitudinal stiffness at the interface give similar maximum accelerations. Moreover, the critical train velocities are increased with <b>the</b> additional stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast.</b> <b>The</b> study also shows thatdistributed loads, in general, lowers the maximum accelerations, especially on short bridges...|$|R

Their effect on the forces, vibration response, and sound radiation as trains run through a turnout is studied here using a calculation model for a whole turnout based on the finite-element method. <b>The</b> non-linear characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast's</b> support under <b>the</b> sleepers, as well as <b>the</b> special construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> articulated joints, are included. It is shown that compared with the normal integral sleeper design, the track with articulated switch sleepers has a lower rigidity, which changes more evenly along the track and improves its dynamic performance. Furthermore, <b>the</b> fatigue strength <b>of</b> an articulated switch sleeper is higher due to its lower stress amplitudes. Additionally, when the vehicles are running on the main turnout route, as the switch sleepers’ vibration behaviour is modified, the articulated joints effectively reduce <b>the</b> impact loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sleeper under the turnout branch track. This will extend <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballast</b> bed.
