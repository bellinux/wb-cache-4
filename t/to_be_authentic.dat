5|$|The Nefertiti bust {{has become}} a {{cultural}} symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt. Nefertiti herself has become quite an icon. Nefertiti is widely known for her beauty and versatility. It has also {{been the subject of}} an intense argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation. It was dragged into controversy by the Body of Nefertiti art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity. However various testing and analysis of the bust have proved it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>authentic.</b>|$|E

Across its websites, Kink.com formed a values statement and set of guidelines for directors and performers, taking preventative measures against victimization. The site production staff developed a practice of interviewing performers both before and after the film sessions.

5|$|These {{instructions}} {{stated that}} {{the objectives of the}} Partisans meant that there could be no cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; they say the document was a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state they consider them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>authentic.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before King {{published}} {{the discovery of}} the fragment, she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review the fragment. They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills which would have been required to forge the fragment, and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed the fragment as fake. In a television documentary about the fragment that was presented on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested that he considered it more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>authentic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shirokogoroff's and Eliade's {{views of}} shamanism were both {{centered}} on individuals {{and on the}} role of shamans in small groups. Shirokogoroff, for instance, considered eighteenth-century Qing shamanism too formalized <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>authentic.</b> Historians of northeast Asia have criticized Eliade's and Shirokogoroff's interpretations because they neglect the political roles of shamans and shamanism's relation with the state. Eliade's claim that shamanism is by essence archaic, individualistic, and socially transgressive led him and his followers to neglect historical contexts in which shamanism fulfilled political functions or served the needs of the state, as it did under the Qing.|$|E
5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>authentic,</b> the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E

5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>authentic</b> pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of {{non-destructive}} techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of time that the {{salamander}} letter was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>authentic,</b> the information contained within it was used in a number of publications and films related to Mormonism.

Today, however, the Sankey mask has been largely dismissed as unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>authentic.</b>|$|E
