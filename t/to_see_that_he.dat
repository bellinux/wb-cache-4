5|$|The fourth episode {{begins with}} Kills {{and a man}} {{involving}} in sexual activity. By the morning, the latter wakes up while Kills is asleep, and steals her passport and revolver. Kills is surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has left and gets angry after realizing that she was robbed.

5|$|Wonka announces {{a contest}} whereby {{children}} that find Golden Tickets hidden in five Wonka bars {{will be given}} a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, and one a chance to be presented with an unknown grand prize. Four tickets are quickly found: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) from Düsseldorf; the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) from Buckinghamshire; the competitive and boastful Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) from Atlanta; and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) from Denver. Charlie hopes to find a ticket but his chances are small as money is tight, and the best has to be made of his annual birthday present of one Wonka bar and a bar bought by Grandpa Joe's money, both of which yield no tickets. All hope is seemingly crushed when the last ticket is apparently claimed in Russia. Charlie, on finding some money in the street, just intends to enjoy one chocolate bar when news breaks that the Russian ticket was fake. To Charlie's surprise, he finds the bar he just bought has the real last Golden Ticket. Bystanders attempt to separate him from it, only for the shopkeeper (Oscar James) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> keeps the ticket and gets back home with it.|$|E

25|$|Soon after, Don Calogero arrives, and the Prince is {{relieved}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> dressed quite tastelessly. His relief ends abruptly when Angelica arrives - he finds her attractive {{enough to feel}} the stir of lust. At dinner, Angelica flirts openly with Tancredi—who, in his turn, finds himself attracted to both Angelica's beauty and her money. For her part, Concetta is enraged.|$|R

25|$|Around 1807 (sources differ), {{during the}} Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived. Germain, {{concerned}} that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety, a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss' safety. General Pernety sent a chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was safe. As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.|$|E
25|$|However, Clark {{remained}} belligerent in his {{attacks on}} the Trudeau government, angrily clashing with the prime minister in Parliament. He hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies and ran his office efficiently. He improved his party's standing in national opinion polls. Clark worked very hard, and gradually earned the respect of most people, including his own caucus, by presenting a series of well thought out speeches and questions in Parliament. He benefited when live television came to the House of Commons in 1977, allowing viewers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was evolving into a real rival for Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|Jesus is not {{believed}} by his family, {{and so he}} leaves them once again, meets Mary Magdalene, and goes to work helping the fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. One day out on the Sea by himself, he is visited by God and the devil. God tells Jesus of his plan for Jesus to institute Christianity, because God is annoyed at being only the God of one race, and that other gods seem {{to get all the}} glory. Jesus is initially against what he sees as a selfish plan bound to lead to great suffering of many, but is made <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually has no choice in the matter.|$|E
50|$|Donner, Santa's lead reindeer, and {{his wife}} have given birth to a new baby fawn named Rudolph. Upon admiring him, they are {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> been born with a glowing red nose. When Santa arrives, <b>he</b> warns Donner <b>that</b> Rudolph won't make the sleigh team because of his nose. So, Donner decides to hide it by covering it with mud so Rudolph will fit in with all the other reindeer.|$|R

25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E
25|$|Kray's troops reached Alessandria on 12 June and Suvorov {{planned to}} launch {{them into an}} attack on Pérignon's wing early on the 14th. This proved to be impossible, but Kray managed to join Bellegarde's force and he promised to attack on 15 August. Meanwhile, the {{division}} of François Watrin moved down from the hills {{in the direction of}} Tortona, giving every indication that the French offensive was still in full swing. Joubert had hoped that he was facing only 8,000 enemies. But he was stunned <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was facing at least 36,000 enemies including Kray's corps in the plains below. Both Pérignon and Saint-Cyr counseled retreat, but Joubert put off a final decision until the next day. Meanwhile, Suvorov assumed that the French army would soon descend into the plains. When the French came forward, Kray and 27,000 soldiers would cut into their left flank while Bagration's 5,700-man Russian advance guard would turn their right flank. With luck the two forces would link hands behind the French. Once the turning movements were well developed, Wilhelm Derfelden's 9,850 Russians and Melas' 8,800 Austrians would join the battle. Farther north, Johann Baptist Alcaini's 5,260-strong force besieged Tortona, covered by Andrei Grigorevich Rosenberg's 8,270 Russians.|$|E

500|$|DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy, {{chief medical}} officer. Kelley also noted the physicality {{required}} for the film and enjoyed doing things {{that he had not}} been asked to do in years. [...] "I was very pleased <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] brought it along in fine style," [...] he said. Kelley noted that his own ambition to direct had deserted him after seeing difficulties Nimoy faced directing the previous two Star Trek films.|$|E

After a few dates, he proposes {{marriage}} but she refuses before starting to date her college tutor, John Arnley (Paul Warriner). She is initially reluctant to introduce {{him to her}} flatmates and when she does, they are surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a lot older. John asks Toyah {{to move in with}} him and she agrees. When Toyah and Fiz argue about John, Fiz tells her that he and Maria had sex and Maria got pregnant. Toyah confronts Maria, who gives her the impression that John forced himself on her. Remembering her rape, Toyah attacks John in front of his class before dumping him. Toyah decides to leave Weatherfield after reuniting with Spider and they move to London ...|$|E
500|$|Bohr {{recognised}} {{early that}} nuclear weapons would change international relations. In April 1944, {{he received a}} letter from Peter Kapitza, written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the Soviet Union. The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain before posting. Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that [...] "we did not speak the same language". [...] Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: [...] "It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is very near the edge of mortal crimes." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Jesús Quintero,Falete {{very much}} [...] "feels like an artist, dreams like an artist, loves like an artist, and suffers like one too. He lives for art; he doesn't see any {{boundaries}} {{between life and}} art." [...] It's not surprising <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> very comfortable with ambiguity and embraces {{it as part of}} his lifestyle and his sexuality, becoming an icon for liberal sexual and body attitudes and defying stereotypes. <b>He's</b> an artist <b>that</b> cannot be pigeonholed - a refreshing figure in the more traditional flamenco and copla scene.|$|R

500|$|Darryl is {{initially}} unsuccessful in {{his attempts to}} win Charlie over, but Anderson hinted that her character would fall for him. She said, [...] "I think the way Steve [...] has played Brax, there is definitely enough there for Charlie <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has a heart {{and to see the}} good side in him as well." [...] Discussing the plot in which Charlie tried to keep Ruby away from Casey, Anderson said, [...] "I think she's also telling herself to stay away from Brax, but Charlie can't get him out of her head." [...] Colin Vickery of The Daily Telegraph said Darryl had turned Charlie's [...] "safe police world" [...] upside down, and Anderson told him, [...] "What is wonderful about this relationship is that it is forbidden love. There is this element of danger that brings excitement along with it." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "fun and flirty" [...] and said it shows another layer to Charlie, as it has brought out her fun side. The arrival of Darryl's ex-girlfriend Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) causes Charlie and Darryl to split. However, Vickery said it was obvious that Charlie cannot stay away from Darryl for long.|$|E
500|$|On 3 August 1940, {{he married}} Eldwyth Ruth Alford (1910–2013), by {{whom he had}} a son and two daughters, and who collaborated with him in much of his work. Ruth Alford was a {{secondary}} school teacher from Tavistock, Devon, the daughter of Roger Rice Alford a Methodist preacher and mayor of Tavistock. When their engagement was announced in The Times, Stearn was vastly amused <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was described as a}} [...] "Fellow of the Linen Society", a typographical error for Linnean Society. Stearn was brought up an Anglican, but was a conscientious objector and after the Second World War he became a Quaker. In his later years, following official retirement in 1976 he continued to live in Kew, Richmond. His entry in Who's Who lists his interests as [...] "gardening and talking". He died on 9 May 2001 of pneumonia at Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, at the age of 90. His funeral took place on 18 May at Mortlake crematorium. He was survived by his widow and three children (Roger Thomas Stearn, Margaret Ruth Stearn and Helen Elizabeth Stearn) leaving an estate of £461,240.

500|$|Musicians Kid Rock and Joe C. guest {{starred in}} the episode as themselves, {{performing}} at the annual spring break concert that Homer sneaks out to attend. When Joe C. makes his first appearance on stage in the episode, Homer mistakes him for a child that has lost his parents. After performing his song [...] "Bawitdaba", Kid Rock tells the audience {{that he is going}} to pour out forty gallons of malt liquor on the curb as a way of showing respect to his homies that could not make it to the concert. When Homer hears this he starts to drink the malt liquor. Just as Kid Rock and Joe C. are about to stop him by hurling Joe C. (now wearing a spiked helmet) at him with a slingshot, the sheriff arrives and settles the situation. Scully said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that the staff of the show chose Kid Rock and Joe C. for the episode because the two [...] "have a lot of stage presence" [...] and visually are [...] "a funny combination," [...] and because the staff thought [...] "they would be funny playing off Homer." [...] According to Scully, the two musicians [...] "had a great sense of humor [...] about themselves," [...] with Kid Rock asking if [...] "he could add a couple of his own lines. He wanted to introduce himself as 'the pimp of the nation.' We kept that in the show. It's quite a title." [...] Kid Rock recorded some of his dialog over the phone, but also paid a 45-minute visit to the Simpsons studio in Los Angeles to record lines. Scully thought it looked like the singer enjoyed the experience and was surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> arrived on time. [...] "My first reaction to that was, 'What kind of rock star is this?'," [...] Scully jokingly told the Detroit Free Press. All of Joe C.'s lines were recorded over the phone.|$|E
