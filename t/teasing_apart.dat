5000|$|The {{mechanism}} {{behind the}} implicit learning that is hypothesized to occur while people engage in artificial grammar learning is statistical learning or, more specifically, Bayesian learning. Bayesian learning {{takes into account}} types of biases or [...] "prior probability distributions" [...] individuals have {{that contribute to the}} outcome of implicit learning tasks. These biases {{can be thought of as}} a probability distribution that contains the probability that each possible hypothesis is likely to be correct. Due to the structure of the Bayesian model, the inferences output by the model are in the form of a probability distribution rather than a single most probable event. This output distribution is a [...] "posterior probability distribution". The posterior probability of each hypothesis in the original distribution is the probability of the hypothesis being true given the data and the probability of data given the hypothesis is true.This Bayesian model for learning is fundamental for understanding the pattern detection process involved in implicit learning and, therefore, the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of artificial grammar learning rules. It is hypothesized that the implicit learning of grammar involves predicting co-occurrences of certain words in a certain order. For example, [...] "the dog chased the ball" [...] is a sentence that can be learned as grammatically correct on an implicit level due to the high co-occurrence of [...] "chase" [...] being one of the words to follow [...] "dog". A sentence like [...] "the dog cat the ball" [...] is implicitly recognized as grammatically incorrect due to the lack of utterances that contain those words paired in that specific order. This process is important for <b>teasing</b> <b>apart</b> thematic roles and parts of speech in grammatical processing (see grammar). While the labeling of the thematic roles and parts of speech is explicit, the identification of words and parts of speech is implicit.|$|E

30|$|We {{note that}} ideally {{we would have}} liked to select {{multiple}} drought and non-drought years from each site, in order to better <b>tease</b> <b>apart</b> the abiotic and biotic drivers of isotopic signatures and growth trends. However, logistic constraints meant we could either sample multiple years for a small subset of species and/or sites, or we could sample across the entire species pool, but only for two contrasting years at each site. As the main goal of our analysis is to understand whether or not carbon isotope ratios and stem growth show a clear and coordinated response to drought across Europe’s forests, we chose to focus on the later of these two options. Further work will be needed to <b>tease</b> <b>apart</b> the ecological, physiological and environmental mechanisms that underpin the general relationships we uncover here.|$|R
