5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} <b>their</b> <b>lungs</b> {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty <b>their</b> <b>lungs,</b> pinnipeds can reinflate <b>their</b> <b>lungs</b> even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with <b>their</b> <b>lungs</b> fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E

5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four {{times longer than}} most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into <b>their</b> <b>lungs.</b> They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E

40|$|Introduction:Despite recent {{therapeutic}} advances, {{lung cancer}} is a difficult disease to manage. This study assessed clinicians’ perceptions of care difficulty, quality of life (QOL), and symptom reports for <b>their</b> <b>lung</b> cancer patients compared with their patients with breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Methods:This report focused on secondary analyses from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Symptom Outcomes and Practice Patterns (SOAPP) study (E 2 Z 02); outcome measures included clinician ratings of 3106 solid tumor patients. Univariate analyses focused on patterns of disease-specific perceptions; multivariable analyses examined whether disease-specific differences persisted after covariate inclusion. Results:In univariate comparisons, clinicians rated lung cancer patients as more difficult to treat than other solid tumor patients, with poorer QOL and higher symptom reports. After covariates were adjusted, the odds of clinicians perceiving lower QOL for <b>their</b> <b>lung</b> cancer patients were 3. 6 times larger than for patients with other solid tumors (odds ratio = 3. 6 [95 % confidence interval, 2. 0 – 6. 6]; p < 0. 0001). In addition, the odds of clinicians perceiving weight difficulties for <b>their</b> <b>lung</b> cancer patients were 3. 2 times larger (odds ratio = 3. 2 [95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 – 6. 0]; p = 0. 0004). No other outcome showed significant differences between lung versus other cancers in multivariable models. Conclusion:Clinicians were more pessimistic about the well-being of <b>their</b> <b>lung</b> cancer patients compared with patients with other solid tumors. Differences remained for clinician perceptions of patient QOL and weight difficulty, even after controlling for such variables as stage, performance status, and patient-reported outcomes. These continuing disparities suggest possible perception bias. More {{research is needed to}} confirm this disparity and explore the underpinnings...|$|R

5|$|Up to 60 {{helminth}} {{species are}} known to infect foxes in fur farms, while 20 are known in the wild. Several coccidian species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria are also known to infect them. The most common nematode species found in fox guts are Toxocara canis and Uncinaria stenocephala, Capillaria aerophila and Crenosoma vulpis, the latter two infect <b>their</b> <b>lungs.</b> Capillaria plica infect the fox's bladder. Trichinella spiralis rarely affects them. The most common tapeworm species in foxes are Taenia spiralis and T.pisiformis. Others include Echinococcus granulosus and E.multilocularis. Eleven trematode species infect red foxes, including Metorchis conjunctus.|$|E
5|$|The American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) funded Drinker to {{investigate}} the 1948 Donora smog, as the company {{had an interest in}} showing that its primary pollutants (sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide) had not significantly contributed to the damage it caused. In the middle of 1953, Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination mist of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide into humid chambers containing guinea pigs {{to investigate}} the damage that it would cause to <b>their</b> <b>lungs.</b> Guinea pigs were used as they breathe more deeply through their mouths than smaller rodents which breathe through their noses. The Amdurs bought their own guinea pigs for the mini project, and spent a holiday weekend doing the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to <b>their</b> <b>lungs,</b> forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding the rib cage. In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{breathing}} exercises were also performed by complete or incomplete paraplegic and tetraplegic patients to protect <b>their</b> <b>lung</b> capacity and strengthen their upper extremities.

5|$|In newts and salamanders, {{metamorphosis}} is {{less dramatic}} than in frogs. This {{is because the}} larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. <b>Their</b> <b>lungs</b> are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land. Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into <b>their</b> <b>lungs</b> by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} in Nature found that hydrogen peroxide {{plays a role in}} the immune system. Scientists found that hydrogen peroxide presence inside cells increased after tissues are damaged in zebrafish, which is thought to act as a signal to white blood cells to converge on the site and initiate the healing process. When the genes required to produce hydrogen peroxide were disabled, white blood cells did not accumulate at the site of damage. The experiments were conducted on fish; however, because fish are genetically similar to humans, the same process is speculated to occur in humans. The study in Nature suggested asthma sufferers have higher levels of hydrogen peroxide in <b>their</b> <b>lungs</b> than healthy people, which could explain why asthma sufferers have inappropriate levels of white blood cells in <b>their</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of airborne}} transmission among humans {{is believed to be}} due to low levels of the virus in the lungs {{and other parts of the}} respiratory system of primates, insufficient to cause new infections. A number of studies examining airborne transmission broadly concluded that transmission from pigs to primates could happen without direct contact because, unlike humans and primates, pigs with EVD get very high ebolavirus concentrations in <b>their</b> <b>lungs,</b> and not their bloodstream. Therefore, pigs with EVD can spread the disease through droplets in the air or on the ground when they sneeze or cough. By contrast, humans and other primates accumulate the virus throughout their body and specifically in their blood, but not very much in <b>their</b> <b>lungs.</b> It is believed that this is the reason researchers have observed pig to primate transmission without physical contact, but no evidence has been found of primates being infected without actual contact, even in experiments where infected and uninfected primates shared the same air.|$|E

40|$|Surgery for {{patients}} with <b>lung</b> cancer diminishes <b>their</b> <b>lung</b> functions, due to removal of <b>their</b> <b>lung</b> lobes. Therefore, thoracic surgeons have to consider postoperative lung function of pa-tients. In this review, we explained recent approaches of estimation of postoperative lung func-tion by spirometrical and also pulmonary circulatory measurement values. The most common and simple way to estimate postoperative conditions {{for patients}} who undergo lung resections is calculated by numbers of segments that are removed by surgery. However, these methods are not so accurate when the patients have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Another method for estimating postoperative conditions using right heart catheterization is a unilateral pulmo-nary arterial occlusion (UPAO) test. Applying this method, surgery related deaths have been decreased. Since, UPAO test mimics the postoperative state by occluding the pulmonary artery prior to lung surgery, {{it is supposed to}} be very accurate. Recently, a novel method to estimate postoperative right heart reserve functions was developed. Using this method, postoperative right heart failures can be anticipated prior to lung resections.
