Plans from 1960 called for BART trains to traverse the Twin Peaks Tunnel, but {{the upper level}} of the subway {{was turned over to}} Muni and both agencies share the Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell and Civic Center stations.

5|$|In 2002, in {{the lead}} up to Manchester hosting the Commonwealth Games, a {{requirement}} to increase capacity on for the event led to Metrolink investigating the purchase of redundant second-hand USSLRV vehicles from <b>the</b> <b>Muni</b> Metro system in San Francisco. To this end, two were procured for testing and shipped to the UK, with one taken to Metrolink's Queen's Road depot.

5|$|In 2011, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$160 million in restitution, {{penalties}} and disgorgement of profits for rigging bids in the U.S. municipal bond market, after the bank and three of its employees were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2010. In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in <b>the</b> <b>muni</b> market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E

5|$|Two subway stations, West Portal Station and Forest Hill Station, {{and five}} of the six light-rail lines, J Church, K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and N Judah, are {{remnants}} of an extensive streetcar system that survived the mass conversion to buses in the 1950s. In 1980, seven subway stations, from Embarcadero Station to Castro Street Station, were opened with the inauguration of the Market Street Subway underneath Market Street, marking the conversion of San Francisco's streetcar system into <b>the</b> <b>Muni</b> Metro. In 1998, four surface stations on The Embarcadero opened, connecting the newly constructed AT Park (then called Pacific Bell Park) and Caltrain to Muni Metro. In 2007, the T Third Street line was started along 18 new surface stations built along new track laid from Caltrain down {{the eastern side of the}} city to the city line.|$|E

25|$|Construction on BART's Market street tunnel {{started in}} 1967, with two decks tracks – the upper {{intended}} to provide local service. Major cost overruns in the BART project forced the state legislature to rescue the project in 1969: curtailing local service in San Francisco and converting the partially constructed stations into {{the basis of a}} new light-rail subway called <b>the</b> <b>Muni</b> Metro to connect the downtown stations to the Twin Peaks Tunnel and continuing along reserved tracks to St. Francis Circle. Construction on the metro began in 1970, but the project suffered from further cuts and design changes throughout the 1970s. <b>The</b> <b>Muni</b> Metro finally opened in February 1980, for one line (N-Judah), with other lines following later in 1980, but the many design compromises and piecemeal planning led to long-term operational challenges and inefficiencies.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, with aging {{equipment}} and poor management, Muni {{developed a reputation}} for poor and erratic service. In 1996 a group called Rescue Muni representing transit riders formed to organize concerns and press for change, advocating for the successful 1999 Proposition E that formed the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency and set service standards for Muni. In an effort to improve service, Muni began to replace its troublesome fleet of Boeing-Vertol light rail vehicles with newer Italian Breda light rail vehicles. In 1998, San Francisco residents witnessed a protracted malfunction of Muni Metro during the switch to automatic train control, culminating in an event that is known as <b>the</b> <b>Muni</b> Meltdown. The two-decade-old fleet of Flyer trolleybuses were replaced with Electric Transit, Inc. (ETI) trolleybuses in the early 2000s. Likewise, the diesel bus fleet saw an infusion of 45 new NABI buses from AC Transit in 1999.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2001, Muni retired {{the last}} of their Boeing LRVs after the LRV2s had proven their {{reliability}} on <b>the</b> <b>Muni</b> Metro system. The MBTA was originally expected to have retired their LRVs around the same time. However, the new Type 8s had been prone to derailing and other technical defects, which had significantly delayed their entry into service, with the MBTA nearly suspending the contract. These issues were finally resolved in 2006, allowing production and delivery of the Type 8 cars to resume. By early 2007, a sufficient number Type 8 cars had entered service to allow the retirement of the remaining Boeings. The final revenue service run of the MBTA Boeing cars was made on March 16, 2007, on the Riverside Line by cars 3485 and 3499. By late 2007, all Type 8s had been assembled and delivered for service.|$|E
25|$|The F Market Line (historic {{streetcar}} service) in San Francisco, {{opened in}} 1995, runs along Market Street from The Castro to the Ferry Building, then along the Embarcadero {{north and west}} to Fisherman's Wharf. This line {{is run by a}} mixture of PCC cars built between 1946 and 1952, and earlier pre-PCC cars. Due to its success, a second heritage line was inaugurated in 2015, the E Embarcadero, which serves to facilitate a one-seat ride from the Caltrain San Francisco Station to Fisherman's Wharf. Although San Francisco had removed PCCs from revenue service when the city's light rail was transformed into <b>the</b> <b>Muni</b> Metro system in 1980, they had made occasional festival trips in the ensuing years before being returned to full-time service.

On July 2, 2015, Muni was awarded a grant of $41 million from the California Transportation Agency to eventually pay for 40 of the 64 additional Siemens light rail vehicles. The first car was delivered from the Siemens plant in Sacramento to San Francisco on 13 January 2017; it is expected that deliveries will continue through 2028. In early November 2017, a test car passed a CPUC regulatory inspection with only minor correctable issues and received permission to begin reveue service on November 15.
