5|$|These defeats {{forced the}} Galatians <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> {{peace and the}} Romans {{returned}} to the coast of Asia Minor. However, when Manlius Vulso returned to Rome, {{he was charged with}} threatening the peace between the Seleucids and Rome. He was cleared and was granted a triumph by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} King Poniatowski decided <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace, the Polish army {{was still in}} good {{fighting}} condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events would prove him wrong, {{the question of whether}} this could have been foreseen, and prevented through continued military resistance, has been subject to much debate among historians.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, {{was much}} {{longer and more}} serious for both the Romans and Samnites. The {{fortunes}} of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course. But the Romans won the Battle of Bovianum, and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC, the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.|$|E

5|$|These two {{crushing}} military defeats {{forced the}} Galatians <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace. This campaign greatly enriched Vulso and his legions as the Galatians had gathered great wealth through their many conquests in Asia Minor. The Galatians sent envoys to Vulso asking for peace but Vulso, {{who at the}} time was hurrying back to Ephesus because winter was approaching, bade them to come to Ephesus.|$|E
5|$|After {{having won}} {{control of the}} seas, a Roman force landed on the African coast under Marcus Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the Battle of Adys and forcing Carthage <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed {{to cut off the}} Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|At the Lannister army camp, Lord Tywin Lannister and his {{followers}} discuss their recent setbacks: not only have they lost an important battle, and Jaime, to the Starks, along with his entire army, but both Baratheon brothers now also threaten them. Because his grandson's execution of Ned Stark destroyed any hope <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace between the Starks and the Lannisters, Tywin orders his son Tyrion to go to King's Landing in his stead as Hand of the King {{in order to keep}} Joffrey under control. Against his father's orders, Tyrion brings the prostitute Shae with him to the capital.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling {{resulted}} in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing {{the rights to}} Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but {{if they did not}} begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{was long}} remembered favourably in the Western church for his reputed feat in {{recovering}} the True Cross, {{which had been}} captured by the Persians. As Heraclius approached the capital, Khosrau fled from his favourite residence, Dastagird near Baghdad, without offering resistance. Meanwhile, some of the Persian grandees freed Khosrau's eldest son Kavadh II, who had been imprisoned by his father, and proclaimed him King {{on the night of}} 23â€“24 February, 628. Kavadh however was mortally ill and was anxious that Heraclius should protect his infant son Ardeshir. So, as a goodwill gesture, he sent the True Cross with a negotiator <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace in 628.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E

5|$|John {{had lost}} most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had {{struggled}} to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money {{to fight a war}} which ended in expensive failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace and pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.|$|E
5|$|Multiple Aboriginal {{villages in}} {{frontier}} areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression {{such as when}} the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 {{at the same time}} as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died, after an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan the aboriginals were forced <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace in February 1653.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they lacked}} the forces to take Nikolaev {{in a single}} campaign, the seizure of Kinburn proved to have limited {{strategic}} effect. Nevertheless, the attack on Kinburn was significant in that it demonstrated that the French and British fleets had developed effective amphibious capabilities and had technological advantages that gave them a decisive edge over their Russian opponents. The destruction of Kinburn's coastal fortifications completed the Anglo-French naval campaign in the Black Sea; the Russians no longer had any meaningful forces left to oppose them at sea. The British and French navies planned to transfer forces to the Baltic Sea the following year to strengthen operations there. Diplomatic pressure from still-neutral Austria convinced Czar Nicholas I of Russia <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace, which was concluded the following February with the Treaty of Paris.|$|E

5|$|The Jin assault {{commenced}} in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong continued <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace, but Jin {{demands for}} territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces {{north of the}} Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later.|$|E
5|$|While the Persians proved largely {{successful}} {{during the}} first stage of the war from 602 to 622, conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, several islands in the Aegean Sea and parts of Anatolia, the ascendancy of emperor Heraclius in 610 led, despite initial setbacks, to a Status quo ante bellum. Heraclius' campaigns in Persian lands from 622 to 626 forced the Persians onto the defensive, allowing his forces to regain momentum. Allied with the Avars and Slavs, the Persians made a final attempt to take Constantinople in 626, but were defeated there. In 627 Heraclius invaded the heartland of the Persians and forced them <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of siege the Dutch had re-opened the sea lanes. Charles now faced a {{difficult}} choice: if he tried <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace, the conditions would have been worse than the previous peace. The other option was an all-out attack on Copenhagen, hoping that conquering the city would end the war. The number of Swedish attackers are somewhat uncertain, roughly 8,000 men, comprising 4,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 sailors and a few hundred gunners. The king planned the attack meticulously, but neglected to uphold adequate secrecy; the Danes were soon {{fully aware of the}} details of the Swedish attack plan thanks to a number of deserters and spies able to move between the encampments. The Danes had 6,000 trained soldiers, and an additional 5,000 men and women from the city had also taken up weapons, bringing the number of defenders to 11,000.|$|E

5|$|After the German Ober Ost garrisons were {{withdrawn}} from the Eastern Front following the Armistice, both Soviet Russian armies and Polish ones moved in to fill the vacuum. The newly independent Polish state and the Soviet government each sought territorial expansion in the region. Polish and Russian troops first clashed in February 1919, with the conflict developing into the Polishâ€“Soviet War. Unlike the Soviets' previous conflicts, this had greater implications for the export of revolution {{and the future of}} Europe. Polish forces pushed into Ukraine and by May 1920 had taken Kiev from the Soviets. After forcing the Polish Army back, Lenin urged the Red Army to invade Poland itself, believing that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the Russian troops and thus spark European revolution. Trotsky and other Bolsheviks were sceptical, but agreed to the invasion. The Polish proletariat did not rise, and the Red Army was defeated at the Battle of Warsaw. The Polish armies pushed the Red Army back into Russia, forcing Sovnarkom <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace; the war culminated in the Peace of Riga, in which Russia ceded territory to Poland.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} failure of the last Arab attempt to conquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople, regular, almost annual raids were {{undertaken}} by the Caliphate's forces into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 782, a major invasion, led by the Abbasid heir apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid (r. 786â€“809), resulted in a humiliating settlement for Byzantium, which was forced <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> a truce in exchange for an annual payment of 160,000 gold nomismata. In 785, Empress-regent Irene of Athens resolved to cease the payment of the tribute, and warfare recommenced. The Arabs raided the Armeniac Theme, but in early 786 the Byzantines retaliated by sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids had spent the last five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions against Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a {{much longer}} and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites, running for over twenty years and {{incorporating}} twenty-four battles that led to massive casualties on both sides. The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course: the Samnites seized Neapolis in the Capture of Neapolis in 327 BC, which the Romans then re-captured before losing at the Battle of the Caudine Forks and the Battle of Lautulae. The Romans then proved victorious at the Battle of Bovianum and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. This pattern of meeting aggression in force and so inadvertently gaining territory in strategic counter-attacks {{was to become a}} common feature of Roman military history.|$|E
