5|$|The {{selection}} {{process for the}} IMO varies greatly by country. In some countries, especially those in east Asia, the {{selection process}} involves several tests of a difficulty comparable to the IMO itself. The Chinese contestants go through a camp. In others, such as the USA, possible participants go {{through a series of}} easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty. In the USA, the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions, the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, each of which is a competition in its own right. For high scorers in the final competition for the team selection, <b>there</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> a summer camp, like that of China.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate over}} the {{relative}} importance of the units themselves. For instance, is it group or individual selection that has driven the evolution of altruism? Where altruism reduces the fitness of individuals, individual-centered explanations for the evolution of altruism become complex and rely on the use of game theory, for instance; see kin selection and group selection. <b>There</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> {{debate over the}} definition of the units themselves, and the roles for selection and replication, and whether these roles may change in the course of evolution.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} another {{explanation}} {{for the creation of}} the depression. The Padma has been changing its course over the centuries. In Ven den Brouck's map of Bengal, prepared in 1660, the main channel of the Padma is shown as flowing through Faridpur-Bakharganj, but <b>there</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> a suggestion of another, possibly earlier channel. This channel runs through Rampur Boalia in Rajshahi, Chalan Beel, Dhaleswari and Buriganga before meeting the Meghna. At that time the Jamuna was virtually non-existent and the Brahmaputra used to flow through its old channel.|$|E
25|$|It {{was common}} {{at one time}} {{to suggest that the}} cornicles were the source of the honeydew, and this was even {{included}} in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and the 2008 edition of the World Book Encyclopedia. In fact, honeydew secretions are produced from the anus of the aphid, while cornicles mostly produce defensive chemicals such as waxes. <b>There</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> evidence of cornicle wax attracting aphid predators in some cases. Aphids are also known to defend themselves from attack by parasitoid wasps by kicking.|$|E
25|$|The {{city also}} houses the Ukrainian Premier League and UEFA Europa League {{football}} club, FC Dnipro.

Beside the association football club <b>there</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> a bandy team under the same name, basketball team and others. However, FC Dnipro is not a multi-sport club. The club is owned by the Privat Group.|$|E

25|$|It is suspected, though, {{that the}} figures of Bangladeshi {{migrants}} in India are too far-fetched to be accorded any credence. The diplomatic difficulty is increased {{by the failure of}} conspiracy theorists in India to comprehend that supporting Indian rebels in a plot to carve out a Greater Bangladesh would bring very little strategic dividend to Bangladesh. Scholars have also reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. <b>There</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> an alleged parallel threat of turning Assam into a part of a Greater West Bengal.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{causes for}} the {{evolution}} of human bipedalism involve freeing the hands for carrying and using tools, sexual dimorphism in provisoning, changes in climate and environment (from jungle to savanna) that favored a more elevated eye-position, and {{to reduce the amount of}} skin exposed to the tropical sun. It is possible that bipedalism provided a variety of benefits to the hominin species, and scientists have suggested multiple reasons for evolution of human bipedalism. <b>There</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> not only question of why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal but also why did hominins become more bipedal over time. For example, the postural feeding hypothesis explains for how earliest hominins became for the benefit of reaching out for food in trees while the savanna-based theory describes how the late hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal.|$|E
25|$|Stretching inland {{from the}} Aegean coastal plain, the Central Anatolia Region {{occupies}} {{the area between}} the two zones of the folded mountains, extending east {{to the point where}} the two ranges converge. The plateau-like, semi-arid highlands of Anatolia are considered the heartland of the country. The region varies in elevation from 600 to 1,200 meters from west to east. The two largest basins on the plateau are the Konya Ovası and the basin occupied by the large salt lake, Tuz Gölü. Both basins are characterized by inland drainage. Wooded areas are confined to the northwest and northeast of the plateau. Rain-fed cultivation is widespread, with wheat being the principal crop. Irrigated agriculture is restricted to the areas surrounding rivers and wherever sufficient underground water is available. Important irrigated crops include barley, corn, cotton, various fruits, grapes, opium poppies, sugar beets, roses, and tobacco. <b>There</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> extensive grazing throughout the plateau.|$|E
