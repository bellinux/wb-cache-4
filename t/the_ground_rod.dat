50|$|In {{areas with}} {{high-resistance}} soil, {{the resistance of}} the soil wastes energy. Another issue is that the resistance may be high enough that insufficient current flows into the earth neutral, causing <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> <b>rod</b> to float to higher voltages. Self-resetting circuit breakers usually reset because of a difference in voltage between line and neutral. Therefore, with dry, high-resistance soils, the reduced difference in voltage between line and neutral may prevent breakers from resetting. In Australia, locations with very dry soils need <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> <b>rods</b> to be extra deep.Experience in Alaska shows that SWER needs to be grounded below permafrost, which is high-resistance.|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{existence}} {{of a number of}} works related to transient analysis of grounding systems in general, more detailled analysis of the influence of different parameters on their performance is available only for ground grid. In power distribution systems and in telecommunication installations, ground rod are widely used. All conclusion done in transient analysis for ground grids are not fully applicable for ground rod. Thus, complementary analysis of influence of some parameters on the transient performance of ground rod is of importance.

40|$|In the {{grounding}} {{systems with}} a two layers soil, {{the calculation of}} the surface potential using the image method is sometimes impossible due to singularities, avoiding researchers to use the method for electrodes in the bottom layer. In the literature this problem solution is refereed as unreliable or solved with other more complex methods. This paper presents {{a new approach to}} calculate the surface potentials in a two. layer soil, for electrodes in the bottom layer, when images are at surface. The singularities in computing surface voltage, when the first image upwards lies at surface, are analysed and it's shown that a small change in top layer thickness allows an approximate solution. Surface potentials due to grid conductor are also considered and the values of resistance are compared with those from other methodologies. Singularities for a ground rod that crosses the two layers are also treated. The obtained values of resistance are not satisfactory, due to lower segments images that overlap the upper segments.

40|$|Abstract—A test airport runway {{lighting}} system, including a buried cable {{protected by a}} counterpoise and vertical <b>ground</b> <b>rods,</b> was subjected to direct lightning strikes, and currents and voltages measured {{in different parts of}} the system were reported earlier by Bejleri et al. In this paper, we attempt to model the lightning interaction with this system using the transmission line theory. Lumped devices along the cable such as current regulator and transformers are ignored; possible nonlinear phenomena (arcing) in the system are neglected; the soil is assumed to be homogeneous. The model-predicted currents in <b>the</b> counterpoise, <b>ground</b> <b>rod,</b> and <b>the</b> cable are compared with the measurements, and a reasonable agreement was found for the currents along the counterpoise. It is found that current in the counterpoise is not much influenced by the presence of the cable. Further, vertical <b>ground</b> <b>rods</b> connected to <b>the</b> counterpoise do not have significant influence on the current distribution along the counterpoise. It appears that the model is unable to predict cable currents and voltages in the test system, presumably due to neglecting nonlinear phenomena in the soil and in cable’s insulation and electromagnetic coupling with the lightning channel.
