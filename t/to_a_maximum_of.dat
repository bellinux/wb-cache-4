5|$|There {{are four}} Mira {{variable}} stars in Auriga: R Aurigae, UV Aurigae, U Aurigae, and X Aurigae, {{all of which}} are type M stars. More specifically, R Aurigae is of type M7III, UV Aurigae is of type C6 (a carbon star), U Aurigae is of type M9, and X Aurigae is of type K2. R Aurigae, with a period of 457.5 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.9 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> 6.7. UV Aurigae, with a period of 394.4 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 10.6 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> 7.4.

5|$|If {{someone is}} {{found guilty of}} an attempt, they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. This {{provides}} that anyone who attempts to commit an offence will be punished with {{the same period in}} prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> seven years.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E

Cape May reports a storm surge of 2.6feet (.79m). Five rivers, including the Raritan River, withhold too much water and exceed flood stages. Strong wind gusts leave over 650,000citizens without power during the storm's passage. Floyd caused great damage {{in the state and}} six casualties.|$|E

5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
5|$|Algol (from the Arabic رأس الغول Ra's al-Ghul, {{which means}} The Demon's Head), also {{known by its}} Bayer {{designation}} Beta Persei, is the best-known star in Perseus. Representing {{the eye of the}} Gorgon Medusa in Greek mythology, it was called Horus in Egyptian mythology and Rosh ha Satan ("Satan's Head") in Hebrew. Located 92.8 light-years from Earth, it varies in apparent magnitude from a minimum of 3.5 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> 2.3 over a period of 2.867 days.|$|E
5|$|Barton Fink premiered in May 1991 at the Cannes Film Festival. Beating {{competition}} {{which included}} Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, and David Mamet's Homicide, the Coen brothers' film won three awards: Best Director, Best Actor, {{and the top}} prize Palme d'Or. This sweep of awards in major categories at Cannes was extremely rare, and some critics felt the jury was too generous {{to the exclusion of}} other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> two awards.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
5|$|France also {{committed}} military {{assets to}} the coalition; in October 1990, eight Jaguar A aircraft {{along with several}} Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft {{were sent to the}} Middle East, with the Mirages, which had more advanced avionics, acting as guides for the Jaguars. Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with GPS receivers, RAF Tornadoes also required adaption to a lesser extent. The French Jaguar force in Saudi Arabia built up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> 28 aircraft, which carried out 615 combat sorties, with one Jaguar damaged by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile. Typical targets were Iraqi armoured units, Scud missile sites, and naval vessels.|$|E
5|$|HB 3466 {{would have}} {{increased}} penalties {{for possession of}} under an ounce of marijuana from an infraction (traffic ticket-like offense) to a Class A misdemeanor, the worst non-felony offense, with a fine of $100 to $1,000 per gram, up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> $5,000. The bill also would have created a new crime—being {{under the influence of}} marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. The bill would have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E

5|$|In 1989 Capuano ran {{for mayor}} {{a third time}} in and won. Capuano served as mayor from 1990 to 1999, where he earned a {{reputation}} as a hands-on administrator. One of his priorities was to lower the city's population density, which at time was the highest of any New England municipality, by using state grants to demolish several buildings and replace them with playgrounds and parking spaces. As mayor, Capuano oversaw the reduction of school class sizes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> 19 students.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012 the Standards in Public Office Commission {{published}} the candidates' returns for campaign donations and election expenses.

Three candidates received the maximum refund allowed; the other four had too few votes and received no refund. Only donations above €638 need be reported, making the reported totals less meaningful. Gay Mitchell had stated his campaign would be funded by a Fine Gael members' lottery.|$|E
5|$|In late 1971 the FBI {{distributed}} {{lists of}} the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>of</b> $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public.
