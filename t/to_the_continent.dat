5|$|Aldfrith's reign is {{considered}} the beginning of Northumbria's Golden Age, which lasted {{until the end of}} the 8th century. The period saw the flowering of Insular art in Northumbria and produced the Lindisfarne Gospels, perhaps begun in Aldfrith's time, the scholarship of Bede, and the beginnings of the Anglo-Saxon missions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the {{expiration}} of the trademark {{in the late}} 1990s, Burger King unsuccessfully tried to introduce the brand <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> After losing a lawsuit filed against it by Hungry Jack's ownership, the company ceded the territory to its franchisee. Hungry Jack's is now the only Burger King brand in Australia; Cowin's company Hungry Jack's PTY is the master franchise and thus is now responsible for oversight of the operations that country with Burger King only providing administrative and advertising support to ensure a common marketing scheme for {{the company and its}} products.|$|E

5|$|Bede was a Northumbrian, {{and this}} tinged {{his work with}} a local bias. The sources {{to which he had}} access gave him less {{information}} about the west of England than for other areas. He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of Boniface, a West Saxon missionary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> He also is parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm, a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held imperium, or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, Ceawlin, is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. Historian Robin Fleming states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's {{family had}} been exiled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continent</b> in 1539. It is not known exactly when they {{returned}} to England, but it was soon after the accession of Edward VI in 1547 that Cranmer publicly acknowledged their existence. Not much is known about {{the early years of the}} children. His daughter, Margaret, was likely born in the 1530s and his son, Thomas, came later, probably during the reign of Edward. Sometime around Mary's accession, Cranmer's wife, Margarete, escaped to Germany, while his son was entrusted to his brother, Edmund Cranmer, who took him too <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continent.</b> Margarete Cranmer eventually married Cranmer's favourite publisher, Edward Whitchurch. The couple returned to England after Mary's reign and settled in Surrey. Whitchurch also negotiated for the marriage of Margaret to Thomas Norton. Whitchurch died in 1562 and Margarete married for the third time to Bartholomew Scott. She died in the 1570s. Both of Cranmer's children died without issue and his line became extinct.|$|E
5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{black jack}} is a benthopelagic species rarely found in shallow inshore waters, preferring deep, clear {{offshore}} waters [...] of depths from 12 <b>to</b> 354 m. <b>The</b> species is {{most common in}} insular oceanic habitats and around offshore islands, rarely found close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continents.</b> <b>The</b> black jack inhabits deep reefs and reef drop offs, also being common around oceanic seamounts.

5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century, universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, to Oxford or Cambridge, or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continent.</b> Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Among the destinations Paris was the most important, but also Cologne, Orléans, Wittenberg, Louvain and Vienna.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp went to Dover in late 1191 to seek {{transport}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> During his escape, he {{was unable}} to answer the local people when they spoke to him in English. He attempted to leave England in various disguises, including a monk's habit and women's clothes. Hugh Nonant wrote that Longchamp attempted on one occasion to hide dressed as a prostitute, which led to him being assaulted by a fisherman who mistook him for a whore. Longchamp eventually succeeded in leaving England, on 29October.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth and {{his growing}} force then {{continued}} north via Bridgwater, {{where he took}} up residence at Bridgwater Castle (21 June), Glastonbury (22 June) and Shepton Mallet (23 June) in worsening weather. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy captured Monmouth's ships, cutting off any hope of an escape back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> The Royalist forces of Churchill, who was now in Chard, and of Feversham, in Bristol, also received reinforcements who had marched from London.|$|E

5|$|North American birds {{most closely}} {{resemble}} those of Eurasia, which was connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> {{as part of the}} supercontinent Laurasia until around 60 million years ago. Many groups occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere and worldwide. However some groups unique to the New World have also arisen; those represented in this list are the hummingbirds, the New World vultures, the New World quail, the tyrant flycatchers, the vireos, the mimids, the New World warblers, the tanagers, the cardinals and the icterids.|$|E

5|$|The regulars and reserves—at {{least on}} paper—totalled a mobilised force of almost 700,000 men, {{although}} only 150,000 men were immediately available to be formed into the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) {{that was sent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> This consisted of six infantry divisions and one of cavalry. By contrast, the French Army in 1914 mobilised 1,650,000 troops and 62 infantry divisions, while the German Army mobilised 1,850,000 troops and 87 infantry divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade with}} the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union, when high salt duties {{prevented}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression, as the local traders were not as skilled in trading salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continent.</b> For the independent farmers of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.|$|E
