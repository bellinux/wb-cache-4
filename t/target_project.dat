40|$|In {{the early}} {{feasibility}} study stage, the {{information concerning the}} <b>target</b> <b>project</b> is very limited. It is very common in practice for a Quantity Surveyor (Q. S.) to use the mean value of the historical building price data (with similar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project)</b> to forecast the early construction cost for a <b>target</b> <b>project.</b> Most clients rely heavily on this early cost forecast, provided by the Q. S., {{and use it to}} make their investment decision and advance financial arrangement. The primary aim of this research is to develop a statistical model and demonstrate through this developed model how to measure the accuracy of mean value forecast. A secondary aim is to review the homogeneity of construction project cost. The third aim is to identify the best data pooling for mean value cost forecast in early construction stages by making the best use of the data available. Three types of mean value forecasts are considered: (1) the use of the target base group (relating to a source with similar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project),</b> (2) the use of a non-target base group (relating to sources with less or dissimilar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project)</b> and (3) the use of a combined target and non-target base group. A formulation of mean square error is derived for each to measure the forecasting accuracy. To accomplish the above research aims, this research uses cost data from 450 completed Hong Kong projects. The collected data is clustered into two levels as: (1) Level one - by project nature (i. e. Residential, Commercial centre, Car parking, Social community centre, School, Office, Hotel, Industrial, University and Hospital), (2) Level two -by project specification and construction floor area. In this research, the accuracy of mean value forecast (i. e. mean square error) for a total number of 10, 539 of combined data groups is measured. From their performance, it may reasonably be concluded that (1) the use of a non-target base group (relating to sources with less or dissimilar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project)</b> never improves the forecasting performance, (2) the use of a target base group (relating to a source with similar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project)</b> cannot always provide the best forecasting performance, (3) the use of a combined target and non-target base group in some cases can furnish a better forecasting performance, and (4) when the cost data groups are clustered into a more detailed level, it can improve the forecasting performance...|$|E
40|$|Effort {{estimation}} {{is a key}} step of any software project. This paper {{presents a}} method to estimate project effort using an improved version of analogy. Unlike estimation methods based on case-based reasoning, our method makes use of two nearest neighbors of the <b>target</b> <b>project</b> for estimation. An additional refinement based on the relative location of the <b>target</b> <b>project</b> is then applied to generate the effort estimate. We first identify the relationships between cost drivers and project effort, and then {{determine the number of}} past project data that should be used in the estimation to provide the best result. Our method is then applied to a set of maintenance projects. Based on a comparison of the estimation results from our estimation method and those of other estimation methods, we conclude that our method can provide more accurate results.
