There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{investigative tool}} at the player's disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests people {{to determine if}} they are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined points in the game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject's eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a replicant; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> human. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by asking too many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject is or is not a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{indicates}} that the more corporal punishment children receive, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners. Children who are spanked more as {{children are more likely}} as adults to approve of hitting a partner, and also experience more marital conflict and feelings of anger in general.

While these associations do not prove causation, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. According to research, corporal punishment of children predicts weaker internalisation of values such as empathy, altruism, and resistance to temptation. According to researcher Joan Durrant at the University of Manitoba, it should therefore not be surprising that corporal punishment [...] "consistently predicts increased levels of antisocial behavior [...] as well as dating violence".|$|E
2500|$|Joan Durrant at the University of Manitoba {{writes that}} {{a number of studies have}} found {{physical}} punishment to be associated with [...] "higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other factors. According to Elizabeth Gershoff at the University of Michigan, the more that children are physically punished, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners. In countries where physical punishment of children is perceived as being more culturally accepted, it is less strongly associated with increased aggression; however, physical punishment has been found to predict some increase in child aggression regardless of culture. While these associations do not prove causality, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. In examining several longitudinal studies that investigated the path from disciplinary spanking to aggression in children from preschool age through adolescence, Gershoff concluded: [...] "Spanking consistently predicted increases in children's aggression over time, regardless of how aggressive children were when the spanking occurred". similar results were found by Catherine Taylor at Tulane University in 2010. Family violence researcher Murray A. Straus argues, [...] "There are many reasons this evidence has been ignored. One of the most important is the belief that spanking is more effective than nonviolent discipline and is, therefore, sometimes necessary, despite the risk of harmful side effects".|$|E

The relationship between the independent and the dependent variables was investigated through a 65 -item survey. The population for this study included all undergraduate Latina/o students enrolled at Northern Illinois University from the 1993 fall semester through the 1998 spring semester. The 1321 surveys were distributed during fall semester 1998. Participants returned 412 usable surveys, which represents a 31 % return rate. Data generated from the instrument were collected and analyzed using statistical procedures: Bivariate and Multiple regressions. As a result of this study, a model for Latina/o student retention has been developed. Through step-wise regression, a final set of ten independent variables was selected that had a statistically significant relationship with CUMGPA: Academic Classification [...] -Hypothesis 11 (positive), Scholarship [...] -Hypothesis 6 (positive), Subjective Evaluation of Preparation [...] -Hypothesis 1 (positive), Missed Classes [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Semester GPA Below 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Subjective Evaluation of Readiness for College [...] -Hypothesis 2 (positive), Go to Community College if Semester GPA fell below a 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Would Repeat Courses if Semester GPA fell below a 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Ethnic Mix of Friends [...] -Hypothesis 8 (positive as mix move toward All Anglo), and Ethnic Identity/Support [...] -Hypothesis 3 (negative). The final Best-Fit model explained 47 % of the variance in Latina/o CUMGPA. Previous academic preparation was the strongest predictor of success. However, students more immersed in Latina/o organizations did not achieve the same level of success of those students less involved. Also, these factors must be investigated for their impact on retention, not just success. Students with a lower CUMGPA can remain enrolled and graduate, as long as they maintain the minimum GPA.

Hanson depicts modern Russia in unflattering terms as [...] "...a disaster of a declining population, corruption, authoritarianism, a warped economy, and a high rate of alcoholism." [...] Precisely because Russia is so weak, Hanson claims that Putin is driven to aggression against his neighbors with the overwhelmingly support of the Russian people {{out of a sense of}} hurt pride and a desire to make Russia great again. In 2014, Hanson called Putin [...] "evil", writing: [...] "Putin is almost Milton's Satan—as if, in his seductive evil, he yearns for clarity, perhaps even a smackdown, if not just for himself, for us as well. He is not the better man than Obama but, again like Milton's Satan, the more interesting, if only because he reminds of us of our own limitations." [...] In a 2015 column, Hanson wrote about what he views as the aims of Russian foreign policy that: [...] "Russian president Vladimir Putin thinks he can reconstitute the empire of the czars and the later Soviet Union.

30|$|The second {{interaction}} term is parental {{educational level}} and gender (i.e., parental educational level[*]×[*]gender).

Introducing gender into the question can investigate whether parents' educational level has a different impact on {{men and women in}} accessing higher education.
