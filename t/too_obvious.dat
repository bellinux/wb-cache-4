5|$|Because WALL-E overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's {{production}} {{values and}} aesthetic, without being <b>too</b> <b>obvious.</b> In the DVD commentary, Stanton {{said that he}} has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; {{it was a way to}} answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E
5|$|Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman {{citizens}} adopted into a {{new family}} usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g., Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, though some of his contemporaries did, {{there is no evidence}} that Octavius ever himself officially used the name Octavianus, as it would have made his modest origins <b>too</b> <b>obvious.</b> Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.|$|E

60|$|Besides, {{the police}} might have chosen, even by day, some other {{opportunity}} to light upon us {{than in the}} very thick of our wrestle with the extortionate prices of fresh kuruma. It was inconsiderate of them, to say the least; for the attack naturally threw us into a certain disrepute not calculated to cheapen fares. Then, <b>too,</b> our <b>obvious</b> haste helped furnish circumstantial evidence of crime.|$|R

5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Davao and Jackie Lou Blanco {{respectively}} as Cesar and Sandra Magtanggol - are Tengs adoptive parents. Teng's {{place in}} the family was a decision made by Cesars father, Lolo Aloy, and as such their feelings toward him are rather conflicted. Sandra refuses to accept Teng, let alone as a replacement child for Clarisse, the daughter she lost many years ago. Cesar is generally sympathetic, but avoids making such a sentiment <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> to Sandra.|$|E

50|$|This {{shows that}} this {{definition}} of a tensor product is <b>too</b> naive; the <b>obvious</b> fix is to define it such that it is antisymmetric, so that the middle two terms cancel. This leads {{to the concept of}} a Lie algebra.|$|R
25|$|Allen {{retired in}} 1958, and Burns tried to soldier on without her. The show was renamed The George Burns Show {{with the cast}} intact except for Allen. The locale of the show was changed from the Burns home to George Burns' office, with Blanche Morton working as Burns' {{secretary}} so she could help Allen {{keep an eye on}} him. Allen's absence was only <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> and impossible to overcome. The renamed show barely lasted a year.|$|E
25|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} episode had several laugh-out-loud moments, that he {{appreciated}} the Eye of Gulga Grymna story arc and liked the twist that Kröd's prudishness actually {{proved to be}} an asset in battle. But Fowler also said many of the jokes remain <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> and juvenile and that the supporting characters are being underused; he said the fact that Aneka has spent the last few episodes having sex with Longshaft was particularly offensive.|$|E
25|$|With {{the wild}} {{side of his}} nature given an {{occasional}} outlet McMahon settled into study and won a university scholarship, achieving an honorary degree in Arts and Town Planning which led to him becoming, for a year, a lecturer and tutor in Town Planning at The University of Sydney. McMahon has said he became interested in studying town planning as a possible future way of correcting the all <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> mistakes he found in the running of Blacktown. He wrote a treatise on the subject but became disillusioned when he realised the many political and vested interests trying to prevent the ideal becoming a reality.|$|E
40|$|Say ‘fjord’ and, not surprisingly, {{most people}} picture the {{stunning}} {{west coast of}} Norway. Fjord is a general Nordic name for a marine inlet, mostly used for inlets made by glaciers.

50|$|Critical {{reception}} for Far from Home has been negative. DVD Verdict panned the movie, as {{they felt that}} the film exploited Barrymore - who was fourteen at the time - as a sexual object and was also too predictably plotted.

25|$|On April 11, 2007, Steve Capus of NBC News, {{announced}} that MSNBC {{would no longer}} simulcast Imus in the Morning, effective immediately. While the decision came {{on the same day}} that a few advertisers left Imus, the network also said employee concerns played a role. Sen. (and at the time presidential candidate) Barack Obama, and several high-profile NBC black personalities, including Al Roker previously a friendly guest on the show, opposed Imus's return. The absence and silence from Imus's frequent NBC guests Brian Williams, Andrea Mitchell, David Gregory, Chris Matthews and close friend Tim Russert was <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> to ignore and foreshadowed NBC's future action.|$|E
25|$|On 14 August Galatea {{attempted}} {{to cut out}} the French privateer Général Ernouf, which had been the British sloop-of-war Lilly). She was sheltering at the Saintes near Guadeloupe where shore batteries could protect her. The attack was a debacle for the British, who failed completely in their attempt. Galateas captain, Henry Heathcote, had been <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> in his reconnoitering and the French {{were waiting for the}} night attack. In all, the British lost some 10 men killed, including Lieutenant Charles Hayman, the commander of the boarding party, and first lieutenant of Galatea, and 55 or more wounded or captured. The French lost four killed and suffered some wounded, among them Captain Lapointe, commander of the Général Ernouf, and Lieutenant Mouret, commander of the detachment of troops the French stationed aboard her in anticipation of the attack. The French also captured Galateas barge, which the other three boats of the cutting out party could not retrieve as they made their escape.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the play with the {{illusion}} of space in the painting {{can be seen in}} the young man at the top of the ladder holding the nails withdrawn from Christ's body. Campbell points out that this servant behind the cross appears to have caught his sleeve in the wooden tracery depicted at the top of the painting. The head of one of the bloody nails that he holds is in front of the fictional wooden picture frame, though the point of the other nail is behind the tracery. Campbell argues that, in order to prevent these spatial distortion from becoming <b>too</b> <b>obvious,</b> Rogier took pains to conceal the principal pictorial junctions in the picture. For example, the ladder is in an impossible perspective: its top is behind the cross while its foot appears to be in front of the cross. To conceal the points at which the Cross and the ladder meet the landscape, Rogier has greatly lengthened the Virgin's left leg, so that her left foot and mantle cover the base of the Cross and one upright of the ladder.|$|E
5000|$|The other {{referred}} to a supporter of Ronald Reagan as [...] "a flaming fascist".

Hamilton thought Karim was not as dangerous as some supposed {{but that he was}} [...] "a stupid man, and on that account he may become a tool in the hands of other men." [...] In early 1896, Karim returned to India on six months' leave, and Hamilton and Elgin placed him under [...] "unobtrusive" [...] surveillance. They dared not be <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> lest the Munshi notice and complain to the Queen. Despite fears that Karim might meet with hostile agents, his visit home appears to have been uneventful.|$|E
500|$|The {{use of the}} 'Tainted Love' {{sample was}} well {{received}} by critics. Ruth Jamieson of The Observer commented that the sample was an [...] "outrageously hooky Soft Cell rhythm". Jazzily Bass of Contactmusic.com complimented {{the inclusion of the}} [...] "Tainted Love" [...] sample, describing [...] "SOS" [...] as [...] "superbly infectious". Bass continued to praise the song for not making the sample <b>too</b> <b>obvious,</b> writing [...] "I was accepting it to sound like every other song that has sampled the hook."

500|$|The second revised {{design is}} said to [...] "subliminate both {{elevated}} site and female gender" [...] with a [...] "lonely phallus", without the original planned animated circular ring representing the female reproductive organs. Ledoux drew upon phallic and sexually charged inspiration in other buildings which he designed. His design of Besançon Theatre for instance was fueled by the exigencies of prostitution and ancient sexual ritual. However, {{in comparison to the}} likes of Jean-Jacques Lequeu, who gained notoriety for his pornographic architectural concoctions, Ledoux's architectural inspiration was relatively mild, and he {{is said to}} have omitted towers from his designs on occasion as he was aware that they would be frowned upon shamefully by general society as a <b>too</b> <b>obvious</b> representation of the phallus; Ledoux's [...] "missing erection" [...] is explained to this effect in Jacques Lecan's Significance of the Missing Phalus.|$|E
60|$|Listening to {{ordinary}} talk about health, disease, and death, one is often led to entertain a doubt whether the speakers {{believe that the}} course of natural causation runs as smoothly {{in the human body}} as elsewhere. Indications are <b>too</b> often <b>obvious</b> of a strong, though perhaps an unavowed and half unconscious, under-current of opinion that the phenomena of life are not only widely different, in their superficial characters and in their practical importance, from other natural events, but that they do not follow in that definite order which characterises the succession of all other occurrences, and the statement of which we call a law of nature.|$|R

500|$|There {{was another}} {{obstacle}} to overcome, however. The military Enigma had been modified from the commercial Enigma, of which Rejewski {{had had an}} actual example to study. In the commercial machine, the keys were connected to the entry drum in German keyboard order ("QWERTZU..."). However, in the military Enigma, the connections had instead been wired in alphabetical order: [...] "ABCDEF..." [...] This new wiring sequence foiled British cryptologists working on Enigma, who dismissed the [...] "ABCDEF..." [...] wiring as <b>too</b> <b>obvious.</b> Rejewski, perhaps guided by an intuition about a German fondness for order, simply guessed that the wiring was the normal alphabetic ordering. He later recalled that, after he had made this assumption, [...] "from my pencil, as by magic, began to issue numbers designating the connections in rotor N. Thus the connections in one rotor, the right-hand rotor, were finally known." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response was}} mixed. James Hunt of the website Den of Geek listed [...] "Bound" [...] as the fourth best episode of Enterprise, {{saying that it}} [...] "found a way to include [...] {{in a way that}} preserved the eye candy and shifted the power in the Orion relationships." [...] However, Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave [...] "Bound" [...] a score of one out of four, saying that it was [...] "too dumb, <b>too</b> <b>obvious,</b> too boring, and too rooted in gender stereotypes". He said that it was sexist and [...] "the worst episode of Enterprise in more than two years". Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation said that it was the single worst episode of any Star Trek series, including [...] "Spock's Brain". She considered it a statement in misogyny and also thought that it represented a scenario where homosexual characters do not exist.|$|E
500|$|Favreau's {{main concern}} with the film's effects was whether the {{transition}} between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be <b>too</b> <b>obvious.</b> He hired Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to create {{the bulk of the}} visual effects for the film after seeing [...] and Transformers. The Orphanage and The Embassy did additional work, with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor. To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a motion capture suit, and skydivers were filmed in a vertical wind tunnel to study the physics of flying. For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses.|$|E
5000|$|The Dor Dai {{response}} to this is that, however this may be in theory, these warnings have not been observed. Kabbalah, in its most literal and [...] "realistic" [...] sense, has in fact been extensively popularised, {{with the result that}} many otherwise pious Jewish groups are now permeated with superstition, so that the whole enterprise is now more trouble than it is worth. Further, the claim that these works, on their true interpretation, are harmless metaphorical imagery fully compatible with monotheism is disingenuous: the origins of most Kabbalistic concepts in pagan systems such as Neoplatonism and Gnosticism are <b>too</b> glaringly <b>obvious</b> to be ignored. (Dor Daim do not claim that Kabbalists are in fact polytheists: only that they are inconsistent.) ...|$|R
