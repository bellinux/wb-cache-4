50|$|Due to {{the release}} of alpha particles, <b>Thorotrast</b> was found to be {{extremely}} carcinogenic. There is a high over-incidence of various cancers in patients who have been treated with <b>Thorotrast.</b> The cancers occur some years (usually 20-30) after injection of <b>Thorotrast.</b> The risk of developing liver cancer (or bile duct cancer) in former <b>Thorotrast</b> patients has been measured to be well above 100 times the risk {{of the rest of the}} population. The risk of leukemia appears to be 20 times higher in <b>Thorotrast</b> patients. <b>Thorotrast</b> exposure has also been associated with the development of angiosarcoma.

50|$|The Danish {{director}} Nils Malmros's movie, Facing the Truth (original Danish title At Kende Sandheden) from 2002, {{portrays the}} dilemma that faced Malmros's father, Richard Malmros, when treating his {{patients in the}} 1940s. Richard Malmros was deeply concerned about the persistence of <b>Thorotrast</b> in the body but was forced to use <b>Thorotrast,</b> because the only available alternative (per-abrodil) had serious immediate side-effects, suffered from image quality problems and was difficult to obtain during the Second World War. The use of <b>Thorotrast</b> in Denmark ended in 1947 when safer alternatives became available. Today, iodinated hydrophilic molecules are universally used as injected contrast agents for X-ray procedures.|$|E

50|$|In January 1988, Ritzau {{journalist}} Jens Jørgen Espersen {{received the}} Cavling Award for his covering of the <b>Thorotrast</b> scandal.|$|E
50|$|The film {{opens in}} 1944, {{as a young}} {{fisherman}} who has suffered a stroke due to aneurysm is being attended to by a neurosurgeon, Dr. Richard Malmros (Jens Albinus). Malmros operates on the fisherman after injecting him with <b>Thorotrast,</b> a radioactive contrast medium and the operation is a success. However, 42 years later, the patient develops liver cancer and dies. His widow sues the hospital claiming that the <b>Thorotrast</b> caused the liver cancer. The story flashes back through the life of Richard Malmros. As a child he lived in poverty. His father is unemployed due to World War I. His childhood and later life are greatly influenced by his aunt who is a devout Christian and always warns {{about the danger of}} sin. The story continues through his schoolboy days, his university education, and his marriage, which he feels tricked into. The film focuses on the ambiguity of the 'truth' reported in the media as well as the personal dilemma that Richard Malmros faced: his knowledge of the dangers of <b>Thorotrast,</b> and the decision he had to make when there were no alternatives. He could use the <b>Thorotrast,</b> or risk having them die right there, and this was a decision he had to make. The old Richard acknowledges that if he had known what he knows today, clearly some patients should not have been given <b>Thorotrast.</b> Although he is vindicated in court, he remains haunted by feelings of guilt, which he carries from the strong influence of his aunt in his childhood.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{contrast}} media was sometimes highly dangerous, but these dangers were {{not well understood}} during {{the development of the}} early types of {{contrast media}}, such as <b>Thorotrast.</b>|$|E
50|$|Even at {{the time}} of introduction, there was concern about the safety of <b>Thorotrast.</b> Following injection, the drug is {{distributed}} to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone, where it is absorbed. After this initial absorption, redistribution takes place at a very slow pace. Specifically, the biological half-life is estimated to be 22 years. This means that the organs of patients who have been given <b>Thorotrast</b> will be exposed to internal alpha radiation {{for the rest of their}} lives. The significance of this long-term exposure was not fully understood {{at the time}} of Thorotrast's introduction in 1931.|$|E
50|$|Thorium dioxide was {{the primary}} {{ingredient}} in the once-common radiocontrast agent <b>Thorotrast.</b> Its use was abandoned when it {{was found to be}} a carcinogen, sometimes causing cholangiocarcinoma. As many as 10 million patients were treated with <b>Thorotrast.</b> It offered excellent image enhancement and almost no immediate side effects but was associated with a significantly higher incidence of cancer later in life, often occurring decades following its administration (with one large study showing a median life-expectancy reduction of 14 years experienced by those treated with it). Today, iodinated solutions (injected) or barium sulfate (ingested) are the standard X-ray contrast agents.|$|E
50|$|Thorium {{has been}} linked to liver cancer. In the past thoria (thorium dioxide) was used as a {{contrast}} agent for medical X-ray radiography but its use has been discontinued. It was sold under the name <b>Thorotrast.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thorium {{compounds}} produce excellent images {{because of}} thorium's high opacity to X-rays (it {{has a high}} cross section for absorption). Unfortunately, thorium is retained in the body, and it is radioactive, emitting harmful alpha radiation as it decays. Because the suspension offered high image quality and had virtually no immediate side-effects compared to the alternatives available at the time, <b>Thorotrast</b> became widely used after its introduction in 1931. (António Egas Moniz contributed to its development.). About 2 to 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with <b>Thorotrast.</b> However, today it has shown an increase risk in certain cancers such as cholangiocarcinomas and angiosarcomas of the liver.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "angiosarcoma", {{when used}} without a modifier, usually refers to hemangiosarcoma. However, glomangiosarcoma (8710/3) and lymphangiosarcoma (9170/3) are {{distinct}} conditions humans.

5000|$|Barium sulfate in {{suspension}} is frequently used medically as a radiocontrast agent for X-ray imaging and other diagnostic procedures. It {{is most often}} used in imaging of the GI tract during what is colloquially known as a [...] "barium meal". It is administered orally, or by enema, as a suspension of fine particles in a thick milk like solution (often with sweetening and flavoring agents added). Although barium is a heavy metal, and its water-soluble compounds are often highly toxic, the low solubility of barium sulfate protects the patient from absorbing harmful amounts of the metal. Barium sulfate is also readily removed from the body, unlike <b>Thorotrast,</b> which it replaced. Due to the relatively high atomic number (Z = 56) of barium, its compounds absorb X-rays stronger than compounds derived from lighter nuclei.|$|E
50|$|CERCLA {{identifies}} all radionuclides as carcinogens, {{although the}} nature of the emitted radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, or neutron and the radioactive strength), its consequent capacity to cause ionization in tissues, and the magnitude of radiation exposure, determine the potential hazard. Carcinogenicity of radiation depends on the type of radiation, type of exposure, and penetration. For example, alpha radiation has low penetration and is not a hazard outside the body, but emitters are carcinogenic when inhaled or ingested. For example, <b>Thorotrast,</b> a (incidentally radioactive) suspension previously used as a contrast medium in x-ray diagnostics, is a potent human carcinogen known because of its retention within various organs and persistent emission of alpha particles. Low-level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage (leading to replicational and transcriptional errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions) leading to pre-mature aging and cancer.|$|E
50|$|Contrast {{compounds}} containing barium or iodine, {{which are}} radiopaque, can be ingested in the gastrointestinal tract (barium) or injected in the artery or veins to highlight these vessels. The contrast compounds have high atomic numbered elements {{in them that}} (like bone) essentially block the X-rays and hence the once hollow organ or vessel can be more readily seen. In the pursuit of nontoxic contrast materials, many types of high atomic number elements were evaluated. Unfortunately, some elements chosen proved to be harmful - for example, thorium was once used as a contrast medium (<b>Thorotrast)</b> - {{which turned out to}} be toxic, causing a very high incidence of cancer decades after use. Modern contrast material has improved and, while there is no way to determine who may have a sensitivity to the contrast, the incidence of serious allergic reactions is low.|$|E
5000|$|Working with {{asbestos}} is {{the most}} common risk factor for mesothelioma. In the United States, asbestos is considered the major cause of malignant mesothelioma and has been considered [...] "indisputably" [...] associated with the development of mesothelioma. Indeed, the relationship between asbestos and mesothelioma is so strong that many consider mesothelioma a “signal” or “sentinel” tumor. A history of asbestos exposure exists in most cases. However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos. In rare cases, mesothelioma has also been associated with irradiation of the chest or abdomen, intrapleural thorium dioxide (<b>thorotrast)</b> as a contrast medium, and inhalation of other fibrous silicates, such as erionite or talc. Some studies suggest that simian virus 40 (SV40) may act as a cofactor in the development of mesothelioma. This has been confirmed in animal studies, but studies in humans are inconclusive. Pericardial mesothelioma may not be associated with asbestos exposure.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} cholangiocarcinoma {{has not been}} clearly defined. A number of {{pathologic}} conditions, however, resulting in either acute or chronic biliary tract epithelial injury may predispose to malignant change. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, an idiopathic inflammatory condition of the biliary tree, has been clearly associated {{with the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma in up to 40% of patients. Congenital biliary cystic disease, such as choledochal cysts or Caroli's disease, has also been associated with malignant transformation in up to 25% of cases. These conditions appear to be related to an anomalous pancreatico-biliary duct junction and, perhaps, are related to the reflux of pancreatic secretions into the bile duct. Chronic biliary tract parasitic infection, seen commonly in Southeast Asia due to Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini, has also been identified as a risk factor. Although gallstones and cholecystectomy are not thought to be associated with an increased incidence of cholangiocarcinoma, hepatolithiasis and choledocholithiasis may predispose to malignant change. Further, industrial exposure to asbestos and nitrosamines, {{and the use of the}} radiologic contrast agent, <b>Thorotrast</b> (thorium dioxide), are considered to be risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the short}} range of {{absorption}} and inability to penetrate the outer layers of skin, alpha particles are not, in general, dangerous to life unless the source is ingested or inhaled. Because of this high mass and strong absorption, if alpha-emitting radionuclides do enter the body (upon being inhaled, ingested, or injected, as {{with the use of}} <b>Thorotrast</b> for high-quality X-ray images prior to the 1950s), alpha radiation is the most destructive form of ionizing radiation. It is the most strongly ionizing, and with large enough doses can cause any or all of the symptoms of radiation poisoning. It is estimated that chromosome damage from alpha particles is anywhere from 10 to 1000 times greater than that caused by an equivalent amount of gamma or beta radiation, with the average being set at 20 times. A study of European nuclear workers exposed internally to alpha radiation from plutonium and uranium found that when relative biological effectiveness is considered to be 20, the carcinogenic potential (in terms of lung cancer) of alpha radiation appears to be consistent with that reported for doses of external gamma radiation i.e. a given dose of alpha-particles inhaled presents the same risk as a 20-times higher dose of gamma radiation. The powerful alpha emitter polonium-210 (a milligram of 210Po emits as many alpha particles per second as 4.215 grams of 226Ra) is suspected of playing a role in lung cancer and bladder cancer related to tobacco smoking. 210Po was used to kill Russian dissident and ex-FSB officer Alexander V. Litvinenko in 2006.|$|E
