30|$|In this paper, {{a patent}} family {{from a country}} {{is defined as a}} family {{containing}} at least one patent of which at least one applicant is from that country. The applicant’s country is used instead of <b>the</b> <b>inventor’s</b> country because <b>the</b> applicants designate the owners or party in control of the invention, mostly firms (OECD 2009). Therefore it reflects the innovative performance of the given country’s firms, while <b>the</b> <b>inventor’s</b> country is usually <b>the</b> <b>inventor’s</b> professional address.|$|R

5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed planar technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. <b>The</b> <b>inventor</b> of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially triplate and microstrip. The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E
