5|$|Christians {{from many}} traditions were critical, saying the {{movement}} was hyper-emotional, misused Scripture and lost focus on Christ by overemphasizing the Holy Spirit. Within a short time ministers were warning their congregations {{to stay away from}} the Azusa Street Mission. Some called the police and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the building shut down.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years, he was {{assisted}} {{by the man}} who had become his trusted prime-minister, Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna (1635–1680). Some sources say the king was basically dependent on Gyllenstierna,. His sudden death in 1680 opened up the road to the monarch, and many men <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> close to the king to take Gyllenstierna's place.|$|E

5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned as they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across the river. It is thus likely that {{about a third of}} the German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E

England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings.

He created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which {{was used by the}} institute to teach visiting students about the animal life of tide pools. The comic starred various anthropomorphic sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters. Hillenburg <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the comic professionally published, but none of the companies that he sent it to were interested.|$|E

At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane outside and drove over a dummy of Paul Bearer before driving off with the real one again.|$|E
5|$|Before Massino became boss, John Gotti {{was one of}} {{his closest}} allies. Massino had backed Gotti in his plot to take over the Gambino family, and as Gambino boss, Gotti <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Massino a seat on the Commission as the Bonannos' acting boss. Gotti was {{reportedly}} infuriated that Massino had been officially promoted without him being consulted, and Massino would later testify he believed Gotti conspired with Vitale to kill him. Gotti, however, was marginalized by his 1992 racketeering and murder conviction and consequent life imprisonment. Massino, for his own part, was angered at Gotti's high public profile and later criticized Gotti for killing his predecessor Paul Castellano. Massino also had a poor relationship with Vincent Gigante, who had backed the opposition to Rastelli and blocked Gotti's attempts to bring Massino onto the Commission.|$|E
5|$|Brandenburg-Prussia {{tried to}} acquire Crab Island in 1687, but {{the island was}} claimed also by Denmark, England and Spain, and when a second {{expedition}} in 1692 found the island in Danish hands, the plan was abandoned. 1689, Brandenburg-Prussia annexed Peter Island, but the small rock proved ineligible for trade or settlement. In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by England, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with England {{did not result in}} an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a hold of Tortola, but England denied them settlement. Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.|$|E

5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the March 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. The new Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ITAK's support for his minority government but refused to give into ITAK's demands to end state-sponsored colonisation of Tamil-majority areas by Sinhalese, regional autonomy and the rights of Indian Tamils. As a result, ITAK started negotiations with the opposition SLFP who agreed to introduce the provisions of the B-C pact as bills in parliament. During the negotiations on forming an alternate stable government Chelvanayakam informed the Governor-General that ITAK would support a SLFP government for a full term and as result the Governor-General dissolved parliament.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Kemp {{to run in}} the 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to have felt that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Lorraine, Charles V {{was without}} an heir and Marguerite-Louise, as the {{daughter}} of a Lorrainer princess, delegated the right to succeed to the duchy to her elder son, Ferdinando. Grand Duke Cosimo <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his son international recognition as heir-apparent, to no avail. Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, supported Cosimo's claim, not wanting to see Lorraine revert to France. The Treaties of Nijmegen, which concluded the Franco-Dutch War, did not rubber stamp Cosimo's ambitions, as he had wished. The Lorrainer question was concluded with the birth of a son to Charles V in 1679, ending Cosimo's dream of a Medici cadet branch, dreams which were to be revived in 1697 by Gian Gastone's marriage to an heiress.|$|E

Usually buildings less than fifty years old are not considered, but the building's significance in Modern architecture kept the state of Pennsylvania and the National Park Service interested. While not designated a National Historic Landmark, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 9, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was called for}} 17 September 1878. Fearful that Macdonald would be defeated in Kingston, his supporters <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him {{to run in the}} safe Conservative riding of Cardwell; having represented his hometown for 35years, he stood there again. In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by Alexander Gunn, but the Conservatives swept to victory. Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for Marquette, Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of Victoria, where the {{election was}} to be held on 21 October. Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria, although he had never visited either Marquette or Victoria.|$|E
