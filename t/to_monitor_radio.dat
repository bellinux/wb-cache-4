Portable sweep equipment may be used to detect some types of covert listening device (bugs).|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview on European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) activities related to opportunistic spectrum sharing technology with a specific focus on (TV) white spaces. Key use cases are outlined and a novel approach for a coordinated and an uncoordinated approach for accessing the spectrum resource is given. A spectrum coordinator is indeed introduced in order to handle resource management. Furthermore, database system design and inter-database communication solutions are discussed as they are introduced by ETSI. Finally, various sensing mechanisms are detailed, which allow <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the <b>radio</b> environment and to feed decision-making components correspondingly. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The audio quality of the alert that KOPB-FM received via the NPR Squawk Channel was exceptionally poor, and most monitoring stations' equipment did not recognize the alert at all or only broadcast the first few seconds of the alert. The FCC has since expanded PEP coverage to West of the Cascades (including Portland).|$|R

50|$|In essence, a trunked {{radio system}} is a packet {{switching}} computer network. Users' radios send data packets to a computer, operating on a dedicated frequency — called a control channel — to request communication on a specific talk-group. The controller sends a digital signal <b>to</b> all <b>radios</b> <b>monitoring</b> that talkgroup, instructing the radios to automatically switch to the frequency indicated by the system <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the transmission. After the user is done speaking, the users' <b>radios</b> return <b>to</b> <b>monitoring</b> the control channel for additional transmissions.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{simultaneously}} optimize network lifetime and latency in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN), an always-on wake-up receiver (WuRx) can be used <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the <b>radio</b> link continuously. For truly autonomous sensor nodes employing energy scavenging, only 50 μW power is available for the WuRx [1]. An envelope detector is a popular choice in WuRx because of its low power consumption. However, the detector is always the bottleneck of the receiver sensitivity since it attenuates low level input signal and adds excessive noise. One way of improving sensitivity is to amplify the signal before the detector, for example at RF [2, 3] or IF [4] stages, to enhance the SNR at the output. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
