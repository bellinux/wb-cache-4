5|$|Monument 67 is a badly eroded Olmec-style {{sculpture}} {{showing a}} figure emerging from <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jaguar, {{with one hand}} raised and gripping a staff. Traces of a helmet are visible. It is located {{to the west of}} Structure 12 and dates to the Middle Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Romani people drove {{steel or}} iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears {{and between the}} fingers {{at the time of}} burial. They also placed {{hawthorn}} in the corpse's sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near Venice, a brick forced into <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006. In Bulgaria, over 100 skeletons with metal objects, such as plough bits, embedded in the torso have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Nama {{assemblage}} is best {{represented in}} Namibia. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms, while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers. These beds are sandwiched between units comprising interbedded sandstones, siltstones and shales – with microbial mats, where present, usually containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed at <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> delta's distributaries.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{is part of}} a cycle on the life of Saint Peter, and describes a scene from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus directs Peter to find a coin in <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fish in order to pay the temple tax. It owes its importance in particular to its revolutionary use of perspective and chiaroscuro. The Tribute Money suffered great damage in the centuries after its creation, until the chapel went through a thorough restoration in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills at <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E
5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{days out}} of Delaware Bay, Bonnet entered the estuary of the Cape Fear River and {{anchored}} near <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small waterway now known as Bonnet's Creek. The Royal James had begun to leak badly and {{was in need of}} careening. Shortly afterwards, a small shallop entered the river and was captured. Bonnet had the shallop broken up to help repair the Royal James. The work of careening was done, in whole or in part, by the prisoners Bonnet had captured. Bonnet threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the Royal James. Bonnet remained in the Cape Fear River for the next 45 days. According to Bonnet's boatswain, Ignatius Pell, the pirates intended to wait out the hurricane season there.|$|E

25|$|During the Classic period, Tikal's North Acropolis {{consisted}} of nucleated royal burial temples and is even {{referred to as}} a 'necropolis'. In Classic-period royal courts, tombs are generally found integrated in the residences of the nobility. Apart from the ancestral remains themselves, sacred bundles left by the ancestors were also an object of veneration. Reliefs from the Classic-period kingdom of Yaxchilan also show that royal ancestors were sometimes approached during bloodletting rituals and then appeared to their descendants, emerging from <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> terrestrial serpent (which has been nicknamed 'Vision Serpent').|$|E

In this system {{it is the case}} that the pipe can be brought to {{resonance}} if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to (1 + 2n)λ/4 where n is an integer. As the antinodal point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.|$|E
25|$|Not a fell {{of great}} significance, Heron Pike {{is a slight}} grassy rise on the long {{southern}} ridge of its parent fell Fairfield. Just cresting the 2,000 foot mark at 612m (2,008ft), it is mostly climbed {{as part of the}} Fairfield horseshoe walk and it lies between the adjoining fells of Nab Scar and Great Rigg. Heron Pike’s eastern side features Erne Crag and Blind Cove as it falls away quite steeply towards Rydal Beck.
