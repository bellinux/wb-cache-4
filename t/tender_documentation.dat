There are particular signs of feasibility of leveraging public procurement as an innovative policy tools, yet the up to date academic findings appear to be in fragmented state. At this point, establishing a link with SMEs, the core players in national innovation systems, is the cornerstone of the research. By investigating these aspects in the context of Finland encompassing gas turbines sector, the current thesis aims to outline concrete challenges prevailing in the field and suggest concise practices and steps both purchasing and supplying parties may benefit from. The study is organized qualitatively and consists of semi-structured interview with the case company, questionnaire and documentary analyses of <b>tendering</b> <b>documentation.</b> The results confirm that SMEs can be innovative public suppliers, whereas various main typical barriers hindering an access to public contracts still persist. The nature of innovations in state procurement is rather vague and implicit, meaning an absence of academic concepts and, hence, requiring from companies an ability to identify market’s maturity level in order to reflect their innovative capabilities. Inasmuch as bidding for smaller lots does not possess any significant challenges, restricted entry modes and high volume contracts can be overcome and secured by joint bids, sub-contracting options and enhanced public-private partnerships...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the barriers and opportunities of public procurement that SMEs and public purchasers experience. A plan of action for public purchasers and SMEs to commonly increase SMEs participation in public procurement is formulated based on the findings. Method: Qualitative interviews with both public purchasers and representatives for local SMEs are performed to answer the research question of how local SMEs and public procurement divisions jointly can increase SMEs participation in public procurement. Findings: The results are presented separately for public purchasers and SMEs, but the picture they are painting are coherent. Both procurers and SMEs testify to a difficult regulatory framework that is very resource intensive. The procurers perceive multiple benefits when sourcing from local SMEs, but the SMEs experience is that factors such as service and quality seldom is taken into consideration in public procurements. Procurers and SMEs both declare that procurement processes are of poor quality, where the procurers stresses the lack of resources needed and SMEs testify to poorly written <b>tender</b> <b>documentations</b> and a lack of knowledge about the good or the service that is the subject to the procurement. Conclusions: Previous studies have stated that the problems in public procurement experienced by SMEs that were brought to attention twenty years ago are still present. The findings of this study are coherent with that statement, since many of the experienced barriers and opportunities that are articulated by procurers and SMEs are consistent with previous research. The practical contribution of this study consists of a plan of action to enhance cooperation between municipalities and SMEs with the aim to increase local SMEs participation in public procurement. The plan of action is divided in three parts; to initiate a local cooperation, to update the local policy of public procurement and to evaluate the way public procurement is organized. Limitations: The study has been executed in a geographical limited area and only covered parts of the public sector, given the orientation towards Swedish municipalities...|$|R
40|$|Building cost {{planning}} was originally {{developed in the}} framework of traditional procurement methods with conventional <b>documentation,</b> <b>tendering</b> and administration processes. With the advent of alternative forms of procurement with more fluid approaches to design stages and documentation, the need for sound {{cost planning}} does not appear to diminish. As a process established on solid theoretical foundations, cost planning should be robust enough to adapt and flourish in a variety of procurement environments. However, little documentation and analysis of transformed and adapted forms of cost planning appear to have been made.

The thesis includes four chapters as well as an introduction and a conclusion, each of them dealing with different aspects of the Act on Public Tenders. Chapter Two is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis: public tender, the contracting body, types of awarding procedures and basic principles of this procedure such as transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination. The chapter Three, referred to as <b>Tender</b> <b>Documentation,</b> is subdivided into five parts.

The practical part of the thesis starts with the description of the village of Dolany and the preparation for the setting the options.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{information}} contained in <b>tender</b> <b>documentation</b> produced using Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) and provided in a hard-copy format to an electrical engineering contractor for a port expansion facility, which formed {{an integral part of}} an Iron Ore mega-project is analyzed. A System Information Model (SIM), which is an object oriented approach, was retrospectively constructed from the documentation provided to assist the contractor with their tender bid preparation. During the creation of the SIM, a total of 426 errors and omissions were found to be contained within the 77 tender ‘drawing’ documents supplied to the contractor by an Engineering, Construction, Procurement and Management (EPCM). Surprisingly, 70 drawings referenced in the <b>tender</b> <b>documentation,</b> and the Input/Output lists and Cause/Effect drawings were not provided. Yet, the electrical contractor was required by the EPCM organization to provide a lump sum bid and also guarantee the proposed schedule would be met; the financial risks were too high and as a result the contractor decided not to submit a bid. It is suggested that if the original <b>tender</b> <b>documentation</b> had been prepared using a SIM rather than CAD, the quality of information presented to the contractor would have enabled them to submit a competitive bid for the works. The research concludes that the economic performance and productivity of mining projects can be significantly improved by using a SIM to engineer and document electrical instrumentation and control (EIC) systems...|$|E
40|$|Tendering {{is one of}} {{the stages}} in {{construction}} procurement that requires extensive information and documents exchange. However, tender documents are not always clear in practice. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain the clarity and adequacy of tender documents used in practice. Access was negotiated into two UK construction firms and the whole tender process for two projects was shadowed for 6 - 7 weeks in each firm using an ethnographic approach. A significant amount of tender queries, amendments and addenda were recorded. This showed that quality of <b>tender</b> <b>documentation</b> is still a problem in construction despite the existence of standards like Co-ordinated Project Information (1987) and British Standard 1192 (1984 and 1990) that are meant to help in producing clear and consistent project information. Poor quality tender documents are a source of inaccurate estimates, claims and disputes on contracts. Six recommendations are presented to help in improving the quality of <b>tender</b> <b>documentation.</b> Further research is needed into the recommendations to help improve the quality of tender documents, perhaps in conjunction with an industry-wide investigation into the level of incorporation of CPI principles in practice...|$|E
