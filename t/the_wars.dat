5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of <b>the</b> <b>wars</b> of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once <b>the</b> <b>wars</b> were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E

5|$|John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during <b>the</b> <b>Wars</b> of the Roses.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes Esmāʻil Fasih’s <b>war</b> novel, <b>The</b> Winter of 1983 (Zemestān-e 62, 1985) from a narratological standpoint {{to illuminate}} how this novel differ from other Iranian wartime novels, since it explores numerous themes and perspectives on <b>the</b> <b>war</b> not explored by <b>the</b> <b>war</b> novels of this period. Whereas many wartime novels describe the active {{role of the}} working class in participating in <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>The</b> Winter of 1983 chiefly portrays the upper class’s role, and especially their outlook on <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> In addition, Fasih’s <b>war</b> novel exposes <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>the</b> Iranian cities end up in ruins due to <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> an oft-neglected aspect of <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> This dissertation also considers how The Winter of 1983 might be differently categorized, as a novel with a moderate or neutral outlook on <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>the</b> central reason being that the novel features both positive and negative aspects of <b>the</b> <b>war...</b>|$|R

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I a number of socialist parties initially supported <b>the</b> <b>war</b> when it began in August 1914.

One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was Gabriele d'Annunzio who promoted Italian irredentism and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> <b>The</b> Italian Liberal Party under the leadership of Paolo Boselli promoted intervention in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> on <b>the</b> side of the Allies and utilized the Società Dante Alighieri to promote Italian nationalism. Italian socialists were divided on whether to support <b>the</b> <b>war</b> or oppose it. Prior to Mussolini taking a position on <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> a number of revolutionary syndicalists had announced their support of intervention, including Alceste De Ambris, Filippo Corridoni, and Angelo Oliviero Olivetti.
