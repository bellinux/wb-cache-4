The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show {{has always been that}} we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right not only for the series, but also for the times we are living in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> and added, [...] "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E

500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{relationship between}} Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written {{out of the}} soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and {{was placed in the}} care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: [...] "Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that {{this is the end of}} Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again." [...] It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, [...] "I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too—not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{style of}} film is {{presented}} in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt that the only way <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|E
