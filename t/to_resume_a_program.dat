50|$|The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{has decided}} <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> of {{transient}} testing, {{and plans to}} invest about $75 million to restart the TREAT facility by 2018. The renewed interest in TREAT was sparked by the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, which prompted the shutdown of Japan's and Germany's nuclear plants. One use for TREAT is planned to be testing of new accident tolerant fuel for nuclear reactors.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, the Government of Poland was {{effectively}} a puppet {{state of the}} Soviet Union and was in no position <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>an</b> acknowledged Promethean <b>program.</b> Despite this, the Polish people, through Solidarity, {{played a major role}} in the breakup of the Soviet Union. The 1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union largely vindicated the predictions of those Poles and others who had anticipated the event and, in some cases, had worked for it.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{wireless}} sensor networks can {{be found}} in many new application areas. In these sensor networks there may exit a part of the network which are difficult to access or lie in a wide area, far apart. A change in the software (e. g., function update or bug fix) can entail reprogramming of all sensor nodes. This is very time consuming and labour intensive, if the patching has to be done manually for each individual sensor nodes. In the area of mobile phones, the over the air (OTA) update function has been established very well with good reliability. In embedded systems such as sensor nodes, where resources are severely restricted, an update cannot be stored but must be programmed directly with the transfer. For this to be possible, a lot of basic functionality is needed to be established to correct errors or to be able <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>a</b> failed <b>programming.</b> Within the framework of this thesis a concept for the transmission and distribution of the firmware and programming the sensor node is established. Focus here is to optimize the use of resources and to provide basic functionality within the programming mode...|$|R
50|$|Wood began 2016 in the Dodgers {{starting}} rotation. He made 10 {{starts in}} April and May and was 1-4 with a 3.99 ERA. On May 21 against the San Diego Padres {{he struck out}} a career high 13 batters in only six innings of work, the first Dodgers pitcher in history to have struckout that many in so few innings. However, he reported {{that he was not}} feeling 100% after a May 30 outing against the Chicago Cubs. An MRI exam the next day revealed a posterior impingement in his left elbow, requiring four weeks of rest, and he was placed on the disabled list. On June 16, he reported that the infringement subsided after he had some fluid drained from his elbow and he would be cleared <b>to</b> <b>resume</b> <b>a</b> throwing <b>program</b> <b>a</b> few days earlier than expected. He threw a simulated game against minor league hitters on July 16 and early reports were that it went well. However, shortly afterwards it was determined that he would need elbow debridement surgery, which would cause him to miss an additional two months. He did not rejoin the Dodgers roster until September 20. Overall, he appeared in 14 games for the Dodgers in 2016 (10 starts) and was 1-4 with a 3.73 ERA. The Dodgers did not carry Wood on their roster for {{the first round of the}} playoffs, but on October 15, he was added to their roster for the league championship series. He pitched two scoreless innings in that series. After the season, Wood signed a $2.8 million contract with the Dodgers for 2017, avoiding salary arbitration.|$|R
