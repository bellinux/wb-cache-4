The {{purpose of the present}} {{research}} is to assess parents attitude towards sexual education, argued to be a possible form extra-family sexual abuse prevention. Especially, differences in the attitude towards the sexual education and in the awareness of extra-family abuse had been investigated in relationship to parents sex (father versus mother), <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> (urban versus rural), children age (6, 8, and 10 years), and children sex (male versus female). The study demanded the compilation of structured interview. The results underline a positive but uncertain attitude of parents towards sexual education of their children. Parents choice to provide sexual education to their children depends on children age (10 years old are considered more suitable for sexual education), parents sex (mothers approve sexual education more than fathers; moreover, mothers retain sexual education a form of sexual abuse prevention more than fathers do), and settlement type (parents from urban settlement believe in the value of sexual education for their own children significantly more than parents from rural ones) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} urban/rural residence and various forms of trust in Hungary, including control variables such as age, gender, income, marriage, qualification into the analysis. Trust is a basic dimension of human capital and a very often used concept in everyday situations too. Trust research became increasingly popular in recent years. However, urban-rural and spatial differences of specific forms of trust remains a rarely investigated question. Trust can be measured with one question (global or general trust) or with many questions. Global measures of trust have serious methodological and interpretative problems. Therefore a research was conducted with 19 questions concerning the various personal or impersonal subjects of trust. Respondents (n= 2031) of a countrywide representative survey in Hungary rated their trust in various groups or institutions on a 10 -point Likert scale. The results were analysed along the settlement hierarchy at four different levels: Budapest, the country capital; cities with county rights (namely the biggest Hungarian cities, apart from Budapest); smaller and medium sized cities; villages. Various sociodemographic factors were included into the analysis. In some cases age and gender is a more significant factor in differentiating the results as <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>type,</b> but age and gender can have a different effect on results for different settlement types. The results have a great variability according {{to the subject of}} trust. General differences between settlement types show a higher trust level in cities with county rights, then towns, villages and at last Budapest. Exceptions from this general picture are highly interesting: trust in personal contacts is much lower in Budapest, trust in institutions or abstract institutions (law and legal system, market system, political system, banks) is higher than in villages, institutions with more concrete personal contacts is higher in villages than in Budapest. The difference is bigger in the case of church. In Budapest, compared to other settlements, trust is lower in personal contacts, but the differences between settlement categories are lower than the differences of trust between the personal and impersonal contacts. Gender differences according to the settlement categories are also interesting. The highest trust level can be seen in elder age. However, trust of younger adults is higher in Budapest, mainly thanks to the much higher trust level in abstract institutions. Trust of younger adults in personal contacts and health institutions is not higher in Budapest. These {{are just some of the}} main finding of our complex results...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{introduction}} {{and success of}} Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has gained the interest of National Mapping Agencies (NMAs) worldwide. VGI is geographic information that is freely generated by non-experts and shared using VGI initiatives available on the Internet. The NMA of South Africa i. e. the Chief Directorate: National Geo- Spatial Information (CD: NGI) is looking to this volunteer information to maintain their topographical database; however, the main concern {{is the quality of}} the data. The purpose of this work is to assess whether it is feasible to use VGI to update the CD: NGI topographical database. The data from OpenStreetMap (OSM), which is one the most successful VGI initiatives, was compared to a reference data set provided by the CD: NGI. Corresponding features between the two data sets were compared in order to assess the various quality aspects. The investigation was split into quantitative and qualitative assessments. The aim of the quantitative assessments was to determine the internal quality of the OSM data. The internal quality elements included the positional accuracy, geometric accuracy, semantic accuracy and the completeness. The _rst part of the qualitative assessment was concerned with the currency of OSM data between 2006 and 2012. The second part of the assessment was focused on the uniformity of OSM data acquisition across South Africa. The quantitative results showed that both road and building features do not meet the CD: NGI positional accuracy standards. In some areas the positional accuracy of roads are close to the required accuracy. The buildings generally compare well in shape to the CD: NGI buildings. However, there were very few OSM polygon features to assess, thus the results are limited to a small sample. The semantic accuracy of roads was low. Volunteers do not generally classify roads correctly. Instead, many volunteers prefer to class roads generically. The last part of the quantitative results, the completeness, revealed that commercial areas reach high completeness percentages and sometimes exceed the total length of the CD: NGI roads. In residential areas, the percentages are lower and in low urban density areas, the lowest. Nonetheless, the OSM repository has seen signi_cant growth since 2006. The qualitative results showed that because the OSM repository has continued to grow since 2006, the level of currency has increased. In South Africa, the most contributions were made between 2010 and 2012. The OSM data set is thus current after 2012. The amount and type of contributions are however not uniform across the country for various reasons. The number of point contributions was low. Thus, the relationship between the type of contribution and <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> could not be made with certainty. Because the OSM data does not meet the CD: NGI spatial accuracy requirements, the two data sets cannot be integrated at the database level. Instead, two options are proposed. The CD: NGI could use the OSM data for detecting changes to the landscape only. The other recommendation is to transform and verify the OSM data. Only those features with a high positional accuracy would then be ingested. The CD: NGI currently has a shortage of sta_ that is quali_ed to process ancillary data. Both of the options proposed thus require automated techniques because it is time consuming to perform these tasks manually...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to Wirth's claim that <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> influences interpersonal relation-ships, Gans {{has argued that}} such influences can be completely explained by demo-graphic differences between the populations of <b>the</b> various <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> How-ever, Gans has ignored the possibility of interaction between <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> and demographic characteristics. This study tests the influence of city versus suburban <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> on interpersonal estrangement. In anticipating that interaction ef-fects will be found, it is hypothesized that the influence on estrangement of demo-graphic variables which represent vulnerability to strangers will differ between city and suburb. This "vulnerability hypothesis " is supported, particularly {{as it pertains to}} the child-rearing lifecycle stage. It is concluded that while <b>the</b> effect of <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> on estrangement cannot be explained by demographic characteris-tics, it is largely confined to persons who possess certain characteristics. <b>The</b> relationship between <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> and <b>the</b> quality of interpersonal relationships has long been debated in urban sociology. The debate rests on two divergent points of view, the first of which is associated with Louis Wirth. Wirth argues that the ecological characteristics of the city settle-ment type, that is, its great population size, density, and social heteroge-neity, independently reduce the quality of interpersonal relationships gen-erally, and in particular produce interpersonal enstrangement (see also Park; Simmel). Wirth notes that in the city, it is not possible for residents to know all others personally, and those who are known tend to be so in a distant and secondary way. Further, city-dwellers treat each other with indifference and not infrequently with distrust owing to the competitive, exploitive, and predatory social relationships engendered by large popula-tion size. The alternative point of view is associated with Herbert Gans. Gans (a) argues that the ecological characteristics of cities have little effect o...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{developed a}} method to explore density and growth rates in the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The outcomes of this method enable planners to understand the growth pattern of a region and compare it with other regions in the country. The main objectives of this research were: (1) to identify <b>settlement</b> <b>types</b> (high, medium and low density, suburbs, and urban fringes) in each metropolitan area; (2) to depict and compare general metropolitan structures across the nation; and (3) to evaluate the location of recently developed dwellings in relation to <b>settlement</b> <b>types</b> and structures and estimate growth trends. The paper combined the percentage of impervious surface raster dataset (30 -m cell size) produced by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and block-level housing unit data produced by the Census Bureau to map housing density across the lower 48 states in 2000 and 2010. Neighbourhood density profiles were used to identify <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>types</b> (high, medium and low density, suburbs, and urban fringes).

The basis of the division lies in an attempt to serialise different types of form, in the various difficulties involved in the process and with the spatial Organisation of the cultural landscape. The periods of high medieval agricultural expansion (and, after the retreat phenomena of the late middle ages, the expansion of modern times) can each be divided into three phases (in which the dates should be interpreted as mean values) : 1000 - 1070 : small-scale land clearance, non-uniform <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> 1070 - 1230 : large-scale land clearance under the influence of territorial rulers, uniform settlemcnt types. 1230 - 1350 : large-scale land clearance, streng urban influence on the form of the cultural landscape. 1350 - 1450 / 1500 : late medieval retreat periods, pronounced social and economic changes. 1450 / 1500 - 1700 : small-scale land clearance, non-niform <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> 1700 - 1850 : large-scale land clearance under the influence of <b>the</b> State, uniform <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> 1850 - 1950 : expansion and improvement of existing settlements, strenger urban influence. 1950 -till today: mereasing fallow phenomena and decrease in farm numbers, strong social and economic restructuring.

Looking at 1500 households in two suburban municipalities from a 2007 metropolitan travel survey, this study is the first to quantify differences in car ownership and car use across households in informal settlements and commercial housing developments. Accounting for income, proxies for wealth, household composition, and geography, households living in commercial housing developments are likely to own more cars and drive more than similar households in neighboring informal settlements. A test for residential self-selection finds no unobserved correlations across households that own cars and live in commercial housing developments, suggesting that the included controls {{do a good job of}} capturing the effects of residential self-selection or that the effects are limited.
