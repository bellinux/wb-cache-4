5|$|A demon {{comes to}} steal the ring from Thalaba, but he is stopped by the young boy. This allows Thalaba to demand {{information}} about the sorcerers and why his family was killed. Time passes and Thalaba settles into a pastoral life at Irem and plans to marry Moath's daughter, Oneiza. However, Thalaba decides that his duty prohibits him from such actions, and he leaves to fulfill his destiny. However, <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> Lobaba tricks Thalaba and tries {{to steal the}} ring. After many failed attempts, Lobaba tries to convince Thalaba to harness the ring's magic power, which would bring Thalaba harm. Instead, Thalaba argues {{against the use of}} magic in general and realises that Lobaba is evil. Although Thalaba attempts to kill Lobaba and fails by the sorcerer's magic, a storm comes and destroys <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ramudu meets a Nepali sorcerer {{during the}} latter's magic {{show in a}} street. <b>The</b> <b>sorcerer,</b> who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his prayers to {{sacrifice}} an intelligent and brave young man before her to be granted a statuette which grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills a crocodile that immediately transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth {{equal to that of}} the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.|$|E
5|$|The {{repertory}} system {{ensured that}} the comic patter character who performed the role of <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer,</b> John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, then join the army as Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in <b>The</b> <b>Sorcerer</b> transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in Pirates. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included George Grossmith, the principal comic; Rutland Barrington, the lyric baritone; Richard Temple, the bass-baritone; and Jessie Bond, the mezzo-soprano soubrette.|$|E
5000|$|Long {{time ago}} there was a war between <b>the</b> <b>sorcerers</b> and sorceresses as they contest who among them was the strongest. Elizaria (Sam Pinto) came, {{defeated}} them all, and she became the most powerful sorceress, bringing peace to their world. Then came a prophecy {{that there would be}} another war. Elizaria knew this and she created the Ilumina or [...] "Ang Aklat Ng Salamangka" [...] (<b>The</b> <b>Sorcerer's</b> Book), containing all the secrets she knew and every power she had. <b>The</b> <b>sorcerers</b> cannot settle among themselves over who would keep the Ilumina and so they fought for it. The second war began and divided <b>the</b> <b>sorcerers</b> into two factions, Black and White. <b>The</b> Black <b>sorcerers</b> first acquired <b>the</b> Ilumina, becoming the most powerful, until Elena (Rochelle Pangilinan), Sasha (Cara Eriguel) and <b>the</b> other white <b>sorcerers</b> took back <b>the</b> book. The war continued on long after that, becoming more deadly over the years.|$|R

5|$|While {{they are}} unable to locate the sorcerer's lair, Indu refuses the sorcerer's {{proposal}} to marry him. With the help of the statuette, <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> brings Ramudu to his lair and tortures him in front of Indu with a hope that she would succumb to his proposal to marry him. Posing as an assistant, Ramudu shaves the sorcerer's beard, making him lose his powers. Afterwards, Ramudu finds the statuette and wishes to bring the palace back to Ujjain. In a fight between Ramudu and <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> mid-way in the sky, the latter dies when Ramudu throws him out. The palace is back in Ujjain and Surasena apologises to both Ramudu and Indu before uniting them. While Anji marries Indu's best friend, the film ends with the marriage of Ramudu and Indu with the elders' blessing.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan scored {{their first}} {{international}} hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising {{the rise of}} unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in <b>The</b> <b>Sorcerer,</b> love between members of different social classes). As {{with many of the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically {{near the end of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|In Kathmandu, Nepal, <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> Kaecilius and his zealots {{enter the}} secret {{compound}} Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal {{a few pages}} from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.|$|E

Sudeep {{arranges}} to kill Nani but the fly escapes and causes a short circuit, killing <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> and leaving Sudeep unconscious. Nani and Bindu assume Sudeep is dead {{but he is}} saved by his business partner. Sudeep is enraged when he learns that Bindu is helping the fly. Sudeep kills his partner to collect a 7billion (US$ million) insurance policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} of H.M.S. Pinafore {{relied on}} stock character types, {{many of which}} were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone—the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of H.M.S. Pinafore, the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before <b>The</b> <b>Sorcerer,</b> Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury. Building on the team he had assembled for <b>The</b> <b>Sorcerer,</b> Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found the death of <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> similar {{to the story of}} Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by {{touching}} her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E

5|$|During the company's 1975 centennial {{performances}} of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre, Trial was given four times, as a curtain raiser to <b>The</b> <b>Sorcerer,</b> Pinafore and Pirates {{and as an}} afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before {{the first of the}} four {{performances of}} Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Carte, Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875. Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E
5|$|Terry Pratchett {{was pleased}} with the 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing. He was reluctant to grant Discworld licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company who cared about the property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and their failure to obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation of}} Simon <b>the</b> <b>Sorcerer,</b> which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E
5|$|The PC {{version was}} later ported to Microsoft Windows. The game was {{published}} in the United States by Activision. A patch was released, fixing compatibility issues with Windows ME, 2000, and XP. Simon <b>the</b> <b>Sorcerer</b> was released on GOG.com in December 2008. In 2009, the game was re-released for the iPhone by iPhSoft. A new version titled '20th Anniversary Edition' developed by MojoTouch and released for Android in August 2013. This version featured new animations and icons, remastered music, high-definition graphics, and new game menus. A sequel, , was released in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{inspired}} by works such as the Discworld series, and the character of Simon was created {{to compete with the}} characters of such works. The character was modelled on characters including Blackadder. Simon <b>the</b> <b>Sorcerer</b> was well received, with reviewers praising the humour and graphics. The game was re-released on CD, featuring voice-overs, with Simon being voiced by Chris Barrie. Ports for iOS and Android were released in 2009 and 2013 respectively, and the game was released on GOG.com in 2008. The second instalment in the series, , was released in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} divided into two parts: the first part is a remake of , while the second is an {{original}} story acting as a sequel to the first game. After defeating <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> Gharnef and the Dark Dragon Medeus, peace is restored to Archanea and Marth restores his kingdom. His ally Hardin ascends to the throne of Archanea, but begins hostile military expansion across the continent, forcing Marth to confront his old friend and the force driving him. Gameplay follows the traditional Fire Emblem system of tactical battles taking place on grid-based maps.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} film reel levels {{based on some}} of the movie's {{segments}} such as Sorcerer's Apprentice and Night on Bald Mountain that appear in the Epic Mickey games. Yen Sid and Chernabog also make cameo appearances in the games (Yen Sid <b>the</b> <b>sorcerer</b> from The Sorcerer's Apprentice narrates the openings and endings of the two games and served as the creator of the Wasteland. Chernabog the demon from the Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria segment appears as a painting in the first game and appears in the Night on Bald Mountain film reel levels in the second).|$|E
