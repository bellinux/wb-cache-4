5|$|The hearing {{began on}} 21 January 1997, under the {{supervision}} of a three-judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito. After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only {{a small percentage of the}} damages were awarded, after the court ruled <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> from Udin's family– whom they saw as having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case– was ineligible.|$|E
25|$|The Court held <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> on {{the form}} of a victim impact {{statement}} was admissible and constitutional in death penalty cases, thus expressly overruling two prior cases, Booth v. Maryland (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989).|$|E
25|$|In an October 2011 lecture {{addressing}} the Occupy movement, Noam Chomsky characterized portions of Greenspan's February 1997 {{testimony to the}} U.S. Senate {{as an example of}} the self-serving attitudes of the so-called 1%. In <b>that</b> <b>testimony,</b> Greenspan had stated that growing worker insecurity is a significant factor keeping inflation and inflation expectation low, thereby promoting long-term investment.|$|E
50|$|There is {{empirical}} evidence <b>that</b> expert <b>testimony</b> on future dangerousness has less effect on jury decisions than does expert testimony on the defendant's mental functioning. However, {{there is no}} evidence so far <b>that</b> expert <b>testimony</b> does influence the jury on sentencing outcomes in death penalty cases.|$|R

25|$|In his ruling, Justice Cooperman stated <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> by Guzman and Benefield did {{not make}} sense. He also cited {{the fact that they}} had a pending $50,000,000 lawsuit against the city. After the ruling was made, the family, led by Sharpton and several others, went to Bell's graveside in Port Washington, Long Island for a {{memorial}} service.|$|E
25|$|The next topic which Hume {{strives to}} give {{treatment}} {{is that of}} the reliability of human testimony, and of the role <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> plays a part in epistemology. This was not an idle concern for Hume. Depending on its outcome, the entire treatment would give the epistemologist a degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles.|$|E
25|$|Before the Supreme Court, Reynolds {{argued that}} his {{conviction}} for bigamy should be overturned on four issues: {{that it was}} his religious duty to marry multiple times and the First Amendment protected his practice of his religion; that his grand jury had not been legally constituted; that challenges of certain jurors were improperly overruled; <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> was not admissible as it was under another indictment.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, most Croatian historians {{consider}} it a political myth {{because of a lack}} of direct evidence, and the difficulty of explaining the Yugoslav Wars, with Croats and Serbs as the main antagonists, in the context of a Serbo-Croatian agreement.Ivica Lučić and Miroslav Tuđman claim <b>that</b> <b>testimonies</b> do not match, and that the anomalies can be explained by particular political interests.|$|R

25|$|Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case {{which held}} <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> {{in the form}} of a victim impact {{statement}} is admissible during the sentencing phase of a trial and, in death penalty cases, does not violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Payne narrowed two of the Courts' precedents: Booth v. Maryland (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989).|$|E
25|$|In July 2015 Adamcik {{gained a}} hearing for post-conviction relief with state Sixth District Magistrate Judge Mitchell W. Brown. He claimed <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> from {{character}} witnesses could {{have changed the}} outcome of the sentencing, but that his former attorney, against Adamcik's parents' wishes, chose not to call upon these witnesses. Adamcik said that his attorney believed that the prosecution would have submitted even more damaging evidence. In March 2016 Judge Brown denied his request for post-conviction relief. Adamcik is appealing Judge Brown's decision to the Idaho Supreme Court. A hearing will be held on November 9, 2017.|$|E
25|$|Kilgallen was {{publicly}} {{skeptical of}} the conclusions of the Warren Commission's report into the assassination of President Kennedy and wrote several newspaper articles on the subject.

25|$|We {{claim that}} the {{defendant}} is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue {{as to whether he}} taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict <b>that</b> <b>testimony,</b> there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E
25|$|Preparing for trial, {{the court}} {{threw out the}} plaintiff's real estate expert and {{approved}} the government's real estate expert, applying the Daubert standard. He also clarified his prior ruling, to note <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> on laches would be permitted inasmuch as it related to pre-judgement interest. In 2001, the jury returned a verdict for the Cayuga, calculating damages the current fair {{market value of the}} land and the fair rental value of the land over 204 years in excess of $36 million; with the addition of pre-judgement interest, the damages reached $247,911,999.42. The court also denied the defendant's post-trial motions, but stayed the collection of the judgement pending appeal.|$|E
25|$|The Waite Court heard nine {{criminal}} appeals {{from the}} territorial courts, {{the majority of}} them arising from prosecutions of Mormon polygamists in the courts of the Utah Territory. Reynolds v. United States (1878) rejected six challenges to a polygamy conviction: that the territorial grand jury statute provided for fewer members that grand juries in the circuit courts; that it violated the Impartial Jury Clause to seat a juror opposed to polygamy; that for cause challenges were improperly granted to the prosecution; <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> violated the Confrontation Clause; that polygamy was protected by the Free Exercise Clause; and that it was improper for the judge to comment on the social ills of polygamy.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{provisions}} of Shari’a law as practiced in the country, judges may discount the testimony {{of people who are}} not practicing Muslims or who do not adhere to the official interpretation of Islam. Legal sources report <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> by Shi’a is often ignored in courts of law or is deemed to have less weight than testimony by Sunnis. Sentencing under the legal system is not uniform. Laws and regulations state that defendants should be treated equally; however, under Shari’a as interpreted and applied in the country, crimes against Muslims may result in harsher penalties than those against non-Muslims. Information regarding government practices was generally incomplete because judicial proceedings usually were not publicized or were closed to the public, despite provisions in the criminal procedure law requiring court proceedings to be open.|$|E
25|$|In the 1957 case Jencks v. United States the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} a {{defendant}} must have access to government witnesses who will testify against him in a criminal trial, and must also have access to any documents pertaining to <b>that</b> <b>testimony.</b> This includes papers, documents, written statements and the like. This led to passage of the Jencks Act, 18 USC, Part II, Chapter 223, § 3500, which allows for subpoena duces tecum of relevant government documents, but only after a government agent or employee has testified at trial. There can be no pre-trial discovery. The subpoena is allowed by the trial judge. The government {{has the right to}} deny access to the documents. This {{may be due to the}} sensitive nature of the documents, or because they are classified.|$|E
25|$|Elisa Carrió {{said that}} Miriam Quiroga's {{testimony}} {{was similar to}} her 2008 reports during an ongoing corruption case against Néstor Kirchner, Báez, Julio De Vido, Carlos Zannini, Ricardo Jaime, Claudio Uberti and Rudy Ulloa, and hoped that judge Julián Ercollini would expedite the case. Quiroga's testimony was heard by judge Julián Ercolini. She testified that Kirchner instructed Rudy Ulloa and Cristobal López to buy media and how to manage public works, but did not remember details. Quiroga was not asked about the bags of money she mentioned in Lanata's program because it concerned a different case; <b>that</b> <b>testimony</b> will be heard by judge Luis Rodríguez. Daniel Muñoz, Kirchner's former secretary, was accused by prosecutor Ramiro González {{of involvement in the}} conspiracy. Pablo Senyszyn, Néstor Kirchner's bodyguard, denied seeing money bags and said that any bags would have been detected by security; he was suspended and replaced by Claudia Katok and Cristina Caamaño.|$|E
50|$|Problems are {{sometimes}} {{created by the}} unwillingness of medical experts to attend court. The {{reason for this is}} frequently that the court schedules are unpredictable, with cases often postponed at short notice and long waits for witnesses who are to give short testimonies. In South Africa, to counter this, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions has been training magistrates to interrupt proceedings in sexual violence cases when the medical expert arrives so <b>that</b> <b>testimonies</b> can be taken and witnesses cross-examined without delay.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the uses of oral testimony in writing about literacy in historical context, especially about the literacy traditions of populations “hid-den from history”—immigrants, refugees, and undocumented persons—who are entering U. S. schools and workplaces, and whose literacy histories may be unknown or lost. Drawing on testimonies collected from Laotian Hmong refugees, I offer the following propositions: First, <b>that</b> oral <b>testimonies</b> pro-vide information about literacy that may be unavailable in documentary records. Second, <b>that</b> oral <b>testimonies</b> may reveal deeply held values and atti-tudes about literacy that cannot be derived from the documentary evidence. Third, <b>that</b> oral <b>testimonies</b> disclose {{the full range of}} human experience, rational and emotional, and that this may lead to new understandings of lit-eracy. Finally, that oral histories invite collaboration between researcher and informant in writing new histories of literacy—though not always in ways commonly assumed...|$|R

In the same year, Louis granted the Banate of Severin and the district of Fogaras to Vladislav Vlaicu of Wallachia, who had accepted his suzerainty. Tvrtko I of Bosnia also accepted Louis's suzerainty after Hungarian troops assisted him in regaining his throne in early 1367.|$|E

In February 1951, weeks before the trial, he changed his testimony to claim that Ethel had typed up his notes. He testified against his sister and her husband in court in 1951 as part of an immunity agreement. In exchange for <b>that</b> <b>testimony,</b> the government allowed Ruth to stay with their two children. She was named a co-conspirator, but was never indicted.

5000|$|In matters {{other than}} {{financial}} transactions, scholars differ {{on whether the}} Qur'anic verses relating to financial transactions apply.

According to Averroes, Imam Abu Hanifa believed <b>that</b> their <b>testimony</b> is acceptable in such cases. Imam Malik, on the contrary, believes <b>that</b> their <b>testimony</b> remains unacceptable. For bodily affairs about which men can have no information in ordinary circumstances, such as the physical handicaps of women and the crying of a baby at birth, the majority of scholars hold <b>that</b> the <b>testimony</b> of women alone is acceptable. But the number of women witnesses needed is debated in different Islamic schools of law. Hanafi's and Hanbali's see even one woman enough. According to Maliki's two women are required. As for Shafii's, they see that 4 women are needed.|$|R
