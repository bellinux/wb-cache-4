5|$|On 30 January 1963, a B-52E of the 6th Bomb Wing from Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico, {{crashed in}} snow-covered {{mountains}} in northern New Mexico after turbulence tore off the vertical fin. The ECM operator and tail gunner were killed {{but at least}} three crew (pilot, radio operator and one other crew member) survived. Three Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars and, later, three Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports, circled the area trying to locate survivors; the pilots reported <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> two other survivors after the first man walked to safety.|$|E
5|$|Peter wakes in the hospital, {{learning}} from Olivia <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a man safely cross {{the bridge and}} taken by Newton. When Walter arrives to see Peter, Peter tells him he has realized the truth: because he, like {{the man on the}} bridge, was not affected by the same shockwave that killed the FBI agent, he must be from the parallel universe. Walter is unable to deny Peter's accusations. The next day, Walter is devastated to learn that Peter has discharged himself and has disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Walker began {{monitoring}} Riley and denying him {{access to}} liquor, but Riley {{found ways to}} evade Walker. At {{a stop at the}} Masonic Temple Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel's bartender to sneak whiskey to his room. He became too drunk to perform, and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier-Journal <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.|$|E
5|$|Veronica meets Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo), who annoys both Veronica and Mac. Veronica, Parker, Mac, Wallace, and Piz go to a concert. Veronica {{talks about}} Piz’s {{problem at the}} concert, and three kids say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a white girl who was faking being fat. Dick shows up at Mac’s door and tells her that Beaver never cared about her. Veronica finds Piz’s guitar, and they visit the seller. The seller’s {{description}} matches that of other people. Veronica talks to Piz about a suspect, {{but he says that}} it doesn’t match the woman he saw. Keith and the bail-jumper’s car gets stranded. Veronica signs up for the mentoring program in criminology class, and she notices that one of the kids at the concert has a criminal record. Dick gets beaten up when he talks to another man’s girlfriend, but Logan tases the man. Veronica finds the Welcome Wagon girl, the seller’s husband.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E

5|$|A further {{report in}} 1945, {{supporting}} the same conclusion, was produced and stifled. In 1943, two U.S. POWs—Lt. Col. Donald B. Stewart and Col. John H. Van Vliet—had {{been taken by}} Germans to Katyn for an international news conference. Documents released by the National Archives and Records Administration in September 2012 revealed that Steward and Van Vliet sent coded messages to their American superiors indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> proof that implicated the Soviets. Three lines of evidence were cited. Firstly, the Polish corpses were in such an advanced state of decay that the Nazis could not have killed the Poles, as they had only taken over the area in 1941. Secondly, none of the numerous Polish artifacts, such as letters, diaries, photographs and identification tags pulled from the graves, were dated later than the spring of 1940. Most incriminating was the relatively good state of the men's uniforms and boots, which showed {{that they had not}} lived long after being captured. Later, in 1945, Van Vliet submitted a report concluding that the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. His superior, Major General Clayton Lawrence Bissell, General George Marshall's assistant chief of staff for intelligence, destroyed the report. Washington kept the information secret, presumably to appease Stalin and not distract from the war against the Nazis. During the 1951–52 Congressional investigation into Katyn, Bissell defended his action before the United States Congress, arguing that it was not in the U.S. interest to antagonize an ally (the USSR) whose assistance was still needed against the Empire of Japan. In 1950 Van Vliet recreated his wartime report.|$|E
25|$|The Crown's case relied only on eyewitnesses {{who were}} near Pentridge Prison when Hodson {{was shot and}} killed, {{because there was no}} {{scientific}} forensic evidence to prove Ryan fired a shot. Each eyewitness testified a different account of what they saw and where Ryan was standing. Eleven eyewitnesses testified <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Ryan waving and aiming his rifle. There were variations, whether Ryan was standing, walking or squatting at the time a single shot was heard and whether Ryan was to the left or right of Hodson. Only four eyewitnesses testified <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Ryan fire a shot. Two eyewitnesses testified <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> smoke coming from Ryan's rifle. Two eyewitnesses testified <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Ryan recoil his rifle.|$|E

25|$|Generative {{linguists}} of the 1960s, including Noam Chomsky and Ernst von Glasersfeld, believed semantic {{relations between}} transitive verbs and intransitive verbs {{were tied to}} their independent syntactic organization.

25|$|Even the {{location}} {{from which the}} missiles were fired is disputed.

25|$|In {{addition}} to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the golden plates and, in some cases, handled them.

50|$|Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both <b>saw</b> {{and handled}} the plates. Another {{difference}} is that the Eight testified <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were shown the plates by Joseph Smith rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses.|$|R
