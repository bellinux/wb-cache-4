50|$|<b>Troxipide</b> {{inhibits}} various proinflammatory mediators {{present at}} different stages of the microcirculatory system, thereby restoring the normal gastric mucosa. <b>Troxipide</b> caused the inhibition of recombinant interleukin-8 (IL-8) induced migration of the inflammatory cells. Two other pro-inflammatory mediators causing oxidative stress that are inhibited by <b>Troxipide</b> include the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and the Platelet Activating Factor (PAF).|$|E
50|$|<b>Troxipide</b> is well absorbed {{throughout}} the gastrointestinal tract with a relative bioavailability of 99.6%. At any time, a mean concentration of 5.3- 8.9 µg of <b>troxipide</b> is present per gram of tissue, which {{is capable of}} inhibiting the chemotactic migration and superoxide generation in the gastric mucosa. Thus, even 3 hrs after attaining peak serum levels, <b>troxipide</b> is found in therapeutically active concentrations in the small intestine, liver and stomach. The elimination half-life of <b>troxipide</b> is 7.5 hours, and is mainly excreted in urine (96% as metabolites).|$|E
50|$|<b>Troxipide</b> {{has been}} well {{established}} {{in the treatment of}} gastric ulcers showing an overall amelioration rate of 79.4%. An overall endoscopic healing rate of 66.7% after 8 weeks and 80% after 12 weeks of drug administration was achieved with <b>troxipide</b> (100 mg t.i.d. (three times a day)). In patients with duodenal ulcers, <b>troxipide</b> showed endoscopic healing rate of 53.3% and 73% at 8 weeks and 12 weeks respectively. At the end of the treatment, an overall improvement of 86.6% and 93.3% was achieved in patients with gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer respectively.In patients with acute gastritis and acute gastric mucosal lesions, an overall amelioration rate of 82.9% has been observed with <b>troxipide.</b> In a comparative study evaluating the efficacy of <b>troxipide</b> (100 mg t.i.d.) with Ranitidine (150 mg b.i.d. (two times a day)), administered over 28 days in patients with gastritis, <b>troxipide</b> was statistically superior to Ranitidine, both with respect to resolution of gastritis clinical signs (abdominal pain, bloating, belching and heartburn) as well as the endoscopic evidences (erosion, oozing, redness and edema). A study comparing the efficacy of <b>troxipide</b> (100 mg t.i.d for 28 days) with Rabeprazole (20 mg o.d. for 28 days) in patients suffering from gastritis showed that improvement in abdominal pain and nausea was significantly superior with <b>troxipide</b> at the end of 14 days. <b>Troxipide</b> administration caused a marked reduction in clinical (abdominal pain, bloating, belching, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and heartburn) and endoscopic signs of gastritis {{by the end of the}} treatment, though it did not significantly differ from that of Rabeprazole.In patients with APDs like dyspepsia, gastritis, GERD and/or gastric ulcer, uncontrolled with acid inhibitors viz. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine receptor antagonists (H2RAs) etc., <b>troxipide</b> (100 mg t.i.d. for 28 days) showed significant improvement in all major symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, belching, heartburn, epigastric pain, acid regurgitation, abdominal bloating & loss of appetite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Troxipide</b> {{is a drug}} used in the {{treatment}} of gastroesophageal reflux disease. <b>Troxipide</b> is a systemic non-antisecretory gastric cytoprotective agent with anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory and mucus secreting properties irrespective of pH of stomach or duodenum. <b>Troxipide</b> is currently marketed in Japan (Aplace), China (Shuqi), South Korea (Defensa), and India (Troxip). It is used for the management of gastric ulcers, and amelioration of gastric mucosal lesions in acute gastritis and acute exacerbation of chronic gastritis.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators, <b>troxipide</b> directly acts on the enzymes such as xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase that generate free oxygen radicals in gastric mucosa. Experimental {{studies have demonstrated}} that <b>troxipide</b> restrains NSAID-induced generation of porphyrins, tissue peroxidation and gastric lesion formation.|$|E
5000|$|The gastric pH {{and content}} {{independent}} properties of <b>troxipide</b> include the following: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Troxipide</b> enhances mucosal blood flow, {{which is}} the {{secondary}} defense barrier of gastric mucosa that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the epithelium, and removes, dilutes and neutralizes toxic substances that have diffused into the mucosa from the lumen. The increment in mucosal blood flow with <b>troxipide</b> is more pronounced in the gastric antrum than in the gastric corpus.|$|E
50|$|A post-marketing study, {{conducted}} by the innovator, in over 12,000 patients showed that only 0.75% of them developed adverse events attributable to the drug. The adverse reactions were mild to moderate, which resolved when the drug was discontinued. Commonly observed adverse events included constipation (0.19%) and increase in levels of liver enzymes, AST (0.17%) and ALT (0.25%). In a post-marketing study conducted in 1500 Indian patients, only 9 adverse events were reported in 9 patients (0.63%) that were of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse events observed included constipation, acidity, nausea, fatigue and headache, and were of mild to moderate intensity.In all clinical studies, <b>troxipide</b> was well tolerated. In a comparative study with ranitidine, <b>troxipide</b> was assessed as a more tolerable medication than ranitidine. A favorable tolerability profile for <b>troxipide</b> was reported by 95.45% of the investigators as compared to 65.45% for ranitidine while favorable tolerability profile was reported by 93.67% of the patients for <b>troxipide</b> and 64.55% for ranitidine.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all of the}} gastric mucosal defense {{mechanisms}} are stimulated and/or facilitated by prostaglandins (PGs), especially PGE2. These cytoprotective PGs stimulate mucus, bicarbonate, and phospholipid secretion; increase mucosal blood flow; and accelerate epithelial restitution and mucosal healing. They also inhibit mast cell activation, and leukocyte and platelet adherence to the vascular endothelium. Thus, continuous generation of PGE2 by gastric mucosa is crucial {{for the maintenance of}} mucosal integrity and protection against ulcerogenic and necrotizing agents. <b>Troxipide</b> is known to stimulate the release of PGE2 and PGD2 in experimental as well as clinical studies. <b>Troxipide</b> has been observed to enhance PG-stimulated increase in gastric mucosal output, accelerated epithelial restitution and mucosal healing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Troxipide</b> {{inhibits}} H. pylori-derived urease, a multimeric nickel-containing {{enzyme that}} catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonic acid, which damage host tissues and trigger inflammatory response, including recruitment of leukocytes and triggering of the oxidative burst in neutrophils.|$|E
50|$|Gastric parietal {{cells are}} rich in {{mitochondria}} which provide {{energy in the form}} of ATP for cells by oxidative phosphorylation, critical to maintain the proper morphology and function of gastric mucosa. The mitochondrion is the major target of intracellular oxidative stress associated with aggressive factors like H. pylori, alcohol and NSAIDs, which disturb the energy metabolism of mitochondria. <b>Troxipide</b> accelerates oxygen intake of marginal gastric mucosa and glycogen consumptive stimulation of the gastric mucosa of the corpus, thereby elevating the tissue respiration and energy metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Gastric mucosa {{typically}} {{is composed}} of salts and other dialyzable components, free proteins, carbohydrate rich glycoprotein and water. <b>Troxipide</b> fortifies this gastric mucosal barrier by increasing the content of glucosamine, mucopolysaccharides and collagen. Glucosamine is an amino-sugar that is known to stimulate glycoprotein synthesis and protective mechanisms of the gastric mucosa, thereby aiding in ulcer healing. Mucopolysaccharides impart structural integrity to the gastric mucosa and collagen imparts properties like ionic capability to attract blood components essential to tissue regeneration, mechanical protection, high tensile strength and slow digestibility to the gastric mucosa.|$|E

40|$|Aims: A post {{marketing}} {{study to}} assess the symptomatic efficacy and safety of <b>Troxipide</b> (TROXIPTM) 100 mg {{in the management of}} acid peptic disorders (APDs) in Indian population. Study Design: An observational, prospective, uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter post marketing study. Place and Duration of Study: Patients were enrolled from 62 centers across 11 states of India, between October 2010 and March 2012. Methodology: Out of 1500 APD patients, 1486 (850 men, 636 women; age range 16 - 85 years) were prescribed <b>Troxipide</b> 100 mg tablet orally thrice daily. The efficacy and safety assessments were performed on day 14 and day 28 after beginning the treatment and recorded in the case report forms. The efficacy of <b>Troxipide</b> was estimated based on the changes from the baseline in the symptom score on a 100 point visual analogue scale (VAS) for individual symptoms. Safety was assessed by adverse events reported with usage of <b>Troxipide</b> on day 14 and day 28 after start of the treatment. Results: <b>Troxipide</b> monotherapy (n= 1427) significantly reduced the mean VAS score from baseline for all major symptoms, viz. nausea, vomiting, belching, heart burn, epigastric pain, acid regurgitation, abdominal bloating & loss of appetite {{at the end of the}} study. The global mean VAS score (a sum of individual symptom VAS score) of these patients decreased from 134. 26 ± 75. 31 to 21. 88 ± 39. 52 at the end of the study (P <. 001). All the patients who were previously treated but uncontrolled, with acid inhibitors like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) etc. had a significant reduction in the VAS score from 164. 38 ± 64. 54 to 35. 56 ± 54. 24 on day 28 (P<. 001). <b>Troxipide</b> was well tolerated with overall incidence of adverse events being 1. 05 % (n= 15) and all the events were resolved without any sequel.
