Other improvements included getting a Basketball net put in the local park and getting a Rugby field put up; the field it is in is closer to Oatridge College than to the village itself, but was made for the villagers to use.|$|R

5|$|The city of San Francisco {{notified}} the Mallochs {{that they were}} in violation of a building code prohibiting more than three floors above a garage, because the building contained four floors of apartments above <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> The Mallochs successfully argued that their structure stepped back in progression up the slope of Telegraph Hill so that the top floor was not directly above <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> No part of the building was in violation of the code.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTraffic {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{particulate}} matter (PM) inside urban areas. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the potential to reduce outdoor PM concentrations by local removal inside semi-enclosed parking <b>garages.</b> <b>The</b> assessment is performed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the 3 D steady RANS equations and an Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. First, an extensive CFD validation study is performed with gas dispersion wind-tunnel measurements. Next, the case study for Eindhoven city center is conducted on a high-resolution grid including 16 semi-enclosed garages. Traffic intensities on the streets and in <b>the</b> <b>garages</b> are converted to PM 10 source terms. <b>The</b> <b>garages</b> are ventilated with outdoor air. Simulations are performed with and without removal units in <b>the</b> <b>garages.</b> <b>The</b> case study is not intended to reproduce a particular pollution episode but to provide a preliminary indication of the potential reduction in PM 10 for representative meteorological and traffic conditions. The results show that 594 removal units allow reductions in local outdoor PM 10 by up to 50 % close to <b>the</b> <b>garages</b> while reductions up to 10 % are achieved further downstream. It is concluded that local removal in semi-enclosed parking garages can be an effective strategy towards improved outdoor air quality...|$|R

5|$|All five {{songs on}} the {{extended}} play (EP) were written and produced by Chana and Chan. The pair worked on Manos Arriba for roughly two years and recorded it in Chan's recording studio in <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> of his home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. They initially created the material {{as a way to}} secure a record deal, but later decided to release it independently. Chana later said that the decision allowed her to have more creative input on her music and image. They completed eighteen tracks and chose five for the EP.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E

5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s through the mid-1990s the {{laboratory}} was rededicated to medical and urban entomology, with Professor John Edman running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron Prokopy focusing on orchard pest control.

50|$|There {{are three}} <b>garages</b> on <b>the</b> property, {{but they are}} non-contributing to the {{official}} designation of historic district: the ambulance, concrete, and modern <b>garages.</b> <b>The</b> ambulance <b>garage</b> is a brick rectangular structure built in 1900 on a raised concrete foundation. Much of the brickwork {{is similar to that}} of the detention hospital. <b>The</b> ambulance <b>garage</b> is not one of the contributing buildings to the historic district because it is now connected to <b>the</b> concrete <b>garage</b> and its doors and windows were modified. This combined building now houses a restaurant. <b>The</b> modern <b>garage</b> is of frame construction and built in the early 1990s. It is slightly north of the residence and has asphalt shingles and two <b>garage</b> doors. <b>The</b> concrete <b>garage</b> is just northwest of <b>the</b> modern <b>garage</b> and was built after 1950 with a raised concrete foundation and has green asphalt shingles. It is non-contributing because it has been modified with more modern brickwork, stucco, and siding.|$|R
