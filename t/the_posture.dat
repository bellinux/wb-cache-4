5|$|<b>The</b> <b>posture</b> of Ardhanarishvara may be tribhanga – bent {{in three}} parts: head (leaning to the left), torso (to the right) and right leg {{or in the}} sthanamudra {{position}} (straight), sometimes standing on a lotus pedestal, whereupon it is called samapada. Seated images of Ardhanarishvara are missing in iconographic treatises, but are still found in sculpture and painting. Though the canons often depict the Nandi bull as the common vahana (mount) of Ardhanarishvara, some depictions have Shiva's bull vahana seated or standing near or behind his foot, while the goddess's lion vahana is near her foot.|$|E
5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on <b>the</b> <b>posture</b> and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, <b>the</b> <b>posture</b> is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops species {{possessed a}} sturdy build, with strong limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. Although {{certainly}} quadrupedal, <b>the</b> <b>posture</b> of these dinosaurs {{has long been}} the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed out, in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, <b>the</b> <b>posture</b> is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E

40|$|A {{method to}} {{generate}} a high-continuity thickness measuring path has been proposed in our own developed automatic system using laser displacement sensors and an industrial robot to measure and evaluate a free curved plate thickness. Besides the system generates the thickness measuring path {{on the basis of}} the point cloud data representing a workpiece shape, in this method, a quaternion is used to represent a change in <b>the</b> measuring <b>posture</b> with squad which is an interpolation algorithm. This paper presents a new method to determine the positions and <b>the</b> <b>postures</b> of <b>the</b> representative points for continuous interpolation. These positions and <b>the</b> <b>postures</b> are determined using 3 D Configuration space(C-Space) consisting three parameters for representing <b>the</b> measuring <b>posture.</b> For details, <b>the</b> measurable <b>postures</b> are mapped in the C-Space on each measuring point. Then, the positions of the representative points are determined using a local maximum value of the distance between centroid coordinate of <b>the</b> measurable <b>postures</b> in adjacent points. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>postures</b> of them are determined using <b>the</b> common <b>postures</b> of adjacent points or the distance from the origin of the C-Space. The continuity of the measuring path is evaluated from the change in the joint angle of the robot. Specifically, angular acceleration of the joint angle is used to evaluate for stabilization of the high-speed robot motion. The experimental result shows that the angular acceleration of the robot joint in generated path is smaller than that of the path generated by a conventional method...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{responses}} {{of the human body}} in a standing position and in a sitting position have been compared. The apparent mass and transmissibilities to the head, six locations along the spine, and the pelvis were measured with eight male subjects exposed to vertical whole-body vibration. In both <b>postures,</b> <b>the</b> principal resonance in the apparent mass occurred in the range 5 – 6 Hz, with slightly higher frequencies and lower apparent mass in <b>the</b> standing <b>posture.</b> There was greater transmission of vertical vibration to the pelvis and the lower spine and greater relative motion within the lower spine in <b>the</b> standing <b>posture</b> than in <b>the</b> sitting <b>posture</b> at <b>the</b> principal resonance and at higher frequencies. Transmissibilities from the supporting surface (floor or seat) to the thoracic region had similar magnitudes for both standing and sitting subjects. The lumbar spine has less lordosis and may be more compressed and less flexible in <b>the</b> sitting <b>posture</b> than in <b>the</b> standing <b>posture.</b> This may have reduced the relative motions between lumbar vertebrae and both the supporting vibrating surface and the other vertebrae in <b>the</b> sitting <b>posture.</b> <b>The</b> characteristics of the vibration transmitted to the pelvis may have differed in <b>the</b> two <b>postures</b> due to different transmission paths. Increased forward rotation of the pelvis in <b>the</b> standing <b>posture</b> may have caused the differences in {{responses of}} the pelvis and the lower spine that were observed between <b>the</b> two <b>postures...</b>|$|R
5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>posture</b> and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include {{the idea that the}} hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} {{in western}} jackdaw flocks {{is determined by}} supplanting, fighting, and threat displays—several {{of which have been}} described. In the bill-up posture, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, <b>the</b> <b>posture</b> is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A bill-down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the forward-threat posture, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the defensive-threat posture, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the joint effects of body posture and calf muscle pump, the calf blood flow of eight healthy volunteers {{was measured with}} pulsed Doppler equipment during and after 3 min of rhythmic exercise on a calf ergometer in the supine, sitting, and standing postures. Muscle contractions seriously impeded calf blood flow. Consequently, blood flow occurred mainly between contractions and reached a plateau that lasted at least the final 100 s of each exercise series. After exercise the blood flow decreased much faster in the sitting and standing <b>postures</b> than in <b>the</b> supine <b>posture.</b> There {{was no difference in}} blood flow between various <b>postures</b> during <b>the</b> same submaximal exercise. However, subjects in <b>the</b> standing <b>posture</b> were able to perform exercise with a higher load than in <b>the</b> supine <b>posture,</b> and blood flow in <b>the</b> standing <b>posture</b> could become twice as high as in <b>the</b> supine <b>posture.</b> We conclude that calf blood flow is regulated according to needs; available perfusion pressure determined maximal blood flow and exercise; and compared with <b>the</b> supine <b>posture,</b> <b>the</b> standing <b>posture</b> and calf muscle pump increase the perfusion pressure...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the physiological effects of body <b>posture</b> on cycling. <b>The</b> familiar positions of bicycle riding have been <b>the</b> touring <b>posture</b> (hands stretched on top handlebar) and <b>the</b> racing <b>posture</b> (hands bent at the elbow, with the back horizontal). However, a relatively new stance has been gaining in popularity since the mid- 1970 s. This is <b>the</b> semi-recumbent <b>posture,</b> in which <b>the</b> rider is seated on an office-like chair, adopting body angles similar to that of an automobile driver, with the pedals located in front of the cyclist. This study tested the above-mentioned positions, {{with the addition of a}} fully supine recumbent posture, at a moderate commuting workload (90 watts), pedaled at 60 revolutions per minute frequency. Among male volunteers, 8 healthy subjects performed a sequence of 4 posture trials on a mechanical ergometer, each lasting for 8 minutes with intermittent rest period averaging 27 minutes. Several physiological responses were measured during rest and steady-state conditions, the most prominent of which were the oxygen (caloric) consumption and heart rate. The results of the analysis of variance, using Latin Square design, showed that the heart rate during steady-state in <b>the</b> racing <b>posture</b> was significantly (α =. 05) higher than that in <b>the</b> semi-recumbent <b>posture.</b> <b>The</b> oxygen uptake for <b>the</b> racing <b>posture</b> also expressed a higher average, but the difference was not statistically significant.
