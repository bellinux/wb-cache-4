5|$|The young Henry FitzEmpress {{returned}} to England again in 1149, this time planning {{to form a}} northern alliance with Ranulf of Chester. The Angevin plan involved Ranulf agreeing {{to give up his}} claim to Carlisle, held by the Scots, in return for being given the rights to the whole of the Honour of Lancaster; Ranulf would give homage to both David and Henry Fitzempress, with Henry having seniority. Following <b>this</b> <b>peace</b> agreement, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, probably with help from the Scots. Stephen marched rapidly north to York and the planned attack disintegrated, leaving Henry to return to Normandy, where he was declared duke by his father.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{this period}} Madagascar {{continued}} {{to engage the}} French in negotiations, but these were to prove unsuccessful with both sides unwilling to capitulate on key points of contention. After two years of stalemate, a column brought an ultimatum to Antananarivo in December 1885, asking for recognition of French rights in northeastern Madagascar, a French protectorate over the Sakalava, recognition of French property principles and an indemnity of 1,500,000 francs. <b>This</b> <b>peace</b> treaty was ratified by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony in January 1886 and French government representatives two months later.|$|E

5|$|One year later, the feudal {{families}} of the Sasanian Empire, who were tired of war against the Byzantines and Khosrow's oppressive policies, freed Khosrow's son Kavadh, who had been imprisoned by his own father. The feudal families included: Shahrbaraz himself, who represented the Mihran family; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by spahbed Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni; and finally the Kanarang. In February, Kavadh, along with Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire on 25 February, and {{with the aid of}} Piruz Khosrow, executed all his brothers and half-brothers, including Khosrow II's favorite son Mardanshah. Three days later, he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. With the agreement of the nobles of the Sasanian empire, Kavadh then made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius; under the terms of <b>this</b> <b>peace,</b> the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E
5|$|The annals record Olaf's {{return to}} Ireland in 938 {{as well as}} a raid he carried out that year on Kilcullen in modern-day County Kildare, where he is said to have taken a {{thousand}} prisoners. Æthelstan died in October 939 and very soon afterwards Olaf left for York where he was able to quickly establish himself as king of Northumbria. Olaf was joined in England by his cousin Olaf Cuaran, and Olaf's brother Blácaire was left to rule in Dublin while he was away. Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum records that Olaf and the new English king Edmund met at Leicester in 939 and came to an agreement on dividing England between the two of them. <b>This</b> <b>peace</b> was short-lived and within a few years of the agreement the Vikings had seized the Five Boroughs of Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Stamford.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>peace</b> {{lasted for}} around a decade, until Trajan became emperor in 98 AD. Immediately upon {{becoming}} emperor, Trajan travelled to the frontier stretching from Pannonia to Moesia. Here he strengthened the fortifications. In 101–102 AD Trajan assembled {{an army of}} up to 150,000 men to send against Decebalus' 50,000. The army was split into two and entered into Dacian territory at two points along the frontier. The columns met at Tibiscum and marched together towards Sarmizegetusa. At Tapae they encountered and defeated the Dacian force. This in turn forced Decebalus to sue for peace, which Trajan agreed to, but, he imposed harsh terms against the Dacians. Decebalus {{failed to meet the}} terms of the peace and in 105 Trajan launched a second campaign against him. By 106, Trajan completed the conquest of Dacia and ended its existence as an independent kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany: Under {{the terms}} of <b>this</b> <b>peace</b> treaty, the Four Powers renounced all rights they {{formerly}} held in Germany, including Berlin.

25|$|Although <b>this</b> <b>peace</b> treaty {{affirmed the}} status quo ante bellum and thus the mixed {{jurisdiction}} over the Grisons between the Habsburgs, the bishopric of Chur, and the Three Leagues remained, the battle of Calven {{marked the end of}} the Habsburg expansion in the Grisons. The victory also strengthened the republican Three Leagues, who would consolidate their alliance in 1524. The Vinschgau, however, became a Habsburg territory in 1618, when the Grisons became a theater in the Thirty Years' War.|$|E

25|$|Although Saladin {{claimed a}} {{military}} victory at Chastellet, his troops {{fell victim to}} another enemy. Directly after the siege, {{the bodies of the}} 700 Crusaders killed at Jacob’s Ford were placed into a pit. The corpses in the pit began to decay in the August heat and, as a result, a plague ensued, killing approximately ten of Saladin's officers. However, this setback did not diminish Saladin’s military prowess. In 1180, Saladin and Baldwin signed a truce. Seven years after <b>this</b> <b>peace</b> treaty between the Muslims and the Crusaders, Saladin captured Jerusalem from the Christians after the Battle of Hattin in 1187.|$|E
