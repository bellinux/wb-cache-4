5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E
5|$|On May21, {{the large}} {{eye of the}} typhoon crossed Guam, {{producing}} typhoon-force winds (greater than 118km/h or 73mph) {{for a period of}} 18hours. An estimated 80% of the buildings on the island were damaged to some degree, including 3,300houses that were destroyed. Pamela's slow motion produced 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, making May 1976 the wettest on record in Guam. Despite the high damage, well-executed warnings kept the death toll <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one.</b> After affecting the island, the typhoon weakened and turned northeastward, passing near Iwo Jima before becoming an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|Saladin, who overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, was {{hostile to}} the Shi’ite {{principles}} of learning propounded at al-Azhar during the Fatimid Caliphate, and under his Ayyubid dynasty the mosque suffered from neglect. Congregational prayers were banned by Sadr al-Din ibn Dirbass, appointed qadi by Saladin. The reason for this edict may have been Shāfi‘ī teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> mosque, or mistrust of the former Shi'a institution by the new Sunni ruler. By this time, the much larger al-Hakim Mosque was completed; congregational prayers in Cairo were held there.|$|E

The most stable {{of them are}} lutetium-177m, with half-life of 160.4 days and lutetium-174m, with half-life of 142 days; this is longer than half-lives of the ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes, except only for lutetium-173, 174, and 176.|$|E

5|$|There {{are only}} three stars in the {{constellation}} brighter than magnitude 4.5, and 37stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5. Leo Minor {{does not have a}} star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> star, Beta. It is unclear whether he intended to give 46Leonis Minoris a Bayer designation, as he recognized Beta and 46Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.|$|E
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{creative}} differences, Kuntz {{backed out of}} the project, but created an adventure module that would be published {{at the same time as}} Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> or two hours per day. Finally in 2005, Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer (2007).|$|E

5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at 15–36 months and males at 4–5 years. Mating may occur anytime after {{reaching}} sexual maturity, but is mostly {{seen in the}} rainy season. In Zambia, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere it is the mating season. Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start mating {{with each other in}} separate pairs. Males chase the females to find out if they are in estrus. They also test the female's urine. Usually, a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. It is 2–4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a gestation period of 9 months, and give birth <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> calf each time.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{devoted his}} life entirely to his profession, {{remaining}} single. He {{is known to have}} been attracted <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> woman—Josefa Moreu, teacher at the Mataró Cooperative, in 1884—but this was not reciprocated. Thereafter Gaudí took refuge in the profound spiritual peace his Catholic faith offered him. Gaudí is often depicted as unsociable and unpleasant, a man of gruff reactions and arrogant gestures. However, those who were close to him described him as friendly and polite, pleasant to talk to and faithful to friends. Among these, his patrons Eusebi Güell and the bishop of Vic, Josep Torras i Bages, stand out, as well as the writers Joan Maragall and Jacint Verdaguer, the physician Pere Santaló and some of his most faithful collaborators, such as Francesc Berenguer and Llorenç Matamala.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, {{both the}} piano version and the orchestral version were published. The first edition was a piano version by the Brandis & Dufour {{who made it}} {{available}} {{on the day of}} the premiere, based on Rossini's piano version but reduced <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> piano, also cutting passages. It was soon followed by editions from Chappell in London, Ricordi in Milan, and Oliver Ditson in Boston, somewhat later by B. Schotts Söhne. These four prints have in common that they were settings for harmonium and only one piano. Ricordi published a piano reduction of the orchestral score rather than following Rossini's original piano version. Some versions failed to mention that Rossini intended the work to be accompanied by two pianos.|$|E

5|$|Like in {{the first}} game, Sora can summon a Disney {{character}} to aid him in battle. Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora {{for as long as}} the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.|$|E
5|$|Michigan won {{the coin}} toss and elected {{to defer to}} the second half, and Alabama opened play with a three-and-out. Michigan was then held <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> first down before they punted on their first possession. On the drive that ensued, Alabama's mix of play-action passes and rushes ended with a two-yard {{touchdown}} reception by Michael Williams from AJ McCarron for a 7–0 lead. After the Crimson Tide defense again forced a Wolverine punt, on Alabama's next drive, McCarron connected with DeAndrew White for a 51-yard touchdown reception and a 14–0 lead. Michigan stalled on their next drive after Denard Robinson threw an interception to Dee Milliner who returned it to Michigan's 17-yard line. On third down, Eddie Lacy rushed nine yards {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown and a 21–0 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2009, the G {{was once}} again {{extended}} south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for overhaul of the Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue/Ninth Street—used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith–Ninth Streets—to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> storage track at Smith–9th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having {{to wait in the}} station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith–Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the visit, the US {{government}} and the AFV made thorough preparations to make Diệm's visit pleasant, and the AFV successfully lobbied the media to write favourable reports on the South Vietnamese leader. Diệm was trumpeted {{as a champion of}} democracy, and mentions of his autocratic style and election rigging were avoided. Diệm arrived by plane in Washington, D.C. on May 8, and was personally greeted at the airport by President Dwight D. Eisenhower—an honor Eisenhower accorded <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> other visiting head of state. Diệm's motorcade was greeted by 50,000 wellwishers and his address to the US Congress and his policies were heartily endorsed by both sides of politics. During his time in the US capital, Diệm also attended receptions, and had private meetings with both Eisenhower and the US Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, to discuss American support for South Vietnam, although the meeting with Dulles was ineffectual as Diệm spoke continuously, rendering two-way discussions impossible.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{football}} {{improved his}} confidence {{and with it}} his effectiveness. Under Lee Clark, he started regularly but was often substituted; under Gary Rowett, who replaced Clark in late October, he played every minute of Birmingham's league fixtures, usually partnering Stephen Gleeson in a 4–2–3–1 formation, until injuring a knee in mid-February. He missed the 4–3 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion, in which the local newspaper attributed Birmingham's defensive frailties to his absence. On his return, away at Ipswich Town, his presence achieved more in attack than defence, twice– with a header {{and then with a}} volley– restoring Birmingham <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> goal behind before Ipswich secured a 4–2 win in stoppage time. Rowett signed Nottingham Forest midfielder Robert Tesche on loan on 2 March. Initially he played alongside Davis in place of the suspended Gleeson, and then as part of a three-man midfield, but when Rowett reverted to 4–2–3–1, it was Davis who missed out.|$|E
5|$|The August 1938 {{shipbuilding}} plan {{envisioned a}} total of 15 Project 23-class battleships, and this grandiose scheme was only slightly revised downward to 14 ships in the August 1939 plan. Eight of these were to be laid down before 1942 and the remaining six before 1947. However, only four were actually laid down before the outbreak of World War II forced the Soviets to reassess their ambitious plans. On 19 October 1940 an order was issued, signed by Stalin and Molotov, that no new battleships would be laid down in order to concentrate on smaller ships' building (and also, probably, because more resources were required for the Army), one ship is to be scrapped, and priority should be given <b>to</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the three remaining battleships.|$|E
