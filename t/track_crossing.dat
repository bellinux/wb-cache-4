5|$|The tornado entered Hale County west of Sawyerville, {{continuing}} {{to move through}} sparsely populated rural areas. North of Sawyerville, the tornado strengthened to EF3 intensity as it was crossing Alabama State Highway 14. Reaching estimated maximum winds of , the tornado continued on its northeast <b>track,</b> <b>crossing</b> County Roads 18 and 21, Alabama State Highway 69, and County Road 29 as it moved south and east of the small communities of Harper Hill and Ingram. The tornado caused extensive structural damage through this area, consisting of many mobile homes and site-built homes being either heavily damaged or destroyed. A church in the area was heavily damaged, vehicles were tossed and destroyed, and thousands of trees were downed as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{platforms}} are {{not located}} opposite one another, but are staggered, with the <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> located between the platforms. The stop {{is located in}} a residential area, but adjacent to parkland on both the Leichhardt and Haberfield sides. Pathways were built between the closest streets - Hawthorne Parade in Haberfield and Darley Road in Leichhardt - including a bridge over the canal. This improved pedestrian access between the two suburbs which had been limited by the railway.|$|E

25|$|The first Ordnance Survey map of 1860 shows a farm <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> the viaduct {{as part of}} a byway from West Gatehead farm to Cockhill {{farm and}} the Craig estate. The new wooden viaduct of 1846 carries the railway. The new bridge {{required}} embankments to give sufficient height over the river, whereas the first viaduct was sprung from higher river embankments. On the Troon side the site of the old track has been obliterated by Fairlie Colliery (Pit No.3) and its spoil heaps.|$|E
25|$|The {{first section}} of the South Shore Line, under {{construction}} since 1966, opened on September 1, 1971, branching from the original Red Line at a flying junction north of Columbia (now JFK/UMass). It ran along {{the west side of}} the Old Colony rail right-of-way (which has since been reduced to one <b>track),</b> <b>crossing</b> to the east side north of Savin Hill. The northernmost station was North Quincy, with others at Wollaston and Quincy Center. Service began alternating between Ashmont and Quincy. Ashmont service operated with 1400-series cars, while the Quincy branch only had 1500- and 1600-series cars because they had cab signaling.|$|E
25|$|Taverners Hill {{is located}} on an {{embankment}} adjacent to Parramatta Road and the Hawthorne Canal at the border of Lewisham, Summer Hill, Haberfield and Leichhardt. The platforms are not located opposite one another, but are staggered, with the <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> located between the platforms. A footbridge {{to the south of}} the stop over Parramatta Road connects to the citybound platform.

25|$|So it {{was that}} on 2 August 1907 the Act was passed, {{empowering}} the North British Railway to construct Methil no 3 Dock and associated railway connections; the NBR was required to complete {{it as soon as}} possible. Wemyss withdrew his Bill, and in 1908 the NBR let a contract to Robert McAlpine for the no 3 Dock. It was to be located east of the earlier docks and was undoubtedly very large. The single <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> of the River Leven was to be widened to four tracks, and considerable additional sidings accommodation was to be provided. The railway facilities alone were to cost £50,000. As part of the scheme, Leven Harbour, already badly silted up, was closed.|$|E
25|$|Leichhardt North {{is located}} {{parallel}} to the City West Link Road, serving a residential area in Leichhardt. The platforms are not located opposite one another, but are staggered, with the <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> located between the platforms. There are entrances {{at either end of}} the stop. The outbound platform connects to the City West Link / James Street intersection. The citybound platform connects to a pathway that leads to either the southern or northern parts of Charles Street - the latter via a bridge over the City West Link. Immediately to the east of the stop, the light rail passes through a tunnel under the City West Link. Leichhardt Oval is a short walk from the station.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the previous successful Australian ambushes along the Sungei Koemba river in May and June, the Indonesians planned to increase their activity with H BTP and J BTP moving against the Gumbang, Tringgus and Bukit Knuckle areas, while additional forces from BTP 2 were also subsequently redeployed against Serian. In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak, and these would later result in further fighting. One such patrol by 2 Platoon, A Company ascertained that the Indonesians had recently increased their use of an east-west <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> the border south-west of the company base at Stass and consequently the Australians decided to conduct a further Claret operation in order {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity provided.|$|E

500|$|A brickworks {{and clay}} pit were {{served by the}} next siding. It was not {{constructed}} until 1936, and continued in use until the line closed. The line rose on an embankment to cross the A161 road, and then entered a cutting, where it was joined by the Hatfield Moors branch, the two running parallel for some [...] before the cutting became an embankment, and they joined near Epworth station. Epworth had a passing loop and sidings to the east, with the <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> the High Street on a brick bridge {{to the south of}} the station.|$|E
500|$|After the leasing of the New Jersey and New York Railroad to the Erie Railroad, {{the history}} of Anderson Street station {{remained}} rather quiet, with {{minor changes to the}} station building and site occurring over the next sixty years. The Erie had repainted the station to a common green and white Erie Railroad paint scheme. By 1964, there were new asphalt pavement platforms on both the northbound main track and the southbound team <b>track,</b> <b>crossing</b> gates had been installed and the paint scheme was fading to a darker green. By September 1966, the Erie Lackawanna (a merge of the Erie Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western) sold off the station building to become the site of the Green Caboose Thrift Shop, [...] and repainted a teal green color. The nearby watchman's shanty, closed on Sundays, were repainted to tan and green with a red roof. The team track was also being dismantled by this point. Later, in 1972, the station experienced minor changes, with the Green Caboose Thrift Shop remaining in service the station building being repainted by the Erie Lackawanna a dark green (with the Erie Lackawanna's red doors). The nearby watchman's shanty was not repainted, remaining the railroad's common red color and the team track had been long removed, with no remains were noticeable.|$|E
500|$|New York's [...] {{of trail}} contain very little {{elevation}} change {{compared to other}} states. From south to north, the trail summits many small mountains under [...] in elevation, its highest point in New York being Prospect Rock at , and only [...] from the border with New Jersey. The trail continues north, climbing near Fitzgerald Falls, passing through Sterling Forest, and then entering Harriman State Park and Bear Mountain State Park. The lowest point on the entire Appalachian Trail is in the Bear Mountain Zoo [...] It crosses the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge. It then passes through Fahnestock State Park, and continues northeast and crosses the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line. This <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> {{is the site of}} the only train station along the trail's length. It enters Connecticut via the Pawling Nature Reserve. The section of the trail that passes through Harriman and Bear Mountain State Parks is the oldest section of the trail, completed in 1923. A portion of this section was paved by 700 volunteers with 800 granite-slab steps followed by over a mile of walkway supported by stone crib walls with boulders lining the path. [...] The project took four years, cost roughly $1 million, and was officially opened in June 2010. [...] The project was done by the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference. The New York–New Jersey Trail Conference maintains and updates the Appalachian Trail in New York.|$|E

2500|$|The {{station at}} Täsch has been {{particularly}} important since the 1970s, as the end point of {{the part of the}} valley road available for use by motor vehicles. [...] Originally a simple two <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> station, the Täsch station site was expanded in 1975 by the addition of a separate platform track for shuttle trains to Zermatt. At the same time, the 1891 station building received a modern extension housing a ticket office, while the fields surrounding the station were transformed into parking spaces.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Welland Canal Relocation Project in the early 1970s, the CASO line was rerouted through the Townline Tunnel, {{bypassing}} this bridge. [...] One <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> Bridge 15 remained in service as an interchange line between the Canadian National Railway Canal Subdivision through Welland and the new Wainfleet Marshalling Yard at Wainfleet, Ontario. In the late 1980s, service on this line between Welland and Wainfleet ended and the track was removed between Wainfleet and a point a couple of hundred meters west of Bridge 15.|$|E
2500|$|Grade {{crossing}} protection {{practices in}} Canada are virtually {{identical to those}} in the United States (see below) using the same alternating flashing red lights and gate arms. The only significant differences are the crossbuck signs, which have no wording but are white with a red outline; the supplemental sign to indicate the number of tracks, which has an image of a track instead of the word [...] "TRACKS", and has the number and track image in either red (usually for CN rail lines) or black (for CP rail lines); and the advance-warning sign, which is a yellow diamond shape with a diagram of a <b>track</b> <b>crossing</b> a straight segment of road (similar to a crossroads sign, except that the horizontal road is replaced by a track). Before changes in regulations mandated bilingual (English and French) or no-wording signs, crossbucks were nearly identical {{to those in the}} US, except that they would either read [...] "Railway Crossing" [...] or “Traverse De Chemin De Fer” instead of [...] "Railroad Crossing." [...] The red lights also flash a little faster than in the United States.|$|E
