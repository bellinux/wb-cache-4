40|$|Key words: {{diversion}} tunnel; textural stress; stress distribution; failure peculiarity Abstract. The <b>textural</b> <b>stress</b> {{has great}} {{effect on the}} stability of rock. According to the measured geo-stress data, through FEM and combined with the linear multivariate regression method, the geo-stress field was conducted. Using these methods, a diversion tunnel of a large-scale hydropower station was analyzed to study the stress distribution. It was shown that the stress concentration was located {{at the bottom of}} the wall and the arch top, the stress in the wall was little and the failure happened {{at the bottom of the}} wall and the arch top, then the bottom board and some areas far from the tunnel. Under the condition without considering <b>textural</b> <b>stress,</b> the stress concentration area located in the wall and the failure happened at the bottom of the wall, then in the middle of the wall and at the arch top...|$|E

Higher WHC and protein binding of gels were obtained under prolonged pasteurisation time. Furthermore, surface pressure in liquid samples correlated with dry-heating time. The surface hydrophobicity increased at short dry-heating periods, after which it stagnated. The molecular changes resulting in higher hydrophobicity and improved gel properties was mainly induced by heating time...|$|R
40|$|The study gives {{a summary}} of the results of {{industrial}} and laboratory investigations regarding an assessment of the thermal fatigue behaviour of creep-resistant austenitic cast steel. The first part of the study was devoted to the problem of <b>textural</b> <b>stresses</b> forming in castings during service, indicating them as a cause of crack formation and propagation. Stresses are forming in carbides and in matrix surrounding these carbides due to considerable differences in the values of the coefficients of thermal expansion of these phases. The second part of the study shows the results of investigations carried out to assess the effect of carbon, chromium and nickel on crack resistance of austenitic cast steel. As a criterion of assessment the amount and propagation rate of cracks forming in the specimens as a result of rapid heating followed by cooling in running water was adopted. Tests were carried out on specimens made from 11 alloys. The chemical composition of these alloys was comprised in a range of the following values: (wt-%) : 18 - 40 %Ni, 17 - 30 %Cr, 1. 2 - 1. 6 %Si and 0. 05 - 0. 6 %C. The specimens were subjected to 75 cycles of heating to a temperature of 900 oC followed by cooling in running water. After every 15 cycles the number of the cracks was counted and their length was measured. The results of the measurements were mathematically processed. It has been proved that the main factor responsible for {{an increase in the number}} of cracks is carbon content in the alloy. In general assessment of the results of investigations, the predominant role of carbon and of chromium in the next place in shaping the crack behaviour of creep-resistant austenitic cast steel should be stressed. Attention was also drawn to the effect of high-temperature corrosion as a factor definitely deteriorating the cast steel resistance to thermal fatigue...|$|R
40|$|Non-rigid surface registration, {{particularly}} {{registration of}} human faces, finds {{a wide variety}} of applications in computer vision and graphics. We present a new automatic surface registration method which utilizes both attraction forces originating from geometrical and <b>textural</b> similarities, and <b>stresses</b> due to non-linear elasticity of the surfaces. Reference and target surfaces are first mapped onto their feature image planes, then these images are registered by subjecting them to local deformations, and finally 3 D correspondences are established. Surfaces are assumed to be elastic sheets and are represented by triangular meshes. The internal elastic forces act as a regularizer in this ill-posed problem. Furthermore, the non-linear elasticity model allows us to handle large deformations, which can be essential, for instance, for facial expressions. The method has been tested successfully on 3 D scanned human faces, with and without expressions. The algorithm runs quite efficiently using a multiresolution approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of immature crystallization and some lunar textures characterized by it {{are the principal}} objectives of this investigation. A comparative and selective approach is adopted, and particular reference is made to the form and textural relations of olivine in 12009 and of pyroxenes and plagioclase in 12021, and to terrestrial analogs. The optic orientation of the olivines in 12009 is determined, and their skeletal crystallization is illustrated and evaluated. Microprobe and optical data are associated in a textural analysis of an analog from the upper contact of a minor intrusion in Skye. The optic orientation of pyroxene enclosed in plagioclase cores is determined, {{and the results are}} plotted stereographically. The need for greater precision in the use of <b>textural</b> terms is <b>stressed,</b> and a new term - intrafasciculate - is introduced for textures in which pyroxene has crystallized within hollow, skeletal plagioclase. Apollo 12 pyroxene-phyric basalts are texturally reviewed, and the crystallization of the phenocrysts is discussed, emphasis being placed on size-independence of skeletal growth...|$|R
40|$|The Niquelàndia Complex {{belongs to}} an {{alignment}} of mafic-ultramafic massifs situated in Central Goiás (Brasil). The Complex displays the following stratigraphy: a) a basal gabbroic zone (BGZ); b) a basal peridotite zone (BPZ); c) a layered ultramafic zone (LUZ); d) a layered gabbroic zone (LGZ). LUZ is a sequence formed by alternating peridotite and pyroxenite layers. The Complex {{has been interpreted}} in various ways. The most recent interpretations are those of Danni et al. (1982), who consider the Complex as a protoophiolitic suite, with presence of mantle peridotites (BPZ), and that of Rivalenti et al. (1982), who consider the Complex as a layered sequence formed by fractionation of a basic magma, without presence of mantle peridotites. Nevertheless, in both cases LUZ is considered as formed by fractionation and cumulus. The textural features do not constitute an unequivocal discrimination tool for the peridotites of the Complex, as foliated and cumulus textures occur both in BPZ and LUZ. The lack of discriminant <b>textural</b> features is <b>stressed</b> by fabric analysis. α-olivine fabric is usually weak and appears mainly related to the textural type {{rather than to the}} stratigraphic unit. The data presented in this paper suggest the idea that BPZ and LUZ rocks are kindred and formed by the same process...|$|R
