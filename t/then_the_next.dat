5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|So far, no {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} synthesize any element {{that could be the}} next group 3 element; if lutetium and lawrencium are considered to be group 3 elements, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> element in the group should be element 153, unpenttrium (Upt). However, after element 120, filling electronic configurations stops obeying Aufbau principle. According to the principle, unpenttrium should have an electronic configuration of 8s25g186f147d1 and filling the 5g-subshell should be stopped at element 138. However, the 7d-orbitals are calculated to start being filled on element 137, while the 5g-subshell closes only at element 144, after filling of 7d-subshell begins. Therefore, it is hard to calculate which element should be the next group 3 element. Calculations suggest that unpentpentium (Upp, element 155) could also be the next group 3 element. If lanthanum and actinium are considered group 3 elements, then element 121, unbiunium (Ubu), should be the fifth group 3 element. The element is calculated have electronic configuration of 8s28p1/21, which is not associated with transition metals, without having a partially filled d-subshell. No experiments have been performed to create unpenttrium, unbiunium or any element that could be considered the next group 3 element; however, unbiunium is the element with the lowest atomic number that has not been tried to be created and thus has chances to be, while unpenttrium, unpentpentium or any other element considered if preceded by lawrencium is very unlikely to be created due to drip instabilities that imply that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at unbihexium.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{versions}} of the dichotomy paradox. In the other version, before Homer could reach the end of the path, he must reach half of the distance to it. Before reaching the last half, he must complete the next quarter of the distance. Reaching the next quarter, he must then cover the next eighth of the distance, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> sixteenth, and so on. There are thus an infinite number of steps that must first be accomplished before he could reach the end of the path. Expressed this way, the dichotomy paradox is very much analogous to that of Achilles and the tortoise.|$|E

25|$|Njóla {{is a long}} didactic theological-philosophical poem Björn wrote mostly {{during his}} survey travels when the weather did not permit to work or in the evenings. It was {{published}} originally in the annual report of 1842 of the Bessastaðir school, and then in 1853 with some minor revisions and again in 1884 in Reykjavík. The poem begins by describing a night view of the skies, and then introduces the reader to astronomic distances, explaining how long a cannonball shot from the sun would take to reach each of the planets—and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> star. In later stanzas, he describes {{the birth of the}} universe, covers Newton's laws and explains gravity. He interweaves such physics and mathematics framed as poetry with theological and philosophical musings about the purpose of the universe, the nature of good and evil, and God's intent.|$|E
25|$|Reisch and Prather pioneered a {{technique}} that combines both the λ-red and CRISPR/Cas9 recombination systems to form a novel methodology called no-SCAR (Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering) for E. coli genome modifications. In this method, a plasmid containing the gene for Cas9 expression (cas9) is first transformed into E. coli cells. After selecting for the transformants using antibiotic resistance, another plasmid containing the targeted gene {{of interest in the}} form of sgRNA and the λ-red operon is transfected. After induced expression of the λ-red recombineering system, linear DNA to be incorporated into the E. coli genome is transformed into the cells. The expression of Cas9 and the sgRNA are then induced, which results in the Cas9 locating the E. coli target DNA based on the sgRNA complement. Cas9 is able to initiate a double strand break and the λ-red system is able to bring the linear DNA to E. coli genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific sgRNA and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> plasmid containing the specific sgRNA target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.|$|E

25|$|The third (or {{technically}} {{fourth or}} fifth) primary melody {{in a march}} is called the trio. The trio is described as the main melody of the march. It is often played legato style in a softer dynamic, and features woodwinds more than brass. Sousa often used clarinets and euphoniums in lower tenor register in his trios. The trio is the most contrasting section, often containing variations of motifs heard in the previous two strains. The trio melody is often repeated once at a softer dynamic, or not repeated at all and goes right to the next section. Generally, it is played quietly for the first (or second) playthrough, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> has a piccolo playing over the trio melody, and in the final playthrough, it is loud. In almost all cases, the trio modulates to the subdominant key of the march, meaning one flat {{is added to the}} key signature. Again, this is for the purpose of contrast and makes the trio more memorable to the listener. The fact that the key is now flatter also offers a more relaxing feel for those trios with softer instrumentation. For marches starting in minor keys, the trio usually modulates to the relative major. This key is maintained {{to the end of the}} piece.|$|E
25|$|The Indians stated {{their first}} innings well, with Mankad and Sarwate putting on 124 {{for the first}} wicket, before the latter became the first wicket to fall for 36 scored from 84 balls, {{dismissed}} by Bill Johnston. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> wicket fell at 145, this time it being that of Gul Mohammad, who was caught and bowled by Bruce Dooland, for 12. Mankad and Hazare contributed a stand of 43 before Hazare was dismissed by Sid Barnes. The next ball afterward, the Indian Captain, Amarnath fell for a duck getting out lbw to Barnes, who got his second wicket. The fifth wicket to fall, at 198, was that of Mankad himself, who had contributed a 116, which created history because it was India's first test century against Australia. He was caught by Don Tallon, the wicketkeeper, off Bill Johnston's bowling for a fine 116. Then Adhikari and Phadkar put up a partnership of 62 to bring some respectability to the score before Adhikari was dismissed for 24. Overnight rain made batting difficult, and after three cheap wickets, Amarnath declared even though India were 103 runs behind. To counter the difficult conditions, Bradman sent his tailenders, Dooland, Johnson and Johnston. But when Sid Barnes fell with the score on 32, Wisden noted that Bradman might have felt worried.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{individuals}} first develop into males and then later {{there is a possibility}} that they become females (protandrous hermaphrodites). This also can be termed as plasticity in sex differentiation. This is shown when there are males, females, and juveniles together in an anemone. In the social groups, the female is the dominant and largest member, with signs of aggression towards other members of the social group. The next rank in the social hierarchy were the fishes that will become males and other fishes that stay as non-reproductive. One experiment placed three juvenile anemonefish in a tank and their behaviors were observed over a month. Observations about social rank were made throughout this period, based on interactions with the group. There was also a noticeable correlation between aggressive behaviors and appeasing behaviors. There were many other signs of dominance in this hierarchy, such as the continuous occupation of territory in the tank by the dominant fish, and increase in body mass of the dominant fish compared to that of lower ranked fish (indicating growth suppression). In addition, a difference in certain steroid levels of the fish indicated that there was reproductive suppression also occurring. The individuals that were ranked lower were reproductively suppressed, which was apparent around the first stage of when the group was formed. Gradually, the sex differentiation and dominance were formed after social interactions occurred for a while. Another experiment performed was if we removed the female from the anemone, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> dominant male would become the female. There is also a dominance hierarchy that exists here. Females actually utilize aggressive dominance to control the males to prevent the formation of other females, and dominant males prevent juvenile males from mating.|$|E

25|$|The tournament was a one-night tournament held on August 21, 2011 in Arena México, CMLL's main venue, and {{featured}} 16 Mini-Estrellas {{teaming up}} for the tournament for the first time. The tournament was part of CMLL's weekly Domingos Arena Mexico show, promoted as {{a celebration of the}} Mini-Estrella division's 19th anniversary, and spanned 9 matches in total including the final one on one match. To determine the team match-ups in the tournament a representative of each team entered a Battle royal where the order of elimination determined when the team would wrestle in the first round – the first two wrestlers eliminated would face off, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two and the next two, with the final two men in the ring facing off in the last of the opening round matches. The final two participants in the Battle Royal were Universito 2000 and Fantasy, who would compete in the last of the first round matches with their respective partners. Of the eight teams only two pairings featured an ongoing scripted feud or storyline, focusing on the developing feud between Aéreo and Pequeño Nitro and the long running rivalry between recently deposed CMLL World Mini-Estrellas Champion Bam Bam and the reigning Mexican National Lightweight Champion Pierrothito that {{had been going on for}} several years. After four first round matches and two semi-finals the rivals Bam Bam and Pierrothito faced the team of Astral and Pequeño Violencia. While their opponents were on opposite sides of the Tecnico/Rudo divide the team was able to put their differences aside to prevent them having to put their mask (Astral) and their hair (Pequeño Violencia) as they defeated Bam Bam and Pierrothito, taking advantage of the friction between the longtime rivals. Bam Bam was forced to wager his hair and Pierrothito had to wager his mask in the Lucha de Apuestas match that followed immediately after their tag team loss. As is traditional in lucha libre the match was contested under best two-out-of-three falls between the two wrestlers. The two quickly split the first two falls between them, leaving the score tied for a third and final fall, which lasted much longer than the first two falls. In the third fall Pierrothito was able to defeat Bam Bam and celebrated in the ring while Bam Bam had all his hair shaved off as a result of the loss.|$|E
