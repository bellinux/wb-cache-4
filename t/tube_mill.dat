50|$|The {{ball and}} tube mills are {{low-speed}} machines that grind the coal with steel balls in a rotating horizontal cylinder. Due to its shape, {{it is called}} a <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> and due to use of grinding balls for crushing, it is called a ball mill, or both terms as a ball <b>tube</b> <b>mill..</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{stamp mill}} {{contained}} 40 1250 lb stamps. Ore entering the mill from the tramway went over grizzlies. It {{then went to}} stamps which dropped 106 times per minute. Only outside amalgamation was used, and the pulp flowed over 6 ft amalgamating plates to Frenier sand pumps, which sent it to hydraulic classifiers. The slime was sent to thickeners; the sand was concentrated in three double deck and two single deck Deister tables. The concentrate was de-watered, after which it was ground in a <b>tube</b> <b>mill.</b> The middling was sent to two Union Vanners. Tailing went from the tables to 7 sand vats. From the <b>tube</b> <b>mill,</b> the ground concentrate flowed over a 6 ft amalgamating plate, fines going to cyanide and portion over 200 mesh returning to <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> for regrinding.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{following}} years the company’s position in the export business, which was important from the beginning, was consolidated and expanded by the acquisition of the Mannesmann <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> in Landore/Wales and by the founding of a Mannesmann <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> in Dalmine/Italy. Branch offices for storage and direct sales business, sometimes with tube processing workshops and pipeline construction capacities, were set up in cooperation with well-established companies all over the world, especially in South America, Asia, and South Africa. In addition, Mannesmannröhren-Werke took up the production of welded steel pipes, stainless steel pipes and other type of pipes and tubes. The company became the worldwide leading manufacturer of steel tube and pipe ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>Mills</b> {{railway station}} was a {{station on the}} Gawler line located in the inner {{northern}} Adelaide, suburb of Kilburn. It was located approximately 8.4 kilometres from Adelaide station, and was demolished in the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> is a {{revolving}} cylinder {{of up to}} five diameters in length used for fine pulverization of ore, rock, and other such materials; the material, mixed with water, is fed into the chamber from one end, and passes out the other end as a slurry.|$|E
50|$|Later {{known as}} the Birmingham Battery Company. Additional {{premises}} were constructed in Selly Oak in 1871 and by 1876 all work had been transferred from Digbeth. The site expanded {{with the addition of}} a copper refinery, a <b>tube</b> <b>mill,</b> a rolling mill and a canal wharf on the Dudley Canal.|$|E
5000|$|The home plant of YS&T {{was known}} as the Campbell Works located in Campbell and Struthers, Ohio. This plant {{contained}} four blast furnaces, twelve open hearth furnaces, several blooming mills, two Bessemer converters, a slabbing mill, a butt-weld <b>tube</b> <b>mill,</b> a 79" [...] hot strip mill, seamless tube mills, and 9" [...] and 12" [...] bar mills at the Struthers Works. The Brier Hill Works consisted of two blast furnaces named Grace and Jeannette, twelve open hearth furnaces, a 40" [...] blooming mill, a 35" [...] intermediate blooming mill, a 24" [...] round mill, 84" [...] and 132" [...] plate mills, and an electric-weld <b>tube</b> <b>mill.</b> During much of the Depression, the Brier Hill works was shut down, but it reopened in 1937. Much of the reopened plant's production comprised tube rounds for the Campbell seamless tube mills. Due to the imbalance of ironmaking and steelmaking facilities at the two plants, rail shipments of molten iron [...] "hot metal" [...] were made from Campbell to Brier Hill from 1937 until 1979.|$|E
50|$|Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment Corporation is an American {{manufacturer}} and supplier of metal machine {{tubes and pipes}} that is based in Perrysburg, Ohio. Founded in 1985, the company specializes in buying and selling <b>tube</b> <b>mills,</b> pipe mills and rollforming machines.|$|R
5000|$|The British <b>Tube</b> <b>Mills</b> {{works were}} served by rail. Rail {{access to the}} works was via the Up North Main only, meaning trains either had to come from Dry Creek and shunt into the works or work [...] "wrong line" [...] from Islington.|$|R
50|$|The British <b>Tube</b> <b>Mills</b> {{works were}} {{originally}} located {{on both sides}} of Churchill Road. Rail access to the eastern works was provided via a level crossing over Churchill Road. The level crossing has long since been removed, but evidence of it is still visible.|$|R
50|$|Rautaruukki {{began to}} grow in Western Europe by {{establishing}} sales offices and making acquisitions. It bought a colour-coating works called Metalcolour A/S from Denmark, a steel wholesale business called CCB-Gruppen from Norway and a <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> called Schmacke Rohr GmbH from Germany. In 1989 Stelform A/S (a new cold-formed section production plant) was established in Denmark. In the end of 1980's Rautaruukki employed almost 10,000 people. In 1989 Rautaruukki became a publicly traded company.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the blast furnace/open hearth steelmaking process, CF&I also used the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process {{for a number of}} years. This process was later replaced by electric arc furnaces (EAF). Currently, one EAF is used at the facility to convert over a million tons of scrap per year into steel billets of various sizes. The billets are then distributed to the three steel finishing facilities (rail mill, rod & bar mill, seamless <b>tube</b> <b>mill)</b> for processing into the various finished products.|$|E
50|$|The {{grinding}} in {{the ball}} and <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> is produced by the rotating quantity of steel balls by their fall and lift due to tube rotation. The ball charge may occupy one third to half of the total internal volume of the shell. The significant feature incorporated in the BBD mills is its double end operation, each end catering to one elevation of a boiler. The system facilitated entry of raw coal and exit of pulverized fuel from same end simultaneously. This helps in {{reducing the number of}} installations per unit.|$|E
50|$|Johnson's {{close friend}} Ross Palmer, {{the owner of}} Palmer <b>Tube</b> <b>Mills</b> of Brisbane, became his primary sponsor in 1981 (with Bryan Byrt Ford also still a major sponsor), and with the donated money allowed him to return the next year to win both the Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) and the Bathurst 1000 (with John French). He won the ATCC again in 1982 (the Tru Blu XD Falcon), 1984 (Greens Tuff XE Falcon), 1988 (Ford Sierra RS500) and 1989 (Sierra RS500). He also won Bathurst in 1989 (in a Ford Sierra with John Bowe) and 1994 (in an EB Falcon, also with Bowe). The names Tru Blu, and Greens Tuff, as well as Red Roo (seen in late 1982 only) were product names of Palmer <b>Tube</b> <b>Mills.</b>|$|R
25|$|Of {{the many}} {{production}} and fabrication mills that once existed on the site, only the steel production (electric furnaces, used for scrap recycling), rail, rod, bar, and seamless <b>tube</b> <b>mills</b> {{are still in}} operation. The wire mill was sold in the late 1990s to Davis Wire, which still produces products such as fence and nails under the CF brand name.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, {{the company}} {{purchased}} Gallatin Steel Company. In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia. [...] In 2016, Nucor announced {{the acquisition of}} a steel plate mill in Longview, TX, and structural <b>tube</b> <b>mills</b> in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois. [...] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> output (responding to boiler load demand) is {{controlled}} by regulating the primary air-flow. This regulation, by sweeping pulverized fuel from the mill, is very fast; comparable with oil firing response, but needs the coal level to be maintained in the mill. A control circuit monitors the coal level in the mill, and controls {{the speed of the}} raw coal feeder to maintain it. Maintaining the coal level in the mill offers a built-in capacity cushion of pulverized fuel to take care of short interruptions in the raw coal circuit.|$|E
50|$|A ball <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> may be {{described}} as a cylinder made of steel plates having separate heads or trunions attached to the ends with each trunion resting on suitable bearings for supporting the machine. The trunions are hollow to allow for the introduction of discharge of the materials undergoing reduction in size. The mill shell is lined with chilled iron, carbon steel, manganese steel, or high chrome liners attached to shell body with counter sunk bolts. These liners are made in different shapes so that the counter inside surface of the mill is suited for requirement of a particular application.|$|E
50|$|Edward Mooney {{was born}} in Mount Savage, Maryland as the seventh child of Thomas and Sarah (née Heneghan) Mooney. At age 5, he moved {{with his family to}} Youngstown, Ohio, where his father worked at a <b>tube</b> <b>mill.</b> Following his father's death in the 1890s, his mother opened a small bakery to support the family, with Edward and his {{siblings}} delivering the baked goods to her customers. He attended St. Charles College in Ellicott City and St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore before being sent to Rome in 1905 to study at the Pontifical North American College. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Pietro Respighi on April 10, 1909.|$|E
5000|$|Dick Johnson won the 1984 Australian Touring Car Championship {{behind the}} wheel of a Group C {{specification}} 351 cuin L XE Falcon sedan, commonly known as [...] "Greens Tuf" [...] (due to the cars green paint and the name of one of the steel products from the main sponsor - Palmer <b>Tube</b> <b>Mills).</b> [...] This final evolution of Greens Tuf was rated at [...] and was retired at the end of 1984 when the Group C-era ended. It is now part of the David Bowden collection.|$|R
50|$|Out of {{the many}} {{production}} and fabrication mills which once existed on the site, only the steel production (electric furnaces, used for scrap recycling), rail, rod & bar, and seamless <b>tube</b> <b>mills</b> are still in operation. The wire mill was sold in the late 1990s to Davis Wire, which produced products such as fence and nails under the CF&I brand name until 2014 when it was closed. The mill is able to produce rail lengths of up to 480 feet (up from the current 80 feet), lengths currently possible only in a few European plants.|$|R
50|$|In 1886, the German {{brothers}} Reinhard (1856-1922) and Max Mannesmann (1857-1915) {{received the}} world's first patent for their invention {{of a process}} for rolling seamless steel pipes (Mannesmann process). Between 1887 and 1889 they founded <b>tube</b> <b>mills</b> with several different business partners in Bous, Germany, in Komotau/Bohemia, in Landore/Wales and in their home town Remscheid/Germany. In 1890, due to technical and financial start-up problems, the <b>tube</b> and pipe <b>mills</b> existing on the continent were folded into Deutsch-Österreichische Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG. The new company had its headquarters in Berlin. Reinhard and Max Mannesmann formed the first board of directors but left it in 1893. In that year the company headquarters were moved to Düsseldorf - {{at that time the}} center of the German tube and pipe industry. The company was renamed Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG in 1908.|$|R
50|$|The city {{developed}} considerable industry {{before and}} after World War II, especially in steel-making. Algoma (formerly Algoma Steel; Essar Steel Algoma) is the largest single employer, with 3500 employees at the main plant and approximately 553 (440 unionized and 113 non-unionized) at an adjacent <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> operated by Tenaris. During the 1940s, the steel and chromium operations were of substantial importance {{to the war effort}} in Canada and the United States. Algoma Steel and the Chromium Mining and Smelting Corporation were key producers for transportation and military machines. The Huron Central Railway has been important to the operation of the steel operation, but Genesee and Wyoming, Inc., owner of the railway, has announced its intention to discontinue operations. It continued to operate under an agreement which terminated on August 15, 2010.|$|E
5000|$|As the new <b>tube</b> <b>mill</b> was built, {{there was}} a need for homes and workmen and their families, so the farms {{gradually}} became subdivisions. As the plant expanded, more and more homes were needed. It is a fairly densely populated area, as contrasted with Chippewa, Darlington, or South Beaver Township. West Mayfield probably has more families of different ethnic backgrounds than any other areas as well. As industrial needs increased, people from many walks of life sought employment in the Borough. It had the highest proportion of rentals in the Blackhawk District in 1970, but with the increasing number of apartments in both Chippewa and Patterson and the increase in new homes built in West Mayfield, the percentage has probably changed in the past ten years. The area is [...]66 square miles, and it has a population of about 2,200.|$|E
50|$|The CuproBraze {{technology}} uses brazing {{instead of}} soldering to join copper and brass radiator components. The heat exchangers {{are made with}} anneal-resistant copper and brass alloys. The tubes are fabricated from brass strip and coated with a brazing filler material in form of a powder based paste or an amorphous brazing foil is laid between the tube and fin. There is another method of coating the tube in-line on the <b>tube</b> <b>mill.</b> This is done using the twin wire-arc spray process where the wire is the braze alloy, deposited on the tube as it is being manufactured at 200-400 fpm. This saves one process step of coating the tube later. The coated tubes, along with copper fins, headers and side supports made of brass, are fitted together into a core assembly which is brazed in a furnace.|$|E

50|$|In 1989 and 1990, {{prompted}} by Palmer <b>Tube</b> <b>Mills</b> who assisted him in receiving multiple sources of sponsorship {{and through the}} company's American offshoot Redkote, Johnson made a brief foray into the NASCAR Cup Series driving a Ford Thunderbird, entering a total of seven races with a best start of 11th at Sears Point Raceway in his first race, and a best finish of 22nd at Pocono Raceway. Johnson also drove a Thunderbird in the first NASCAR race held in Australia, the 1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500 at the Calder Park Thunderdome in Melbourne. Unfortunately for Johnson {{he was involved in}} an early race crash which put him out of the event.|$|R
