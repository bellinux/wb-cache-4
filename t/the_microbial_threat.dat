40|$|Reusing {{filtering}} facepiece respirators (FFRs) {{has been suggested}} as a strategy to conserve available supplies for home and healthcare environments during an influenza pandemic. For reuse to be possible, used FFRs must be decontaminated before redonning {{to reduce the risk}} of virus transmission; however, there are no approved methods for FFR decontamination. An effective method must reduce <b>the</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>threat,</b> maintain the function of the FFR, and present no residual chemical hazard. The method should be readily available, inexpensive and easily implemented by healthcare workers and the general public. Many of the general decontamination protocols used in healthcare and home settings are unable to address all of the desired qualities of an efficient FFR decontamination protocol. The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of two commercially available steam bags, marketed to the public for disinfecting infant feeding equipment, for FFR decontamination. The FFRs were decontaminated with microwave generated steam following the manufacturers ’ instructions then evaluated for water absorption and filtration efficiency for up to three steam exposures. Water absorption of the FFR was found to be model specific as FFRs constructed with hydrophilic materials absorbed more water. The steam had little effect on FFR performance as filtration efficiency of the treated FFRs remained above 95 %. The decontamination efficacy of the steam bag was assessed using bacteriophage MS 2 as a surrogate for a pathogenic virus.

40|$|SummaryResistance and {{tolerance}} are two defense strategies employed by <b>the</b> host against <b>microbial</b> <b>threats.</b> Autophagy-mediated degradation of bacteria {{has been extensively}} described as a major resistance mechanism. Here {{we find that the}} dominant function of autophagy proteins during infections with the epidemic community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA 300 is to mediate tolerance rather than resistance. Atg 16 L 1 hypomorphic mice (Atg 16 L 1 HM), which have reduced autophagy, were highly susceptible to lethality in both sepsis and pneumonia models of USA 300 infection. Autophagy confers protection by limiting the damage caused by α-toxin, particularly to endothelial cells. Remarkably, Atg 16 L 1 HM mice display enhanced survival rather than susceptibility upon infection with α-toxin-deficient S.  aureus. These results identify an essential role for autophagy in tolerance to Staphylococcal disease and highlight how a single virulence factor encoded by a pathogen can determine whether a given host factor promotes tolerance or resistance...|$|R

Coincident with this publication came increasing reports of severe atypical pneumonia of unknown etiology among persons in southeast Asia. This new disease, designated {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS), spread globally in a matter of weeks, infecting primarily close contacts of index patients (e. g., household members and healthcare workers caring for index patients) but also resulting in community transmission in some areas. An unprecedented worldwide collaborative effort was undertaken to determine the cause of the illness and implement prevention measures. A previously unrecognized coronavirus was identified as the causative agent, and health officials throughout the world struggled to implement measures to contain its spread, including isolation of suspect SARS cases and quarantine of exposed persons. The emergence of SARS is a timely reminder of the need to expect the unexpected and to ensure strong national and global public health partnerships when preparing for and responding to infectious diseases. Effectively addressing the threat of SARS will require enhanced global infectious disease surveillance, the development of rapid diagnostics, new therapies, and vaccines, implementation of aggressive evidence-based infection control strategies, and effective communication...|$|R
40|$|Although phylogenetically unrelated, {{filamentous}} oomycetes {{and fungi}} establish similar structures to colonize plants and they represent economically <b>the</b> most important <b>microbial</b> <b>threat</b> to crop production. In mutualistic interactions established by root-colonizing fungi, clear differences to pathogens can be seen, {{but there is}} mounting evidence that their infection strategies and molecular interactions have certain common features. To infect the host, fungi and oomycetes employ similar strategies to circumvent plant innate immunity. This process involves the suppression of basal defence responses which are triggered by the perception of conserved molecular patterns. To establish biotrophy, effector proteins are secreted from mutualistic and pathogenic microbes to the host tissue, where they play central roles in the modulation of host immunity and metabolic reprogramming of colonized host tissues. This review article discusses key effector mechanisms of filamentous pathogens and mutualists, how they modulate their host targets and the fundamental differences or parallels between these different interactions.

40|$|A {{key issue}} {{for the study of}} {{tuberculosis}} infection (TB) is to understand why individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis experience different clinical outcomes. Elaborating the immune mechanisms that determine whether an infected individual will suffer active TB or latent infection can aid in developing treatment and prevention strategies. To better understand the dynamics of M. tuberculosis infection and immunity, we have developed a virtual human model that qualitatively and quantitatively characterizes the cellular and cytokine control network operational during TB infection. Using this model, we identify key regulatory elements in the host response. In particular, factors affecting cell functions, such as macrophage activation and bactericidal capabilities, and effector T cell functions such as cytotoxicity and cytokine production can each be determinative. The model indicates, however, that even if latency is achieved, it may {{come at the expense of}} tissue damage if the response is not properly regulated. A balance in Th 1 and Th 2 immune responses governed by IFN-�, IL- 10, and IL- 4 facilitate this down-regulation. These results are further explored through virtual deletion and depletion experiments. The Journal of Immunology, 2001, 166 : 1951 – 1967.

Staphylococcus aureus often colonizes the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). This was explained by diminished expression of AMP including cathelicidin/LL- 37, human β-defensins- 2 and - 3, and dermcidin. The S 100 -protein psoriasin is an additional keratinocyte-derived AMP that preferentially kills E. coli. As E. coli infections are not observed in atopic skin we investigated the functional role of psoriasin in AD patients. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated enhanced epidermal psoriasin expression in AD. An up to 1500 -fold increase in secreted psoriasin was detected by ELISA in vivo {{on the surface of}} AD skin compared to healthy control skin. Surprisingly, tumor necrosis factor-α-enhanced psoriasin release in primary keratinocytes was inhibited by the Th 2 -cytokines IL- 4 and - 13, whereas IL- 17 and - 22 induced psoriasin. Epidermal barrier disruption significantly enhanced psoriasin expression as demonstrated by tape stripping in healthy volunteers. The upregulation of psoriasin in AD maybe induced by the disrupted skin barrier offering a possible explanation why these patients do not suffer from skin infections with E. coli.

40|$|The {{potential}} for airborne disease transmission exists anywhere humans gather indoors, {{but the situation}} becomes an acute oc-cupational hazard in laboratories where animals are used (1 - 3). Animal laboratories and animal facilities have the unique prob-lem that zoonotic diseases can be transmitted not only between animals but also from animals to humans and vice versa (4, 5). In addition, humans can develop various allergies due to pro-longed or chronic exposure to animals (6). Many common human diseases {{have the potential to}} infect animals. This propensity partly is because of biological and physi-ological similarities between humans and animals. But the potential also {{is due to the fact}} that many human and animal diseases have common evolutionary origins. Tuberculosis, for example, dates to the beginning of animal husbandry (about 15, 000 years ago) and apparently jumped species from cattle to humans (7). Similarly, many types of animal diseases have the ability to af-fect humans. Whenever airborne transmission of disease from humans to animals (or vice versa) occurs, secondary transmis-sions are rare. Transmission of diseases from animals to humans, or from humans to animals, normally occurs through direct con-tact, but can potentially occur via airborne transmission also. Contact transmissions can be controlled through appropriate operating procedures, whereas the control of airborne transmis-sion is best effected by engineered systems. The most common and reliable technologies for keeping in-door or laboratory air free of microbes are dilution ventilation, filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). In ad-dition, laboratories and animal facilities use air pressurization to isolate areas and thereby control the spread of airborne patho-gens between zones. Each of these technologies has unique advantages and applications, and it is necessary to consider the strengths of each technology when designing air contamination-control systems.

Not only phytoplankton but also other heterotrophic protists are occasionally essential to bivalves. Oysters cannot use bacterioplankton, but they can ingest protists that feed on bacterioplankton, thus using microbial energy indirectly through this microbial loop. To evaluate the impor-tance of <b>the</b> <b>microbial</b> loop in planktonic food webs, occurrences of bacteria and heterotrophic protists were studied in the eutrophic Hiroshima Bay, where oyster aquaculture is economically important. Temporal changes in microbial loop components suggested that energy flow within <b>the</b> <b>microbial</b> loop was enhanced {{at the end of}} a phytoplankton bloom. The distribution of microbes and other protists implies that transfer efficiencies within planktonic food webs including <b>the</b> <b>microbial</b> loop differed among regions of the bay. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>microbial</b> loop may play an important role in planktonic food webs in Hiroshima Bay.
