They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{weapons were}} {{imported}} from Japan and the United States in 1883. The first military factories were established and new military uniforms {{were created in}} 1884. Under joint patronage of Gojong & his Queen Consort, a request was made to the United States for more American military instructors {{to speed up the}} military modernization of Korea. Out of all the projects <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> simultaneously, the military project took the longest. To manage these simultaneous projects was in itself was a major accomplishment for any nation. Not even Japan had modernized at the rate of Joseon, and not with as many projects going on at once, a precursor to modern Korea as one of East Asia's Tigers in rapid development into a first class nation during the 1960s–1980s.|$|E

25|$|The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The Bank of Greece {{tried to}} adopt deflationary {{policies}} {{to stave off}} the crises <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April, 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which a number of European countries did during the time period.|$|E
500|$|For her live performances, {{which she}} calls dinner theatre {{because of her}} {{practice}} of throwing tea and tea-time snacks offstage, Autumn makes use of burlesque—"a show that was mainly using humour and sexuality to make a mockery of things <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> socially and politically"—to counterbalance the morbid topics such as abuse and self-mutilation. She incorporates handmade costumes, fire tricks, theatrics, and a female backing band, The Bloody Crumpets: Veronica Varlow, Jill Evyn (Moth), and formerly The Blessed Contessa, Lady Aprella, Little Lucina, Lady Joo Hee, Captain Vecona, Little Miss Sugarless, Mistress Jacinda, and the model Ulorin Vex.

500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the [...] "film {{you are about to}} see is true", was a response to being [...] "lied to by the government about things <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> all over the world", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and [...] "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War". The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film".

Tom Pollock, then Lucas' lawyer writes: [...] "So in the negotiations <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> we drew up a contract with Fox’s head of business affairs Bill Immerman, and me. We came to an agreement that George would retain the sequel rights. Not all the [...] that came later, mind you; just the sequel rights.

In a press conference on December 10, Chechnya's vice-president, Vakha Arsanov, showed a recovered video tape in which the kidnappers forced the four to dress in military uniforms and confess in Russian to spying for [...] "German, English and Israeli special services" [...] and the CIA. According to Chechen security forces, the hostages were executed at an unused factory south of Grozny after a rescue operation that went wrong; it was suggested that their death was a show of defiance to the authorities from the kidnappers. Family members said the abortive rescue attempt [...] "ruined delicate negotiations" [...] <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> between Granger and the kidnappers, and also criticized an unnamed news agency that had given out details of where the hostages were being held shortly before the operation.|$|E
