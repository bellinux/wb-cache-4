Al-Nusra retaliated by shelling Division 13's headquarter in the city. SOHR claimed that Jund al-Aqsa joined the conflict and established checkpoints in support of JaN.

25|$|The 2008 Morelia grenade attacks {{took place}} on September 15, 2008, when two hand grenades were thrown onto a crowded plaza, killing ten people and {{injuring}} more than 100. Some see these efforts as intended to sap the morale of government agents assigned <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cartels; others see them {{as an effort to}} let citizens know who is winning the war. At least one dozen Mexican norteño musicians have been murdered.

25|$|Political {{controls}} were instituted slowly under Carías. The Communist Party of Honduras (Partido Comunista de Honduras, PCH) was outlawed, but the PLH continued to function, {{and even the}} leaders of a small uprising in 1935 were later offered free air transportation should they wish to return to Honduras from their exile abroad. At the end of 1935, however, stressing the need for peace and internal order, Carías began <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposition press and political activities. Meanwhile, the PNH, at the president's direction, began a propaganda campaign stressing that only the continuance of Carías in office could give the nation continued peace and order. The constitution, however, prohibited immediate reelection of presidents.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} the Heungseon Daewongun‘s {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Catholics. Perhaps the most obvious was the lesson provided by China, that it had apparently reaped nothing but hardship and humiliation from its dealing with the western powers - seen most recently in its disastrous defeat during the Second Opium War. No doubt also fresh in the Heungseon Daewongun‘s mind was {{the example of the}} Taiping Rebellion in China, which had been infused with Christian doctrines. 1865 had seen poor harvests in Korea as well as social unrest, which may have contributed to a heightened sensitivity to the foreign creed. The crackdown may also have been related to attempts to combat factional cliques at court, where Christianity had made some inroads.|$|E

In addition, the two were fined $100,000, ordered to pay $77,500 in restitution to AOL, and ordered to forfeit more than $1.1 million, the amount of illegal proceeds from their spamming operation. The charges included conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, and transportation of obscene materials. The trial, which began on June 5, {{was the first to}} include charges under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, according to a release from the Department of Justice. The specific law that prosecutors used under the CAN-Spam Act was designed <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transmission of pornography in spam.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 war and {{separation}} of East-Pakistan demoralized and shattered the nation. President General Yahya Khan {{handed over the}} political power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the Pakistan Peoples Party. With PPP's coming to power, the democratic socialists and visionaries came to the power {{for the first time}} in the country's history, under a democratic transition. Bhutto made critical decision after dismissing chiefs of army, navy and the air force while authorized home confinement orders for General Yahya Khan and several of his collaborators. He adopted the East-Pakistan Commission's recommendations and authorized large-scale court-martial of army officers tainted for their role in East Pakistan. To keep the country united, Bhutto launched a series of internal intelligence operations <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fissiparous nationalist sentiments and movements in the provinces. Proponents of socialism were supported as part of the internal policies and the PPP faced serious challenges, both on internal and foreign fronts.|$|E
25|$|At 12 noon, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé {{organised}} {{a crisis}} team, and Charles Pasqua, Interior Minister of France, met his aides. French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur was recalled from his Christmas vacation in Chamonix, France, {{and other government}} officials were recalled from their vacations. Balladur recalled spending his entire afternoon on the telephone, trying to determine {{what was happening and}} feeling confusion. According to Balladur, the Algerian authorities wanted <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terrorists and that Balladur encountered difficulties discussing the events. At one point, the hijackers dropped the demand for the release of the party leaders. Two hours after the hijacking began, the hijackers asked the captain to depart for Paris so the hijackers could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off as the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the A300 and the Algerian authorities blocked the runway with parked vehicles. When the captain, forced by the hijackers, asked for the removal of the boarding stairs, the Algerian authorities, determined not to give in to any of the hijacker demands, refused. The hijackers announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities gave in to the demands.|$|E

25|$|Armed with batons, PAD forces {{surrounded}} Parliament {{and used}} razor wire barricades {{to prevent the}} legislature from meeting to hear Samak's replacement, Somchai Wongsawat, formally announce his policies. The government decided <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protesters. Police used tear gas but many bullets were fired at the protesters. Many protesters got seriously wounded; some even lost legs, causing over a hundred injuries. One additional PAD leader was killed, claimed by the police, when the bomb in his car went {{off in front of}} the headquarters of the Chart Thai Party, a member of the government coalition. Several protesters lost their hands and legs, although it was not clear whether these injuries were caused by tear gas rounds or the ping-pong grenades. Pornthip Rojanasunand, Director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, claimed that the loss of one particular PAD member's leg could not have been the result of tear gas usage, but came from a more powerful explosion. After viewing photographs of Angkhana Radappanyawut's injuries, Pornthip Rojanasunand suggested unequivocally that the death was caused by the explosion of a tear gas canister. She also stated that {{there was no need to}} conduct further investigations into the death and injuries of protesters because it became clear that they were caused by weapons of police. Investigations took place while charges against the police and government were filed by many protesters.|$|E
500|$|In December 1975, {{attempting}} {{to circumvent the}} restrictions of the banning order, the BPC declared Biko their honorary president. After Biko and other BCM leaders were banned, a new leadership arose, led by Muntu Myeza and Sathasivian Cooper, who were {{considered part of the}} Durban Moment. Myeza and Cooper organised a BCM demonstration to mark Mozambique's independence from Portuguese colonial rule in 1975. Biko disagreed with this action, correctly predicting that the government would use it <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> BCM. The government arrested around 200 BCM activists, nine of whom were brought before the Supreme Court, accused of subversion by intent. The state claimed that Black Consciousness philosophy was likely to cause [...] "racial confrontation" [...] and therefore threatened public safety. Biko was called as a witness for the defence; he sought to refute the state's accusations by outlining the movement's aims and development. Ultimately, the accused were convicted and imprisoned on Robben Island.|$|E
500|$|On 5 March, Nasser's {{security}} coterie arrested {{thousands of}} participants in the uprising. As a ruse to rally opposition against a return to the pre-1952 order, the RCC decreed an end to restrictions on monarchy-era parties and the Free Officers' withdrawal from politics. The RCC succeeded in provoking the beneficiaries of the revolution, namely the workers, peasants, and petty bourgeois, to oppose the decrees, with one million transport workers launching a strike and thousands of peasants entering Cairo in protest in late March. Naguib sought <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protesters, but his requests were rebuffed by the heads of the security forces. On 29 March, Nasser announced the decrees' revocation in response to the [...] "impulse of the street". Between April and June, hundreds of Naguib's supporters in the military were either arrested or dismissed, and Mohieddin was informally exiled to Switzerland to represent the RCC abroad. King Saud of Saudi Arabia attempted to mend relations between Nasser and Naguib, but to no avail.|$|E
