5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. <b>Two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{there are}} <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad {{with the rest}} of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E

5|$|There are <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> get to Lundy, {{depending}} {{on the time of}} year. In the summer months (April to October) visitors are carried on the Landmark Trust's own vessel, MS Oldenburg, which sails from both Bideford and Ilfracombe. Sailings are usually three days a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, with additional sailings on Wednesdays during July and August. The voyage takes on average two hours, {{depending on}} ports, tides and weather. The Oldenburg was first registered in Bremen, Germany in 1958 and has been sailing to Lundy since her engine was replaced in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in Days of Ruin {{is for the}} player to use their military force to defeat the enemy's force. Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, there are <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across {{the different types of}} terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as submerging a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those in the visual range of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E

25|$|Skin {{friction}} {{is caused}} by viscous drag in the boundary layer around the object. There are <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> decrease skin friction: {{the first is to}} shape the moving body so that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{configure}} a {{breeder reactor}} {{to do the}} required breeding. One can place the fertile and fissile fuel together, so breeding and splitting occurs in the same place. Alternatively, fissile and fertile can be separated. The latter is known as core-and-blanket, because a fissile core produces the heat and neutrons while a separate blanket does all the breeding.|$|E

25|$|The report {{acknowledged}} that a redesign {{of the fuel}} system would not be practical in the near-term, and suggested <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{lower the risk of}} recurrence. One was to use a fuel additive (FSII) that prevents water ice from forming down to −40°C. Western air forces have used FSII for decades, and although it is not widely used in commercial aviation, it is nonetheless approved for the 777.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> give consent: {{explicit}} consent or implied consent. Explicit consent {{is when a}} patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{approach}} {{these symptoms}} using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. Rate control seeks {{to reduce the}} heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. Rhythm control seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is {{more important in the}} chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control in long term mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.|$|E

25|$|Before {{gunpowder}} {{was applied}} to civil engineering, there were <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> break up large rocks, by hard labor or by heating with large fires followed by rapid quenching. The earliest record {{for the use of}} gunpowder in mines comes from Hungary in 1627. It was introduced to Britain in 1638 by German miners, after which records are numerous. Until the invention of the safety fuse by William Bickford in 1831, the practice was extremely dangerous. Another reason for danger were the dense fumes given off and the risk of igniting flammable gas when used in coal mines.|$|E
25|$|If at {{any point}} in the game a player can use another player's discard to {{complete}} a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they yell out 'Mahjong', take the piece and reveal their hand, with the way of calling it out depending on variations. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If two or three players need the piece to win, there are <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> resolve the issue depending on agreed table rules: Either the players compete to see who would have a better hand in terms of scoring, or simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn wins the game.|$|E
25|$|Laser fusion was {{suggested}} in 1962 by scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{shortly after the}} invention of the laser itself in 1960. At the time, Lasers were low power machines, but low-level research began as early as 1965. Laser fusion, formally known as inertial confinement fusion, involves imploding a target by using laser beams. There are <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> do this: indirect drive and direct drive. In direct drive, the laser blasts a pellet of fuel. In indirect drive, the lasers blast a structure around the fuel. This makes x-rays that squeeze the fuel. Both methods compress the fuel so that fusion can take place.|$|E
