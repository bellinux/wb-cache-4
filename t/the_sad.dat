5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sad</b> elephant, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the elephant in the room, is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant {{for a short period}} of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.|$|E
5|$|Sato and Reed {{return to}} Enterprise with <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> news that Archer {{did not make}} it off the weapon.

The patient is revealed as Archer. One of the SS personnel steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be a gray-skinned alien.|$|E

The Dummi Bears' name is a reference to the TV series Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears.

25|$|Distraction from sadness using {{art therapy}} {{may be a}} better {{alternative}} than venting sadness. Two studies by Drake and Winner (2012) published from the American Psychological Association compared venting (expressing negative feelings) and distraction (expressing something that is not related to negative feelings) in one study. To distract oneself, the participants were told to draw something unrelated to a sad film they had watched. The participants who had vented were told to draw something related to the film. In study 2, the participants were told to think of a sad event and were put into the venting, distraction, and calming position or sitting conditions. The sitting condition allowed the passage of time to be evaluated. In study 1, the distraction method in which the participants drew something unrelated to <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> film significantly improved negative mood compared to the venting condition. In study 2, the distraction method in which the participants drew a house (something unrelated to <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> event), had significantly improved negative mood compared to venting (drawing <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> event) or the sitting condition (sat quietly for 10 minutes). Therefore, art therapy could be beneficial to people suffering from depressive moods through a way of distraction rather than venting.|$|E

In 1884, Mahnič published a satirical short story entitled Indija Koromandija, in which he mocked the progressive ideas of Josip Stritar, whom Tavčar admired. Tavčar responded with the dystopic novel named 4000, in which he described <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> and repressive society resulting from the implementation of Mahnič's integralist policies.|$|E

The love {{triangle}} involving Anawrahta, Kyansittha and Manisanda {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> story of Saw Mon Hla, one of his queens, are a staple of Burmese theater.
