50|$|Convulxin is a {{snake venom}} toxin {{found in a}} <b>tropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> known as Crotalus durissus terrificus.|$|E
50|$|Although {{it has a}} {{comparatively}} low venom yield, its toxicity {{is considered to be}} the second highest of all rattlesnake venoms (next to the mojave), and the third highest of all snakes in the Western Hemisphere. It has a high neurotoxic fraction that is antigenically related to Mojave toxin (see Crotalus scutulatus, venom A), and includes another component immunologically identical to crotamine, which is a myotoxin also found in <b>tropical</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (see Crotalus durissus). A low but significant protease activity is in the venom, although {{it does not seem to}} have any hemolytic activity.|$|R
50|$|The first myotoxin to be {{identified}} and isolated was crotamine, from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus, a <b>tropical</b> South American <b>rattlesnake,</b> by Brazilian scientist José Moura Gonçalves, in the 1950s.

40|$|The South American <b>tropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus durissus subspp) is {{responsible}} for approximately 10 % of bites from venomous snakes in Brazil. We studied 24 victims of bites by this species over 3 years, in south-eastern Brazil, particularly investigating haemostatic alterations. Thirteen patients were defined as moderately envenomed and 11 as severe. There were two deaths, which were not attributed to venom-induced haemostatic disturbances. However, envenoming by C. durissus is frequently associated with haemostatic disorders, which are probably attributable mainly to {{the action of the}} thrombin-like enzyme, with possible additional effects secondary to the powerful myotoxic activity of the venom...|$|E
40|$|A novel undecapeptide {{has been}} {{isolated}} and structurally characterized from the venoms of three species of New World pit vipers from the subfamily, Crotalinae. These include the Mexican moccasin (Agkistrodon bilineatus), the prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis viridis), and the South American bushmaster (Lachesis muta). The peptide was purified {{from all three}} venoms {{using a combination of}} gel permeation chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. Automated Edman degradation sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry established its peptide primary structure as: Thr-Pro-Pro-Ala-Gly-Pro-Asp-Val-Gly-Pro-Arg-OH, with a non-protonated molecular mass of 1063. 18 Da. A synthetic replicate of the peptide was found to be an antagonist of bradykinin action at the rat vascular B 2 receptor. This is the first bradykinin inhibitory peptide isolated from snake venom. Database searching revealed the peptide to be highly structurally related (10 / 11 residues) with a domain residing between the bradykinin-potentiating peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide domains of a recently cloned precursor from <b>tropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus durissus terrificus) venom gland. BIP thus represents a novel biological entity from snake venom...|$|E
40|$|Coated-platelets are a {{previously}} unrecognized class of activated platelets, detected only after simultaneous stimulation with 2 agonists, thrombin and collagen, or throm-bin and convulxin, a collagen receptor agonist from <b>tropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> venom. 1, 2 Initially {{referred to as}} COAT-platelets, an acronym for collagen and thrombin activated platelets 3; this subset of activated platelets expresses surface phospha-tidylserine, supports a robust prothrombinase activity, and retains high levels of several procoagulant proteins on the cell surface, including factor V, fibrinogen thrombospondin, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor. 1, 2, 4 – 6 Because thrombin generation is the central event in coagulation, coated-platelets {{are considered to be}} prothrombotic. 2 In healthy controls, coated-platelet levels represent ≈ 32 % of the entire platelet population. 7 In previous studies, we found that patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) have significantly lower coated-platelet levels shortly after the hemorrhagic event compared with normal controls, and these levels inversely correlate with the size of the bleed. 8, 9 Prompted by the link between lower coated-platelet levels and increased bleed volume in SICH, 9 we initiated a prospective study investigating whether lower levels of coated-platelets measured {{at the time of the}} initial hemorrhage would be asso-ciated with increased mortality...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>tropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus durissus) is a snake {{of great}} {{importance}} for biomedical industry since its poison {{is used for the}} production of antiophidic serum and researches. Several conditions related to animal health, such as diseases and parasites, which can promote the reduction of poison production by these snakes should be investigated. Accordingly, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the gross and microscopic lesions related to the presence of Ophidascaris arndti in stomachs of tropical rattlesnakes. The gastrointestinal tract of thirty-five South American rattlesnakes captured in Southeastern region of Brazil were analyzed and nineteen animals showed infestation by the parasites, found in the small intestine and, especially, in the stomach of the hosts. Grossly, lesions were characterized by mucosal ulcers occasionally associated with hemorrhage. Microscopic alterations included histiocytic granulomas, fibrosis, necrosis, and hemorrhage. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of a parasitic granulomatous disease was made. The lesions may be related to the cause of death in captivity snakes, since the lesions can promote secondary infections by opportunistic bacteria. Moreover, the intense inflammatory response accompanied by fibrosis may be related to poor functioning of the gastric snakes, which it may exhibit frequent regurgitation of the food...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{comparative}} proteomic and antivenomic {{characterization of the}} venoms of subspecies cascavella and collilineatus of the Brazilian <b>tropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> Crotalus durissus. The venom proteomes of C. d. collilineatus and C. d. cascavella comprise proteins {{in the range of}} 4 - 115 kDa belonging to 9 and 8 toxin families, respectively. Collilineatus and cascavella venoms contain 20 - 25 main toxins belonging to the following protein families: disintegrin, PLA(2), serine proteinase, cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP), vascular endothelial growth factor-like (VEGF), L-amino acid oxidase, C-type lectin-like, and snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP). As judged by reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, cascavella and collilineatus share about 90 % of their venom proteome. However, the relative occurrence of the toxin families departs among the two C. durissus subspecies venoms. The most notable difference is the presence of the myotoxin crotamine in some C. d. collilineatus specimens (averaging 20. 8 % of the total proteins of pooled venom), which is absent in the venom of C. d. cascavella. On the other hand, the neurotoxic PLA 2 crotoxin represents the most abundant protein in both C. durissus venoms, comprising 67. 4 % of the toxin proteome in C. d. collilineatus and 72. 5 % in C. d. cascavella. Myotoxic PLA(2) s are also present in the two venoms albeit in different relative concentrations (18. 1 % in C. d. cascavella vs. 4. 6 % in C. d. collilineatus). The venom composition accounts for the clinical manifestations caused by C. durissus envenomations: systemic neurotoxicity and myalgic symptoms and coagulation disturbances, frequently accompanied by myoglobinuria and acute renal failure. The overall compositions of C. d. subspecies cascavella and collilineatus venoms closely resemble that of C. d. terrificus, supporting the view that these taxa can be considered geographical variations of the same species. Pooled venom from adult C. d. cascavella and neonate C. d. terrificus lack crotamine, whereas this skeletal muscle cell membrane depolarizing inducing myotoxin accounts for similar to 20 % of the total toxins of venom pooled from C. d. collilineatus and C. d. terrificus from Southern Brazil. The possible relevance of the observed venom variability among the <b>tropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> subspecies was assessed by antivenomics using anti-crotalic antivenoms produced at Instituto Butantan and Instituto Vital Brazil. The results revealed that both antivenoms exhibit impaired immunoreactivity towards crotamine and display restricted (similar to 60 %) recognition of PLA(2) molecules (crotoxin and D 49 -myotoxins) from C. d. cascavella and C. d. terrificus venoms. This poor reactivity of the antivenoms may be due to a combination of factors: on the one hand, an inappropriate choice of the mixture of venoms for immunization and, on the other hand, the documented low immunogenicity of PLA(2) molecules. C. durissus causes most of the lethal snakebite accidents in Brazil. The implication of the geographic variation of venom composition for the treatment of bites by different C. durissus subspecies populations is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
