25|$|Urine {{was used}} before the {{development}} of a chemical industry in the manufacture of gunpowder. Urine, a nitrogen source, was used <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> straw or other organic material, which was kept moist and allowed to rot for several months to over a year. The resulting salts were washed from the heap with water, which was evaporated to allow collection of crude saltpeter crystals, that were usually refined before being used in making gunpowder.|$|E
25|$|Foragers first go {{in search}} of water, which they collect in {{multiple}} trips. This water is then regurgitated {{on the surface of}} the nest material (typically plant fibers). The water serves as a type of glue, adhering the fibers of the nest material, beginning the formation of a ball. The water also serves <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> and soften the fibers of the pulp so it is easier to manipulate for the formation of the nest. Using their mandibles, the foraging wasps remove the plant fibers (pulp) from its surface. This forms a ball of pulp, and the wasp will move around the immediate area in order to collect enough pulp (a ball that is about the size of its head, 2–4mm). This collection process only takes a few minutes. At this point, the forager returns to the nest, carrying the pulp mass. Either the forager or the queen wasp will take the pulp and apply it to the growing nest. The forager repeats this process multiple times in a day, usually for many hours. Interestingly, there is evidence that foragers collect the same foraging material on each trip. In nests that are made out of materials with distinct colors, researchers found that each forager collected only one of the colors in the nest, creating a colorful nest.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief and artistic renditions, which depict the species as green, coquís {{commonly}} have a gray or gray-brown coloration. Unlike many frogs, coquís do not possess swimming membranes between their digits, and are not adapted to swimming. However, like all tree frogs, they possess small pads on the tips of their toes which help them adhere <b>to</b> <b>moistened</b> or slippery surfaces.|$|R

She summarised, [...] "The smile and laughter will not leave you while it still manage <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> your eyes here and there". Sandhya Rao of Sify stated, [...] "Manam`s story is something new within Telugu films context, but the way the film showcases romance and emotion, it is far from a regular fare.

500|$|Except as larvae, coconut crabs cannot swim, {{and they}} will drown if left in water {{for more than an}} hour. They use a special organ called a branchiostegal lung to breathe. This organ can be {{interpreted}} as a developmental stage between gills and lungs, {{and is one of the}} most significant adaptations of the coconut crab to its habitat. The branchiostegal lung contains a tissue similar to that found in gills, but suited to the absorption of oxygen from air, rather than water. This organ is expanded laterally and is [...] to increase the surface area; located in the cephalothorax, it is optimally placed to reduce both the blood/gas diffusion distance and the return distance of oxygenated blood to the pericardium. Coconut crabs use their hindmost, smallest pair of legs to clean these breathing organs and <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> them with water. The organs require water to properly function, and the coconut crab provides this by stroking its wet legs over the spongy tissues nearby. Coconut crabs may drink water from small puddles by transferring it from their chelipeds to their maxillipeds.|$|E
500|$|Air masses can be {{modified}} {{in a variety of}} ways. [...] Surface flux from underlying vegetation, such as forest, acts <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> the overlying air mass. [...] Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as [...] to [...] [...] For example, southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow bands. Those bands bring strong localized precipitation since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13°C or 23°F) between the water surface and the air above. Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds (see satellite picture) which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.|$|E

30|$|Previous studies {{pointed out}} that the shallow cumulus moistens the lower {{troposphere}} and promotes deep convection on a diurnal scale (e.g., Shinoda and Uyeda 2002). In the present case, the C-band radar captured some scattered precipitation within the array (Figs. 5 e and 6) as cloud cover reached a diurnal minimum (Figs. 5 a, b). It can be recognized that narrow, shallow, but precipitating (radar-observable) clouds existed when negative Q 2 was apparent. It is implied that these shallow clouds contributed <b>to</b> <b>moistening</b> the lower troposphere. Subarray-scale dry vertical mixing (dry convection, eddy transport, etc.) is also possible, although we have no clear evidence of it for the present case.|$|R

2500|$|Nasal irrigation, or nasal lavage or nasal douche, is a {{personal}} hygiene practice in which the nasal cavity is washed to flush out [...] mucus and debris from the nose and sinuses.

2500|$|The trachea {{is lined}} {{with a layer of}} pseudostratified ciliated {{columnar}} epithelium. The epithelium contains goblet cells, [...] which are glandular, modified simple columnar epithelial cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. Mucus helps <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> and protect the airways. Mucus lines the ciliated cells of the trachea to trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled as phlegm. This self-clearing mechanism is termed mucociliary clearance.|$|E

50|$|Another {{commonly}} used method is solvent extraction, typically using oil (extracted from roasted coffee) or ethyl acetate as a solvent. In this process, solvent is added <b>to</b> <b>moistened</b> green coffee beans to extract {{most of the}} caffeine from the beans. After the beans are removed from the solvent, they are steam-stripped to remove any residual solvent. The caffeine is then recovered from the solvent, and the solvent is re-used. The Swiss Water Process is also used for decaffeination. Decaffeinated coffee beans have a residual caffeine content of about 0.1% on a dry basis. Not all facilities have decaffeination operations, and decaffeinated green coffee beans are purchased by many facilities that produce decaffeinated coffee.|$|R

2500|$|Water [...] is {{required}} for germination. Mature seeds are often extremely dry and need to take in significant amounts of water, relative to the dry weight of the seed, before cellular metabolism and growth can resume. Most seeds need enough water <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> the seeds {{but not enough to}} soak them. [...] The uptake of water by seeds is called imbibition, which leads to the swelling and the breaking of the seed coat. When seeds are formed, most plants store a food reserve with the seed, such as starch, proteins, or oils. This food reserve provides nourishment to the growing embryo. When the seed imbibes water, hydrolytic enzymes are activated which break down these stored food resources into metabolically useful chemicals. [...] After the seedling emerges from the seed coat and starts growing roots and leaves, the seedling's food reserves are typically exhausted; at this point photosynthesis provides the energy needed for continued growth and the seedling now requires a continuous supply of water, nutrients, and light.|$|E
2500|$|Foster later revised {{his view}} in a 2016 piece {{published}} in Palestine Square, arguing that already in 1898 Khalil Beidas {{used the term}} “Palestinian” to describe the region’s Arab inhabitants in the his preface to a book he translated from Russian to Arabic. [...] In the book, [...] , Beidas explained that the summer agricultural work in Palestine began in May with the wheat and barley harvest. After enduring the entire summer with no rain at all—leaving the water cisterns depleted and the rivers and springs dry—”the Palestinian peasant waits impatiently for winter to come, for the season’s rain <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> his fossilized fields.” [...] Foster explained {{that this is the}} first instance in modern history where the term ‘Palestinian’ or ‘Filastini’ appears in Arabic. [...] He added, though, that the term Palestinian had already been used decades earlier in Western languages by the British James Finn, the German Ludwig Schneller, and the American James Wells.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the use of}} {{irrigation}} is disparaged or even prohibited in many premium wine producing regions, its use in Washington is absolutely vital and is a major asset in quality wine production. The average vineyard in Eastern Washington receives approximately [...] in annual rainfall, most of it during the winter months. Without irrigation, agriculture in the region would not be possible. Compared to other wine regions that do not need or practice irrigation, a vineyard manager in Washington State has {{more control over the}} potential quality of the grapes. Utilizing drip irrigation and controlling the amount of water the vines receive and wine allows the grower to limit the amount of vigor (and thus yields) of vine and leverage water stress to produce more concentrated flavors and phenolic compounds in the grape. Growers will often withhold water early in the growing season to control the leaf canopy, which can have a beneficial business aspect by saving money compared to using costly viticultural chores such as sucker pruning, leaf striping and mildew treatment to control and tend to the leaf canopy. Applying a controlled amount of water during the ripening period following veraison encourages the grapes to ripen faster without a reductive loss in quality. One additional benefit {{of irrigation}} is frost protection. Following harvest, growers will soak the soil of the vineyard <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> the soil down to two feet. As temperatures drop, this water can form a protective layer of ice that will give the vine a few extra degrees of protection from freezing temperature that may damage the roots.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} an army {{to be in}} good {{fighting}} condition, it must maintain the health of its soldiers. [...] One way of doing this is knowing the proper location to set up camp. [...] Military camps were not to be set up in any sort of marshy region. [...] Marsh lands tend to have standing water, which can draw in mosquitos. [...] Mosquitos in turn can carry deadly disease, such as malaria. [...] As the camp and troops were needed to be moved, the troops would be wearing heavy soled shoes in order to prevent wear on soldiers’ feet. [...] Waterborne illness has also remained an issue throughout the centuries. [...] When soldiers would look for water they would be searching for some sort of natural spring, or other form of flowing water. [...] When water sources were found, any type of rotting wood, or plant material, would be removed before the water was used for drinking. [...] If these features could not be removed, then water would be drawn from {{a different part of the}} source. [...] By doing this the soldiers were more likely to be drinking from a safe source of water. [...] Thus, water borne bacteria had a less chance of making soldiers ill. [...] One process used to check for dirty water, was <b>to</b> <b>moisten</b> a fine white linen cloth with the water and leave it out to dry. [...] If the cloth had any type of stain, it would be considered to be diseased. [...] If the cloth was clean, the water was healthy and drinkable. [...] Fresh water also assists with sewage disposal, as well as wound care. [...] Thus, a source of fresh water was a preemptive measure taken to defeat disease and keep men healthy once they were wounded.|$|E

40|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) of trimethylgallium (TMG) {{has been}} studied as a method to disperse extraframework Ga in acidic ZSM- 5 and mordenite zeolite. Various samples were extensively characterized by ICP, XPS, NMR, and FTIR. Silylation with tetramethyldisilazane is explored as a method for deactivating the external zeolite surface. The deposition of TMG in silylated ZSM- 5 results in a gallium-to-aluminum ratio close to unity, which indicates a homogeneous metal distribution in the micropore space. However, pore blockage in the one-dimensional channels of mordenite results in a inhomogeneous distribution and a low Ga loading. Upon exposure <b>to</b> <b>moistened</b> air, the adsorbed methylgallium species decompose and alkoxy groups are formed. Subsequent oxidation or reduction leads to the complete removal of methyl groups. The reductive route is the preferred one resulting in a better dispersion of Ga, since oxidation of the methyl groups leads to water formation and hydrolysis of cationic Ga species. status: publishe...|$|R
