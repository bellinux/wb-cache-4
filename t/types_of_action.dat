500|$|Sights {{that use}} dot reticles are almost {{invariably}} measured in minutes of angle, or [...] "MOA". MOA is a convenient measure for shooters using English units, since 1 MOA subtends approximately [...] {{at a distance}} of , which makes MOA a handy unit to use in ballistics. The 5 MOA (1.5 mrad) dot is small enough not to obscure most targets, and large enough to quickly acquire a proper [...] "sight picture". For many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> shooting, a larger dot is preferred; 7 (2.0 mrad), 10 (2.9 mrad), 15 (4.4 mrad) or even 20 MOA (5.8 mrad) dots or rings are used; often these will be combined with horizontal and/or vertical lines to provide a level reference.|$|E
500|$|The weapon {{fire on the}} set was {{considered}} dangerous, which led the crew {{to build a new}} bulletproof plexiglas shield that could be bolted to the camera. This shield was useful particularly for one sequence in Hard Target where Van Damme empties a magazine of ammo into the camera. These camera dollies were nicknamed by the crew as [...] "the Woo-Woo Choo-Choo". Russell Carpenter found difficulty in filming the huge gunfight scenes. Carpenter specifically noted the Mardi Gras parade warehouse by recollecting that [...] "just the lighting for a space like that, with all those strange shapes and shadows was difficult enough, but John then added the further complication of wanting the scene shot from several angles at once—often with more than one of the cameras moving". Producer James Jacks supported this style of filming finding it the most economical way to shoot these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> scenes.|$|E

Instead, enemies are visible in the overworld and the player may choose to fight or avoid them. Battles unfold in real time using the [...] "Active Dimension Battle" [...] (ADB) system. Battles begin when the party comes within range of an aggressive enemy, the party attacks an enemy, or a story event initiates a confrontation. When a character or enemy begins an action, target lines connect characters to other party members or enemies; different colors represent the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The player may swap to and issue commands {{to any of the}} three characters in the party, but guest characters are controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). Battle commands are initiated through a series of menus, and include Attack, Magicks, Technicks, Mist, Gambits, and Items. The player may switch any active character with an inactive character at any time, unless the active character is targeted by an attack or ability. Characters who are knocked out may also be substituted.|$|E

2500|$|In animal cells, {{there are}} two primary <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> potentials. One type is {{generated}} by voltage-gated sodium channels, the other by voltage-gated calcium channels. [...] Sodium-based action potentials usually last for under one millisecond, whereas calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer. [...] In some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitted sodium spikes. [...] In cardiac muscle cells, on the other hand, an initial fast sodium spike provides a [...] "primer" [...] to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike, which then produces muscle contraction.|$|E

They are categorized according to which functions the trigger is to perform. In addition to releasing the hammer or the striker, a trigger may cock the hammer or striker, rotate a revolver's cylinder, deactivate passive safeties, select between semi-automatic and full-automatic fire such as the Steyr AUG (see progressive trigger), or pre-set a [...] "set trigger". Most modern firearms use the trigger to deactivate passive safeties but this does not change how they are identified.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} ions {{involved in}} an action potential are sodium and potassium cations; sodium ions enter the cell, and potassium ions leave, restoring equilibrium. Relatively few ions need to cross the membrane for the membrane voltage to change drastically. The ions exchanged during an action potential, therefore, make a negligible change in the interior and exterior ionic concentrations. The few ions that do cross are pumped out again by the continuous action of the sodium–potassium pump, which, with other ion transporters, maintains the normal ratio of ion concentrations across the membrane. [...] Calcium cations and chloride anions {{are involved in a}} few <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> potentials, such as the cardiac action potential and the action potential in the single-cell alga Acetabularia, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Contrasting {{with some}} of the more sexual {{relationships}} of the other characters, Willow and Tara demonstrate a sentimental, soft, and consistent affection for each other. Some of this was pragmatic: the show was restricted in what it could present to viewers. Willow and Tara did not kiss until the fifth season in an episode that diverted the focus away from the display of affection when Buffy's mother dies in [...] "The Body". Before this, much of their sexuality is represented by allusions to witchcraft; spells doubled for physical affection such as an erotic ritual in [...] "Who Are You?" [...] where Willow and Tara chant and perspire in a circle of light until Willow falls back on a pillow gasping and moaning. Within the Buffy universe, magic is portrayed in a mostly female realm. As opposed to it being evil, it is an earth-bound force that is most proficiently harvested by women. The treatment of the lesbian relationship as integral to magic, representative of each other (love is magic, magic is love), earned the series some critical commentary from conservative Christians. To avoid large-scale criticism, scenes had to be shot several different ways because censors would not allow some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> on screen. In the fourth and fifth seasons, the characters could be shown on a bed, but not under the covers. Hannigan noted the inconsistent standards with the other relationships on the show: [...] "you've got Spike and Harmony just going at it like rabbits, so it's very hypocritical". As a couple, Willow and Tara are treated {{by the rest of the}} Scoobies with acceptance and little fanfare. Susan Driver writes that younger viewers especially appreciate that Willow and Tara are able to be affectionate without becoming overly sexual, thus making them objects of fantasy for male enjoyment. Willow and Tara's influence on specifically younger female viewers is, according to Driver, [...] "remarkable".|$|E
