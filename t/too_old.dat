5|$|The Yankees {{finished}} 79–75 in 1959, {{in third}} place, their worst record since 1925, as the White Sox, managed by Lopez, won the pennant. There was considerable criticism of Stengel, who {{was viewed as}} <b>too</b> <b>old</b> and {{out of touch with}} the players.|$|E
50|$|On May 24, 2007, Toonami {{shut down}} at 3am. The old version of Cartoon Network Too had closed down at 7pm the day prior. The latter {{was moved to}} Toonami's space and Cartoonito {{launched}} in Cartoon Network <b>Too's</b> <b>old</b> slot as a channel.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} historian Yahya of Antioch, the conspirators of 1022 were released by Constantine VIII after Basil's death in 1025, but Xiphias remained in exile until 1028, when the new emperor, Romanos III, released him. Xiphias, however, was by now <b>too</b> <b>old</b> and weary, and soon retired to the Stoudios Monastery. Nothing further is known of him.|$|E
5|$|After Cerezeda took {{most of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Trujillo into Higueras, the city entered a period of serious decline. Those inhabitants that remained were <b>too</b> <b>old,</b> too sick, or too dispirited to head west. Basic supplies such as food and clothing were scarce. The citizens believed that Cerezeda wished to abandon Trujillo, and appealed to the audiencia of Santo Domingo, and to the Crown, for supplies and a Crown-appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Warner Bros. {{announced}} plans to produce a new feature film adaptation of The Stand. King commented {{that he would like}} to see Dutch actor Rutger Hauer in the role of Flagg, but conceded that he may be <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for the part. In August 2014 it was reported that Warner Bros. wanted actor Matthew McConaughey for the role.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2013, California {{strip club}} owner Mike Galam {{purchased}} Crazy Horse Too {{as part of}} a $5 million, 59 percent stake in Canico. In early May 2013, Crazy Horse III filed a complaint against Galam, claiming that the club's use of the [...] "Crazy Horse" [...] name was a trademark infringement. The club was renamed as The Horse Gentlemen's Club. Crazy Horse <b>Too's</b> <b>old</b> sign was kept up, but covered with a new sign. Other potential names included [...] "Crazy Mike's" [...] and [...] "The Two." ...|$|R
50|$|The demo for the self-titled {{album was}} {{considered}} <b>too</b> dark. <b>Old</b> guitar parts from the demos were muted and new pop-driven riffs {{were created by}} the new guitarist.|$|R
5|$|In June 1935 Calleia was {{announced}} to star as Joaquin Murrieta in I Am Joaquin (later titled Robin Hood of El Dorado), a film {{for which he}} had written the screenplay. MGM replaced him with Warner Baxter, ostensibly because Calleia was <b>too</b> <b>old,</b> although Baxter was six years older. Calleia did receive a notable starring role in Man of the People (1937), a political drama about a young lawyer fighting corporate racketeers.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, at 62, {{felt she}} was <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to travel to India, but two American {{supporters}} visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further refitting from 1939 to 1943. During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was anchored in Salvador as the main defense of the port, as it was <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to play {{an active part in}} the war. For the last nine years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.|$|E

5|$|After the 1932 season, University of Chicago {{president}} Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins {{forced out}} 70-year-old head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, whom he considered <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for the position. Stagg {{then moved on}} to coach at the College of the Pacific. Athletic director T. Nelson Metcalf hired Shaughnessy to replace Stagg as head coach in 1933. Shaughnessy inherited a difficult situation at Chicago, and for the most part, lacked good material. He did, however, inherit from Stagg at least one important recruit: inaugural Heisman Trophy winner and future Hall of Fame back Jay Berwanger, whom many Midwest pundits considered the best back of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to be of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which {{he wrote a book}} to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E
60|$|Thorn was a Massachusetts volunteer; a man {{who seemed}} <b>too</b> early <b>old,</b> <b>too</b> early embittered by some cross, for though grim of countenance, rough of speech, cold of manner, a keen {{observer}} would have soon discovered traces of a deeper, warmer nature hidden, behind the repellent front he turned upon the world. A true New Englander, thoughtful, acute, reticent, and opinionated; yet earnest withal, intensely patriotic, and often humorous, despite a touch of Puritan austerity.|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from three}} destroyers {{launched}} in 1940 and four submarines from the inter-war years, Brazil's warships were old and mostly obsolete pre-First World War vessels. The mainstays of the fleet, Minas Geraes, São Paulo, , and , {{were all over}} thirty years old. Although Minas Geraes had been further refitted from 1939 to 1943, the ship was still <b>too</b> <b>old</b> and in too poor a condition for any {{active role in the}} Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a floating battery in the port of Salvador {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Navy {{decided that}} Nevada was <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to be retained, so they {{assigned}} {{it to be a}} target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 (Operation Crossroads). The ship was hit by the blast from the first atomic bomb, Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, Nevada was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was among}} 12 {{nominated}} at the 1944 Democratic National Convention {{to serve as}} Roosevelt's running mate {{in the presidential election}} that year, receiving six votes. Delegates favored dropping vice president Henry Wallace from their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to consider him, telling a July 11 meeting of Democratic leaders that he was <b>too</b> <b>old.</b> Instead, he took the recommendation of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan and choose Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.|$|E

5|$|Basically it’s {{just about}} having a throwdown {{out in the woods}} — that’s what we used to do in high school. I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting <b>too</b> <b>old,</b> but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy stuff that I used to do, and the crazy stuff that I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E
5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for militia duty.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number {{of men and women in}} the past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E
50|$|The rest of {{the team}} is now <b>too</b> {{physically}} <b>old</b> to continue fighting crime and retires. Starman retires and passes on the Starman legacies to his sons, resulting in the creation of one of the new series following Zero Hour, James Robinson's Starman.|$|R

60|$|He did {{not answer}} at once. She was <b>old</b> <b>too,</b> a fat <b>old</b> native woman. He {{wondered}} why he had ever loved her so madly. He had laid at her feet all the treasures of his soul, and she had cared nothing for them. Waste, what waste! And now, {{when he looked at}} her, he felt only contempt. His patience was at last exhausted. He answered her question.|$|R
