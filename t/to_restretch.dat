40|$|Part I: The {{problem of}} the nature of house dust allergens has been {{investigated}} by studying the chemical and physical properties of active fractions of aqueous dust extracts. The fractions consisted largely of a heterogeneous mixture of acidic polysaccharides and in lesser amounts a polypeptide component (2 - 30 %), probably linked to the polysaccharides. The polysaccharides contained uronic acid (probably mostly glucuronic acid), D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose and L-rhamnose and lesser amounts of a number of pentoses. Nitrogen free active polysaccharide fractions have not been obtained. The most purified active fraction contained 0. 4 % nitrogen. The relation between the chemical and physical properties of the fractions and current ideas of the origin of the dust allergens was discussed. Part II: Rabbit bladder stretching curves under constant pressure have been studied. A method, involving the use of eserine and acetylcholine, has been found <b>to</b> <b>restretch</b> the same bladder and obtain reproducible curves. The effect of temperature and epinephrine upon the bladder stretching curves was investigated...|$|E
50|$|Those {{wishing to}} stretch this {{piercing}} to accommodate larger gauge jewelry should wait {{until at least}} two weeks after the initial piercing has fully healed. It is common for a frenum piercing to start to close soon after the jewelry has been removed. A fairly recent piercing may start to close in less than an hour. Temporary removal and replacement (for example, to accommodate a partner who finds it uncomfortable) may mean reinserting with a smaller gauge and then <b>restretching</b> <b>to</b> get back to the original, larger gauge. This tendency for the piercing to close up will diminish over time.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} Ca 2 + upon the rate {{constant}} of force redevelopment following {{a period of}} isotonic shortening with immediate <b>restretch</b> <b>to</b> the starting sarcomere length was studied in rabbit psoas fibers at 5 degrees C. Control experiments support {{the assumption that the}} rate constant of force redevelopment represents isometric cross-bridge turnover kinetics (fapp + gapp), where fapp and gapp are the rate constants characterizing the transitions from the non-force-generating states to the force-generating states and back to the non-force-generating states, respectively. Parallel measurements of the rate constant of force redevelopment and of force, stiffness, and fiber ATPase during isometric contraction allow the effect of Ca 2 + upon fapp and gapp to be determined. Analysis reveals that Ca 2 + has a marked effect upon fapp, while gapp remains approximately unchanged. Furthermore, in the range above 25 - 30 % of maximum Ca 2 + activation, regulation of force, stiffness, and ATPase is mediated through changes in fapp. Below this range, however, it cannot be ruled out that, in addition, cross-bridges are also switched {{in and out of the}} turnover process ("recruitment"). As a consequence of regulation through turnover kinetics, both Ca 2 + sensitivity and the slope of force-pCa (-log[Ca 2 +]) relations are shown to be affected by the ratio fapp/gapp, which may represent an important mechanism of modulation of contractile function in addition to modulation through changes within the regulatory protein system...|$|R
