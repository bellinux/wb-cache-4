5|$|At the {{headland}} at Grenen, {{the northernmost}} point of Denmark, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet. Because of their different densities, a clear dividing {{line can be}} seen. As a result of turbulent seas, beachings and shipwrecks were common. These frequent losses combined with the town's strategic location as the gateway to the Baltic led to Skagen being <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> one of Denmark's earliest lighthouses, Vippefyr, a lever light constructed in 1627.

40|$|We have visualized the intranuclear {{topography}} of adenovirus replication and transcription in infected HeLa cells. The {{results show that}} viral DNA replication occurs in multiple foci that are highly organized in the nucleoplasm. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that newly synthesized viral double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced from the replication foci and spread throughout the nucleoplasm, while the single-stranded DNA replication intermediates accumulate in adjacent sites. Double-labelling experiments and confocal microscopy show that replication occurs in foci localized at <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> where single-stranded DNA accumulates. The simultaneous visualization of viral replication and transcription reveals that <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> transcription are predominantly separated from <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> replication. Transcription is detected adjacent to the replication foci and extends around <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> single-stranded DNA accumulation. These data indicate that newly synthesized double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced from the replication foci and spread in the surrounding nucleoplasm, where they are used as templates for transcription. Splicing snRNPs are shown to co-localize with <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> transcription and to be excluded from <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> replication. This provides evidence that splicing of viral RNAs occurs co-transcriptionally and that <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> viral DNA replication are spatially distinct from <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> RNA transcription and processing...|$|R

40|$|Background: The embryologic fusion planes {{might be}} related with <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> onset of basal cell {{carcinoma}} (BCC), thus supporting an embryologic role for its pathogenesis. Methods: A study involving 495 patients with 627 BCCs {{of the head and}} neck was carried out over a period of 5 years by correlating the distribution of all BCCs with <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> congenital clefts {{of the head and neck}} using (1) the original anatomic diagram of the Tessier classification of craniofacial clefts, (2) the anatomic diagram by Moore et al featuring the paths of the “hairline indicators” of craniofacial clefts that represent the cranial extensions of the Tessier classification, and (3) an anatomical diagram featuring <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> congenital clefts of the neck. Results: The proportion of BCCs localized within a cleft site was significantly higher than those in <b>the</b> noncleft <b>sites.</b> <b>The</b> age <b>of</b> patients with BCCs localized within the Tessier cleft number 3 was the lowest among all cleft regions. Conclusions: A topographic correspondence between <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> BCCs and <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> congenital clefts was demonstrated in the head and neck. This evidence would support the hypothesis of an embryologic role for the pathogenesis of BCC. The existence of clusters of embryological stem cells in <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> fusion and/or merging of embryonic processes might therefore be proposed. There may be special biology/physiology along these cleft lines that predispose BCC formation...|$|R
