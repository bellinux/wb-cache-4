5|$|A key {{step in the}} {{majority}} of GWA studies is the imputation of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases the power of <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> <b>and</b> facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E

5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to {{her ideas}} about the role of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> performance of her music.|$|E
5|$|Becoming {{increasingly}} belligerent {{toward his}} father, Riley {{moved out of}} the family home and briefly had a job painting houses before leaving Greenfield in November 1870. He was recruited as a Bible salesman and began working in the nearby town of Rushville, Indiana. The job provided little income and he returned to Greenfield in March 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter. He completed <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> opened a business in Greenfield creating and maintaining signs. His earliest known poems are verses he wrote as clever advertisements for his customers.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} as herbalism, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> use {{of plants}} for their medicinal properties. Many {{records of the}} Holocene period date early botanical knowledge {{as far back as}} 10,000 years ago. This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee, which make up much of the Cherokee land today. The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E

5|$|Cartography, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> {{practice}} of map-making, and geography, {{the study of}} the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth.

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> {{modelling}} {{of the transfer}} of the inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Association for <b>the</b> <b>Study</b> <b>and</b> Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee spoke out against the use of {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused to take part in the education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Truman Scholarship {{was created}} as a federal program to honor U.S. college {{students}} who exemplified dedication to public service and leadership in public policy. In 2004, the President Harry S. Truman Fellowship in National Security Science and Engineering was {{created as a}} distinguished postdoctoral three-year appointment at Sandia National Laboratories. In 2001, the University of Missouri established the Harry S. Truman School of Public Affairs to advance <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> practice of governance. The University of Missouri's Missouri Tigers athletic programs have an official mascot named Truman the Tiger. On July 1, 1996, Northeast Missouri State University became Truman State University—to mark its transformation from a teachers' college to a highly selective liberal arts university and to honor the only Missourian to become president. A member institution of the City Colleges of Chicago, Harry S Truman College in Chicago, Illinois, is named in his honor for his dedication to public colleges and universities. In 2000, the headquarters for the State Department, built in the 1930s but never officially named, was dedicated as the Harry S Truman Building.|$|E

5|$|The IAPT's {{primary purpose}} is the {{promotion}} {{and understanding of}} biodiversity—the discovery, naming, classification, and systematics of plants—for both living and fossil plants. Additionally, it promotes <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> conservation of plant biodiversity, and works {{to raise awareness of}} the general public to this issue. The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant systematics, taxonomy, and nomenclature. This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.|$|E

5|$|The {{preliminary}} experimentation for {{the modern}} restoration began in 1979.

An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> analysis of the artwork. Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process. This was done by the photographer Takashi Okamura for Nippon Television Network Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} to the study of molecular and cell biology as they provide simple systems {{that can be used to}} manipulate and investigate the functions of cells. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> use of viruses have provided valuable information about aspects of cell biology.

5|$|Italian, {{and to some}} extant Latin, {{was used}} as the main {{functioning}} language of the courts throughout the periods of the knights, French occupation, British protectorate, until at least 1879 when the courts had already moved out of the building. The French language was established as the sole official language, however an exception was given to the courts as Italian prevailed for legal jargon. Efforts by the British to use English during the protectorate and the early colonisation of Malta failed, mostly due to the resistance by the nobility. The supreme court proceeding were suggested to take place with the use of English, to encourage <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> use of English by judges and lawyers, but the efforts were futile. Both during the French occupation and English period, the supreme court decisions were published in Italian and the other preferred language of the government; French during the French period and English during the British periods. The Maltese language was never discussed to be used at the courts when housed in the Castellania. The language question was not solved until the 20th century, when the building had for long changed purpose.|$|E
