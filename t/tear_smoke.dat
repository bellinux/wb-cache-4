50|$|The BSF {{maintains}} a <b>Tear</b> <b>Smoke</b> Unit (TSU), which {{is unique in}} India. The TSU {{is responsible for producing}} tear gas munitions required for the Anti-Riot Forces. It also exports a substantial quantity to other countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{smallest}} {{functional unit}} in the force is a 'Team' commanded by an inspector, has three components namely riot control element, <b>tear</b> <b>smoke</b> element and fire element. It has been organised as an independent striking unit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{police are}} {{authorized}} {{to use force}} to [...] "quell a disturbance of the peace, or to disperse an unlawful assembly, which either refused to disperse or shows a determination not to disperse," [...] however the use of force must be limited as [...] "as much as possible" [...] using [...] "the least deadly weapon which the circumstances permit." [...] Non-lethal measures required before lethal force may be used include water cannons, <b>tear</b> <b>smoke,</b> riot batons, and rubber pellets; shooting live ammunition into crowds is authorized only after firing warning shots into the air.|$|E

50|$|On October 25, 2011, Scott Olsen, a 24-year-old former Marine and Iraq War veteran, {{suffered}} a skull fracture {{caused by a}} projectile that some witnesses claimed was a <b>tear</b> gas or <b>smoke</b> canister fired by police.|$|R
50|$|Grenades {{have also}} been made to release <b>smoke,</b> <b>tear</b> gas and other gases, as well as illumination. Stun grenades are often used to disorient people during entry into a room, {{especially}} where hostages or non-combatants may be present.|$|R
5000|$|The Jew {{is liable}} to panic and 800-900 Jews {{fighting}} to get up a stairway to escape <b>tear</b> <b>smoke</b> could have produced a deplorable business. ... It is a very frightening thing {{to go into the}} hold full of yelling maniacs when outnumbered six or eight to one. Describing the assault, the officer wrote to his superiors: [...] After a very short pause, with a lot of yelling and female screams, every available weapon up to a biscuit and bulks of timber was hurled at the soldiers. They withstood it admirably and very stoically till the Jews assaulted and in the first rush several soldiers were downed with half a dozen Jews on top kicking and tearing ... No other troops could have done it as well and as humanely as these British ones did. He concluded: It should be borne in mind that the guiding factor in most of the actions of the Jews is to gain the sympathy of the world press.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} existed as well, {{including a}} life-sign tracking device, as well other game items like <b>tear</b> gas grenades, <b>smoke</b> grenades and medkit. A LAW (Lightweight Anti-tank Weapon) could be used, {{as well as}} night vision and thermal vision.|$|R
50|$|Specialized warheads are {{available}} for illumination, <b>smoke,</b> <b>tear</b> gas, and white phosphorus. Russia, China, and many former Warsaw Pact nations have also developed a fuel-air explosive (thermobaric) warhead. Another recent development is a tandem HEAT warhead capable of penetrating reactive armor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tear</b> gas and <b>smoke</b> {{blanketed}} downtown Sarajevo, {{where police}} opened fire with rubber bullets on several thousand protesters who {{set fire to}} the headquarters of the capital’s cantonal government. Water cannon was also used to disperse protesters who were trying to enter the presidency building.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{theme of}} Free verse, as with Migjeni's prose, is misery and suffering. It is a poetry of acute social {{awareness}} and despair. Previous generations of poets had sung the beauties of the Albanian {{mountains and the}} sacred traditions of the nation, whereas Migjeni now opened {{his eyes to the}} harsh realities of life, to the appalling level of misery, disease and poverty he discovered all around him. He was a poet of despair who saw no way out, who cherished no hope that anything but death could put an end to suffering. [...] "I suffer with the child whose father cannot buy him a toy. I suffer with the young man who burns with unslaked sexual desire. I suffer with the middle-aged man drowning in the apathy of life. I suffer with the old man who trembles at the prospect of death. I suffer with the peasant struggling with the soil. I suffer with the worker crushed by iron. I suffer with the sick suffering from all the diseases of the world... I suffer with man." [...] Typical of the suffering and of the futility of human endeavour for Migjeni is Rezignata ("Resignation"), a poem in the longest cycle of the collection, Kangët e mjerimit ("Songs of poverty"). Here the poet paints a grim portrait of our earthly existence: sombre nights, <b>tears,</b> <b>smoke,</b> thorns and mud. Rarely does {{a breath of fresh air}} or a vision of nature seep through the gloom. When nature does occur in the verse of Migjeni, then of course it is autumn.|$|R
50|$|One protester, Iraq War veteran Scott Olsen, {{suffered}} a skull fracture {{caused by a}} projectile that witnesses believed was a <b>tear</b> gas or <b>smoke</b> canister fired by police.

5000|$|Salazar {{was resting}} in the Silver Dollar Bar after protest became violent. According to a witness, [...] "Ruben Salazar had just sat down to sip a quiet beer at the bar, away from the madness in the street, when a deputy fired a tear gas projectile" [...] at a crowd which went into the {{interior}} of the bar, hitting Salazar in the head and killing him instantly. The sheriff's deputy fired a 10-inch wall-piercing type of tear gas round from a tear gas guns of the type intended for barricade situation, rather than the type of tear gas round designed to be fired directly at people (which produces a plume of <b>tear</b> gas <b>smoke).</b> The deputy was found to have mistakenly loaded the wrong type of tear gas round, as the two types of cylinders were nearly identical.|$|R

5000|$|In {{its early}} years, the arsenal {{produced}} and stockpiled chemical weapons such as phosgene, Lewisite, and mustard gas. The use of toxic gases in warfare was banned under the Geneva Protocol of 1925, but the U.S. {{signed with the}} reservation that it be allowed to use chemical weapons against aggressors who used them. The facility also produced carbonyl iron powder (for radio and radar tuning), <b>tear</b> gas, and <b>smoke</b> and incendiary devices.

2500|$|Media {{coverage}} was again sparked on 1 October, when New York City protesters attempted to march across the Brooklyn Bridge {{and more than}} 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge and even escorting them partway across before they began to make mass arrests. On 25 October, police officers cleared two Occupy Oakland protest camp sites. Police fired tear gas canisters at the protestors, allegedly in response to objects being thrown at them. Protest organizers said {{that many of the}} troublemakers were not part of the Occupy movement. The raid was described as [...] "violent and chaotic at times" [...] and resulted in over 102 arrests. Scott Olsen, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, suffered a skull fracture caused by a projectile that witnesses believed was a <b>tear</b> gas or <b>smoke</b> canister fired by the police. On 2 November, protesters in Oakland, California, shut down the Port of Oakland, the fifth busiest port in the nation.

25|$|The final protest {{march was}} {{permitted}} for 2:00 to 5:00p.m. {{on the final}} day of the convention. This meant that the last of the marchers needed to be back on capitol grounds by 5p.m. By 4p.m., the march had still not left the capitol grounds. Understanding that the protesters were interested in being near the Xcel Energy Center when delegates were, police offered a compromise: march leaders were told that if they started their march before 5p.m., police would allow it to continue past the permit time. March organizers refused. When the final protest march permit expired at 5p.m., overpasses over Interstate 94 leading into downtown from the state capitol were closed. Two hours later, when the final assembly permit on capitol grounds expired and protesters refused several commands to disperse, police used <b>tear</b> gas, <b>smoke</b> bombs, pepper spray, flash bangs, mounted police, paint marker rounds, and rubber bullets to prevent an antiwar march organized by the Anti-War Committee to march on the Xcel Energy center. This march would have been in violation of the court-approved march permits. Between 300 and 400 people were arrested or held including 19 journalists, among them AP reporters Amy Forliti and Jon Krawczynski, reporters from Twin Cities Daily Planet and The Uptake, and Paul Demko of The Minnesota Independent. Total arrests of convention protesters numbered approximately 800, although only 15 cases resulted in criminal charges.

50|$|Sea Shepherd protested a Canadian seal hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence off {{the north}} coast of Nova Scotia in March 1983. The arrival of the group led to a one-day {{suspension}} of the hunt. On March 25, the Sea Shepherd II was ordered back by Canadian authorities after the vessel came within one half-mile of seal hunters. Watson promised to scuttle the ship if they attempted to board it. While in St. John's, Newfoundland, they blockaded a dozen sealing ships in harbor, threatening to ram any ship that left. The Sea Shepherd II was fortified with barbed wire and a water cannon. Sea Shepherd began to harass sealers by chasing half a dozen sealing ships out of the area. On March 27, the vessel was stuck in ice and Watson and three others walked across the ice to Chéticamp where they were later arrested for viewing the seal hunt without a permit. 15 officers boarded the ship from a Canadian Coast Guard vessel {{with the use of}} <b>tear</b> gas and <b>smoke</b> bombs. The crew was arrested without any resistance or injuries. They were charged with conspiracy to commit mischief and conspiracy to commit extortion. Watson was bailed out by actor Mike Farrell and was acquitted upon appeal of the charges. The campaign saved the lives of 76,000 seals.|$|R
