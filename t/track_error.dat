The NHC also issued a tropical storm watch south of Little River, South Carolina {{to the mouth of}} the Santee River, as well as from Chincoteague, Virginia northward to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the East Coast of the United States. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Fire Island, New York and from Cape Fear, North Carolina to the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina, and a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Cape Fear. Landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average <b>track</b> <b>error</b> was 18miles (29km).|$|E
5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel {{to make landfall}} between North Carolina and New Jersey, and the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina.

From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average <b>track</b> <b>error</b> was 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area. The Newport Weather Forecast Office issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess whether {{exchange-traded}} funds (ETFs) can beat the market, as it is expressed by the Standard and Poor (S&P) 500 Index, examine the outperformance persistence, calculate <b>tracking</b> <b>error,</b> assess the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> persistence, investigate the factors that induce <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> and assess whether there are predictable patterns in ETFs' performance. Design/methodology/approach – The author uses a sample of 50 iShares during the period 2002 - 2007 and calculates the simple raw return, the Sharpe ratio and the Sortino ratio, regresses the performance differences between ETFs and market index, calculates <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> as the standard deviation in return differences between ETFs and benchmarks, assesses <b>tracking</b> <b>error's</b> persistence in the same fashion used to assess the ETFs' outperformance persistence, examines the impact of expenses, risk and age on <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> and applies dummy regression analysis to study whether the performance of ETFs is predictable. Findings – The results reveal that the majority of the selected iShares beat the S&P 500 Index, both at the annual and the aggregate levels while the return superiority of ETFs strongly persists at the short-term level. The <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> of ETFs also persists at the short-term level. The regression analysis on <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> reveals that the expenses charged by ETFs along with the age and risk of ETFs are some of the factors that can explain the persistence in <b>tracking</b> <b>error.</b> Finally, the dummy regression analysis indicates that the performance of ETFs can be somehow predictable. Originality/value – The findings of this paper may be of help to investors seeking investment choices that will help them to gain above market returns. In addition, tracking error-concerned investors will be helped by the findings of the paper. Finally, the findings on return predictability can also be helpful to investors.

40|$|The {{active force}} control (AFC) method {{is known as}} a robust control scheme that {{dramatically}} enhances the performance of a robot arm particularly in compensating the disturbance effects. The main task of the AFC method is to estimate the inertia matrix in the feedback loop to provide the correct (motor) torque required to cancel out these disturbances. Several intelligent control schemes have already been introduced to enhance the estimation methods of acquiring the inertia matrix such as those using neural network, iterative learning and fuzzy logic. In this paper, we propose an alternative scheme called Knowledge-Based Trajectory Error Pattern Method (KBTEPM) to suppress the trajectory <b>track</b> <b>error</b> of the AFC scheme. The knowledge is developed from the trajectory <b>track</b> <b>error</b> characteristic based on the previous experimental results of the crude approximation method. It produces a unique, new and desirable error pattern when a trajectory command is forced. An experimental study was performed using simulation work on the AFC scheme with KBTEPM applied to a two-planar manipulator in which a set of rule-based algorithm is derived. A number of previous AFC schemes are also reviewed as benchmark.

Error bounds for the closed-loop tracker are determined by analogy with an extended Kalman filter and are examined under both linear and nonlinear track assumptions. The linear conditional <b>track</b> <b>error</b> is determined over a small neighborhood that includes the true track.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{autonomous}} catamaran, {{based on}} a modified Prindle- 19 day-sailing Catamaran, was built to test the viability of GPS-based system identification for precision control.

40|$|Iterative {{learning}} control (ILC) {{has proven to}} be a powerful method to derive a high performance feedforward signal for systems that perform repetitive tasks. The feedforward signal is derived through several iterations, based on the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> of a feedback controlled system. In practical applications, the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> consists of a repetitive part and a non-repetitive part. ILC only compensates for the repetitive part of the error. The non-repetitive part also enters the learning scheme and affects the tracking performance. The problem definition of this thesis is defined as: Determine how non-repetitive <b>errors</b> affect the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> and the learned feedforward signal of ILC and design a method to eliminate the effect of non-repetitive errors. An expression for the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> of an arbitrary iteration is derived as a function of the reference, load disturbances and measurement disturbances.
