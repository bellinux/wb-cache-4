The author argues that without this type of information, agencies are hindered in really knowing the "proponent of terror," and thus limited in the possibilities for neutralizing the subject. The study analyzes genetic inheritance and childhood environment and presents case studies on Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Ilich Ramirez Sanchez ("Carlos"). The study concludes that genetic and childhood environmental data {{should be included in}} <b>target</b> <b>dossiers</b> of terrorists. Collection categories in genetic inheritance and environment are recommended and include, for example, material on terrorists' biological grandparents, parents, and as appropriate, on their brothers and sisters, and children.
