5|$|The Port Authority then {{proposed}} an inter-terminal rail connector at JFK in 1987. The connector, proposed {{as part of}} a $3 billion renovation of the three airports, would originate from a new five-story, $500 million transportation center, connecting all the terminals to that transportation hub. The two-track system would be able to accommodate 2,000 riders an hour and would also connect to another new structure, a $450 million terminal proposed by Pan American World Airways. The connector and <b>transport</b> <b>hub</b> were proposed to alleviate traffic at the airport, since during the previous year, all three airports had experienced an unusually large increase in passenger counts and were now accommodating 1.5 to 2 times their design capacity. This construction was proposed in conjunction with the JFK Expressway, which was already under construction. Architect Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners created a design for the terminal and the proposed people mover system. However, the Port Authority withdrew its plans for the large <b>transport</b> <b>hub</b> in 1990 after opposition from the airlines there, which could not pay for the costly renovation.|$|E

There is also one general aviation airport, Paris-Le Bourget, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{is a major}} rail, highway, and air <b>transport</b> <b>hub.</b> The Syndicat des {{transports}} d'Île-de-France (STIF), formerly Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), {{oversees the}} transit network in the region.

5|$|Chief of the OKH, General Franz Halder, Fedor von Bock, the {{commander}} of Army Group Center, and almost all the German generals involved in Operation Barbarossa argued vehemently in favor of continuing the all-out drive toward Moscow. Besides the psychological importance of capturing the Soviet capital, the generals pointed out that Moscow was a major center of arms production, {{the center of the}} Soviet communications system and an important <b>transport</b> <b>hub.</b> Intelligence reports indicated that the bulk of the Red Army was deployed near Moscow under Semyon Timoshenko for the defense of the capital. Panzer commander Heinz Guderian was sent to Hitler by Bock and Halder to argue their case for continuing the assault against Moscow but Hitler issued an order through Guderian (bypassing Bock and Halder) to send Army Group Center's tanks to the north and south, temporarily halting the drive to Moscow. Convinced by Hitler's argument, Guderian returned to his commanding officers as a convert to the Führer's plan, which earned him their disdain.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public <b>transport</b> <b>hub.</b> In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating {{that it was more}} important to secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn.|$|E
5|$|The old {{part of the}} town, Calais proper (known as Calais-Nord), is {{situated}} on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies {{to the south and}} south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the church of Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy of Calais. It is arguably the only church built in the English perpendicular style in all of France. In this church former French President Charles de Gaulle married his wife Yvonne Vendroux. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the Hôtel-de-ville (the town hall), and the belfry from the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually. Aside from being a key <b>transport</b> <b>hub,</b> Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in the lace industry for which the town is also famed.|$|E

30|$|Goods {{transport}} {{is increasingly}} managed and handled by <b>transport</b> logistics <b>hubs.</b> In Germany, for instance, nearly two billion tons are handled in terminals and warehouses {{each year and}} related operations account for around 10  % of the logistics market turnover. Beside large <b>transport</b> logistics <b>hubs</b> like seaports or airports {{there is a big}} number of smaller but very important logistics <b>transport</b> <b>hubs</b> like these of freight forwarding networks, which handle around 200 million shipments each year [23]. These data underpin the importance of <b>transport</b> logistics <b>hubs</b> within the <b>transport</b> process. Their empirical significance, therefore, constitutes the relevance to integrate <b>hub</b> related <b>transport</b> processes in demand modelling because such integration ensures higher accuracy and more realistic sensitivity in order to assess policy measures related to logistics.|$|R
