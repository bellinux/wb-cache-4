5|$|Zimbabwe {{suffered}} occasional {{outbreaks of}} acute diseases (such as plague in 1994).

The study is the brainchild of Australian technology entrepreneur Steve Killelea, founder of Integrated Research, and is endorsed by individuals such as Kofi Annan, the Dalai Lama, archbishop Desmond Tutu, Finland's President Sauli Niinistö, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, economist Jeffrey Sachs, former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson and former United States president Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{abilities}} as an all-rounder led to enormous success as both batsman and bowler. The ICC player rankings {{have been applied}} retrospectively to cricket history and Miller achieved top ten rankings with both bat and ball. As a batsman, he peaked at ninth {{in the world in}} 1952, and was a top-20 player from shortly after his début {{and for the rest of}} the duration of his career. Miller's bowling abilities led to even greater success. By the end of 1946, he was already ranked sixth in the world and thereafter never slipped lower than ninth; for much of his career, he was the second-best bowler in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> the ratings, remarkably, for a 36-year-old, peaking at the number 1 slot for a few months in 1956. As an all-rounder, therefore, it is unsurprising to find that he was peerless for most of his career, ranked as number one in the world for most of his career, including an unbroken eight-year run from June 1948 until his retirement.|$|E
5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors. The garment industry is the second-most-polluting industry <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India.|$|E

5|$|The {{usage of}} the metric system varies around <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>According</b> <b>to</b> the US Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook (2007), the International System of Units has been adopted as the {{official}} system of weights and measures by all {{nations in the world}} except for Myanmar (Burma), Liberia and the United States, while the NIST has identified the United States as the only industrialised country where the metric system is not the predominant system of units. However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E
5|$|Completed scripts {{were sent}} to Studio B for {{pre-production}} and animation using Macromedia Flash Professional 8. Thiessen's production team was also allowed to select key personnel subject to Hasbro's approval; one of those selected was art director Ridd Sorensen. The Studio B team would storyboard the provided scripts, incorporating any direction and sometimes managing to create scenes that the writers had believed impossible to show in animation. The animators would then prepare the key character poses, layout, background art, and other main elements, and send these versions back to the production team in Los Angeles for review by Hasbro and suggestions from the writers. Thiessen credited much of the technical expertise in the show to Wooton, who created Flash programs to optimize the placement and posing of the pony characters and other elements, simplifying and economizing {{on the amount of}} work needed from the other animators. For example, the ponies' manes and tails are generally fixed shapes, animated by bending and stretching them in curves in three dimensions and giving them a sense of movement without the high cost of individual animated hairs. The storyboard artists and animators also need to fill in background characters for otherwise scripted scenes as to populate <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>According</b> <b>to</b> writer Meghan McCarthy, many of the small nods to the fandom, pop culture references, or other easter eggs would be added at this point by the studio. Once the pre-production work was approved and completed, the episode would then be animated. Though Studio B performed the initial animation work, the final steps were passed to Top Draw Animation in the Philippines, an animation studio that Studio B had worked with in the later part of season one and beyond.|$|E
