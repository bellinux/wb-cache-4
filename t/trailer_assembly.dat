50|$|John A. McKay House and Manufacturing Company is a {{historic}} home and factory complex located at Dunn, Harnett County, North Carolina. The house was built about 1840, and is a two-story, double pile, Greek Revival style frame dwelling. It features a full-facade, one-story porch and two-story, portico. Associated with the house are a barn, later remodeled with garage doors, a smokehouse, a storage/wash house, and fence. The main factory building was built in 1903, and is a two-story U-shaped building, with a two-story shed, gable roofed ell, and another ell. Other contributing factory buildings are an office (1937), two privies, McKay Manufacturing Company building (1910), <b>trailer</b> <b>assembly</b> room (c. 1930), steel house (1910), foundry (1910), cleaning rooms (1910), wood storage building (1935), boiler room (c. 1925), pattern room (c. 1925), and flask shop (1910).|$|E
50|$|Noshahr Airport, {{previously}} an army airbase {{and currently}} a civilian-only airport {{is located on}} {{the western part of the}} city. The city is also home to Imam Khomeini University for Naval Sciences, some branches and campuses of Azad University of Noshahr and Chaloos, and Royan Institute of Higher Education. The Dual-use port of Noshahr was built by a Dutch contracting firm in late 1920s and is one of the most active ports of Iran in the Caspian Sea. The city of Chaloos and its associated towns and villages were part of the Noshahr township prior to 1996 after which they formed the new township of Chaloos by legislation from the national parliament. The city has been slow to industrialize due to environmental considerations and having an already vibrant economy based on Tourism, Ship transport and Agriculture, nevertheless there are local Food processing, Timber Treatment and Steel industries. Recently, a <b>trailer</b> <b>assembly</b> plant has opened in cooperation with the MAZ of Belarus.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} physical work load and job experience on morbidity from musculoskeletal disorders among <b>trailer</b> <b>assembly</b> workers.  METHODS—A longitudinal study {{was carried out in}} a <b>trailer</b> <b>assembly</b> factory with many new workers employed during the follow up. The sickness absence of 532  workers (160  experienced and 372  new (separately for the first year of employment and from the second year on)) was followed up. Exposure was assessed by job titles, visits, task descriptions, and some direct measurements. The associations between the explanatory variables and sick leave were assessed by log linear models.  RESULTS—A higher rate of sick leave due to disorders of the upper limbs was found for new workers compared with experienced ones, especially in the high work load group. Women had a higher rate than men. New male workers in physically strenuous tasks had a high rate of sick leave due to neck and shoulder disorders.  CONCLUSIONS—As being unaccustomed to work seems to increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, special attention should be paid to newly employed workers.    Keywords: new workers; physical work load; assembly wor...|$|E

5000|$|Sepro Mobile Plants are {{designed}} to be easily re-locatable as they are mounted on road transportable custom built <b>trailer</b> <b>assemblies.</b> These include the Sepro Mobile Mill Plant and Sepro Mobile Flotation Plant, both of which were installed by Banks Island Gold Ltd at the company's Yellow Giant Gold Property on the coast of British Columbia. They can be designed to encompass a wide variety of process options from crushing through to the final concentrate collection. [...] Sepro Modular and Skid Mounted Plants are engineered around structural elements that are simple and easy to erect on site. These plants can be designed with larger equipment for higher tonnage applications than that of the Sepro Mobile Plants. One example is a 360 TPD Gold Processing Plant Sepro supplied to ProEurasia LCC for the Vladimirskaya Project in Russia. This included milling, gravity and smelting circuits.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{escalation}} in {{fuel prices}} has motivated {{the manufacturers of}} heavy commercial vehicles to focus their attention towards efficient aerodynamic design of surface transport systems such as trucks–trailers, railways etc. In {{order to reduce the}} drag force acting on truck–trailer assemblies, the flow separation phenomena, occurring {{on the roof of the}} trailers, need to be controlled. A number of add-on devices have been developed for this purpose by different investigators but most of these devices are still not being used for several reasons including difficult integration with the structure and non-optimal configuration. In the present study, based on the theory of moving surface boundary layer control, a novel fuel saving device has been developed, and its operation optimised, in order to control the flow separation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques have been employed to analyse the aerodynamic performance of a truck–trailer assembly, integrated with a moving surface boundary layer control device (MSBC). The device has been shown to be very effective in reducing the flow drag force being imparted on the truck – <b>trailer</b> <b>assembly,</b> and hence reducing the fuel consumption. Operation of MSBC device has been optimised to obtain a range of rotational speeds of the device over which it provides maximum reduction in aerodynamic drag...|$|E
40|$|During an {{airborne}} multi-sensor {{remote sensing}} experiment at the Virginia Coast Reserve (VCR) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in June 2011 (VCR ' 11), first measurements were {{taken with the}} new NRL Goniometer for Outdoor Portable Hyperspectral Earth Reflectance (GOPHER). GOPHER measures the angular distribution of hyperspectral reflectance. GOPHER was constructed for NRL by Spectra Vista Corporation (SVC) and the University of Lethbridge through a capital equipment purchase in 2010. The GOPHER spectrometer is an SVC HR - 1024, which measures hyperspectral reflectance over the range from 350 - 2500 nm, the visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared. During measurements, the spectrometer travels along a zenith quarter -arc track that can rotate in azimuth, allowing for measurement of the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) over the whole hemisphere. The zenith arc has a radius of approximately 2 m, and the spectrometer scan pattern can be programmed on the fly during calibration and validation efforts. The spectrometer and zenith arc assembly can be raised and lowered along a mast to allow for measurement of uneven terrain or vegetation canopies of moderate height. Hydraulics on the chassis allow for leveling of the instrument in the field. At just over 400 lbs, GOPHER is a field portable instrument and can {{be transformed into a}} compact <b>trailer</b> <b>assembly</b> for movement over long distances in the field...|$|E
40|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} {{for the effect}} of cattle movement upon the dynamic performance of the loaded Class 8 tractor-livestock <b>trailer</b> <b>assembly.</b> Loading guidelines exist for cattle that attempt to prevent injury or debilitation during transit, and literature exists on the orientation and some kinematics of loaded cattle. Considerable literature exists {{on the effect of}} liquid slosh in tankers and swinging beef carcasses suspended from hooks in refrigerated van trailers on the dynamic response and roll stability of those vehicles. However, no research is reported on the case of a loaded livestock trailer—although it is analogized (incorrectly) to the above. The research that is outlined herein focuses specifically on loaded Class 8 tractors and livestock semi-trailers. The authors have engaged in an extensive program involving the five following components: 1. Extensive full scale testing of loaded livestock trailers in accepted test protocols including: a. Tilt table tests (SAE J 2180) b. U-turn maneuvers (SAE J 2181) c. 200 ft. radius turns (SAE J 2181) d. Slalom maneuver (ISO 7401) e. Highway Evasive maneuver (ISO 3888) 2. Driving on public roads at highway speeds 3. Simulation of the tractor-trailer using EDVDS (Engineering Dynamics Vehicle Dynamics Simulator) to perform the driving maneuvers in the computer environment. 4. Comparison to quasi-static analysis using a static roll model (SRM). 5. Analysis of videotape of cattle during test maneuvers. Results of this research verify the stability of Class 8 livestock trailers and validate the use of EDVDS as tool for analysis...|$|E
40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{understanding}} how to mitigate the safety hazard of splash and spray around heavy vehicles, a computational study of the aerodynamics and spray dispersion about a simplified <b>trailer</b> wheel <b>assembly</b> has been completed. A tandem dual slick (TDS) wheel model that neglects complex geometric features such as brakes, wheel bolts and wheel cutouts but with the same dimensions as an actual <b>trailer</b> wheel <b>assembly</b> was used. A detailed simulation of the wheels alone demonstrated that the flow field is both unsteady and complex, containing a number of vortical structures that interact strongly with spray. Preliminary simulations with fenders and fairings demonstrated that these devices prevent the ballistic transport of drops larger than approximately 0. 1 mm, but the fine mist speculated {{to be responsible for}} visibility reduction is unaffected. This work suggests that to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to design and evaluate spray mitigation strategies the jet or sheet breakup processes can be modeled using an array of injectors of small (< 0. 01 mm) water droplets; however the choice of size distribution, injection locations, directions and velocities is largely unknown and requires further study. Possible containment strategies would include using flow structures to 'focus' particles into regions away from passing cars or surface treatments to capture small drops...|$|R
50|$|The {{pivot ball}} hitch is an anti-binding {{motorcycle}} <b>trailer</b> hitch <b>assembly</b> {{composed of a}} base and a trailer ball. The base is secured to a standard ball mount on the motorcycle. The trailer {{is attached to a}} socket coupler. A space between the ball shank and the assembly mount allow the ball to move left and right in a vertical plane. Thus, the ball remains in a generally upright position when the motorcycle leans left or right into a turn because the base of the pivot ball hitch is able to move in the opposite direction of the motorcycle without causing the coupler to bind.|$|R

A gas manifold region ahead of the torch is also provided with shield gas from a tube to protect metal preheated by the torch. Further novelty lies in constructing portions of sides and housing and portions of side walls of the guide of stainless steel screen having a tight mesh...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} new aspects of physical load factors as {{risk factors for}} musculoskeletal disorders among industrial employees. The following issues were in focus: the effect of physical work load and job experience on morbidity from musculoskeletal disorders, the incidence rates and induction times for these disorders, and the triggering factors for incident low back pain. Furthermore, the applicability of telephone interview {{in the assessment of}} physical work load and the effects of an ergonomic intervention were investigated. The studies were conducted in two Finnish factories: a middle-sized <b>trailer</b> <b>assembly</b> factory and a large forest industry enterprise. To investigate the effects of physical work load and job experience on morbidity from musculoskeletal disorders, and to assess the incidence rates of these disorders among newly employed workers, dynamic cohorts were followed. Case-crossover and case-control designs were used for investigating triggering factors for acute low back pain. A 'before-after' design was used in the intervention study. The data were collected with questionnaires, interviews, diaries, observations, and direct measurements. Medical diagnoses and sick leaves were obtained from medical records. The results showed that newly employed workers had a higher rate of sick leave due to upper limb disorders compared to experienced ones, especially in the tasks with high physical work load. The women had a higher rate than the men. New male workers in physically strenuous tasks had a high rate of sick leave due to neck and shoulder disorders. The workers sought medical advice due to the disorders for the first time typically after some months from the beginning of employment. The study on triggering factors for acute low back pain showed these factors to be associated with both work and leisure activities. Acute low back pain was also associated with daily job exposures, such as the handling of heavy loads, squatting or kneeling, and accident risk. Valid and reproducible information of work contents of regular work tasks was obtained via telephone interview. After an ergonomic intervention in assembly work most employees worked less with deviated wrist and the cumulative exposure on the upper extremity was lower. Lifting with twisted torso was reduced. In conclusion, newly employed workers in hand intensive tasks having a high risk of sick leave due to upper limb and neck-shoulder disorders suggests an etiologic role of activities involving high force demands in these disorders. In the prevention of these disorders, special attention should be paid to newly employed workers. The risk of acute low back pain seems to increase via both cumulative loading and acute physical overload. For the assessment of physical load factors, a single telephone interview can give reproducible and valid information of work in daily occurring tasks. For occasional tasks interview methods should be further developed. Exposure to importan. t risk factors of upper extremity and low back disorders can be reduced with relatively simple and low-cost solution...|$|E

40|$|Here {{we discuss}} a new integer multicommodity flow problem {{in which the}} {{commodities}} can not be shipped independently. The problem emerges in the routing of airplane parts from production sites to assembly sites. The parts are of such size {{that they have to}} be carried on dedicated trailers. Each type of part has its own type of trailer. A part is loaded on its trailer after it is produced, carried on its <b>trailer</b> to its <b>assembly</b> site, and then the trailer has to be recycled. The transport of the parts is done with huge specially built transportation aircrafts. For reasons of stability such aircrafts can only carry some pre-specified combinations of parts on trailers and empty trailers. We consider the problem of finding a feasible transportation plan that minimises the total flying time of the transportation aircrafts. For this purpose we develop both optimisation and approximation algorithms...|$|R
