[...] Jackson had wanted the two to meet, with him serving as a mediator, though according to Game, [...] "It never manifested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Professor {{spoke up}} like a man," [...] she agreed, [...] "but, Laura, I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Did you notice his servant--that man Craig?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} do that. I am going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> {{for your own}} good. You must leave off writing those letters to the English newspapers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly, Perkins, {{considering}} I am due at ten o'clock, {{and therefore}} have only {{five minutes to}} stay. I just dropped in <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> about <b>something</b> on which <b>you</b> can perhaps advise us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Great changes {{always bring}} small discomforts," [...] Wolfenden rejoined. [...] "But after all I didn't {{come here to}} talk nonsense. I came <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> both <b>something.</b> I {{want to know whether}} you fellows are bent upon seeing this thing through?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter," [...] said Poirot, not betraying {{any sign of}} disappointment. [...] "Now I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> about <b>something</b> else. There is a {{saucepan}} in Mrs. Inglethorp's room with some coco in it. Did she have that every night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--everything! Well, well, well!" [...] But {{he pulled}} himself together; he began again to eat. [...] "I came back <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> That's what I came back for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{have told}} you {{something}} very interesting," [...] she said, [...] "and in return I am going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> You quarrelled with her, did you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Woodburn {{advanced}} {{and put her}} hand on her father's shoulder. [...] "Look heah, papa! Mr. Fulkerson wants <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> and he wants me to do it fo' him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rupert Sent Leger, {{before we}} {{go a step further}} I must say <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> and I charge you, on your most sacred honour and belief, to answer me truly. Do you believe me {{to be one of those}} unhappy beings who may not die, but have to live in shameful {{existence}} between earth and the nether world, and whose hellish mission is to destroy, body and soul, those who love them till they fall to their level? You are a gentleman, and a brave one. I have found you fearless. Answer me in sternest truth, no matter what the issue may be!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry you}} take it in that way," [...] said Fan. [...] "I was going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do <b>something</b> to please me, but after what you said have--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kilmeny," [...] he said, seriously, [...] "I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do <b>something</b> for me. I {{want you to}} take me home with you and {{introduce}} me to your uncle and aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{wonder why}} I begged you to come. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> You said I was ignorant. That is true. And what can I do but ask you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very good,' pursued Mr Crummles, 'then we'll {{call that}} settled. Now, I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> else. There's a little--what shall I call it?--a little {{canvassing}} {{takes place on}} these occasions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not yet; I wish <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> first. Arthur says he {{will come}} down {{as soon as he}} gets my reply. And--I should like Captain Horton to come with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear Vernon, I wish <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do <b>something,</b> if <b>you</b> kindly will, {{although}} it is not quite in your line. Old Jackson, the editor of The Judge, is a friend of yours, isn't he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{again about}} <b>something</b> <b>you</b> {{said the other}} day. Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak hastily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I meant it," [...] {{answered}} his nephew, {{speaking in a}} full, strong voice, [...] "because that girl was right {{when she said that}} you had cheated her, and you know that she was right. I have seen the accounts of 'Jemima's Vow'--I saw them this morning--and you have already made more than a thousand pounds clear profit on the book. And then, when she comes <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>something</b> over the beggarly fifty pounds which you doled out to her, you refuse, and offer her three pounds as her share of the translation rights--three pounds as against your eleven!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl nodded shortly. [...] "It's not my business," [...] she said. [...] "I am {{glad you}} came. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Who {{is this man}} Rowan who killed my uncle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] said Mr. Skimpole, {{standing}} {{with his back to}} the fire after giving up the sketch when it was half finished, [...] "I should like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> without offence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have agreed}} to be here mostly because I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> important," [...] said Mrs. Fitzpiers, her {{intonation}} modulating {{in a direction that}} she had not quite wished it to take.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh! I don’t {{care about}} the London season! It is too matrimonial. People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them. I wanted to meet you. It is quite true. You know what a woman’s curiosity is. Almost as great as a man’s! I wanted immensely to meet <b>you,</b> and [...] . <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do <b>something</b> for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Lanyon,--You {{are one of}} {{my oldest}} friends; and {{although}} we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day when, if you had said to me, `Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,' I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you. Lanyon my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost.

6000|$|... 'Brother,' said Wegg, {{when this}} happy {{understanding}} was established, 'I should like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> You remember {{the night when}} I first looked in here, and found you floating your powerful mind in tea?' ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (glumly). I'm not. You can't call it writing--not what I did--small town stuff. (Changing the subject.) But I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Do {{you know}} when I'm to be moved away to the huts? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Paul, I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something!</b> When {{you heard}} from the convent that {{relations}} had claimed me and taken me away, and then, a year afterwards, you found me there--in London--a dancing girl, what did you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush! hush!" [...] {{interposed}} Mrs. Peckover; [...] "don't be so dreadful noisy, there's a good man! or you'll wake {{my brother}} up stairs. And, besides, where's the {{use to make}} such a stir about what I done for your sister? Anybody else would have took as kindly to her as I did, seeing what distress she was in, poor soul! Here," [...] she continued, handing him back the beaver-skin roll; [...] "here's your money, and thank you for the offer of it. Put it up safe in your pocket again. We manage to keep our heads above water, thank God! and don't want to do no better than that. Put it up in your pocket again, and then I'll make bold <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>something</b> else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too dreadful! Marjorie," [...] she said, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do <b>something.</b> After all, {{a mother}} has some claim. Will you {{wait just a}} little. Will you promise me to do nothing--nothing, I mean, to commit you--until your father {{has been able to}} make inquiries. Don't see him for a little while. Very soon you'll be one-and-twenty, and then perhaps things may be different. If he cares for you, and you for him, a little {{separation}} won't matter.... Until your father has inquired...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I've <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> first, <b>something</b> {{that may}} take some time." [...] He saw now that her embarrassment had really not been resentful; it had been nervous, tremulous, as the emotion of an {{unexpected}} pleasure might have been. [...] "That's really why I determined last night, without asking your leave first to pay you this little visit--that and the intense desire for another bout of horse-play with Sidney. Oh, I've come to see you," [...] Peter Baron went on, [...] "and I won't make any secret {{of the fact that}} I expect you to resign yourself gracefully to the trial and give me all your time. The day's lovely, and I'm ready to declare that the place is as good as the day. Let me drink deep of these things, drain the cup like a man who hasn't been out of London for months and months. Let me walk with you and talk with you and lunch with you--I go back this afternoon. Give me all your hours in short, so that they may live in my memory as one of the sweetest occasions of life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before I {{answer your}} question," [...] said Midwinter, a little constrainedly, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> Allan, on my side. Is it really true {{that you are}} in some way {{concerned}} in Miss Gwilt's leaving Major Milroy's service?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{it was not}} Fashoda that I {{was going}} to talk to you about. I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about England. I know really nothing about it, for I was born in Alexandria, shortly after my parents came out from England.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] he began, with transparently feigned seriousness. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>{{something}},</b> if {{you don't}} mind. Now, of course, I don't {{want to hurt}} your feelin's or nothin', but just the same there's something important I'd like to know." ...|$|E
5000|$|The next day, {{the caravan}} of the captives {{was made to}} start {{traveling}} towards Kufah. Ali Zaynul-Abidin, regardless of being ill, was bound in heavy chains and forced to walk barefooted as the women, including the granddaughters of Muhammad, were forced to sit on bare backs of camels, with their necks and hands tied tightly with ropes. The people in the caravan suffered the tortures of the journey, and when they reached Al-Kufah, {{they were forced to}} march through its public roads or streets. Suddenly, the camel on which Sakinah and Zainab were stopped near a house. Zaynab's eyes fell on Sakinah and immediately knew that she had something <b>to</b> say. She <b>asked</b> her, and Sakinah answered, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for <b>something,</b> I know my dear aunt, that at this moment it is impossible for you to fulfill it." [...] When Zaynab insisted, Sakinah replied, [...] "O my dear aunt, my throat is so dry, I do not think I can endure my thirst anymore." [...] Her words were heard by the women who had climbed on top of the houses so that they could see the holy caravan march clearly. Among these women, a sympathetic woman immediately got up from the crowd and rushed home to bring water for Sayeda Sakina.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And now, I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do <b>something</b> for me,' added Mr. Underwood. 'I have left this {{magnificent}} estate of mine entirely to my wife, appointing her sole guardian to my children. But I {{have begun to}} think how much has {{been taken out of}} her by that shock of leaving Vale Leston, and by that wonderful resolute patience that-- that I shall never be able to thank her for. I scarcely dare to let her know that I see it. And when I look on to the winter that is before her,' he added, much less calmly, 'I think she may not be long after me. I must add a guardian. Once we had many good friends. We have them still, I hope, but I cannot lay this on them. Our cousin Tom Underwood does not seem disposed to notice us, and his care might not be of the right kind. Our only other relation is Fulbert Underwood.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The Professor {{cleared his}} throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said, [...] "May I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> now?" ...|$|R
