40|$|Reunion Island, {{situated}} in the Indian Ocean, presents a unique case study for modelling regional bio-economic parameters of the dairy industry. It {{is a good example}} of a closed system for several parameters of the model such as movement of animals, labour, consumption and available land. The existence of several agro-ecological zones from tropical to temperate, and various different types of terrain and vegetation presents another unique opportunity to study the impact of these features on the dairy industry. The present study models the dairy sector at a regional (island) level to study the impact of new or adapted agricultural policies in relation to changes in subsidy levels, price fluctuations and environmental policies (mainly nitrogen management). The model can be used to generate a number of scenarios to explore the effects of various policy measures, such as fixing the stocking rate according to EU norms, increasing or decreasing the milk subsidy, intensification (such as an increase in milk production <b>to</b> the <b>allotted</b> <b>quota</b> of 40 million litres/yr) and varying labour/price constraints (such as a reduction in labour hours or an increase or decrease in the milk price). The model is being utilized by the local dairy cooperative as a discussion support tool to study the implications at the regional scale of expanding the sector and assessing its economic, environmental and social impac...|$|R
2500|$|Bedfordshire batted {{first at}} Luton. They progressed slowly, making their first 50 in the 23rd over. Whilst they {{improved}} to 143 for 9 in their 50 overs, {{it was never}} going to be enough. By way of comparison, it took Sussex six overs to reach their first 50, with Ian Ward (65 off 44) scoring most of the early runs, although admittedly batting was easier on the drying pitch. Sussex overhauled their modest target with 31.3 overs to go - almost two thirds of their <b>allotted</b> <b>quota.</b>|$|R
50|$|Haj Committee of India (also {{known as}} Central Haj Committee (CHC)) is a {{statutory}} {{body of the}} Indian government which organises Islamic pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia. It was established under Haj Committee Act in 2002. The committee acts as a nodal agency for state haj committees and has 23 members, of which six are elected by state haj committees, four are ex-official, three are MPs, seven are nominated by the central government and the rest come from the state which sends largest number of pilgrims. India was provided with 1,36,200 pilgrims quota in 2016, out of which, 1,00,200 travels {{were said to be}} arranged by the haj committee. The committee distributes the <b>allotted</b> <b>quota</b> state-wise based on Muslim population density according to 2011 census.|$|R
50|$|On 3 August 1942, the {{squadron}} moved from Bowman Field, Kentucky to the Army Air Base, Florence, South Carolina. The movement was completed on 5 August. The squadron began to gather its required strength of pilots and enlisted man as combat crews, and its <b>allotted</b> <b>quota</b> of aircraft. An intensive overseas training program was immediately undertaken. Flying personnel engaged in night flying and dropped paratroops in southern maneuvers. Ground personnel were given infantry and commando training. While at Florence, {{the number of}} aircraft in the unit was raised {{to a maximum of}} thirteen. The squadron sustained its first loss of personnel when Sergeant Joseph Archembault died on 29 August 1942, at Florence, S.C., as a result of injuries received in a motor vehicle accident.|$|R

40|$|Mega grids span several continents and may {{consist of}} {{millions}} of nodes and billions of tasks executing {{at any point in}} time. This setup calls for scalable and highly available resource utilization control that adapts itself to dynamic changes in the grid environment as they occur. In this paper, we address the problem of enforcing upper bounds on the consumption of grid resources. We propose a grid-wide quota enforcement system, called GWiQ-P. GWiQ-P is light-weight, and in practice is infinitely scalable, satisfying concurrently any number of resource demands, all within the limits of a global quota assigned to each user. GWiQ-P adapts to dynamic changes in the grid as they occur, improving future performance by means of improved locality. This improved performance does not impair the system's ability to respond to current requests, tolerate failures, or maintain the <b>allotted</b> <b>quota</b> levels. 1...|$|R
