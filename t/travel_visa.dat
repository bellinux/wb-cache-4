500|$|... 1:54 is a {{contemporary}} African art fair held annually in London, beginning in 2013. As of 2015, 1:54 {{is the only}} art fair dedicated to contemporary African art in the primary art market. Its name refers to the 54 countries that compose the African continent, expressed as a ratio ("one continent: 54 countries"). Moroccan curator Touria El Glaoui, daughter of the artist Hassan El Glaoui, organized the fair to improve the representation of contemporary African art in worldwide art exhibitions. Representation of non-Western countries in the contemporary art world has lagged behind that of other countries. Representation of African countries, in particular, improved alongside the continent's economic growth. El Glaoui said that the continent {{did not have a}} single art scene, and that there was great diversity between African nations. Accordingly, as in the fair's title, 1:54 tries to preserve rather than homogenize the differences between each country's histories and cultures. In starting the fair, its founder was supported and advised by the British Council, the Francophonie, and partners ArtReview, Beaux Art magazine, and Art.sy. For each edition, the 1:54 organizers ask themselves [...] "what is necessary, what can be achieved, how [...] do something different". The fair's organizers choose exhibitors based on proposal submissions and the firms' reputation and plans. <b>Travel</b> <b>visa</b> issues have also affected whether invitees ultimately attend.|$|E

500|$|M.I.A. {{has become}} known for {{integrating}} her imagery of political violence into her music videos and her cover art. Her politically inspired art became recognised while she exhibited and published several of her brightly coloured stencils and paintings portraying the tiger, a symbol of Tamil nationalism, ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and urban Britain in the early 2000s. Lyrics on Arular regarding her experiences of identity politics, poverty, revolution, gender and sexual stereotypes, war, and the conditions of working class in London were hailed as new and unorthodox, setting her apart from previous artists. The album references the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Tamil independence movements and features culture jamming, multi-lingual slang, strident and subtle imagery. Her albums' social commentary and storytelling have incited debate on the [...] "invigoratingly complex" [...] politics of the issues she highlighted in the album, breaking taboos while the West was engaged in the 2003 Iraq War in the Middle East during the Presidency of George W. Bush. Government visits to her official website following her debut album's release in 2005, and a US refusal to grant M.I.A. a <b>travel</b> <b>visa</b> coupled with her brief presence on the US Homeland Security Risk List in 2006 due to her politically charged lyrics led to her second album Kala being recorded {{in a variety of}} locations around the world. The American Civil Liberties Union described the actions as part of a trend of ideological exclusion by the state which was detrimental to democracy by [...] "censoring and manipulating debate". In October 2016, she revealed on her Instagram that she had finally been approved for a US visa.|$|E

2500|$|As he puts it, Yim Maukun arrived penniless in Hong Kong in 1980. [...] He {{effectively}} {{was starting}} from scratch at age 38, leaving behind whatever reputation he had established in China as an artist for the previous fifteen years. [...] He first earned income working on “export paintings” for art dealers. [...] These consisted mainly of full-sized personal and family portraits made from small photos, replicas of classical European paintings, and reproductions of pieces from various international art magazines. [...] While this can be considered more of a money-making trade than true art, it was nevertheless a crucial stage in Yim’s career for refining his techniques. [...] It led to an arrangement through the art dealer Xu Yaolin in 1981 for Yim to produce original works—two original oil paintings per month—for the Simic Gallery in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, as an associate painter. [...] Several noteworthy pieces {{were the result of}} this (including Eternal Devotion, My San Francisco and the original version of Sunset), but the arrangement ended prematurely when Yim’s application for a <b>travel</b> <b>visa</b> to the U.S. was denied in 1982.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were two}} {{distinct}} periods of recruitment. During the first period, which lasted until 1966, {{a large number}} of Turks came to the Netherlands through unofficial channels, either being recruited by employers or immigrating spontaneously. A small economic recession began in 1966. Some of the labour migrants were forced to return to Turkey. In 1968, the economy picked up again and a new recruitment period, which was to last until 1974, commenced. In May 1968, new European Economic Community rules forced the Netherlands to instate a <b>travel</b> <b>visa</b> system to regulate labour immigration and from then on, the state recruited foreign workers. The peak of Turkish labour migration occurred during these years. The Turks eventually surpassed other migrant nationalities in numbers and came to represent the Dutch image of guest workers. Due to the 1973 oil crisis, the Den Uyl cabinet ended labour immigration in 1974. Because from then on re-entry into the Netherlands was impossible, Turkish remigration strongly decreased. A system of family reunification had been arranged in the 1960s and gradually Turkish workers after 1974 brought over their wife and children. The latter predominantly married partners from Turkey. In the early twenty-first century the Second Balkenende cabinet imposed much stricter conditions on unification, to a large extent ending Turkish [...] "marriage immigration". This coincided with a drop in birth rates, leading to a gradual levelling off in the growth of people of Turkish descent. Since 2003, there have often been years with an emigration surplus.|$|E
