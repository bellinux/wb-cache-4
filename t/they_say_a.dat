Farmers could combat excessive droughts with irrigation techniques, but Environment Canada has concerns about how irrigation effects soil quality. Scientists surmise it would bring more soluble salts to the surface, which would lower the quality of the soil.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the firstborn {{of every}} Jewish family was {{intended}} {{to serve as a}} priest in the temple in Jerusalem as priests to the Jewish people but they lost this role after the sin of the golden calf when this privilege was transferred to the male descendants of Aaron. However, according to some, this role will be given back to the firstborn in a Third Temple when Messiah comes. Until this time, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> firstborn son still has certain other roles. Besides receiving double the father's inheritance and requiring a pidyon haben, a firstborn son is supposed to fast on the Eve of Passover (see: Fast of the Firstborn) {{and in the absence of}} a Levite, a Bechor washes the hands of the Kohen prior to blessing the Israelites (see: Priestly Blessing).|$|E

During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of things about}} people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{opposition}} in the federal parliament of Belgium stated that a decision was already made in favour of the American F-35 and that the competition was a cover-up. The opposition concluded that the requirements for the new aircraft were set up {{such a way that}} [...] "only the F-35 could possibly meet the requirements". A supposedly leaked document from the Belgian military stated that for Belgium to remain in a strong position in NATO, the aircraft should have a launch capability for the B61 nuclear bombs supposedly stored at the Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium. Coalition parties have denied the allegations. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> decision will be made in 2018 and that parliament could still vote against the selected aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designers}} project further improvements. [...] These include improved projectile {{technologies such}} as environmentally friendly bullets and a change in bullet size {{in order to increase}} combat effectiveness, as well as the integration of electronics such as ammunition count readouts, lasers, optical sights, rangefinders, and bullet drop compensation. The Army is pursuing cased telescoped ammunition. [...] This development is far along, and <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> new LMG could be fielded within two years (2014) with unequivocal support. [...] The Marine Corps is pursuing caseless ammunition, which is less developed and will take several more years to refine. A compact version is also being developed with a 4-inch shorter barrel and folding, telescoping buttstock. The 5.56mm LSAT machine gun has been renamed the Cased Telescoped Light Machine Gun (CT LMG).|$|E

2500|$|Richard Pococke, {{who visited}} in 1727, writes {{that it is}} [...] "famous for some {{pleasant}} gardens of lemon and orange trees; and here the Turks have a mosque, to which they pay great veneration, having, as <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> great sheik buried there, whom they call Sede Ishab, who, according to tradition (as a very learned Jew assured me) is Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses." [...] Around this time and until the late 18th century, Hittin was a small village in the autonomous sheikhdom of Zahir al-Umar. In 1767, Zahir's son Sa'id sought to control Hittin and nearby Tur'an, but was defeated by his father. Nonetheless, Zahir granted Sa'id both villages when he pardoned him. A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin [...] showed the place, named as Hattin.|$|E
2500|$|Alito stated [...] "Respondents set out {{a parade}} of horribles that they claim could occur if Flast is not {{extended}} to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures. For example, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> federal agency could use its discretionary funds {{to build a house}} of worship or to hire clergy of one denomination and send them out to spread their faith. Or an agency could use its funds to make bulk purchases of Stars of David, crucifixes, or depictions of the star and crescent for use in its offices or for distribution to the employees or the general public. Of course, none of these things has happened, even though Flast has not previously been expanded in the way that respondents urge. In the unlikely event that any of these executive actions did take place, Congress could quickly step in. And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs who would possess standing based on grounds other than taxpayer standing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dogmatic {{definition}} of purgatory {{was given in}} 1245: the First Council of Lyon declared that, on Scriptural grounds and because the Greeks too [...] "are said to believe and to affirm that the souls of those who after a penance has been received yet not performed, or who, without mortal sin yet die with venial and slight sin, can be cleansed after death and can be helped by the suffrages of the Church, we, since <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> place of purgation of this kind has not been indicated to them with a certain and proper name by their teachers, we indeed, calling it purgatory according to the traditions and authority of the Holy Fathers, wish {{that in the future}} it be called by that name in their area. For in that transitory fire certainly sins, though not criminal or capital, which before have not been remitted through penance but were small and minor sins, are cleansed, and these weigh heavily even after death, if they have been forgiven in this life." ...|$|E
