5|$|Macdonald {{suggests}} thatunlike Wagner, Alkan did {{not seek}} to refashion <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> opera; nor, like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music {{at the service of}} literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the Triangular Trade and how it connected the world. The Triangular Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three areas of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> trade. Once traded, items and goods were shipped {{to other parts of}} the world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E
5|$|Prior to opening, WhiteWater World was criticised {{for being}} built {{during one of}} Australia's worst {{droughts}} and in an area on Level 5 water restrictions.

5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E

5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its {{themes of}} chance and fate, which he characterises as simple luck, to him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, {{a man who}} mediates his experience of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Woods {{announced}} {{his intention to}} begin designing golf courses around <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> a new company, Tiger Woods Design. A month later, he announced that the company's first course would be in Dubai {{as part of a}} 25.3 million-square-foot development, The Tiger Woods Dubai. The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009. As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, The New York Times reported that the project had been shelved permanently. In 2013, the partnership between Tiger Woods Design and Dubai Holding was dissolved.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Qutb Shahi {{rulers and}} Nizams {{attracted}} artists, architects and men {{of letters from}} different parts of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as mushairas (poetic symposia). The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani Urdu literature leading to works such as the Deccani Masnavi and Diwan poetry, which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu. Lazzat Un Nisa, a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts. The reign of the Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education. In 1824, a collection of Urdu Ghazal poetry, named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa, authored by Mah Laqa Bai—the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad.|$|E

5|$|Madras {{was linked}} to the rest of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> {{telegraphs}} in 1853 and a civilian telegraph service was introduced on 1 February 1855. Soon afterwards, telegraph lines linked Madras and Ootacamund with other cities in India. A Telegraph department was set up in 1854, with a Deputy Superintendent stationed in Madras city. The Colombo-Talaimannar telegraph line established in 1858, was extended to Madras in 1882, thereby connecting the city with Ceylon. Telephones were introduced in the presidency in 1881 and on 19 November 1881, the first telephone exchange with 17 connections was established at Errabalu Street in Madras. A wireless telgraphy service was established between Madras and Port Blair in 1920 and in 1936, the Indo-Burma radio telephone service was established between Madras and Rangoon.|$|E

The festival {{is one of the many}} events throughout the year to get youth involved. In 2015 the festival hosted 40 different organizations at King Hussein Business Park in Amman that inspired their audience to be visionary and think differently about <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> presentations and workshops. The variety of organizations included business, environmental, medical and educational groups.|$|E
5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of {{his fingers on the}} typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E

5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New World Order {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported {{to be part of a}} cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{have been}} {{proposed}} about the relation between Ragnarök and the 9th century Old High German epic poem Muspilli about the Christian Last Judgment, where the word Muspille appears, and the 9th century Old Saxon epic poem Heliand {{about the life of}} Christ, where various other forms of the word appear. In both sources, the word is used to signify the end of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> fire. Old Norse forms of the term also appear throughout accounts of Ragnarök, where the world is also consumed in flames, and, though various theories exist about the meaning and origins of the term, its etymology has not been solved.|$|E
5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide debate. This one concerns {{the degree to which}} Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope {{for the rest of the}} human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, Kitase knew {{he wanted}} a {{thematic}} combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters {{who appeared to be}} ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters—a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game, and the use of motion capture technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in VII. Motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of VII, and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.|$|E

With the orphanage {{on the brink}} of bankruptcy, Kyle defies his mother to go on a quest to search for funds, {{together}} with his best friend Loni.

After this, Kyle becomes embroiled in the attempts by a man named Barbatos Goetia to kill those who accompanied his parents, eventually learning that Barbatos also killed Stahn when Kyle was five. During his quest, a series of Lens thefts is orchestrated by Elrane, the Holy Woman of the Order of Atamoni who is capable of performing miracles using Lens and seeks to bring happiness to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>through</b> uniting it under a single religion.|$|E
