50|$|Trade {{promotion}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as export promotion) is an umbrella term for economic policies, development interventions and private initiatives aimed at improving the trade performance of an economic area. Such an economic area can include just one country, a region within a country, or can encompass a group of countries involved in an economic trade area. Specific industries may be <b>targeted.</b> <b>Improvement</b> is mainly sought by increasing exports both in absolute terms, as well as relative to imports. When specific industries are targeted, trade promotion policies tend to target industries that have a comparative advantage over their foreign competitors. Ironically, trade promotion can also include expanding the supply of key inputs in a country's strongest industries, via import expansion. If successful, such a tactic would lead to Pro-trade Biased Growth.|$|E

30|$|Passenger comfort is an {{important}} index {{that can be used}} to measure the quality of public transport services and a crucial factor in residents’ choice of traffic mode (Dell’Olio et al. 2011; Eboli and Mazzula 2011). For example, the quality of life in China has been increasing over the years, which in turn has led to the demand for higher levels of trip comfort. Presently, traffic congestion has become ubiquitous in China’s metropolitan areas. Thus, improving bus comfort to attract more passengers and further alleviate traffic congestion has received much attention from bus operators and authorities (Zhang et al. 2014). In addition, elucidating the factors affecting bus comfort levels can help policymakers implement <b>targeted</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies.|$|E
