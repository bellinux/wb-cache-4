5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar {{became the first}} {{generation}} of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service. In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the <b>twin-engine</b> Boeing 757 to replace its 727, the <b>twin-engine</b> 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range <b>twin-engine</b> operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed <b>twin-engine</b> airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours' distance from emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.|$|E
5|$|The He 111 was a <b>twin-engine</b> {{version of}} the Blitz, {{preserving}} the elliptical inverted gull wing, small rounded control surfaces and BMW engines, so that the new design was often called the Doppel-Blitz ("Double Lightning"). When the Dornier Do 17 displaced the He 70, Heinkel needed a <b>twin-engine</b> design to match its competitors. Heinkel spent 200,000 man hours designing the He 111. The fuselage length was extended to just over 17.4m/57ft (from 11.7m/38ft 4½in) and wingspan to 22.6m/74ft (from 14.6m/48ft).|$|E
5|$|Mohawk Airlines Flight 411, a Fairchild FH-227B <b>twin-engine</b> turboprop, {{registered}} N7811M, was {{a scheduled}} domestic passenger service operated by Mohawk Airlines, between Albany and Glens Falls, New York. On November 19, 1969, it crashed into Pilot Knob Mountain, killing all 14 {{passengers and crew}} on board.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{uncertainty}} surrounding the delivery {{and availability of}} the DB 601 engines, Heinkel switched to 820kW (1,100hp) Junkers Jumo 211 powerplants, whose somewhat greater size and weight were regarded as unimportant considerations in a <b>twin-engine</b> design. When the Jumo was fitted to the P model it became the He 111 H.|$|E
5|$|The Panavia Tornado is {{a family}} of <b>twin-engine,</b> variable-sweep wing multirole combat aircraft, which was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. There are three primary Tornado variants: the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) fighter-bomber, the suppression of enemy air defences Tornado ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) and the Tornado ADV (air defence variant) interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Su-35 (-35; NATO {{reporting}} name: Flanker-E) is {{the designation}} for two separate, heavily-upgraded derivatives of the Su-27 air-defence fighter. They are single-seat, <b>twin-engine,</b> highly-maneuverable aircraft, {{designed by the}} Sukhoi Design Bureau and built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association.|$|E
5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the delta wing resulted in {{two versions of the}} design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a fighter, and gave it <b>twin-engine</b> reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E
5|$|II (Sturm)./JG 4 {{took off}} for Le Culot at 08:08. Getting lost, they {{stumbled}} upon Asch airfield and claimed one P-47 destroyed and two <b>twin-engine</b> aircraft damaged, {{as well as two}} trains and trucks destroyed. The unit claimed an Auster reconnaissance aircraft shot down. The machine was probably a Stinson L-1 Vigilant of the 125th Liaison Squadron, U.S. Army. However, virtually the entire Gruppe of 17 Fw 190s was wiped out.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of older books, the MiG I-211 is called the MiG-5. It is now {{established}} that the MiG-5 designation was reserved for the production version of the MiG DIS, a <b>twin-engine</b> fighter that did not enter production. The acronym DIS comes from Dalnij Istrebitel Soprovozhdenya or long-range escort fighter. Similarly, the MiG-9 designation was intended for the production version of the MiG-3 with the ASh-82 radial engine. This name was reused shortly afterwards for the first Mikoyan-Gurevich jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after it}} {{departed}} from Asheville Regional Airport in Asheville, North Carolina, on July 19, 1967, Piedmont Airlines Flight 22 {{collided with a}} <b>twin-engine</b> Cessna 310 on approach to Asheville. At {{the time of the}} accident, the Piedmont Boeing 727 was en route to Roanoke. There were 82 fatalities and no survivors, making this the deadliest accident associated with Roanoke Regional Airport.|$|E
5|$|The Douglas XCG-17 was an American assault glider, {{developed}} by the conversion of a C-47 Skytrain <b>twin-engine</b> transport during World War II. Although the XCG-17 was successful in testing, the requirement for such a large glider had passed, and no further examples of the type were built; one additional C-47, however, was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration briefly during 1946 for evaluation, but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration.|$|E
5|$|The Grumman XTSF was a {{proposed}} <b>twin-engine</b> torpedo scout aircraft, designed by Grumman for the United States Navy {{towards the end}} of World War II. Based on the design of the Grumman F7F Tigercat fighter, enlarged and {{with the addition of a}} bomb bay, the XTSF was deemed too large for carrier operations, and the project was cancelled before any aircraft were built. Instead, the Navy chose to order the single-engine XTB3F, which became the successful AF Guardian.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is a tandem two-seat, <b>twin-engine,</b> all-weather, {{long-range}} supersonic jet interceptor and fighter-bomber {{originally developed}} for the United States Navy by McDonnell Aircraft. It first entered service in 1960 with the U.S. Navy. Proving highly adaptable, it was also adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force, and by the mid-1960s had become {{a major part of}} their air wings.|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Su-33 (-33; NATO {{reporting}} name: Flanker-D) is an all-weather carrier-based <b>twin-engine</b> {{air superiority}} fighter designed by Sukhoi and manufactured by Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, {{derived from the}} Su-27 and initially known as the Su-27K. Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and stabilators, all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has canards and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel, and is air refuelable.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the raid are {{difficult}} to judge given the confusion over loss records. It is likely more aircraft were destroyed than listed. The Americans failed to keep a proper record of their losses and it appears the U.S. 8th Air Force losses {{were not included in}} loss totals. When these estimates and figures are added to the losses listed in the table below, {{it is likely that the}} correct figures are 232 destroyed (143 single-engine, 74 <b>twin-engine</b> and 15 four-engine) and 156 damaged (139 single-engine, 12 <b>twin-engine</b> and five four-engine). Researching individual squadron records confirms the destruction of even more USAAF aircraft. This suggests at least a further 16 B-17s, 14 B-24s, eight P-51s, and at least two P-47s were destroyed on top of that total. A total of 290 destroyed and 180 damaged seems a more realistic summation than the conservative figures given by the USAAF, RAF, and RCAF. Including the 15 Allied aircraft shot down and 10 damaged in aerial combat, 305 destroyed and 190 damaged is the sum total of the attack.|$|E
5|$|A letter Hess {{wrote to}} his wife dated 4 November 1940 shows {{that in spite of}} not {{receiving}} a reply from Hamilton, he intended to proceed with his plan. He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater <b>twin-engine</b> aircraft, in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, and found a specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a radio compass, modifications to the oxygen delivery system, and large long-range fuel tanks to be installed on this plane, and these requests were granted by March 1941.|$|E
5|$|Airline {{customers}} were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, {{adding to the}} heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the <b>twin-engine</b> configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{losses are}} given at Evere as 32 fighters, 22 <b>twin-engine</b> {{aircraft}} and 13 four-engine aircraft destroyed, plus another nine single, six twin and one four-engine aircraft damaged. In total, II./JG 26 losses included 13 Fw 190s destroyed and two damaged. Nine of its pilots were missing; five {{were killed and}} four captured. III./JG 26 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots. Only {{one of them was}} captured, the remainder were killed. The amount of damage the Germans inflicted made up for the losses; the Evere strike was a success.|$|E
5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat {{as well as the}} political climate regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's attack helicopter requirements in favor of a <b>twin-engine</b> conventional helicopter, viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which {{led to the development of}} the AH-64 Apache.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the war the Royal Air Force (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping {{operations}} on the German Bight. RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off Wilhelmshaven on 18 December 1939 in what became {{to be known as the}} Battle of the Heligoland Bight. Twenty-four <b>twin-engine</b> Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron, No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk heading for the island of Heligoland. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a Freya radar on the East Frisian Islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a <b>twin-engine</b> aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320 family {{consists}} of short- to medium-range, narrow-body, commercial passenger <b>twin-engine</b> jet airliners manufactured by Airbus. The family includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321, {{as well as}} the ACJ business jet. The A320s are also named A320ceo (current engine option) after the introduction of the A320neo (new engine option). Final assembly of the family takes place in Toulouse, France, and Hamburg, Germany. A plant in Tianjin, China, has also been producing aircraft for Chinese airlines since 2009, while a final assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama, United States, delivered its first A321 in April 2016. The aircraft family can accommodate up to 236 passengers and has a range of , depending on model.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, {{wide-body}} <b>twin-engine</b> jet airliner {{built by}} Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 was an American single-seat, <b>twin-engine</b> fighter {{aircraft}} {{technology demonstrator}} {{designed for the}} United States Air Force (USAF). The design was a finalist in the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, and two prototypes were built for the demonstration/validation phase of the competition. The YF-22 won the contest against the Northrop YF-23, and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The YF-22 has similar aerodynamic layout and configuration as the F-22, but with differences in the position and design of the cockpit, tail fins and wings, and in internal structural layout.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy {{planned to}} develop and {{introduce}} the supersonic P.1154 independently of the cancelled NATO requirement. This ambition was complicated by the conflicting requirements between the two services—while the RAF wanted a low-level supersonic strike aircraft, the Navy sought a <b>twin-engine</b> air defence fighter. Following {{the election of the}} Labour Government of 1964 the P.1154 was cancelled, as the Royal Navy had already begun procurement of the McDonnell Douglas Phantom II and the RAF placed a greater importance on the BAC TSR-2's ongoing development. Work continued on elements of the project, such as a supersonic PCB-equipped Pegasus engine, with the intention of developing a future Harrier variant for the decades following cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{the late}} spring of 1940, Fighter Command had been {{preparing}} to meet a possible air attack on the British Isles coming only from due east, from Germany itself; prior to the German victory in Western Europe. The possibility that France might fall and Britain would continue to fight on had not been considered. An air attack from Germany meant the Luftwaffe's bombers would operate beyond the range of their fighters and be vulnerable to attack. If <b>twin-engine</b> fighters, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110s were used, they would be fighting at {{the limits of their}} range.|$|E
5|$|JG 3 claimed 53 {{single-engine}} and 11 <b>twin-engine</b> aircraft destroyed. Five {{fighters and}} one four-engine bomber were also claimed damaged. Four Typhoons, three Spitfires, one Tempest and another unidentified aircraft were claimed shot down. All in all, JG 3 managed to destroy 43 aircraft according to British records, and damage a further 60, some seriously. The Geschwader believed it had destroyed 116. JG 3 {{did not come}} away unscathed. I./JG 3 lost nine of its aircraft and pilots, a 50% loss rate. Damage to the returning Gruppe aircraft meant the entire unit was unserviceable. RAF AAA were credited with shooting down five. JG 3 lost, altogether, 15 of the 60 fighters sent, a 25% loss rate. Some 15 pilots were missing; nine were killed and five captured, and another pilot was posting as missing in action and his fate remains unknown. Another source says 16 pilots; ten killed or missing and six captured.|$|E
5|$|Koch was {{initially}} sent to England {{for training and}} assessment, where he flew the Avro 504, the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin, and the Bristol Fighter. He then accepted a posting to the Middle East, and was attached to No. 208 Army Cooperation Squadron, RAF, at Heliopolis, Egypt. There he was operational on the Bristol Fighter, and in August and September 1929 {{was involved in the}} suppression of the Hebron riots. Whilst on leave in Australia in 1929, Koch met with Lieutenant Colonel Horace Brinsmead, Controller of Civil Aviation, who advised him to gain experience on larger aircraft. However, his application for posting to a <b>twin-engine</b> squadron was refused. In May 1930, the Squadron re-equipped with Armstrong Whitworth Atlas. Koch was also allowed to convert to the Vickers Vimy at No. 216 Squadron, and flew as second pilot on Vickers Victoria aircraft. He returned to Australia at the end of 1930, arriving in Melbourne on 15 December. In Egypt, Koch had continued his interest in rifle shooting and photography.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia was {{the last}} of the Commonwealth {{countries}} to enter the Empire Air Training Scheme and the first to turn out fully qualified pilots. No.25 Elementary Flying Training School at Belvedere Air Station, Salisbury, was the first school to be opened, on 25 May 1940 by Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham. It was followed by a Service School at Cranborne. In Bulawayo, an Elementary School was established at Sauerdale, although due to the unsuitability of the ground surface, it was moved to Induna, with a Service School at Kumalo. Gwelo had an Elementary School at Guinea Fowl and a Service School at Thornhill. The Elementary Schools were equipped with Tiger Moths and the Service Schools, single-engine Harvards and <b>twin-engine</b> Airspeed Oxfords. At Moffat, the first gunners passed out in September 1941 from the only Bombing and Gunnery School in Southern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body <b>twin-engine</b> jet {{airliner}} {{that was}} designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet, the 767, and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common type rating {{that allows them to}} operate both aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch air force, {{which was}} not an {{independent}} arm of the Dutch armed forces, {{but part of the}} Army, on 10 May operated a fleet of 155 aircraft: 28 Fokker G.1 <b>twin-engine</b> destroyers; 31 Fokker D.XXI and seven Fokker D.XVII fighters; ten twin-engined Fokker T.V, fifteen Fokker C.X and 35 Fokker C.V light bombers, twelve Douglas DB-8 dive bombers (used as fighters) and seventeen Koolhoven FK-51 reconnaissance aircraft—thus 74 of the 155 aircraft were biplanes. Of these aircraft 125 were operational. Of the remainder the air force school used three Fokker D.XXI, six Fokker D.XVII, a single Fokker G.I, a single Fokker T.V and seven Fokker C.V, along with several training airplanes. Another forty operational aircraft served with the marine air service along with about an equal number of reserve and training craft. The production potential of the Dutch military aircraft industry, consisting of Fokker and Koolhoven, was not fully exploited due to budget limitations.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar is an {{orthodox}} single-seat, swept-wing, <b>twin-engine</b> monoplane design, with tall tricycle-type retractable landing gear. In its original configuration, {{it had a}} maximum take-off weight in the 15 tonne class; and could manage a combat radius on internal fuel alone of , giving the Jaguar a greater operational range than competitor aircraft such as the Mikoyan MiG-27. The aircraft had hardpoints fitted for an external weapons load of up to 10,000lb (4,500kg), typical weapons fitted included the MATRA LR.F2 rocket pod, BAP 100-mm bombs, MATRA AS37 anti-radar missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and Rockeye cluster bombs. The RAF's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Gulf War, including CRV7 high-velocity rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs. Finally, the Jaguar was equipped with either a pair of French DEFA cannons, or alternatively British Aden cannons.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, the 767 {{spearheaded the}} growth of twinjet flights across the {{northern}} Atlantic under extended-range <b>twin-engine</b> operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could {{be no more than}} 90 minutes away from diversion airports. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{thereafter}} McGovern {{was sworn}} in as a private at Fort Snelling in Minnesota. He spent a month at Jefferson Barracks Military Post in Missouri and then five months at Southern Illinois Normal University in Carbondale, Illinois, for ground school training; McGovern later maintained that both the academic work and physical training were the toughest he ever experienced. He spent two months at a base in San Antonio, Texas, and then went to Hatbox Field in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for basic flying school, training in a single-engined PT‑19. McGovern married Eleanor Stegeberg on October 31, 1943 during a three-day leave (lonely and in love, the couple had decided to not wait any longer); his father presided over the ceremony at the small Methodist church in Woonsocket. After three months in Muskogee, McGovern went to Coffeyville Army Airfield in Kansas for a further three months of training on the BT‑13. Around April 1944, McGovern went on to advanced flying school at Pampa Army Airfield in Texas for <b>twin-engine</b> training on the AT‑17 and AT‑9. Throughout, Air Cadet McGovern showed skill as a pilot, with his exceptionally good depth perception aiding him. Eleanor McGovern followed him to these different duty stations, and was present when he received his wings and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the An-70 {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began {{preliminary}} design work on a successor for the An-12 <b>twin-engine</b> turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, were looking for a replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft with a quick loading time, the ability to operate from short unprepared airfields, could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The initial contract for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began advanced design work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations from the former Soviet Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} the supply of {{available}} aircraft poor, by the then Director of Organisation at the Air Ministry Charles Portal recognised {{there would be a}} future problem in procurement of aircraft. Coastal Command's operational nature would make twenty-four hour operations a basic requirement. Suitable aircraft for take-off and landing, in particular flying-boats, in all weather was vital for the safety of crews and the effectiveness of the Command. The new <b>twin-engine</b> Saro Lerwick had been touted as the ideal aircraft. It only came into service in April 1939 and was then found to be unsuitable. There was a need for long-range machines to cover the South-Western Approaches. In December 1939 to August 1940 the following reinforcements were sent: No. 10 Squadron RAAF received Sunderlands, No. 235 Squadron RAF, No. 236 Squadron RAF, No. 248 Squadron RAF and No. 254 Squadron RAF equipped with Bristol Blenheims from RAF Fighter Command in February 1940; in June 1940 No. 53 Squadron RAF and No. 59 Squadron RAFs with Blenheim on loan from RAF Bomber Command, and in August 1940, No. 98 Squadron RAF's Fairey Battles, also on loan from the Bomber Service and based in Iceland. By 15 June a further 15 squadrons were to have been handed over to Coastal Command, this was only achieved by the loan of seven squadrons from other commands, despite express agreement by the Air Ministry and Admiralty. The daily operational strength of Coastal Command amounted to 298 aircraft, most unsuitable for maritime operations. Within a month, that had risen to 39 squadrons and 612 aircraft. However they were made of 11 different types, causing training and conversion problems.|$|E
