50|$|Although rhythm {{is not a}} {{prosodic}} {{variable in}} the way that pitch or loudness are, it is usual to treat a language's characteristic rhythm as a part of its prosodic phonology. It has often been asserted that languages exhibit regularity in the timing of successive units of speech, a regularity referred to as isochrony, and that every language may be assigned one of three rhythmical types: stress-timed (where <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> of <b>the</b> intervals between stressed syllables is relatively constant), syllable-timed (where <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> of successive syllables are relatively constant) and mora-timed (where <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> of successive morae are relatively constant).

40|$|On an {{adjusting}} {{schedule of}} reinforcement, a parameter of the schedule is varied {{as a function}} of some characteristic of the animal's performance. In Experiment I, the fixed-ratio response requirement was varied {{as a function of}} the time that elapsed before the animal started responding in each fixed-ratio (initial pause). When initial pauses were shorter than a specified <b>duration,</b> <b>the</b> response requirement was increased; when they were longer than <b>the</b> specified <b>duration,</b> <b>the</b> response requirement was decreased. Specified durations of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 min were studied.

In Experiment II, the fixed-ratio response requirement was constant, but reinforcement occurred only when the initial pause was longer than a specified <b>duration.</b> <b>The</b> average <b>durations</b> of initial pauses were directly related to the length of <b>the</b> specified <b>duration</b> and to <b>the</b> response requirement.
