It was not until President A. P. J.

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} verified {{the existence}} of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> was offset from the centre and tilted {{in a manner similar to}} the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and Voyager 2 also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Elmer Riggs {{published}} {{a study that}} described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the Grand River Valley near Fruita, Colorado, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age {{to those of the}} Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described Brontosaurus. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus ajax, Riggs realized that the holotype of A.ajax was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since Apatosaurus was the earlier name, Brontosaurus should be considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus. Because of this, Riggs recombined Brontosaurus excelsus as Apatosaurus excelsus. Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to Apatosaurus, Riggs also determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Field</b> Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to A.excelsus.|$|E

The qualifying tournament involved the 12 newly invited teams, as well as the four lowest-placed teams from the 2009 tournament; all teams who did not win a game. The qualifying tournament broke the teams into fourpools of fourteams each, which competed in a six-game, modified double-elimination format, similar to {{the first round of the}} 2009 tournament, with the winners of the sixth game in each pool proceeding to the main tournament. Australia, having finished 12th after beating Mexico in their first game in 2009, automatically qualified for the main tournament.|$|E
5|$|The club {{decided on}} 4 October 2013 to lay {{artificial}} turf on the field, which it {{hoped would be}} in place ahead of the 2014 season. The club was especially concerned with the poor surface during March, April, October and November. It also cited the possibility of hosting all trainings at the stadium and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> could be used 2,000 instead of 130 hours per year. The stadium hosted its second international match on 19 November 2013, when Norway was defeated 0–1 Scotland in a friendly match watched by 9,750 spectators. It {{was the first time}} since 2002 that a home Norway game was not played at the national stadium, Ullevaal Stadion.|$|E
5|$|The professionalization of {{the field}} began soon after, during the 1950s and 1960s. This move coincided with the {{replacement}} of coroners with medical examiners in many locations around the country. It was during this time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of forensic anthropology gained recognition as a separate field within the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the first forensic anthropology research facility and body farm was opened by William M. Bass. Public attention and interest in forensic anthropology began to increase around this time as forensic anthropologists started working on more high-profile cases. One of the major cases of the era involved anthropologist Charles Merbs who helped identify the victims murdered by Ed Gein.|$|E
40|$|A finite field K {{is said to}} be weak for {{elliptic}} curve cryptography if all instances of the discrete logarithm problem for all {{elliptic curve}}s over K can be solved in significantly less time than it takes Pollard 's rho method to solve the hardest instances. By considering the GHS Weil descent attack, it was previously shown that characteristic two finite fields F q 5 are weak. In this paper, we examine characteristic two finite fields Fq n for weakness under Hess' generalization of the GHS attack. We show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> F q 7 are potentially partially weak in <b>the</b> sense <b>that</b> any instance of the discrete logarithm problem for half of all elliptic curves over F q 7, namely those curves E for which #E(F q 7) is divisible by 4, can likely be solved in significantly less time than it takes Pollard's rho method to solve the hardest instances. We also show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> F q 3 are partially weak, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> F q 6 are potentially weak, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> F q 8 are potentially partially weak. Finally, we argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other <b>fields</b> F 2 N where N is not divisible by 3, 5, 6, 7 or 8, are not weak under Hess' generalized GHS attack...|$|R

5|$|Though Sanford {{enjoyed his}} time as Duke's president, he still harbored {{political}} ambitions. As the 1972 presidential primary season began, he was approached by several people who felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of Democratic candidates was weak. He was particularly keen to challenge Alabama governor George Wallace {{in an effort to}} show that Wallace's segregationist views did not represent majority Southern opinion. Announcing his candidacy on March 8, he faced long odds in a crowded field. Knowing that he could not win a majority of delegates in the primary, he hoped to secure enough to emerge as a compromise candidate in a deadlocked convention. Even in the North Carolina primary, however, Wallace beat Sanford by 100,000 votes, and Sanford managed only a fifth-place finish at the 1972 Democratic National Convention with 77.5 votes, behind George McGovern (1,864.95), Henry M. Jackson (525), Wallace (381.7), and Shirley Chisholm (151.95).|$|E
5|$|Playing in a torrential downpour, the Buccaneers {{scored the}} first shutout in {{franchise}} history to clinch their first playoff berth and the NFC Central title. The Chiefs were held to a franchise-low 80 yards of total offense. Despite the rain, Ricky Bell claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> had better traction than the dry field they had played on the week previously in San Francisco. Bell carried the ball 39 times for 137 yards in such bad weather that the game had to be played under lights. The Buccaneers lost four previous scoring opportunities to a fumble, two interceptions, and a fumbled snap on a field goal attempt. Shut out {{of the end zone}} on three tries with first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, the Buccaneers brought Neil O'Donoghue in to kick what would be the winning field goal with 8:50 remaining. Tampa Bay would hold the ball for all but four plays {{for the rest of the}} game. The Chiefs players gave the Buccaneers little credit after the victory, saying that the AFC was superior to the NFC and that the Buccaneers would never have won the AFC West.|$|E
