5|$|In this test, {{a number}} of cards are {{presented}} to <b>the</b> <b>participants.</b> The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one {{to one of the}} previous cards.

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} an online ADR (Alternative Disputation Resolution) System using {{a tool for}} generating facial expressions of animated agents. In this system, a participant of ADR disputes against an opponent through a computer network. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> agent searches similar cases of arguments and supports <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> by showing <b>the</b> similar cases. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> edits <b>the</b> next proposal by referring to the cases. And the agent learns <b>the</b> <b>participant’s</b> tendency to select facial expressions, based on an emotional model, and generates the facial expression. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> can reduce <b>the</b> cost of the dispute by using <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> agent...|$|R
50|$|During a whispered speech test, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> {{is asked}} to cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and say a series of words in a soft whisper. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> is then asked to repeat what is heard. If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> is unable to {{distinguish}} the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> is able {{to understand what is}} being said. The other ear is then tested.|$|R

30|$|The test {{requires}} <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> {{to reach}} forward beyond {{the length of}} his/her arm without loss of balance. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> was on two legs, positioned shoulder width apart (or seated if <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> could not stand). <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> was requested to lift one arm up to 90 °, forward flexion and extend fingers.

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, {{identifies}} friendship as the {{key factor}} behind {{the success of the}} two UNICEF shows, both in bringing all <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> together on the stage and in the affection with which the audience and music critics viewed the event.

5|$|John H. Flood Jr., Wyatt Earp's secretary, who he {{regarded}} like a son, drew {{a sketch of}} the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1926 under Wyatt's supervision.

40|$|Abstract. The present article {{described}} syntactic {{performance by}} an English/Swedish bilingual participant with Asperger syndrome. <b>The</b> <b>participant’s</b> syntactic performance was investigated {{by means of}} observing <b>the</b> <b>participant’s</b> status updates onFacebook, a social networking platform. Two observation sessions involved one week each, with the interval of six months between the sessions. It was theorised that <b>the</b> bilingual <b>participant’s</b> syntactic performance would be exacerbated by code-switching. <b>The</b> <b>participant’s</b> data were tagged in computer software CLAN. Results of the data analysis indicated that the hypothesis was not supported: <b>the</b> <b>participant’s</b> syntactic performance exhibited no presence of code-switching. Data analysis {{indicated that there was}} no significant difference in <b>the</b> <b>participant’s</b> syntactic performance in the period of six months...|$|R
5|$|On May 22, villagers {{returned}} to Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, {{which had been}} largely destroyed.

5|$|Spicer took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory.
