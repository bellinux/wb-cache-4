500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E

500|$|When The Fabulous Baker Boys was {{released}} in 1989, the idea of Pfeiffer portraying a sex worker who becomes a singer immediately garnered attention from the media. Pfeiffer's performance of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] was used heavily to promote the film; the attention garnered by this particular musical sequence rivaled those of every other film released that year. Pfeiffer continued to generate significant press even after the studio was forced to remove The Fabulous Baker Boys from most theaters to which it had initially been released due to financial concerns. In 1990, Empire magazine published an article entitled [...] "The Fabulous Pfeiffer Girl" [...] in homage to the actress' role. Ultimately, Pfeiffer's performance garnered widespread acclaim from nearly every critic who reviewed the film. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin wrote that [...] "Pfeiffer is [...] unexpected... choice for this musical bombshell" [...] but ultimately admitted that she [...] "proves to be electrifyingly right." [...] According to Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "Pfeiffer does as much for this movie as her Susie does for the Baker boys' act", praising all of her musical performances. Referencing one of her character's lines in which Susie negatively compares the song [...] "Feelings" [...] to parsley, Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers insisted, [...] "Michelle Pfeiffer... is not parsley. <b>Take</b> <b>her</b> <b>out</b> of this movie, and the movie would evaporate." [...] Travers credits the actress with resurrecting the film during its final moments, opining, [...] "The bounce goes out of the movie until Pfeiffer returns to wrap things up", concluding, [...] "the Bridges brothers are a winning pair. But make no mistake: It's Michelle Pfeiffer who puts the 'fabulous' into Baker Boys." [...] Steve Simels of Entertainment Weekly agreed that Pfeiffer [...] "saves Baker Boys from cliché", going on to hail the actress as [...] "a marvel... so funny and vulnerable that she almost makes her indifferently written bad-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold into something three-dimensional and believable." [...] Vanity Fairs Katey Rich concurred: [...] "The film is ostensibly about the Baker (and Bridges) boys, but Pfeiffer stole the show" [...] by [...] "endow her lounge-singer character {{with a lot more}} soul and vulnerability than she needed to." [...] Contributing to The Morton Report, Chaz Lipp agreed that [...] "Pfeiffer feels absolutely authentic in the role... put just the right spin on her line readings to sidestep cliche at every turn", appreciating the actress for interpreting Susie as more than simply a stock character. Despite lamenting that the three main actors [...] "become less interesting" [...] {{towards the end of the}} film, TV Guide agreed that although [...] "the Bridges boys give typically solid performances, it's Pfeiffer who deserves the most credit". The Independents David Thomson was particularly impressed with Pfeiffer's singing, opining, [...] "Anyone who can sing like that would be in Las Vegas, not holding together a piano act in the bars and clubs of Seattle". The Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum agreed, calling Pfeiffer [...] "a terrific singer." ...|$|E
