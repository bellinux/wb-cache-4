5|$|Monument23 {{was damaged}} in {{the mid-twentieth century}} by a local mason who {{attempted}} to break its exposed upper portion using a steel chisel. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> fragmented, although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place.|$|E
5|$|The New Creation– {{located at}} the rear of the church, it is based on the {{description}} in , with stained glass depictions of trees, mountains, and streams of Living Water. At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> a star morphing into a cross, with rays made of nuggets.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area. For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have {{made their way to}} the top of Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions. The view from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> one of the most extensive over the Lake District, and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{issued in}} 7/8 in heavy plate glass. In 1965, {{the thickness of}} <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> reduced to 3/4 in, and its base height was raised, increasing the table's total height from 15 in to 15.75 in.|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{photographic}} {{observations of}} four hail-producing storms are discussed. With {{the exception of}} one storm producing a tornadic event, <b>the</b> overshooting <b>tops</b> <b>were</b> nearly steady-state. <b>The</b> <b>tops</b> <b>were</b> consistently high and wide, reaching maximum heights within about 5 minutes of the initiation of hail. Measured updraft velocities in the turrets composing <b>the</b> overshooting <b>top</b> <b>were</b> 25 m/sec. <b>The</b> dimensions of <b>the</b> overshooting <b>tops</b> <b>were</b> sufficiently large to permit satellite observation...|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is {{the resurrection of the}} just and to the left is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E
50|$|Man at <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> <b>was</b> a British {{television}} series originally aired on ITV lasting for 23 episodes between 1970 and 1972. The series depicted {{the character of}} Joe Lampton, the protagonist of John Braine's novel Room at <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> and of two subsequent films, Room at <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> and Life at <b>the</b> <b>Top.</b> In 1973 a spin-off film from the series, Man at <b>the</b> <b>Top,</b> <b>was</b> released.|$|R

5|$|The slug-like larva of Phoronis ovalis swims {{for about}} 4 days, creeps on the sea-bed for 3 to 4 days, then bores into a {{carbonate}} floor. Nothing {{is known about}} three species. The remaining species develop free-swimming actinotroch larvae, which feed on plankton. The actinotroch is an upright cylinder with the anus {{at the bottom and}} fringed with cilia. At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> a lobe or hood, under which are: a ganglion, connected to a patch of cilia outside the apex of the hood; a pair of protonephridia (smaller and simpler than the metanephridia in the adult); the mouth; and feeding tentacles that encircle the mouth. After swimming for about 20 days, the actinotroch settles on the seabed and undergoes a catastrophic metamorphosis (radical change) in 30minutes: the hood and larval tentacles are absorbed and the adult lophophore is created round the mouth, and both now points upward; the gut develops a U-bend so that the anus is just under and outside the lophophore. Finally the adult phoronid builds a tube.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> heather-clad {{and carries}} {{a number of}} cairns. Bleaberry Fell's central {{position}} is rewarded by a fine all-round view, {{all of the major}} fell groups being visible. Derwentwater can be brought into sight by moving to the north-west cairn.|$|E
25|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> <b>is</b> an American sitcom {{starring}} Tim Curry, Annie Potts, and Steve Carell. The series premiered on ABC on October 21, 1997. Although 12 episodes were produced, {{the series}} was canceled after only three episodes had aired.|$|E
25|$|The Second to Fourth Generation Thunderbird {{convertibles}} {{were similar}} in design to the Lincoln convertible {{of the time and}} borrowed from earlier Ford hardtop/convertible designs. While these Thunderbird models had a true convertible soft <b>top,</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> lowered to stow in the forward trunk area. This design reduced available trunk space when <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> down.|$|R

25|$|Christopher Columbus, in {{his first}} trip, called the {{mountain}} Monte de Plata, observing that since <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> frequently foggy it had a silver-like appearance, hence {{the name of the}} port.

25|$|A {{pyramidal}} top, {{which in}} all cases is very much ruined, but which must have been originally up to 13 m. high, constructed in many small steps (rise and tread about equal at around 0.2-0.25 m.). <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>is</b> mostly solid masonry, but in those jedars that contain funerary chambers, removable steps on one side conceal a passage leading down into the chambers, the ceilings of which may protrude up into the top.|$|E
