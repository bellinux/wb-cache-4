Hypotheses about the channel's purposes included spy messages, contact by extraterrestrial life-forms, construction plans and a Cicada 3301 recruitment program. ===Unexplained references=== Despite Google having clarified the channel's purpose, this did not explain the seemingly humorous references contained in some of the videos. These include the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode, the Rick Astley silhouette, and the Eiffel Tower footage. In this last, Webdriver Torso at one time commented [...] "Matei is highly intelligent". The [...] "Matei" [...] in question is unknown, but Basarab Matei, Matei Mancas, Matei Gruber, and Matei Ciocarlie have all been suspected. The [...] "Matei" [...] comment was apparently removed at some later time. ==Solving the mystery== The channel was later revealed to be a quality <b>testing</b> <b>channel.</b> ===Soggetto Ventuno's discoveries=== An Italian blogger named [...] "Soggetto Ventuno" [...] discovered that Webdriver Torso belongs to a network of accounts called [...] "ytuploadtestpartner_torso". Ventuno then discovered some other accounts with similar videos, many of which were pulled or made private after Ventuno's investigations were published. The network linked to a Facebook page and a Twitter page, which have now both been taken down. The Facebook page had mentioned [...] "Johannes Leitner", a Google Zürich employee. Leitner was friends with another employee, [...] "Matei Gruber". [...] "Matei" [...] was mentioned on 00014 (see above). Ventuno then compared scenes from pulled videos with Google Zürich photos, and noticed matching things, indicating that the pulled videos were recorded at Google Zürich, and that the channel and all similar channels were run from Google Zürich. ===Purpose of videos=== The videos are made to test YouTube video quality. After creation, the videos are uploaded to YouTube. The uploaded videos are then compared to the videos before they were uploaded, to see how much quality was lost. ===YouTube's reply=== When YouTube was asked about Webdriver Torso, they replied: [...] "We're never gonna give you uploading that's slow or loses video quality, and we're never gonna let you down by playing YouTube in poor video quality. That's why we're always running tests like Webdriver Torso." [...] This is a reference to Rick Astley's song [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up". ==Easter eggs== [...] When [...] "Webdriver Torso" [...] is searched into Google or YouTube, the Google logo and YouTube and the search results will both look like a Webdriver Torso video. Another Easter egg is that in the Android L developer builds, the Android Version Easter Egg is a reference to Webdriver Torso videos. Similar channels such as Ekaterina Basic, Webdriver IVPE, and Webdriver YPP exist on YouTube as well.|$|E

The rate-distortion function for general discrete memoryless source was characterized by Heegard and Berger in 1985 [IT- 31 (6) ], who showed that a two-stage coding structure is in fact optimal. However, an explicit characterization of the rate-distortion function for DSBS, and more importantly the optimal forward <b>testing</b> <b>channel</b> structure for this source, was not found despite several attempts.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the large-coalition asymp-totics of various fingerprinting and group testing games, and derive explicit expressions for the capacities {{for each of these}} models. We do this both for simple decoders (fast but suboptimal) and for joint decoders (slow but optimal). For fingerprinting, we show that if the pirate strategy is known, the capacity often decreases linearly with the number of colluders, instead of quadratically as in the uninformed fingerprinting game. For many attacks the joint capacity is further shown to be strictly higher than the simple capacity. For group testing, we improve upon known results about the joint capacities, and derive new explicit asymptotics for the simple capacities. These show that existing simple group testing algorithms are suboptimal, and that simple decoders cannot asymptotically be as efficient as joint decoders. For the traditional group testing model, we show that the gap between the simple and joint capacities is a factor log 2 (e) ≈ 1. 44 for large numbers of defectives.

40|$|A central {{problem in}} the {{operation}} of large wireless networks is how to deal with interference [...] the unwanted signals being sent by transmitters that a receiver is not interested in. This thesis looks at ways of combating such interference. In Chapters 1 and 2, we outline the necessary information and communication theory background, including the concept of capacity. We also include an overview of a new set of schemes for dealing with interference known as interference alignment, paying special attention to a channel-state-based strategy called ergodic interference alignment. In Chapter 3, we consider the operation of large regular and random networks by treating interference as background noise. We consider the local performance of a single node, and the global performance of a very large network. In Chapter 4, we use ergodic interference alignment to derive the asymptotic sum-capacity of large random dense networks. These networks are derived from a physical model of node placement where signal strength decays over the distance between transmitters and receivers. (See also arXiv: 1002. 0235 and arXiv: 0907. 5165.) In Chapter 5, we look at methods of reducing the long time delays incurred by ergodic interference alignment. We analyse the tradeoff between reducing delay and lowering the communication rate. (See also arXiv: 1004. 0208.) In Chapter 6, we outline a problem that is equivalent to the problem of pooled group testing for defective items. We then present some new work that uses information theoretic techniques to attack group testing. We introduce {{for the first time the}} concept of the group <b>testing</b> <b>channel,</b> which allows for modelling of a wide range of statistical error models for testing.

40|$|Molecular {{communications}} {{is a novel}} communication {{technique that}} has many advantages over the traditional radio frequency technologies used in body area medical applications. It {{is based on the}} body`s own biological communication system. This makes this type of communication biocompatible, which is a huge advantage when the body is the environment. Heart diseases is an increasing problem in the society today. Pacemakers are one option to use for treatment of these type of diseases. The newest development is leadless pacemakers, which improve the performance significantly. Since the mortality of these diseases is high, the importance of having the best medical devices and communication technologies is vital. This report studies the combination of diffusion-based molecular communications and leadless pacemakers. We show that the definition of the concentration of the molecules in pheromone communications, can be transferred to the molecular communications used in pacemakers. A deterministic diffusion-based communication system with this concentration, is first proved a suitable model for the diffusion channel of the communication system. It is then shown that a stochastic Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) communication system with on-off keying as the encoder, a binary hypothesis <b>testing</b> <b>channel</b> and a simplified Neyman Pearson detector, gives good performance for the diffusion-based molecular communication between leadless pacemakers. The most important results leading to this conclusion, is a relatively high capacity of 0, 958 bits, a low average error probability (BER) of 0, 39 % and low levels of Intersymbol interference (ISI) with the optimal signaling interval of 150 seconds. A stochastic SIMO communication system with the same encoder, channel and decoder, but with Maximum Ratio Combining Diversity, is also evaluated as a suitable communication system for this problem. This approach gives a capacity of 0, 23 bits, an average error probability of 0, 74 % and low levels of ISI with the optimal signaling interval of 200 seconds. Therefore, the SIMO communication system achieves a lower capacity than the SISO communication system, but is optimal with higher signaling intervals. Last, it is shown that a MIMO communication system with the same encoder, channel and decoder, but with Spatial Multiplexing, is not an optimal alternative for the molecular communication between leadless pacemakers. The reason for this is the significantly lower capacity of 8, 47 *〖 10 〗^(- 7) bits, a high level of distortion where BER is 24, 41 % and a rate distortion that does not match the theory. Even though, the ISI levels are reasonable, it is not sufficient to declare this a suitable communication scheme for molecular communication between leadless pacemakers...|$|E
