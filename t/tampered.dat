The guns come in packs of three but the pack was broken up between three surgeries, one {{was given to}} Ted, another to George White (Dan Amboyer) who Megan has to perform emergency surgery on after finding him near-dead, and the third staple gun was not used. Megan finds traces of fungus found on bonsai trees on the staple guns and Megan realizes that Gwen has bonsai trees. When her son died, he was pledging for the fraternity where George is president. Gwen <b>tampered</b> with the staple guns to kill George, not realizing that the pack would be broken up. Ethan and Curtis find out that Jessica had a genetic mutation that caused a blood clot, so Ethan warns Karen that she might also have one. Megan confronts Gwen, who confesses to Megan. Gwen is eventually taken away by the police, after admitting to George's attempted, and Ted's accidental murder.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in software protection {{is the problem}} of <b>tampering</b> where an adversary modifies a program and uses {{it in a way that}} was not intended or desired. Several ad hoc techniques for software <b>tamper</b> resistance have been proposed, some of which provide a significant level of resilience against <b>tampering.</b> However, the literature lacks a formal definition of <b>tampering</b> that takes into account a model of the attacker’s goals. One effect of this lack is the inability of easily comparing the actual efficacy of proposed <b>tamper</b> resistance mechanisms and evaluating the practical limits of <b>tamper</b> resistance. This paper is a step towards addressing this shortcoming. We consider the two players: the defender who wishes to protect the program, and an adversary who wishes to modify the program as well as the assets embedded within the program to his advantage. We propose a way of expressing the intent of the defender and the attacker based on predicates defined over program traces. Based on these expressions, we present formal definitions for software <b>tamper</b> resistance, and software <b>tamper</b> verification. With a practical <b>tamper</b> verification scheme, we show how this formal model can be used in a reactive protection setting. ...|$|R

Following the contest, allegations emerged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had <b>tampered</b> with its feed of the broadcast to censor the Armenian entry, and that the Azeri government was interrogating citizens who voted for Armenia, accusing them of being unpatriotic and a threat to security.

40|$|AbstractA {{watermarking}} {{field is}} necessary to prove the copyright, ownership, authenticity and other related security aspects of the electronic data. Semi-Blind watermarking refers to need the watermark image during the extraction process. While, informed watermarking generates the watermark data from the original image itself. Moreover, <b>Tamper</b> detection is useful to discover the <b>tamper</b> zone in the image. In this paper, we propose a semi blind and informed watermarking approach. We build the watermark from the original image using Weber Law. Our approach aims to provide a high robustness and imperceptibility with perfectly <b>tamper</b> detection zone. We divide the original image into blocks and the main pixel is chosen for watermark insertion, where the embedding/extraction operates in the spatial domain. The <b>tamper</b> detection is tested by <b>tampering</b> watermarked image, and then based on the extracted attacked watermark; we can discover the <b>tamper</b> area. Also, the robustness watermarking aspect is proved against different kind of geometric and non-geometric attacks. Based on the experimental results, the imperceptibility and robustness of our watermarking approach are proven and showing perfectly the detection of the <b>tamper</b> zones...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Food <b>tampering</b> in foodservice facilities, {{especially}} with self-serve foods, {{can result in}} consumer illness or injury and adversely affect the foodservice organization. This study explored foodservice managers' awareness and perceptions of risk and evaluated a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) -based program of food <b>tampering</b> hazard reduction developed for managers. The study had two phases, descriptive and experimental. The purpose of phase one was to determine food <b>tampering</b> awareness and opinions, to obtain descriptive information about foodservice managers and their facilities, and to identify the population for phase two. The purpose of phase two was to evaluate an educational workbook, which had been developed by the researcher, using a post-test for the experimental and control samples. One thousand foodservice managers in commercial and non-commercial foodservices were contacted by mailed questionnaires in phase one; 376 continued on to phase two, one-half received both a food <b>tampering</b> risk reduction self-instructional workbook and a post-test; 238 completed the study. The post-test included a food <b>tampering</b> hazard inspection form used to evaluate facilities. The managers' changes in opinions and actions to reduce food <b>tampering</b> hazards and their understanding of a HACCP-based program were identified and comparisons made through chi square analyses. More non-commercial foodservice managers than commercial managers had college degrees, {{but there was no}} significant association between education level and food <b>tampering</b> concern. Managers with self-serve foods reported greater concern than those without; managers aware of food <b>tampering</b> reported greater concern. Managers who had received the self-instructional workbook had greater ability to identify food <b>tampering</b> hazards through floor plan evaluation. No significant changes in food <b>tampering</b> concern or intent to take action to reduce risk were found after the post-test. However, increased awareness led to a trend of increased concern. It was concluded that the questionnaire and post-test both had educational effects on the participants. The workbook and the inspection form are suggested as an educational program to increase awareness and concern for food <b>tampering</b> and the intent to reduce food <b>tampering</b> hazards by foodservice managers...|$|R
