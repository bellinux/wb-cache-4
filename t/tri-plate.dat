40|$|The primary {{objective}} was to compare microbiological results of the University of Minnesota <b>Tri-plate</b> and the 3 M Petrifilm Staph Express (STX) Count Plate to standard culture techniques for identification of clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The secondary {{objective was to}} evaluate the Tri-plate's ability to differentiate Streptococcus spp. from other gram-positive organisms. The tests were evaluated using clinically positive mastitic milk samples (n= 282) to determine their ability to diagnose the pathogens of interest. A <b>Tri-plate</b> was classified positive for Staph. aureus when at least 1 colony exhibiting β-hemolysis was present on the Factor media portion of the plate. When the plate {{was used in this}} manner and read by a trained laboratory technician, the sensitivity of the <b>Tri-plate</b> was 97. 9 % and the specificity was 81. 8 %. When the <b>Tri-plate</b> was evaluated by the laboratory technician for its ability to diagnose Streptococcus spp., both sensitivity and specificity of the test were very good (92. 6 and 89. 5 %, respectively). Using the Petrifilm, samples were classified as positive for Staph. aureus if any red-violet colonies were present on the Petrifilm after an initial 24 -h incubation. When used in this manner, the Petrifilm had a sensitivity of 97. 4 % and a specificity of 76. 1 %. Further evaluation of the Petrifilm was done using the STX disk, which was used to confirm the presence of Staph. aureus. When using the presence of 1 pink colony on the disk, the sensitivity of the Petrifilm was 92. 1 % and the specificity was 93. 1 %. Both the <b>Tri-plate</b> and the 3 M STX Petrifilm successfully diagnosed Staph. aureus in clinical milk samples when used in a laboratory setting and the <b>Tri-plate</b> successfully differentiated Streptococcus spp. from other gram-positive organisms...|$|E
40|$|Atlas is a pulsed-power {{facility}} {{under development}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory to drive high-energy density experiments. Design {{has been completed}} for this new generation pulsed-power machine consisting of an azimuthal array of 24, 240 -kV Marx modules and transmission lines supplying current to the load region at the machine center. The transmission line consists of a cable header, load protection switch, and <b>tri-plate</b> assembly interfacing to the center transition section. The cable header interface to the Marx module provides a mechanism to remove the Marx module for maintenance without removing other components of the transmission line. The load protection switch provides a mechanism for protecting the load during charging of the Marx {{in the event of}} a pre-fire condition. The aluminum <b>tri-plate</b> is a low-inductance transmission line carries radial current flow from the Marx energy storage system at the machine periphery toward the load. All transmission line components are oil insulated except the solid-dielectric insulated power flow channel connected directly to the load. The transition region at the machine center consists of several components that enable the radial converging vertical transmission lines to interface to a horizontal disk/conical power flow channel delivering current to the load. The current carrying transition components include the high-voltage and ground conductors interfacing to the <b>tri-plate</b> transmission lines. The <b>tri-plate</b> tank attachment ring interfaces to the <b>tri-plate</b> tanks and the base-plate. The base-plate supports the transition components and interfaces to the center support structure of the machine. The bottom insulator also attaches to the base-plate and to the high-voltage conductor, providing an oil containment seal between the transition and vacuum vessel. Design has been completed for all Atlas components. Some prototype hardware fabrication has been completed and first article hardware is in various stages of completion. The first article is a single line of the machine and includes a Marx module, cable header, load protection switch, <b>tri-plate</b> transmission line, and a dump load for testing. Testing is in progress on some prototype and first article components to verify performance before production begins on critical system components. Production will soon begin for much of the overall system, including the Marx tanks, <b>tri-plate</b> tanks, support structure, some transition components, and the personnel platform. These components will be fabricated and installed while the remaining internal components are being fabricated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{real-time}} seed-metering device performance detection {{is one of}} key {{techniques to}} ensure operation quality of a planter. A crossed E-shape plate capacitance sensor, a parallel-plate capacitance sensor and a differential <b>tri-plate</b> capacitance sensor, are proposed to test corn-seed flow. The detection concept and sensor structure parameters are presented. An adjustable stand is designed to investigate the impact of sensor structure and seed velocity on the outputs of capacitance sensors. The sensitivity and the feasibility of 3 sensors are studied by detecting capacitance variations at different corn-seed speeds. Experimental results show that, with average capacitance variation 0. 1245 pF and 0. 1115 pF, respectively, the crossed E-shape plate sensor and the differential <b>tri-plate</b> sensor are suitable to measure corn-seed metering device performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} currents induced in {{a network}} of thin conducting rods. The transfer functions of these currents were calculated with the NEC- 2 code and compared with measurements on the same structure in our <b>tri-plate</b> transmission-line simulator. Comparison shows fairly good agreement. At certain configurations of the rods the calculated current strongly relies on the selected subdivision of the bars, so that the NEC-code should not be applied in these cases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports a}} MEMS micro force sensor {{with a novel}} {{configuration}} of differential <b>tri-plate</b> comb drives suitable for bulk micromachining. A high-yield fabrication process using DRIE on SOI wafers is utilized to construct the high aspect ratio devices. The sensor has a high sensitivity, good linearity, and a large bandwidth, which are required for characterizing flight behavior of fruit flies (Drosophila). The technique allows for the instantaneous measurements of flight forces, which result {{from a combination of}} aerodynamic and inertial forces generated by the wings.

Dr. Randy Curry, Thesis SupervisorDissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Electrical engineering. M. S. University of Missouri [...] Columbia 2008. As part of the University Consortium for High Power Microwave (HPM) Integration, compact power conditioning and RF systems were investigated with a maximum diameter of 15. 24 cm. A simulator of a flux compression generator (FCG) was built as a non-destructive test stand to evaluate the power conditioning and RF systems. The FCG simulator approximated the rising current signal of an FCG with a peak between 20 kA and 60 kA. The power conditioning system consisted of a spiral-strip pulse transformer, an exploding wire fuse, and a crowbar switch. The pulse transformer enabled compact inductive energy storage, voltage step-up, and electrical isolation. The exploding wire fuse was implemented as an opening switch to transfer energy to the RF circuit, and extensive modeling of the dynamic fuse resistance was performed. The crowbar switch prevented stray circuit or generator inductance from causing fuse restrike. The RF system utilized a compact high voltage capacitor and low inductance shunt to produce high frequency RF as an alternative to HPM sources. Three geometries of the RF system were investigated with capacitances ranging from 275 pF to 730 pF. A <b>tri-plate</b> system was built as a proof of principle of operation of the RF system with the power conditioning components. Spiral-strip and coaxial-cylinder capacitor geometries were investigated as compact designs. Testing of the power conditioning and RF systems was conducted with the FCG simulator and FCGs. Voltages of 180 kV or more were generated with all three geometries, resulting in greater than 130 MW of peak power. The RF frequency content peaked at 10 s of MHz, and the frequency content of the <b>tri-plate</b> geometry extended to 250 MHz. In experiments with an antenna load, the peak voltage was greater than 700 kV. An electric field of 6 kV/m peak-to-peak was measured 5. 5 m from the RF system, thus achieving the final goal of the consortium...|$|E
40|$|The Atlas facility, {{now under}} {{construction}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), {{will provide a}} unique capability for performing high-energy-density experiments in support of weapon-physics and basic-research programs. It {{is intended to be}} an international user facility, providing opportunities for researchers from national laboratories and academic institutions around the world. Emphasizing institutions around the world. Emphasizing hydrodynamic experiments, Atlas will provide the capability for achieving steady shock pressures exceeding 10 -Mbar in a volume of several cubic centimeters. In addition, the kinetic energy associated with solid liner implosion velocities exceeding 12 km/s is sufficient to drive dense, hydrodynamic targets into the ionized regime, permitting the study of complex issues associated with strongly-coupled plasmas. The primary element of Atlas is a 23 -MJ capacitor bank, comprised of 96 separate Marx generators housed in 12 separate oil-filled tanks, surrounding a central target chamber. Each tank will house two, independently-removable maintenance units, with each maintenance unit consisting of four Marx modules. Each Marx module has four capacitors that can each be charged to a maximum of 60 kilovolts. When railgap switches are triggered, the marx modules erect to a maximum of 240 kV. The parallel discharge of these 96 Marx modules will deliver a 30 -MA current pulse with a 4 - 5 -{micro}s risetime to a cylindrical, imploding liner via 24 vertical, <b>tri-plate,</b> oil-insulated transmission lines. An experimental program for testing and certifying all Marx and transmission line components has been completed. A complete maintenance module and its associated transmission line (the First Article) are now under construction and testing. The current Atlas schedule calls for construction of the machine to be complete by August, 2000. Acceptance testing is scheduled to begin in November, 2000, leading to initial operations in January, 2001...|$|E
40|$|Z-Pinch Inertial Fusion Energy (Z-IFE) {{complements}} {{and extends}} the single-shot z-pinch fusion program on Z to a repetitive, high-yield, power plant scenario {{that can be}} used for the production of electricity, transmutation of nuclear waste, and hydrogen production, all with no CO{sub 2 } production and no long-lived radioactive nuclear waste. The Z-IFE concept uses a Linear Transformer Driver (LTD) accelerator, and a Recyclable Transmission Line (RTL) to connect the LTD driver to a high-yield fusion target inside a thick-liquid-wall power plant chamber. Results of RTL and LTD research are reported here, that include: (1) The key physics issues for RTLs involve the power flow at the high linear current densities that occur near the target (up to 5 MA/cm). These issues include surface heating, melting, ablation, plasma formation, electron flow, magnetic insulation, conductivity changes, magnetic field diffusion changes, possible ion flow, and RTL mass motion. These issues are studied theoretically, computationally (with the ALEGRA and LSP codes), and will work at 5 MA/cm or higher, with anode-cathode gaps as small as 2 mm. (2) An RTL misalignment sensitivity study has been performed using a 3 D circuit model. Results show very small load current variations for significant RTL misalignments. (3) The key structural issues for RTLs involve optimizing the RTL strength (varying shape, ribs, etc.) while minimizing the RTL mass. Optimization studies show RTL mass reductions by factors of three or more. (4) Fabrication and pressure testing of Z-PoP (Proof-of-Principle) size RTLs are successfully reported here. (5) Modeling of the effect of initial RTL imperfections on the buckling pressure has been performed. Results show that the curved RTL offers a much greater buckling pressure as well as less sensitivity to imperfections than three other RTL designs. (6) Repetitive operation of a 0. 5 MA, 100 kV, 100 ns, LTD cavity with gas purging between shots and automated operation is demonstrated at the SNL Z-IFE LTD laboratory with rep-rates up to 10. 3 seconds between shots (this is essentially at the goal of 10 seconds for Z-IFE). (7) A single LTD switch at Tomsk was fired repetitively every 12 seconds for 36, 000 shots with no failures. (8) Five 1. 0 MA, 100 kV, 100 ns, LTD cavities have been combined into a voltage adder configuration with a test load to successfully study the system operation. (9) The combination of multiple LTD coaxial lines into a <b>tri-plate</b> transmission line is examined. The 3 D Quicksilver code is used to study the electron flow losses produced near the magnetic nulls that occur where coax LTD lines are added together. (10) Circuit model codes are used to model the complete power flow circuit with an inductive isolator cavity. (11) LTD architectures are presented for drivers for Z-IFE and high yield. A 60 MA LTD driver and a 90 MA LTD driver are proposed. Present results from all of these power flow studies validate the whole LTD/RTL concept for single-shot ICF high yield, and for repetitive-shot IFE...|$|E
