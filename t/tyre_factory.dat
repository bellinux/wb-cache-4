5|$|Playford also {{successfully}} coaxed Chrysler {{to stay in}} Adelaide {{and expand}} its operations. The Housing Trust sold the Tonsley Park where the car manufacturing plant was set up, and helped to install railyards, electricity and water infrastructure there, as it had done at Elizabeth. By the time Playford left office, Holden and Chrysler employed around 11,000 workers, 11% of the state's manufacturing employees. After earlier failed attempts to bring a <b>tyre</b> <b>factory</b> to Adelaide, the plans to build the Port Stanvac oil refinery—which would produce hydrocarbons used in synthetic rubber—in the early 1960s were enough to convince both a Dunlop Rubber-Olympic joint venture and SA Rubber Mills (later Bridgestone Australia) to start manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|While passing {{near the}} British Isles on September6 as an extratropical storm, Danielle {{produced}} severe sea {{conditions on the}} western part of the isles. Major beach erosion was observed, and many people required rescuing. Coastal portions of Cornwall were evacuated as high waves inundated many homes, and an all-terrain police vehicle was shoved into the sea by a rogue wave in the Isles of Scilly. An 11‑year-old boy and his father were trapped in a sea cave on the north coast of Cornwall due to rough surf. Two other men from Port Isaac also became isolated in the same location after their boat capsized. All four were eventually rescued by a helicopter that hovered near the entrance of the sea cave. At the West Sands Caravan Park near Selsey, West Sussex, twelve families were evacuated to higher ground. A yacht filled with eight people ran aground near Calshot; they required rescuing by the Solent Coastguards. Flash flooding was reported throughout Wiltshire, especially in the city of Melksham. Numerous motorists were left stranded in inundated streets, while water entered several homes, store basements, a fire station, and the Cooper Avon <b>Tyre</b> <b>Factory.</b>|$|E

25|$|Castle Bromwich, {{which grew}} into a new town, was {{developed}} approximately six {{miles to the east}} of the town centre during the 1960s. Castle Vale, near the Fort Dunlop <b>tyre</b> <b>factory</b> to the north-east of the city centre, was developed in the 1960s as Britain's largest postwar housing estate; featuring a total of 34 tower blocks, although 32 of them had been demolished by the end of 2003 as part of a massive regeneration of the estate brought on by the general unpopularity and defects associated with such developments.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 23/24 August over 200 bombers {{attacked}} the Fort Dunlop <b>tyre</b> <b>factory</b> in Birmingham, with {{a significant effect on}} production. A sustained bombing campaign began on 24 August with the largest raid so far, killing 100 in Portsmouth, and that night, several areas of London were bombed; the East End was set ablaze and bombs landed on central London. Some historians believe that these bombs were dropped accidentally by a group of Heinkel He 111s which had failed to find their target; this account has been contested.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of the Firestone (now Bridgestone) <b>tyre</b> <b>factory,</b> in Langdons Road, was commenced on land, some {{of which was a}} 5-acre orchard purchased from the Cone family, in 1945. Firestone produced New Zealand's first pneumatic tyre in 1948. This factory remained the only tyre manufacturer in the South Island.On 23 October 2009, it was announced that Bridgestone's Australia and New Zealand manufacturing operations were to close.

500|$|The Russian market, Nokian Tyres' largest, contributed 34% of the {{net sales}} and {{captured}} 26% of the Russian winter tyre market. CEO Kim Gran describes the Russian consumer as having a [...] "love affair" [...] with the Nokian brand citing that it stems from tyres which fits the local weather conditions and a genuine need in the market. The use of winter tyres, which has softer rubber compounds than all-season tyres, results in improved starting, stopping, and steering performance. The Hakkapeliitta brand was, at one time, the only Western tyre brand in Russia having entered the market during the Soviet era in 1964. In contrast to having a Russian <b>tyre</b> <b>factory</b> to benefit from lower tariffs, another tyre company, Continental AG, abandoned Russian tyre production and hopes for Russian membership in the World Trade Organisation will result in lower import tariffs.|$|E
2500|$|Bridgestone Australia {{began as}} the SA Rubber Mills in 1939. [...] In 1980 Bridgestone {{took over the}} Australian plants which were at that time {{operated}} by the Uniroyal Tyre Company.

5000|$|Eric Gough was an {{automotive}} engineer {{and worked at}} Fort Dunlop, the Dunlop <b>Tyres</b> <b>factory</b> in Birmingham, England. He developed his [...] "Universal Tyre-Testing Machine" [...] (also called the [...] "Universal Rig") in the 1950s and his platform was operational by 1954. The rig was able to mechanically test tyres under combined loads. Dr. Gough died in 1972 but his testing rig continued to be used up until the late 1980s when the factory was closed down and then demolished. His rig was saved and transported to the Science Museum (London) storage facility at Wroughton near Swindon.|$|R

White City was made a regular suburban station in December 1949. The station only ever had one platform, on the westbound track, even though fifty services a week stopped there at its peak. Due to its proximity to Tottenham station, White City's signals were operated from there.|$|R
2500|$|Therapy? {{released}} its first single, called Meat Abstract in July 1990. The single {{was limited to}} 1000 copies, and released on the bands' own Multifuckinational Records. During the summer of that year, the band made its first tour through the United Kingdom with The Beyond, catching the attention of influential DJ John Peel along the way. The band's early years followed the familiar pattern of hard graft on the local alternative music scene, with Cairns often putting in a full day at the Michelin <b>tyre</b> <b>factory</b> (where {{he worked as a}} quality controller), then speeding across Northern Ireland {{in order to make it}} to gigs. The band also took whatever support slot they could, opening for the likes of Loop, Ride, Teenage Fanclub, Inspiral Carpets, Tad, Fugazi and Ned's Atomic Dustbin. Therapy? quickly came to the attention of local music fans with their distinctively uncompromising style. Their use of guitar feedback as a [...] "fourth instrument" [...] and unconventional song structures, combined with a darkly original approach to lyrics and imaginative use of samples pulled from cult movies and obscure documentaries, led them to be spotted in 1990 by London-based independent label Wiiija Records. The move was helped by Lesley Rankine of Silverfish, who passed the band's first single on to Gary Walker of Wiiija.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1943, {{leadership}} of the FTP-MOI was assumed by an Armenian immigrant Missak Manouchian, who become so famous for organizing assassinations that the FTP-MOI {{came to be known}} to the French people as the Groupe Manouchian. In July 1943, the Royal Air Force attempted to bomb the Peugeot works at Sochaux, which manufactured tank turrets and engine parts for the Werhmacht. The RAF missed the Peugeot works and instead hit the neighborhood next to the factory, killing hundreds of French civilians. To avoid a repeat, the SOE agent Harry Rée contacted the industrialist Rudolphe Peugeot {{to see if he was}} willing to sabotage his own factory. To prove that he was working for London, Rée informed Peugeot that the BBC's French language [...] "personal messages" [...] service would broadcast a message containing lines from a poem that Rée had quoted that night, and after hearing the poem in the BBC broadcast, Peugeot agreed to co-operate. Peugeot gave Rée the plans for the factory and suggested the best places to sabotage his factory without killing or injuring anyone by selectively placing plastic explosives. As a result, the Peugeot works were largely knocked out in a bombing organised by Rée on 5 November 1943 and output never recovered. The Michelin family were approached with the same offer and declined. As a result, the RAF was called in and bombed the Michelin factory at Clermont-Ferrand – which was France's largest <b>tyre</b> <b>factory</b> and a major source of tyres for the Wehrmacht – into the ground.|$|E

They were architect-designed and followed the Art Deco architecture style that was prevalent at the time of building. The premises in Queen Street, Derby were the subject of a special ceremony when they opened in 1930.
