40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) is the prime but not exclusive determinant of genetically specific constitutive body odors, termed odor types, represented strongly in <b>urine</b> of <b>the</b> mouse. Perception of MHC-determined odor types influences reproductive behavior in the contexts of mate choice and maintenance of early pregnancy, tending to favor the propagation of one MHC type over another. How MHC genotype determines MHC odor type is unknown. One {{possible explanation is that}} differential odorants are generated by populations of commensal microorganisms whose composition is somehow geared to MHC diversity. This hypothesis was tested in the Y-maze system in which mice are trained to distinguish the urinary odors of MHC-congenic mice. First, it was shown that mice could readily be trained to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>urines</b> of germfree MHC-congenic mice. Second, it was shown that mice trained to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>urines</b> of conventionally maintained MHC-congenic mice could as readily distinguish <b>the</b> <b>urines</b> of germfree MHC-congenic mice. These results imply that MHC-determined odor types do not depend on odorants generated by microorganisms...|$|R

40|$|To prove {{and prevent}} the abusing of drugs, {{compulsory}} urine sampling and its scientific analysis is necessary. The problems concerning this matter are, compulsory urine sampling is admissible or not, {{and if it is}} admissible what kind of warrant is needed for that. There is an opinion denying <b>the</b> compulsory <b>urine</b> sampling, for <b>the</b> reason that <b>the</b> compulsory <b>urine</b> sampling gives <b>the</b> suspect physical and mental shock and it infringe the human dignity. But the general opinion and cases admit it under the conditions of the importance of crime, certainty of suspicion, importance as a evidence, reasonability of method. <b>The</b> compulsory <b>urine</b> extraction is a kind of compulsory investigation which needs a warrant from a judge in principle. But current criminal procedure law does not clearly stipulate the compulsory investigation methods for <b>the</b> compulsory <b>urine</b> sampling. <b>The</b> compulsory <b>urine</b> extraction is <b>the</b> activity of investigators to achieve the evidence, so {{it is a kind of}} search and seizure.

Therefore both of the search and seizure warrant and expert estimation warrant are needed for <b>the</b> compulsory <b>urine</b> sampling, I think.

5|$|Lactarius deterrimus is an edible mushroom, but is {{much less}} {{appreciated}} than the similar L.deliciosus. The first tastes slightly bitter and is often infested by maggots. Like L.deliciosus, this fungus is mainly stir-fried in butter or oil; if it is cooked in water, the flesh becomes very soft. Young fruit bodies can be also pickled, or dried for later use. As the fungus is often heavily infested by maggots, skilled mushroom pickers prefer young fruit bodies. <b>The</b> <b>urine</b> discolours to red if {{a large amount of}} milk caps are eaten, but this is entirely harmless and is not evidence for an impairment to health.

5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in <b>the</b> <b>urine.</b> Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into <b>the</b> <b>urine,</b> and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is reabsorbed to {{maintain}} extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed {{to maintain}} serum potassium concentration within narrow limits. Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. Potassium must be conserved also, but, because {{the amount of}} potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water {{at the end of the}} processing. Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.|$|E

5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning.

Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in <b>the</b> <b>urine,</b> excess proteins in <b>the</b> <b>urine,</b> lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure.

5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in <b>the</b> <b>urine</b> of the consumer.
