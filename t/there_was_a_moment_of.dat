5|$|The Chicago Blackhawks NHL {{franchise}} wore NIU Huskies decals {{on their}} helmets during their game on Sunday, February 17, 2008, versus the Colorado Avalanche. A {{moment of silence}} was also observed before the national anthem at the game, and the team wore the same decal during its next two games at the St. Louis Blues and at home against the Minnesota Wild. The Chicago Wolves of the AHL held an NIU night during which <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> silence and NIU students were {{given the opportunity to}} participate during in game promotions.

5|$|When Deep Purple's first line-up came {{together}} in 1967, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, {{in line with the}} hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.|$|E

25|$|The first Test was delayed, at the {{instigation}} of the SCG {{to allow}} time for Ranjitsinhji {{to recover from}} tonsillitis and because Andrew Stoddart's mother had died. In the event, Stoddart did not play, but Ranjitsinhji did, although he did drop down to seventh in the batting order. England were captained by Archie MacLaren for the first time. The Test was dominated by an innings of 175 by Ranjitsinhji. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> controversy when Australian batsman Charlie McLeod was run out by Bill Storer when he left his crease after being bowled by a no-ball, when his deafness prevented him from hearing the umpire's call. England won comfortably by 9 wickets.|$|E
25|$|Ip Man 2 was {{released}} in select Asian countries and in Australia on 29 April 2010. Prior to its release, Mandarin Films publicly launched the film's official website in Beijing on 6 April 2010. The film held a premiere press conference in Beijing on 21 April 2010, only seven days after the 2010 Yushu earthquake. Guests were asked to wear dark-colored clothing in show of mourning; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> silence {{for the victims of}} the disaster. The film's cast, Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung, Huang Xiaoming, Lynn Hung, and Kent Cheng attended the premiere, and donated a total of ¥500,000 (US$73,200) to relief efforts helping in the disaster recovery. The film held private screenings in Chengdu on 21 April 2010, and in China on 27 April 2010, receiving positive reactions from audiences.

25|$|Benaud, who {{had gone}} in as nightwatchman, {{did not last long}} the next morning, but Simpson and O'Neill took the score to 154 before the former was third out for 91. So with seven wickets left, Australia only needed another 104. But wickets now fell steadily, {{including}} O'Neill for 48, Harvey and Davidson, all three dismissed by Worrell. When Burge was seventh out to Valentine for 53, Australia still needed another 8 runs to win. With four runs required, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> controversy. Grout late cut Valentine for two runs, but the off bail had fallen to the ground. The umpires consulted, but ruled that the batsman was not out. Thus Australia were 256-7 instead of 254-8. Valentine had Grout's wicket without further addition to the score: 256-8. Still without addition, an easy chance given by Martin was missed, the batsmen taking a single to bring the scores level. Australia then edged home by two wickets, the winning run being a bye. Australia had scored at only 29 runs per 100 balls. At the death, Mackay scored his 3 not out off 51 balls. Worrell bowled 31 8-ball overs in conceding only 43 runs for his 3 wickets, and Gibbs bowled 41 overs in taking 2/68. Valentine took 3/60 in 21.7 overs.|$|E

500|$|Mikan's {{death was}} widely mourned by the {{basketball}} world, and also brought media {{attention to the}} financial struggles of several early-era NBA players. Many [...] felt that the current players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations. Shaquille O'Neal paid for Mikan's funeral. He said: [...] "Without number 99 , there is no me." [...] Before Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between the Heat and the Detroit Pistons, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> silence to honor Mikan. Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA {{in the early days}} and single-handedly made the league credible and popular. The 2005 NBA Finals between the Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs was dedicated to Mikan.|$|E

500|$|The Trojans did {{not escape}} injuries, as linebacker Clay Matthews, substituting for the {{recovering}} Brian Cushing, broke his thumb, causing Cushing {{to enter the}} game as his replacement. [...] The Trojans also suffered twoinjuries on kick returns: fullback Alfred Rowe suffered a mild concussion, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> worry when returner Vincent Joseph, after being tackled and fumbling the ball, lay on the turf for over 10minutes before being removed by stretcher with a bruised larynx and a neck sprain, but no serious injuries. Linebacker Rey Maualuga was flagged during a field goal attempt for the rarely called penalty of [...] "disconcerting", which is given for [...] "words or signals that disconcert opponents when they are preparing to put the ball in play".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} quarter, quarterback Doc Kuhn {{completed}} a 45-yard pass to end Hek Wakefield, caught at Georgia's 4-yard line. From there Vandy scored {{with a line}} buck from Ryan. Later in the third quarter, Gil Reese ran for 30 yards on a sneak play. [...] It [...] "not only fooled the Bulldogs but everyone in the stands." [...] It seems <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> not knowing where the ball was, until Reese shot {{out the other side}} of the line.

He recalled that students present at the event spent the money of Cassa del circolo giovanile to buy champagne and toast with workers of the canteen.|$|E
2500|$|The Chiefs had a 1–10 {{record at}} the time of the shootings, the worst record in the NFL in 2012. No Chiefs team had ever won just one game in a season, and fans had formed the [...] "Save Our Chiefs" [...] organization. They wore black to games to protest and hired an {{airplane}} to fly over Arrowhead Stadium on game days towing a banner that read, [...] "Restore Hope: Fire Pioli." [...] The Chiefs had a game scheduled at Arrowhead against the also-struggling Carolina Panthers the day after the murder-suicide. The game went on as scheduled, following discussions between the NFL, Crennel, and the Chiefs' team captains. No aircraft carrying the Pioli banners flew overhead, and no formal mention was made of the shooting at the game, although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> silence for [...] "victims of domestic violence and their families". The Chiefs defeated the Panthers 27–21.|$|E
2500|$|Casting for {{the lead}} {{characters}} of NBC police procedural television drama series [...] occurred {{in the spring of}} 1999.

For the female lead – Detective Olivia Benson – Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Hargitay were being considered. For the male role – Detective Elliot Stabler – the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, and Christopher Meloni. Meloni and Hargitay had auditioned in the final round together and after the actors left, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, [...] "Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose – Hargitay and Meloni." [...] The duo, who Wolf believed had the perfect chemistry from {{the first time he saw}} them together, were his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled voiced their assent. Hargitay trained as a rape crisis advocate to prepare for the role of Benson.|$|E

[...] "Only over my dead body will you pass through here! Over my corpse!" [...] One rioter wielded his knife over Abu-Shaker and yelled. 'I will kill you, traitor|!" [...] The knife struck him. Abu-Shaker's leg was cut. His blood was spilt. He did not emit any groans of pain. He did not shout, he only said.'Go and cut! I am not moving!" [...] The rioters consulted with each other: <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> silence. Later we heard them leaving. We knew we had been saved. We wanted to bring our savior inside and bandage his wound and thank him. He refused and said that others might arrived and that his task has not ended yet." ...|$|E
