5|$|The work's moralising tone is {{apparent}} {{from some of}} its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath {{the weight of the}} damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In <b>these</b> <b>ways</b> it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{understood}} that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At {{the beginning of the}} war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in <b>these</b> <b>ways</b> would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, {{on the grounds that it}} was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{periphery}} countries are able to escape their poor status. Some of <b>these</b> <b>ways</b> are stabilizing their governments, becoming more industrialized and using natural resources to benefit themselves rather than core countries, and creating a better education system.

25|$|Because English stops /p, t, k/ {{primarily}} have aspiration, {{speakers of}} English often hear the Māori nonaspirated stops as English /b, d, g/. However, younger Māori speakers tend to aspirate /p, t, k/ as in English. English speakers {{also tend to}} hear Māori /r/ as English /l/ in certain positions (cf. Japanese r). <b>These</b> <b>ways</b> of hearing {{have given rise to}} place-name spellings which are incorrect in Māori, like Tolaga Bay in the North Island and Otago and Waihola in the South Island.|$|E

25|$|Many {{forms of}} amnesia fix {{themselves}} without being treated. However, {{there are a}} few ways to cope with memory loss if that is not the case. One of <b>these</b> <b>ways</b> is cognitive or occupational therapy. In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills they have and try to regain some they have lost by finding which techniques help retrieve memories or create new retrieval paths. This may also include strategies for organizing information to remember it more easily and for improving understanding of lengthy conversation.|$|E
25|$|Beith was {{intermittently}} {{involved with}} the cinema. While in the US in 1917 he had served as technical adviser to Cecil B. DeMille on the film The Little American. Between the wars he wrote or co-wrote original screenplays, such as Keep Your Seats, Please (1936); and adapted his own and other authors' works for the screen, including Tommy Atkins (1928), and The 39 Steps (1935). For several more films of the period, Beith's original plays such as The Middle Watch (1930) were adapted by other writers. In all, Beith's work featured in one of <b>these</b> <b>ways</b> in 25 films between 1921 and 1940.|$|E

Products, such as fish oil and spirulina tablets are also extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is feed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).|$|E

25|$|Dump valves {{are used}} to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both <b>these</b> <b>ways.</b> One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded valve. The dump valve may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.|$|E
25|$|The bowler is {{credited}} in the statistics with having taken a wicket if the batsman is out bowled, LBW, caught, stumped, or hit wicket. If {{the ball is}} a no ball then the batsman cannot be out in any of <b>these</b> <b>ways.</b> The bowler is not credited with having taken a wicket if the batsman is run out, hits the ball twice, or obstructs the field; these dismissals may occur even when the delivery is a no ball. The fieldsman {{is credited}} in the statistics with a dismissal if he takes a catch or a stumping (for a stumping this will necessarily be the wicket-keeper), and may be credited on scorecards for a run-out (although a run-out will not be credited to a player's statistics).|$|E
25|$|In all of <b>these</b> <b>ways,</b> TSA is {{very similar}} to a more {{commonly}} known language disorder, receptive aphasia. However, transcortical sensory aphasia differs from receptive aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition and exhibit echolalia, or the compulsive repetition of words. Transcortical sensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed through brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as the results are often difficult to interpret. Therefore, clinicians rely on language assessments and observations to determine if a patient presents with the characteristics of TSA. Patients diagnosed with TSA have shown partial recovery of speech and comprehension after beginning speech therapy. Speech therapy methods for patients with any subtype of aphasia are based on the principles of learning and neuroplasticity. Clinical research on TSA is limited because it occurs so infrequently in patients with aphasia that {{it is very difficult to}} perform systematic studies.|$|E

25|$|Computers {{have been}} playing an {{increasing}} role in PA for some time (Sulsky & Keown, 1998). There are two main aspects to this. The first is {{in relation to the}} electronic monitoring of performance, which affords the ability to record a huge amount of data on multiple dimensions of work performance (Stanton, 2000). Not only does it facilitate a more continuous and detailed collection of performance data in some jobs, e.g. call centres, but it has the capacity to do so in a non-obvious, covert manner. The second aspect is in mediating the feedback process, by recording and aggregating performance ratings and written observations and making the information available on-line; many software packages are available for this. The use of IT in <b>these</b> <b>ways</b> undoubtedly helps in making the appraisal process more manageable, especially where multiple rating sources are involved, but it also raises many questions about appraisees' reactions and possible effects on PA outcomes. Mostly, the evidence so far is positive.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{ingredients}} are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, {{such as the}} Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be {{different from what they}} order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles would have a better effect. Alternately, the player may {{be able to make a}} character happy by talking to them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In <b>these</b> <b>ways,</b> the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.|$|E
25|$|One such {{therapy is}} trauma-focused therapy. This therapy {{involves}} bringing {{the most disturbing}} elements of a traumatic memory to mind and using therapist-guided cognitive restructuring {{to change the way}} the memories are thought about. The change in evaluation usually involves highlighting that the feelings of certain death, extreme danger, hopelessness and helplessness within a traumatic memory do not apply to the person now, as they survived the event. The therapy also focuses on extending the memory so it is recalled beyond the most traumatic parts. Extending them to a point where the person felt safe again, so they remember the event in a more complete way with less focus on the negative aspects. As an example, a traumatic memory of wartime combat might be extended to after a battle, to when the person was no longer in immediate danger. In processing the memory in <b>these</b> <b>ways</b> it becomes less likely to intrude into their thoughts as an unwanted flashback.|$|E
