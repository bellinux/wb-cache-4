5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include glyphosate, <b>triclopyr</b> and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.|$|E
25|$|Initially, beach vitex stems are wounded using a machete. A 5.25% {{solution}} of imazapyr {{is applied to}} the wounded areas of the stems. After a period of 6 months, all stems are removed. This treatment procedure is repeated until zero regrowth is observed. <b>Triclopyr</b> may be used to treat small resprouts and seedlings.|$|E
25|$|A {{systemic}} herbicide, for example, glyphosate, <b>triclopyr,</b> or picloram, can {{be applied}} directly on cut stems, which is {{an effective means of}} transporting the herbicide into the kudzu's extensive root system. Herbicides can be used after other methods of control, such as mowing, grazing, or burning, which can allow for an easier application of the chemical to the weakened plants. In large-scale forestry infestations, soil-active herbicides {{have been shown to be}} highly effective.|$|E
25|$|A different, and {{sometimes}} less time consuming {{option for the}} control of kudzu is chemical treatment with herbicides. Some common herbicides used are Tordon and <b>Triclopyr</b> and the most effective are Picloram and Tebuthiuron. However, chemical treatments are expensive, and killing off the plant completely requires large amounts of herbicides (40-80 gallons per acre). Herbicides {{are found to be}} most effective when they are used during the typical growing season, June–October, and when used for successive years. One case study saw a significant decrease in the growth of kudzu after just two years, whereas another study required the use of the herbicide for up to ten years.|$|E
50|$|A 3% {{solution}} of glyphosate or <b>triclopyr</b> ester, or 4% <b>triclopyr</b> amine, {{has been shown}} effective in management of Christmas berry. However, the effect of glyphosate is non-specific, so {{the effects of the}} spray on the environment must be monitored. 2,4-D weakness is also exhibited, with even greater susceptibility during seedling or regrowth stages than during maturity. <b>Triclopyr</b> herbicide is most effective at maturity. A basal bark application of 18% v/v {{solution of}} Remedy or Garlon 4 is an effective suppressant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclopyr</b> {{breaks down}} in soil with a {{half-life}} of between 30 and 90 days. One of the byproducts of breakdown, trichloropyridinol, {{remains in the}} soil {{for up to a}} year. <b>Triclopyr</b> degrades rapidly in water. It remains active in decaying vegetation for about 3 months.|$|E
5000|$|Buddenhagen et al. 2004 {{analyzed}} data using {{six different}} herbicide methods from 1999-2002 {{with a different}} trial each year: picloram salt, <b>triclopyr</b> ester, <b>triclopyr</b> salt, glyphosate, diesel fuel, and picloram and metsulfuron. The herbicide was sprayed onto the trees where they were hacked with machetes. In the first trial, <b>triclopyr</b> ester could control C. pubescens with 77% chance of the trees dying. In the second trial, a picloram and metsulfuron solution was 100% successful in concentrations greater than 4% solution. In the third trial, picloram- metsulfuron solution of 10% concentrations or higher was successful in eradicating the tree.|$|E

50|$|<b>Triclopyr</b> is {{effective}} on woody plants {{and is used}} for brush control in rights of way and defoliation of wooded areas. In the USA it is sold under the trade names Garlon and Release, and in the UK as SBK Brushwood Killer.|$|E
50|$|Two {{herbicides}} {{are approved}} {{for use in}} the United States to exterminate Brazilian pepper: <b>Triclopyr,</b> using the basal bark method; and glyphosate. Picloram can be used if the stump has been freshly cut, {{but this is not the}} preferred nor most effective means of eradication.|$|E

50|$|<b>Triclopyr</b> is {{formulated}} {{both as an}} ester and as an amine salt. The usual tradeoffs regarding effectiveness, drift, and toxicity {{to humans}} apply to these two formulations. It is chemically {{very similar to the}} herbicide which it generally replaces, 2,4,5-T, which was phased out in the U.S. in the 1970s amid toxicity concerns.|$|E
50|$|The basal bark {{treatment}} {{consists of}} application of herbicide to all basal {{parts of the}} plant below 12-15 inches. The bark must be thoroughly wet with herbicide for this treatment to be most effective. The USDA suggests that 25% <b>triclopyr</b> and 75% horticultural oil {{is the most effective}} herbicide composition for basal bark treatments.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the United States Department of Agriculture {{halted the}} use of 2,4,5-T on all food crops except rice, and in 1985, the EPA {{terminated}} all remaining uses in the U.S. of this herbicide. The international trade of 2,4,5-T is restricted by the Rotterdam Convention. 2,4,5-T has since largely been replaced by dicamba and <b>triclopyr.</b>|$|E
50|$|These {{plants are}} {{extremely}} difficult to kill and eradicate. It can be controlled by <b>Triclopyr</b> or biological control with the leaf-feeding flea-beetle, Phenrica guérini, which has caused significant damage to Pereskia plants at Port Alfred, Eastern Cape, South Africa, but although the beetle was also released widely in KwaZulu-Natal, it has not become established there.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the timing}} of {{application}} {{may play a role}} in the effectiveness of the herbicide, as well as the perception of effectiveness. For instance, fall is usually the best time for use of broadleaf herbicides; however, a slow-acting herbicide like <b>triclopyr</b> applied in the fall may not appear to have been effective until the next growing season.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclopyr</b> {{is highly}} selective, it only affects {{actively}} photosynthesising monocots, leaving grass, and flowering dicots such as narcissus and bluebell bulbs, undamaged. It also breaks down harmlessly {{in the soil}} within about six weeks leaving no toxic residuals. Glyphosate is also effective but must be used with much greater care and will damage other woodland plants.|$|E
5000|$|Aminopyralid [...] is a {{selective}} herbicide used {{for control of}} broadleaf weeds, especially thistles and clovers. It is in the picolinic acid family of herbicides, which also includes clopyralid, picloram, <b>triclopyr,</b> and several less common herbicides. [...] It was first registered for use in 2005, in the USA under the brand name [...] "Milestone". and in the UK under the brand names Banish, Forefront, Halcyon, Pharaoh, Pro-Banish, Runway, Synero, and Upfront.|$|E
50|$|To {{minimize}} {{the effects of}} Oriental bittersweet’s invasion into North American habitats, its growth and dispersal must be tightly managed. Early detection is essential for successful conservation efforts. To reduce further growth and dispersal, above-ground vegetation is cut and any foliage is sprayed with <b>triclopyr,</b> a common herbicide. Glyphosate is another chemical method of control. These two herbicides are usually sprayed directly on the plants in late fall to prevent other plants from being targeted. These steps must be repeated annually, or whenever regrowth is observed. <b>Triclopyr</b> is non-toxic to most animal and insect species and slightly toxic to some species of fish, {{but it has a}} half-life of less than a day in water, making it safe and effective for field use.Mechanical methods have also been used, but they are not as effective due to the difficulty of completely removing the root. There is also no biological control agent available in helping control this species. Mechanical and chemical methods are being used, but they are only temporarily fixing the situation.|$|E
50|$|A {{systemic}} herbicide, for example, glyphosate, <b>triclopyr,</b> or picloram, can {{be applied}} directly on cut stems, which is {{an effective means of}} transporting the herbicide into the kudzu's extensive root system. Herbicides can be used after other methods of control, such as mowing, grazing, or burning, which can allow for an easier application of the chemical to the weakened plants. In large-scale forestry infestations, soil-active herbicides {{have been shown to be}} highly effective.|$|E
50|$|Herbicides are a {{commonly}} recommended {{method of control}} for this species, particularly <b>triclopyr.</b> Small seedlings can be pulled by hand; larger seedlings root firmly and break if pulled, resprouting soon after. Effective control is difficult because of the plant's ability to sprout back up after being cleared off the land. Heavy machinery should be cleaned after digging in infested areas to prevent the transfer of seeds. Aerial monitoring of vulnerable areas is also recommended.|$|E
50|$|The cut-stump {{method is}} most useful when {{treating}} single plants. This method consists of thoroughly covering the stump of a recently cut plant with herbicides, such as glyphosate and <b>triclopyr.</b> The {{effectiveness of this}} treatment is increased by cutting a hole into {{the surface of the}} stump. Use of this treatment when the plant breaks the dormant stage as well as when the ground is frozen is advised against as it greatly reduces effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|The root {{systems of}} young S. punicea plants {{are not very}} {{extensive}} and the soil is loose under waterlogged conditions, so these plants can be removed by hand or by using some simple garden tools. Trees with larger trunks must be cut and treated with the herbicide glyphosate and/or <b>triclopyr.</b> If they are found in standing water, the scan be cut to below the water level, otherwise simply flooding the area would not kill them.|$|E
50|$|Control: <b>Triclopyr</b> herbicide; Milestone is 5-7 oz/A.; Biological herbicide. A natural, {{biological}} herbicide {{to control}} TSA is currently under development {{and is not}} available for public use at this time. The product is called SolviNix™. TSA beetle. A beetle known as Gratiana boliviana (TSA beetle) has been investigated {{over the past several}} years for control of TSA plants. This beetle is native to South America and underwent a rigorous quarantine process prior to its release in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Gutierrezia microcephala {{is among}} {{one of the}} most {{widespread}} and damaging rangeland weeds, and is an indicator of overgrazed or disturbed rangelands. The herbicides picloram and <b>triclopyr</b> have been found to give satisfactory control, with control lasting at least 5 to 7 years with proper grazing management. Biological control has also been studied, with a combination of an Argentinean root-boring weevil, Heilipodus ventralis, and an Argentinean moth root-borer, Carmenta haematica, found to be an effective method of control.|$|E
50|$|Not all Viola are desired, {{and wild}} violets are {{considered}} weeds in North American lawns by some people. Others tolerate or welcome {{the presence of}} violets in lawns. Wild violets are regarded as a problem in shady fescue lawns in North America. Violets thrive in the part/full shade and are not susceptible to most herbicides used to kill common lawn weeds. <b>Triclopyr,</b> a weedkiller, {{has been found to}} be an effective method of controlling wild violets in fescue lawns.|$|E
5000|$|When {{herbicide}} use is warranted, several {{methods have}} proven effective. In all cases, soil disturbance following herbicide treatment is inadvisable. This {{is due to}} privet's preference for disturbed soils and its increased ability to compete in such an environment. [...] The length of time that the soil must be left undisturbed varies with the treatment. Foliar applications of glyphosate, cut-stump applications of glyphosate or <b>triclopyr,</b> and basal bark treatments for stems less than 0.5 inches is effective.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} few pests or {{diseases}} outside its native range and is widely naturalised and classified as an invasive species {{in parts of}} North America. Invasion can be restricted by removal of rooting stems in spring. Once established, {{it is difficult to}} eradicate, as its waxy leaves shed most water-based herbicide sprays. Removal involves cutting, followed by immediate application of concentrated glyphosate or <b>triclopyr</b> to the cut stems. Repeated chemical treatments may be necessary, along with digging up the roots where feasible.|$|E
50|$|Clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid) is a {{selective}} herbicide used {{for control of}} broadleaf weeds, especially thistles and clovers. Clopyralid is in the picolinic acid family of herbicides, which also includes aminopyralid, picloram, <b>triclopyr,</b> and several less common herbicides. For control of Creeping Thistle, Cirsium arvense, a noxious, perennial weed, clopyralid {{is one of the}} few effective herbicides available. It is particularly damaging to peas, tomatoes and sunflowers and can render potatoes, lettuce and spinach inedible. It does not affect members of the family Poaceae (grasses).|$|E
50|$|Insects {{have been}} {{released}} for the biological control of alligator weed. The most successful and widely used is Agasicles hygrophila commonly called the alligator weed flea beetle; it has been released for biocontrol in Australia, China, Thailand, New Zealand, and the United States. Amynothrips andersoni, the alligator weed thrips, and Vogtia malloi, the alligator weed stem borer, have also been released in the United States. A variety of chemicals {{have been shown to}} be effective in controlling the plant, the most useful of which include glyphosate, <b>triclopyr,</b> fluridone, imazamox, and imazapyr.|$|E
5000|$|Cleaning {{is common}} in {{softwood}} plantations, clearcuts, and overstory removals, where the desired conifers are overtopped by rapidly growing early-successional hardwood species. Herbicides are often used in these cleaning operations because the correct chemical at the correct dose (e.g. glyphosate or <b>triclopyr)</b> and time will kill only broadleaved species, leaving the conifers unharmed and free to grow. Chemical treatments may be applied by foliage sprays, mists or pellets. This can be from a vehicle or by aerial spraying. Where chemicals are impractical or unpalatable to the landowner, a brush cutter is used to cut competing trees close to the ground.|$|E
