5|$|Golf is very popular, {{and golf}} tourism {{is a major}} {{industry}} attracting more than 240,000 golfing visitors annually. The 2006 Ryder Cup was held at The K Club in County Kildare.

5|$|The reigning {{champion}} of the competition is automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors (Masters, the U.S. Open, and <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Championship)</b> for the next five years. The prize of the tournament is the Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, and the champion personally keeps the trophy until the next competition the following year.

5|$|Woods {{turned pro}} in August, 1996 and {{immediately}} signed advertising deals with Nike, Inc. and Titleist that ranked {{as the most}} lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time. Woods was named Sports Illustrateds 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. In April 1997, {{he won his first}} major, the Masters, in record-breaking fashion and became the tournament's youngest-ever winner at age 21. Two months later, he set the record for the fastest-ever ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Rankings. After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Championship,</b> a feat not achieved since 1974.|$|E
5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> <b>Championship</b> at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|E
