25|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass-to-metal seal based on kovar sealable borosilicate glasses, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a tube socket. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a <b>top</b> <b>cap.</b> The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input. The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a <b>top</b> <b>cap</b> include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two <b>top</b> <b>cap</b> connections.|$|E
25|$|The {{process to}} build the SAS tower atop its {{foundation}} consisted of five phases. The first four phases each consisted of lifting four similar columns and bolting them into place and to elements connecting them, while the last phase was to lift the final <b>top</b> <b>cap</b> that will carry the crowning main cable saddle. On July 28, 2010, {{the first of four}} below-deck main tower pillars was erected, having arrived earlier in the month by barge from China. They were placed by lifting one end from a barge into a temporary scaffold, with a carriage on the barge to allow the lower end to move into place. After the columns were bolted into place, the scaffolding was then extended upward to allow the next set of above deck columns to be erected, lifted, and translated into position, a process repeated for each of the remaining phases.|$|E

50|$|The {{electrically}} similar 6L6 was not {{favored by}} hams because high transient voltages on the anode when operating in class C {{could cause a}} flashover between pins 2 and 3 on the octal base, whereas the 807 had the anode connected to a <b>top</b> <b>cap,</b> physically distant from all the base pins.|$|E

50|$|In audio {{amplifier}} tube application, the <b>top</b> <b>cap</b> was originally {{used for the}} grid connection, and a serviceman could apply a moist finger to the terminal {{to confirm that the}} stage and subsequent circuits were working by listening for the hum this produced in the loudspeaker. This practice led to some nasty accidents when anode top caps were first introduced to amplifier stages (they had been used on rectifiers for some time).|$|E

50|$|Caricatures of Ola Nordmann as a {{national}} personification of Norway usually depict him as a blond-haired man dressed in bunad-like traditional folk clothing and wearing a woollen red <b>top</b> <b>cap</b> - the traditional headwear of a Norwegian gnome or nisse. This headwear was also worn by the traditional Norwegian farmer, mostly in the old Norwegian farm culture. In the romantic national period, the farmer often came to represent the Norwegian people as a whole, hence the representation.|$|E
50|$|A top hat, {{also known}} as <b>top</b> <b>cap,</b> is an element {{typically}} found on launched coasters. The element consists of 90-degree ascent up a hill, followed by a 90-degree descent; the train exits {{in the same direction}} from which it entered. In a standard configuration, the track twists so that the train does not invert during the ride. Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point and Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure are two roller coasters that feature a top hat element.|$|E

Most frames made by Giant that have integrated headtubes use this standard (which amounts to a lot of bicycles). Two major manufacturers: FSA and Cane Creek. Head tubes with this standard have a 41.1mm inner diameter, and Cane Creek claims its CC Standard headsets will fit in a Campagnolo Standard head tube using a 0.25mm shim under the <b>top</b> <b>cap</b> of the headset.|$|E
