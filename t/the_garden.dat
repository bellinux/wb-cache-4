Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks {{of a way of}} getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into <b>the</b> <b>Garden.</b> The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden.|$|E
