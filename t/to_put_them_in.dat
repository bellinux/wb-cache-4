5|$|On October 11, 2009, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{played the}} Detroit Lions at Ford Field. Nearing {{the end of}} the fourth quarter the Steelers were up by 8 points and the Lions were marching down the field. At this time the Lions mascot Roary The Lion, stepped on, bit and ripped apart a Terrible Towel. Following this the Lions {{suffered}} three straight sacks <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a long fourth and twenty-eight situation. The Lions did not convert and the Steelers won the game 28-20.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Deutschland and Admiral Graf Spee were deployed to the Atlantic <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> position to attack Allied merchant traffic once war was declared. Admiral Scheer remained in port for periodic maintenance. Deutschland was not particularly successful on her raiding sortie, during which she sank or captured three ships. She then returned to Germany where she was renamed Lützow. Admiral Graf Spee sank nine vessels in the South Atlantic before she was confronted by three British cruisers at the Battle of the River Plate. Although she damaged the British ships severely, she was herself damaged and her engines were in poor condition. Coupled with false reports of British reinforcements, {{the state of the}} ship convinced Hans Langsdorff, her commander, to scuttle the ship outside Montevideo.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 for the PlayStation Vita in 2012, Marvel's new parent company, The Walt Disney Company, which {{acquired}} Marvel in 2009, chose not to renew Capcom's license with the Marvel characters, instead opting <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> its own self-published Disney Infinity series. As a result, Capcom had to pull both Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 off their online platforms in 2013. However, in 2016, Disney announced its decision to cancel the Disney Infinity series, discontinue self-publishing efforts, and switch to a licensing-only model, allowing them to license their characters to third-party game developers, including Capcom. Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite was revealed in December 2016, and then released in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England {{jumped to}} an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed {{back in the second}} half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an {{additional}} field goal late in the first half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E

25|$|A {{great effort}} {{would have been}} needed by the England batsmen <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a {{position}} beyond defeat, and Milton and Bailey went to the wicket with a load on their shoulders. Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a little deeper for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. I thought he was so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E
25|$|After 1718, Peter {{established}} {{colleges in}} place of the old central agencies of government. The new agencies were originally nine in number: Foreign affairs, war, navy, expense, income, justice, inspection. Later others were added. Each college consisted of a president, a vice-president and a number of councilors, assessors in addition to one procurator. Some foreigners were included in various colleges but not as president. Peter believed he did not have enough loyal and talented persons <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> full charge of the different departments. Peter preferred to rely on groups of individuals who would keep check on one another. Decisions depended on the majority vote.|$|E

25|$|The {{second test}} saw a less convincing {{performance}} from England, being bowled out for 198 {{in their first}} innings. To make matters worse, India made a huge 481 <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> control of the test match. England batted bravely in the second innings, posting 355, but by then the damage had already been done and India required just 73 to win the match. They achieved this easily on the final day, meaning they had a 1-0 lead going into the final match. On {{the third and final}} test, India played for a draw, posting 664 in their first innings and showing little interest in declaring. After England were bowled out for 345 in response, India decided against enforcing the follow on. India finally declared on 180/6, setting England 500 to win. Batting admirably, England finished on 369/6. Hence the match ended in a draw, and India clinched the series 1-0. This marked Moores first defeat as Coach of England.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Ambassadors {{became the}} Detroit Jr. Wings in 1992 <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> {{a state of}} {{popularity}} with the NHL's Red Wings. The owner of the Detroit Red Wings Mike Ilitch {{and the owner of}} the Detroit Jr. Red Wings Peter Karmanos had an ongoing feud. Notably, the Jr. Red Wing and Red Wings both shared the Joe Louis Arena. The rivalry between Ilitch and Karmanos boiled over, and the Jr. Red Wings were unceremoniously evicted from the Joe Louis Arena. When Karmanos bought the Hartford Whalers, the team became the Detroit Whalers, but played out of the tiny Oak Park Arena and the Palace of Auburn Hills, the latter of which could have been an appropriate venue for the NHL Whalers. Karmanos then had his own arena for his team constructed, Compuware Arena. In 1997, the Detroit Whalers became the Plymouth Whalers, simply because the team played out of Plymouth, Michigan.|$|E

25|$|The Jesuits {{arrived in}} the Viceroyalty of Peru by 1571; it was a key area of Spanish empire, with not only dense {{indigenous}} populations but also huge deposits of silver at Potosí. A major figure in {{the first wave of}} Jesuits was José de Acosta (1540–1600), whose book Historia natural y moral de las Indias (1590) introduced Europeans to Spain's American empire via fluid prose and keen observation and explanation, based on fifteen years in Peru and a bit of time in New Spain (Mexico). Viceroy of Peru Don Francisco de Toledo urged the Jesuits to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Peru, wanting <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> charge of parishes, but Acosta adhered to the Jesuit position that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of bishops and to catechize in Indian parishes would bring them into conflict with the bishops. For that reason, the Jesuits in Peru focused on education of elite men rather than the indigenous populations.|$|E
25|$|Ottoman {{military}} {{members and}} high-ranking politicians convicted by the Turkish courts-martial were transferred from Constantinople prisons to the Crown Colony of Malta on {{board of the}} SS Princess Ena and the SS HMS Benbow by the British forces, starting in 1919. Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe {{was in charge of}} the operation, together with Lord Curzon; they did so owing to the lack of transparency of the Turkish courts-martial. They were held there for three years, while searches were made of archives in Constantinople, London, Paris and Washington to find a way <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> trial. However, the war criminals were eventually released without trial and returned to Constantinople in 1921, in exchange for 22 British prisoners of war held by the government in Ankara, including a relative of Lord Curzon. The government in Ankara was opposed to political power of the government in Constantinople. They are often mentioned as the Malta exiles in some sources.|$|E

A facemask penalty was called on Ohio State during the play to make it 1st and 5 for Miami from the Buckeye 6-yard line. Ken Dorsey then threw an incomplete pass to Andre Johnson but a pass interference call on the Buckeyes defender gave Miami a 1st and goal from the 2-yard line. The Buckeye defense held Miami to only one yard in the next 3 plays to bring up a big 4th and goal on the 1-yard line. Ken Dorsey threw a pass as he was being hit by linebacker Cie Grant; it was incomplete, ending the game with Ohio State winning the BCS National Championship 31–24.|$|E
