VConnecting breaks down hierarchies by bringing established conference speakers in conversation with early career individuals (virtually or in person) who may not normally have a chance to speak to them, even if they had attended the conference in person - as Rebecca Hogue has said, VConnecting boosts the social capital of both the onsite buddy/volunteer and the virtual buddies/volunteers and participants (in Bali & Hogue, 2015).

40|$|ABSTRACT Individuals {{working to}} excess are often {{described}} as workaholics or work addicts. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> said to choose to neglect other life interests in favour of work. Recent studies indicate that workaholism may {{have a negative effect}} on employee health and wellbeing (Vodanovich & Piotrowski, 2006). Workaholics have been found to report more physical and psychological health problems as well as difficulty in maintaining healthy relationships outside their jobs. Given the problems presented by workaholism, this study will examine the effects of workaholism on the health and family functioning of South African professionals and managers and whether this relationship is moderated by job control. Data was collected through the use of self-report questionnaires and included a sample of 80 professionals and managers. Spearmans correlations and two-way Anovas were used to statistically analyse the data. Results indicate that only a small percentage of managers and professionals in South Africa appear to be workaholics and that there is no relationship between workaholism and general health, or workaholism and family competence. Although, drive, a component of workaholism appears to have a positive impact on general health...|$|E
40|$|The Clinton {{administration}} has made much of its record on employment and economic growth. The 1999 Economic Report of the President, for example, claims, citing a host of recent statistics, that "gains from the ongoing economic expansion [have been] distributed throughout the population, reaching groups {{that had previously been}} left out " (Council of Economic Advisers 1999, 116). However, although the gains of the past seven years are certainly not insignificant, the story told by the White House, government agencies, and the media is far from complete. Behind the healthy numbers lurks a disturbing fact. Despite a strong economic expansion, more than 28 million persons aged 25 to 64 (20 percent of that age group) were classified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as out of the labor force (OLF) in 1998. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> neither employed nor classified by the BLS as unemployed. If we look at the entire 25 and over population, we see almost 56 million persons out of the labor force in 1998, and this is in addition to those classified as unemployed. A large proportion of the OLF adults have a low income and low educational attainment. In an earlier brief (Pigeon and Wray 1998), we found that {{over the course of the}} Clinton expansion, fewer than 500, 000 jobs were created for the half of the population that have a high school degree or less.

40|$|Russian {{emigration}} {{has its own}} specifics {{related to}} the fact that for the general population a “crisis ” is a part of a purely European phenomenon. The poorest part of the society is sure that Europe (European values related to human rights, market economy and liberal democracy) is failing, and this is manifested by the “crisis”. So for traditionally the most vulnerable and marginalized populations, migration seems pointless. However, the statistical analysis suggests that migration to Europe from Russia is well gathered after the presidential election. It is specifically predominant amongst the middle class. Russian migrants in Europe tend to already have higher education, higher-paying jobs, own their own homes and are used to quite a high level of material and cultural consumption. All of this the migrant is ready to leave for the sake of (sometimes illusory) prospects in Europe. Thus, the desire to leave Russia is expressed, and, increasingly, is undertaken by those who are the backbone of the Russian society. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently secure at home and their desire to emigrate is not related to any kind of financial distress. As it is shown in the quantitative analysis carried out by us, current migration is related to political reasons-the lack of the freedom of speech and the overall inability to influence the political destiny of the country. This general conclusion was made based on extensive research which sought to determine the nature of the Russian migration to Europe. It is defined as representing a kind of "new wave of dissent", caused primarily not due to economic distress, but rather, because of the political futility of the regime {{in the eyes of the}} middle class...|$|E

Since Canadians are living longer and healthier lives, the questions arise: how is society preparing for a larger older population, and how are the present 2 ̆ 7 most elderly 2 ̆ 7 dealing with the day-to-day exigencies of life? Since these 2 ̆ 7 most elderly 2 ̆ 7 were born just before or just {{after the turn of the}} twentieth century, they lived through three major world events: the First World War and the Second World War, which were separated by a global depression. It is assumed that these milestones must have affected their lives and were instrumental in forming their current life view. Answers to these questions were sought through a formal questionnaire and face-to-face interviews. The findings of this study indicate that: (1) the older population prefer to remain in their own homes. (2) They look to the community to make available those means of aid that will allow them to continue to be independent. (3) Governments and appropriate agencies are not moving quickly enough, nor with sufficient imagination to accommodate the impending swell in the elderly population. Furthermore it is determined that the elderly are not being consulted and involved in the needed transition. Some policy changes and implementations, in accommodating the elderly, are recommended to government bodies at all levels. Finally, some specific concerns about the socially marginalized elderly are voiced, and further areas of research on this {{segment of the population}} are suggested. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} {{data from a}} {{longitudinal}} study of the first cohort of five students {{making the transition from}} teaching assistant in secondary school to specialist teacher of secondary mathematics via a new full-time honours degree in Mathematics Education Studies beginning in September 2002. Data from a second cohort of four women and one man starting in 2003 is less complete, but used as appropriate. To complete the degree each student must necessarily continue to work as a teaching assistant, and must complete some assessed work in their school setting. The study is thus located within theorised literature of widening participation, student choice, and learning mathematics. It is timely in view of government policy of a â��remodelled school workforceâ�� (DfES, 2004) whereby the stated intention is to complement a reduced cadre of qualified teachers with an enhanced number of staff supporting teaching and learning. I argue, using Bernsteinâ��s work (1996) on subject classification, this student group represents a different type of learner, navigating simultaneously two mathematics discourses: â��hardâ�� university mathematics, and â��everyday mathematicsâ�� as experienced by the lower ability school pupils that the students support when at work. Widening participation rhetoric focuses on enticing people into learning who would not otherwise be there (Hillage and Aston, 2001). This account relates to people who, despite being unqualified are already in educational institutions, i. e. schools, through their work. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> â��pre-disposedâ�� favourably towards higher education (see for example Billet, 2001), and for whom progression is what is desired. The students have undergone a long, and autodidactical preparation for university study, illustrated {{in a variety of ways}} through previous personal and professional engagement with learning. The first group were aged between 35 - 49 on entry to the university, and all working as teaching assistants in three schools, two in each of two schools, and one in a third. None had higher than Grade B Intermediate GCSE in mathematics, but all had qualifications gained through continuing education as adults: in counselling, embroidery, art, design, numeracy, literacy and computer qualifications between them. In comparison with â��traditionalâ�� mathematics undergraduates 1, i. e. higher than average A-level points scores on entry, and mainly following on straight from school, the first group of students have extremely limited mathematics qualifications. None has any parents, brothers or sisters that had attended university, and only one has graduates in her immediate family: her husband and daughter. In terms of national data on student populations as a whole (UCAS, Labour Force Survey, Office for National Statistics, 2004) this group is older than almost three-quarters of the undergraduate population and in a lower social class than half of them. The second group show some differences from the first, not in so far as their mathematics qualifications, but in the fact that two of them are already graduates of other subjects. Nevertheless, students are progressing through the programme, between them achieving the full range of marks, and, unlike traditional mathematics students, so far there has been no drop-out. These students exemplify a different type of mathematics learner, those for who mathematics has never been easy, have never been recognised as talented, and who have developed as a consequence successful strategies for dealing with the practically inevitable difficulties. They are people with specific graduate professional ambitions entering the academy with low level formal mathematics qualifications. These distinctions are forcing a rethink of what success in mathematics means, what may be useful pre-requisites in terms of pre-qualification, and the potential relationship between university learning of mathematics alongside work-place learning, in this case in a secondary school mathematics department...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary Background Staff who {{demonstrate}} effective leadership behaviours {{are at the}} forefront of any future primary care transformation. By empowering and engaging self and others to work differently within a changing clinical context, good leaders are better able to plan and provide a vision for the future of their organisations. However there is evidence of underinvestment in leadership development for staff working within the field of primary care. Health Education West Midlands Triumvirate Leadership Programme Triumvirate primary care leadership offers the potential to ‘unlock' the potential for the General Practitioner, General Practice Nurse and Practice Manager when working collaboratively to improve the outcomes for their patients and to transform primary care practice. Aims and Objectives of the Programme Evaluation 1. 	To critically explore the experience of participating in the Triumvirate Leadership Development Programme from the perspective of key stakeholders participants (General Practitioners, General Practice Nurses, Practice Managers, programme and practice colleagues). 2. 	To provide evidenced-informed recommendations for primary care triumvirate healthcare leadership development. Design Kirkpatrick's Four/Five Levels of Evaluation Model provided the framework for the evaluation (Kirkpatrick 1983, Winfrey 1999). The five levels of the model measure: 1. 	Reaction- students initial thoughts and feelings about the education and training experience 2. 	Learning - the resulting increase in knowledge or capability 3. 	Behaviour- extent of behaviour and capability improvement and implementation/application 4. 	Results - the effects on the business or environment resulting from the student’s performance 5. 	Return of Investment – often used to demonstrate monetary investment in education and training. For the purpose of this study, it was not intended to demonstrate evidence at level 5 as this would be extremely difficult to evidence with any certainty therefore this study evaluated the programme using levels 1 - 4 only. Methods Face to face and telephone focus group interviews were undertaken with the following stakeholder groups: •	GPs •	Practice Managers •	General Practice Nurses •	Programme team •	General Practice administrative staff (non-triumvirate). •	Individual triumvirate participants forming 2 case study sites Participants completed poster presentations as part of the programme requirements. The content of these was also analysed for evaluative data using Kirkpatrick’s levels. Findings Thematic analysis of the semi-structured focus group interviews and poster presentations identified themes and subthemes relating to the four levels of Kirkpatrick’s model. Evidence was found across all four levels, with the majority of changes in levels 3 and 4. Conclusions Findings show how adopting a primary care triumvirate leadership approach offers a promising platform for operationalising the contemporary collective and distributed approaches to leadership development (Storey and Holti, 2013; West et al, 2015). Future programmes could benefit further by adopting a multi-dimensional leadership development model (Leigh et al, 2015). This would expose the primary care triumvirate leader to the evidence based Six ‘E’s’ approach to leadership development (Leigh, 2016). Summary of the evidence-informed recommendations for primary care triumvirate healthcare leadership development: 1. 	The triumvirate leadership development approach is the recommended method to operationalise collective and shared leadership within the primary care setting. 2. 	Operationalise future programmes within a multi-dimensional leadership development model to promote the best environment to implement the following five key concepts for effective primary care triumvirate leadership: 1. 	Bring the right people (not the available people) into the triumvirate from the outset and ensure <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> willing to challenge and transform their primary care practice 2. 	Adopt teaching and learning strategies that develop the resilient triumvirate leader so that they can motivate others and challenge the reluctant followers 3. 	Adopt teaching and learning strategies that promote the development of strategic management, communication, change and service improvement in order to spread the triumvirate philosophy across their primary care organisation for the benefit of patient care and improved patient outcomes 4. 	Promote leadership development within an empowered learning organisation (both educational and primary care practice). 5. 	Put in place strategies and systems {{at all levels of the}} primary care system to build and sustain a culture for lifelong leadership learning and development...|$|E
40|$|There {{are serious}} {{problems}} with biological evolution education. Since the time of Darwin resistance has existed {{to the idea that}} biological evolution via natural selection occurs. America has seen more than its fair share of opposition, particularly in recent history. From Scopes to Dover the teaching of biological evolution has been under attack. Most recently foes of biological evolution have argued that intelligent design (ID) is a valid scientific alternative. Those that suggest this hold fundamentally incorrect concepts of the nature of science (NOS), which {{has been shown to be}} a factor related to knowledge and acceptance of biological evolution. But is biological evolution even worth fighting over? Isn 2 ̆ 7 t it 2 ̆ 2 just a theory? 2 ̆ 2 Isn 2 ̆ 7 t all science unproven? These are questions that members of the American public are struggling with and science educators need to help them address. Misconceptions about biological evolution specifically and science in general are pervasive in American society and culture. Some think biological evolution explains life 2 ̆ 7 s origins. Others think that hypotheses become theories, which then become laws. These misconceptions are reinforced in the media, in people 2 ̆ 7 s personal lives, and in some unfortunate cases in the science classroom. Previous work has looked at several factors that are related to a person 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of biological evolution, their acceptance of biological evolution, and their understanding of the NOS. Yet no one has examined the three variables together and how they relate to each other as a whole. It has not been determined which factors are the most pervasive influencers of a person 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of biological evolution, their acceptance of biological evolution, and their understanding of the NOS. These are gaps in our knowledge that must be filled if we want to address the myriad issues surrounding BEE. I was interested in investigating these variables in a highly educated population: university faculty. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not only involved in instruction, but are also active researchers. I suggest that by learning what faculty members understand about the NOS, their knowledge of biological evolution, their acceptance of biological evolution, what misconceptions they have, how those are related to their personal views as well as other factors we will gain an understanding of what we can do to make improvements that lead to a better education for students. The primary questions of interest are: 1. What knowledge of biological evolution do faculty have? 2. How, if at all, does faculty knowledge of biological evolution differ among disciplines? 3. How, if at all, does faculty knowledge of biological evolution differ between theistic views? 4. What level of acceptance of biological evolution do faculty have? 5. How, if at all, does faculty acceptance of biological evolution differ among disciplines? 6. How, if at all, does faculty acceptance of biological evolution differ between theistic views? 7. What understanding of the Nature of Science (NOS) do faculty have? 8. How, if at all, does faculty understanding of the NOS differ among disciplines? 9. How, if at all, does faculty understanding of the NOS differ between theistic views? 10. How, if at all, do knowledge of biological evolution, acceptance of biological evolution, and understanding of the nature of science relate to each other? There are also secondary questions of interest: 11. What is the relationship, if any, of these variables to the amount of science education received? 12. What is the opinion held by faculty across science disciplines of science teaching policies? In order to effectively cover these questions, the content has been broken up into several chapters. Chapter 2 details much of the relevant background needed to understand the degree and scope of the BEE problem. It covers the recent history, including the political and the legal aspects, of the teaching of biological evolution. Additionally, current research on the effective methods of teaching evolution, the relationship between the Nature of Science and evolution, and those groups that have already been studied are discussed. Chapter 3 presents data and analysis collected from faculty members at a large, Midwestern, public university regarding their knowledge and acceptance of biological evolution. Chapter 4 presents data collected from the same population, but focuses on their understanding of the NOS, as well as the relationship between evolutionary knowledge, NOS knowledge, and acceptance of evolution. Chapter 5 discusses the importance of the results of this research, as well as the some of the participant responses to questions that were not discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, and concludes with some recommendations for further research...|$|E
