5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of testing s null {{hypotheses}} simultaneously. In {{order to deal with}} the multiplicity problem, the classical approach is to restrict attention to multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> that control the familywise error rate (FWE). The closure method of Marcus et al. (1976) reduces {{the problem of}} constructing such procedures to one of constructing single tests that control the usual probability of a Type 1 error. It was shown by Sonnemann (1982, 2008) that any coherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> can be constructed using the closure method. Moreover, it was shown by Sonnemann and Finner (1988) that any incoherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> can be replaced by a coherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> which is at least as good. In this paper, we first show an analogous result for dissonant and consonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures.</b> We show further that, in many cases, the improvement of the consonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> over the dissonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> may in fact be strict {{in the sense that it}} has strictly greater probability of detecting a false null hypothesis while still maintaining control of the FWE.

25|$|Many of {{the major}} nuclear {{accidents}} have been directly attributable to operator or human error. This was obviously {{the case in the}} analysis of both the Chernobyl and TMI-2 accidents. At Chernobyl, a <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> was being conducted prior to the accident. The leaders of the test permitted operators to disable and ignore key protection circuits and warnings that would have normally shut the reactor down. At TMI-2, operators permitted thousands of gallons of water to escape from the reactor plant before observing that the coolant pumps were behaving abnormally. The coolant pumps were thus turned off to protect the pumps, which in turn led to the destruction of the reactor itself as cooling was completely lost within the core.|$|E

O 2 ̆ 7 Brien and Fleming stated that their group sequential <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> has the same Type I error rate and power {{as that of a}} fixed one-stage chi-square test, but gives the opportunity to terminate the trial early when one treatment is clearly performing better than the other.

Furthermore, we updated the O’Brien Fleming Group Sequential <b>Testing</b> <b>procedure</b> to make it more flexible via three extensions.

[...] The key scenario being examined by investigators is that the torque calibration parameter data was accidentally wiped on three engines as the engine software was being installed at Airbus facilities, which would prevent the FADECs from operating. Under the A400M's design, the first warning pilots would receive of the engine data problem would be when the plane was 120 meters (400 feet) in the air; on the ground, there is no cockpit alert.|$|E
