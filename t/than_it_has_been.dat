25|$|The vagina {{has been}} studied in humans more <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in other animals. Its {{location}} and structure varies among species, and may vary in size within the same species. Female mammals usually have {{the opening of the}} urethra of the urinary system separate to the vaginal opening of the genital tract. This is different to male mammals, who usually have a single opening, the external urethral opening for both urination and reproduction. The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans. In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary and reproductive tracts.|$|E
