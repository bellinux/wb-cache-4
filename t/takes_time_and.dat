5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E

Instead it is possible to maintain an array of distances between all pairs of clusters.

Maintaining this array {{over the course of the}} clustering algorithm <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space [...] The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm may be used in conjunction with this array of distances to find the same clustering as the greedy algorithm for these cases.

Experience points are awarded for certain player actions, such as killing enemies or completing quests. The party also has a reputation, which {{is affected by the}} player's moral actions, and which, along with the party leader's charisma attribute, influences how NPCs in the game world react to the player. The characters in the party will also complain if the party's reputation conflicts with their alignment.

2500|$|Pasternak's {{translations}} of William Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, Antony and Cleopatra, Othello, King Henry IV (Parts I and II), Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear) remain deeply popular with Russian audiences {{because of their}} colloquial, modernised dialogues. Pasternak's critics, however, accused him of [...] "pasternakizing" [...] Shakespeare. In a 1956 essay, Pasternak wrote, [...] "Translating Shakespeare is a task which <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort. Once it is undertaken, {{it is best to}} divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day. In thus daily progressing through the text, the translator finds himself reliving the circumstances of the author.

The United Nations Human Development Index shows some correlation between higher standards of living and higher turnout. The age of a democracy {{is also an important}} factor. Elections require considerable involvement by the population, and it takes some time to develop the cultural habit of voting, and the associated understanding of and confidence in the electoral process.

2500|$|The episodic {{retrieval}} {{model is}} the current popular model and explains that negative priming occurs due to memory retrieval. This model theorizes that each encounter with a stimulus is encoded and stored separately as an individual episode. Each episode includes perceptual details of both the stimuli and the response developed for that stimulus. When a stimulus is encountered the second time, the previous episode regarding that stimulus along with its tags of perceptual details, role in selective attention, and response given are all retrieved automatically. When the repetitively ignored distractor stimulus is encountered as the target, a tag associated with {{the response to the}} stimulus is also retrieved. This response tag of a distractor will likely be [...] "do-not-respond" [...] tag as opposed to the [...] "respond" [...] tag of the target stimulus. Retrieval of the previous [...] "do-not respond" [...] tag of the stimulus conflicts with the current [...] "respond" [...] tag. This presents a problem of whether to respond or not. Resolving this conflict <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> produces negative priming effect.|$|E

That's not {{something that can be}} done overnight; it <b>takes</b> <b>time.</b> <b>And</b> I don't think it's necessarily acts, like one heroic act, that redeem someone." [...] She clarified: It's just showing change. She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel sorry for what they did, but she repented for her sins. Everyone has a past. Everyone makes mistakes. The only {{thing you can do is}} move on and try to be a better person from that point forward. When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E

2500|$|Following a {{referendum}} on March 10, 1996, Romansh was recognized as a partial official language of Switzerland alongside German, French, and Italian in article 70 of the federal constitution. According to the article, German, French, Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh are national languages of Switzerland. The official languages are declared to be German, French, and Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh is an official language for correspondence with Romansh-speaking people. This means that in principle, {{it is possible to}} address the federal administration in Romansh and receive an answer in the same language. In what the Federal Culture Office itself admits is [...] "more a placatory and symbolic use" [...] of Romansh, the federal authorities occasionally translate some official texts into Romansh. In general, though, demand for Romansh-language services is low because, according to the Federal Culture Office, Romansh speakers may either dislike the official Rumantsch Grischun idiom or prefer to use German in the first place, as most are perfectly bilingual. Without a unified standard language, the status of an official language of the Swiss Confederation would not have been conferred to Romansh. It <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> needs to be promoted to get implemented in this new function.|$|E

60|$|Now, in {{considering}} the question to what extent a squadron should be armed with lances, the system adopted by the Guides may be of interest. In this warfare it is very often necessary for the cavalryman to dismount and use his carbine. The lance then {{gets in the way}} and has to be tied to the saddle. This <b>takes</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> there is usually not much time to spare in cavalry skirmishing. The Guides compromise matters by giving one man in every four a lance. This man, when the others dismount, stays in the saddle and holds their horses. They also give the outer sections of each squadron lances, and these, too, remain mounted, as the drill-book enjoins. But I become too technical.|$|E

He has, mark ye, not only his troops to find, but their weapons, which is like to prove a more difficult matter. Suppose he can raise five thousand men--and he cannot stir with less--he will not have one musket in five, so the rest must do as they can with pikes and bills, or such other rude arms as they can find.
