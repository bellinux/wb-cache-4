Experimental measurements of the dominant <b>Taylor</b> <b>wave</b> and its growth rate were made during the film boiling of cyclohexanol on cylindrical heaters.

40|$|Air ingress {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential threat for Very High Temperature gas-cooled Reactors (VHTR). Reactor components constructed of graphite will, at high temperatures, produce exothermic reactions in the presence of oxygen. The danger lies in the possibility of fuel element damage and core structural failure. Previous investigations of air ingress mechanisms have focused on thermal and molecular diffusion, density-driven stratified flow, and natural convection. Here, we investigate the possibility of a rapid ingress of air due to a <b>Taylor</b> <b>wave</b> expansion after a hypothetical sudden loss of coolant accident (LOCA) scenario in a VHTR. Our analysis starts with a one-dimensional shock tube simulation to simply illustrate the development of a <b>Taylor</b> <b>wave</b> with resulting reentrant flow.

However, fewer quantitative studies have been conducted on the effect of direct, in-contact, high explosive (HE) -driven <b>Taylor</b> <b>wave</b> (unsupported shocks) loading on the shock hardening, damage evolution, or spallation response of materials. Systematic studies quantifying the effect of sweeping-detonation wave loading are yet sparser. In this study, the shock hardening and spallation response of Ta is shown to be critically dependent on the peak shock stress and the shock obliquity during sweeping-detonation-wave shock loading. Sweeping-wave loading is observed to: a) yield a lower spall strength than previously documented for 1 -D supported-shock-wave loading, b) exhibit increased shock hardening as a function of increasing obliquity, and c) lead to an increased incidence of deformation twin formation with increasing shock obliquity...|$|E

We have {{carried out the}} first experimental study using a detonation tube hung in a ballistic pendulum arrangement within a large pressure vessel {{to determine the effect}} that the environment has on the single-cycle impulse. Air pressure decreased below 100 kPa, whereas initial pressure of the stoichiometric ethylene– oxygen mixture inside the tube varied between 100 and 30 kPa. The original impulse model (Wintenberger et al., Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 19, No. 1, 2002, pp. 22 – 38) was modified to predict the observed increase in impulse and blowdown time as the environmental pressure decreased below 1 atm.

40|$|Movies of {{the breakup}} of viscous and {{viscoelastic}} drops in the high-speed airstream behind a shock wave in a shock tube have been reported by Joseph, Belanger & Beavers (1999). They performed a Rayleigh–Taylor stability analysis for the initial breakup of a drop of Newtonian liquid {{and found that the}} most unstable Rayleigh– <b>Taylor</b> <b>wave</b> fits nearly perfectly with waves measured on enhanced images of drops from the movies, but the effects of viscosity cannot be neglected. Here we construct a Rayleigh–Taylor stability analysis for an Oldroyd-B fluid using measured data for acceleration, density, viscosity and relaxation time λ 1. The most unstable wave is a sensitive function of the retardation time λ 2 which fits experiments when λ 2 /λ 1 = O(10 − 3). The growth rates for the most unstable wave are much larger than for the comparable viscous drop, which agrees with the surprising fact that the breakup times for viscoelastic drops are shorter. We construct an approximate analysis of Rayleigh–Taylor instability based on viscoelastic potential flow which gives rise to nearly the same dispersion relation as the unapproximated analysis. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{used the}} {{polytropic}} approximation P ∼ ργ {{to model the}} isentrope in the detonation products in our original study 1 {{in order to simplify}} the computation and develop analytic formulas for the impulse. Radulescu and Hanson (R&H) point out that for the stoichiometric ethylene-oxygen case, an equilibrium approximation to the isentrope is more realistic than the frozen approximation that is implied by our choice of polytropic exponent. We appreciate their observation, noting that we were aware of the significance of chemical reaction in the products, and our use of the frozen rather than equilibrium isentrope was an oversight on our part. We have recomputed our results 2 (see the tables and plots in the Errata accompanying this response) for all cases finding that the choice of frozen versus equilibrium isentrope makes less than a 10 % difference in the impulse in the most extreme cases, at most a 1. 3 % difference for fuel-air cases, and changes none of the qualitative conclusions of our study. Their comment raises three issues that we did not address in our original study. 1) Is the polytropic approximation reliable for equilibrium detonation products? 2) To what extent are the detonation products in equilibrium within the <b>Taylor</b> <b>wave?</b> 3) What is the appropriate choice for the polytropic exponent γ in our model...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the surface}} {{stability}} of metals undergoing dynamic fracture at shock breakout {{is important to}} several applications in metals processing. The advantages of using the Pegasus II facility to investigate the phenomena occurring at shock break out are described. As {{an example of the}} data collected, we concentrate on brief descriptions of two experiments that compared the tensile failure, i. e. ''spall'', patterns in the presence of sinusoidal perturbations seeded on the free inner surface of cylindrical samples of 3 types of Al. These samples were composed variously of soft Al 1100 -O, structural grade Al 6061 -T 6, and ultra-pure 99. 99 % Al and were subjected to <b>Taylor</b> <b>waves</b> with shock pressures of 14 GPa. We show that the material behind the exiting surface undergoes a type of failure termed here ''microspall'', resulting in the production of a significant volume of low-density, probably granular, material. The failure mechanism, combined with the forces that cause inertial instability, leads to rapid pattern growth in the failed material and subsequent pattern growth on the surface. Pattern growth was studied as a function of perturbation wavelength and amplitude. The different Al samples vary by an order of magnitude in yield strength, and some increase in pattern instability was observed at lower yield strength. The ultra-pure Al has exceptionally large grain size, in the mm range. No appreciable variation of spall pattern was observed due to grain size...|$|R

40|$|Abstract DEM (Distinct Element Method) {{models have}} found {{numerous}} applications {{in a number}} of engineering disciplines, such as material handling and transport, chemical, industrial, civil, mining and mineral processing. The thesis describes developments using PFC 3 D (Particle Flow Code in 3 D) for simulating rock fragmentation by commercial explosives. Emphasis is on the realistic simulation of explosive detonation in the blasthole as well as the flow of explosive gas from the blasthole, through the fracture network and venting to the atmosphere. Detonation can be initialized at any point along discretized blastholes and proceed up or down the hole according to the Velocity of Detonation of the explosive. Each of the explosive properties (pressure, density, extent of reaction, energy and their time derivatives) is computed according to the conservation equations and the explosive equation of state at any point along the hole. At initiation, the product calculation begins at the sonic locus with input of the detonation product provided by the non-ideal detonation code Vixen-n. The <b>Taylor</b> <b>wave</b> is then computed {{as a function of the}} blasthole expansion, which depends on the rock mass response to loading. The explosive gas is treated as a non-steady, compressible fluid and can flow through an arbitrary and evolving fracture network developed in the rock mass as a function of explosive loading. The fracture network (and flow paths) is defined by the coalescence of discrete macro-cracks. The gas has the effect of draining the blasthole and loading the fracture surface by its pressure and drag forces. Fracture intersection with free-surfaces is monitored and venting to the atmosphere is allowed. Validation of the fluid flow scheme is performed by comparing numeric results to analytic solutions for flow in shock tubes. The complete model is demonstrated by simulating stress only models, gas flow models and complete models of field-scale blasts...|$|E
40|$|In the {{original}} evaluation of our analytical {{model for the}} single-cycle impulse of a pulse detonation tube, 1 we approximated the detonation product isentrope as having a frozen composition with a corresponding polytropic exponent °f. As discussed in the accompany-ing comment by Radulescu and Hanson and our response, for many situations, it is more appropriate to use an equilibrium approximation to the isentrope. This implies a di®erent value of the polytropic exponent ° = °e, a new computational procedure for computing the plateau pressure P 3, and results in revised values for the predicted impulse. Although the general equations and the qualitative conclusions drawn in our paper are unchanged, the revised numerical values of the predicted impulse di®er up to 9. 5 % for stoichiometric fuel-oxygen mixtures and less than 1. 3 % for fuel-air mixtures at standard conditions. In this errata, we present a revised set of selected tables and ¯gures along with a short description of the calculations.

The detonation-tube nozzle and surrounding tank were initiallyfilledwith air between 1. 4 and 100 kPa in pressure simulating high-altitude conditions. A stoichiometric ethylene–oxygen mixture at an initial pressure of 80 kPa filled the constant-diameter portion of the tube. Four diverging nozzles and six converging–diverging nozzleswere tested. Two regimes of nozzle operationwere identified, depending on the environmental pressure. Near sea-level conditions, unsteady gas-dynamic effects associated with the mass of air contained in the nozzle increase the impulse as much as 72 % for the largest nozzle tested over the baseline case of a plain tube. Near vacuum conditions, the nozzles quasi-steadily expand the flow, increasing the impulse as much as 43 % for the largest nozzle tested over the baseline case of a plain tube. Competition between the unsteady and quasi-steady-flow processes in the nozzle determine the measured impulse as the environmental pressure varies.

40|$|In an {{anisotropic}} linear-elastic medium, {{polarization of}} waves due to anisotropy {{of the medium}} is known to occur. In a way similar to phenomena in an anisotropic linear-elastic medium, polarization of waves takes place even in an anisotropic nonlinear-elastic medium. Polarized waves in a nonlinear-elastic medium are also soliton-like or step-shaped waves named simple waves. In an isotropic nonlinear-elastic medium, the simple waves are separated into two categories, non-coupled and coupled simple waves. The former are dilatational waves, while the latter are coupled waves with dilatational (u-component) and distorsional (v- and w-components) properties, where u and {v, w} are longitudinal and transverse components, respectively. In the case of anisotropic nonlinear-elastic medium, two kinds of simple waves mentioned above also appear with some modification due {{to the presence of}} anisotropy.

The non-dimensional equations are then combined with a fully developed sea state cap (Young and Verhagan 1996) to form the open coast and bay methodologies. This approach yields root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0. 01 - 0. 46 m, with the majority of points below 0. 3 m. This approach yields small bias values.

The experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure and 296 K under laminar pre-mixed and turbulent-incompletely mixed conditions. A pulsed, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser {{was used as the}} ignition source. Laser sparks with energies of 10 mJ and 40 mJ were used, as well as a conventional electrode spark with an effective energy of 6 mJ. Measurements were made of the flame kernel radius as a function of time using pulsed laser shadowgraphy. The initial size of the spark ignited flame kernel was found to correlate reasonably well with breakdown energy as predicted by the <b>Taylor</b> spherical blast <b>wave</b> model. The subsequent growth rate of the flame kernel was found to increase with time from a value less than to a value greater than the adiabatic, unstretched laminar growth rate. This behavior was attributed to the combined effects of flame stretch and an apparent wrinkling of the flame surface due to the extremely rapid acceleration of the flame. The very large laminar flame speed of methane-oxygen mixtures appears to be the dominant factor affecting the growth rate of spark ignited flame kernels, with the mode of ignition having a small effect.

3000|$|... (1) The {{theory of}} gravity wave {{absorption}} at critical layers is well-developed. Gravity waves propagating energy upward {{from the lower}} atmosphere are absorbed into the mean flow as they approach the critical layer where the intrinsic frequency of the wave is Doppler-shifted to zero. Gravity waves can propagate upwards only when the propagation direction of gravity wave is opposite to the neutral wind direction. All-sky images of the near-infrared OH emission is well suited for this study as they provide reasonable estimates of the direction of motion and the apparent speed of the waves reaching the upper atmosphere. The observations reported here show very good agreement between the observed and the permitted wave azimuths and speeds. For the month of April 2008, the blocking region was in south-west direction, and the waves were propagating towards the north-east direction. The anisotropy in propagation direction in March and April {{may be due to}} a wave-filtering effect, which is in agreement with the findings of Taylor et al. (1993). The blocking region also varied as a function of time and altitude. There is, however, an overall consistency between the observed GW propagation and the blocking diagrams. The theory of the filtering effect of a gravity wave by its absorption into the mean wind flow at a critical layer is valid only when the background wind through which wave is propagating is somewhat stable (Richardson’s number, Ri, of the background medium is greater than 1 / 4). When there is a steep vertical gradient of wind flow, wind profiles may become unstable, causing refraction or over-reflection of the upward propagating gravity <b>wave</b> (<b>Taylor</b> et al., 1993).|$|R
