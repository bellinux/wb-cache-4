[...] Despite this, the administrative hearing found that he was not eligible for Social Security Disability. [...] Perales did not subpoena the doctors who had written unfavorable reports and cross examine them {{in the course of his}} hearing, despite having the opportunity to do so.

50|$|Another {{issue in}} the rights debate is governments' use of {{legislation}} to control competition among private medical insurance providers against national social insurance systems, such as the case in Canada's national health insurance program. Laissez-faire supporters argue that this erodes the cost-effectiveness of the health system, as even {{those who can afford}} to pay for private healthcare services drain resources from the public system. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> whether investor-owned medical insurance companies or health maintenance organizations are {{in a better position to}} act in the best interests of their customers compared to government regulation and oversight.

5000|$|When {{a patient}} {{presents}} with {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} (CO) or other non-respiratory hypoxic symptoms, most current CO-oximeter will detect the relative levels of each hemoglobin fraction (oxyhemoglobin and dyshemoglobins) and likely the oxyhemoglobin saturation. For any system making these measurements {{it is critical that}} the device clearly distinguish between Oxygen Saturation' and Fractional Oxyhemoglobin" [...] <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> the careless use of saturation vs. fractional oxyhemoglobin, which both measure the same entity -oxyhemoglobin- but the oxygen saturation uses as its base only the hemoglobin available for binding, while the fractional oxyhemoglobin uses the total hemoglobin in the sample as its base. In normal subjects the values are nearly identical-thus leading to terminologic and possibly clinical confusion. A simple oximeter measuring only oxygen derivatives, may report a normal saturation or even a hyperoxic state if oxygen gas has been administered when in fact there is serious compromise of oxygen carrying ability of the hemoglobin present..|$|E
50|$|The {{creation}} of the 8th federalist paper, written by Alexander Hamilton, was to establish a proper Union {{and the importance of}} protecting one. Without a Union, or unity between states, the United States would’ve had little to no defensive protocols against foreign invaders. Given the United States was underdeveloped, at the time, in comparison to Great Britain, in no way would have America protected itself against attackers of outer parties. The main conflict was that if the states can’t work together to work in harmony, how can they work together to protect each other? Hence the {{creation of}} a standing army was underway. However, the thoughts of having a professional army created doubts among the people, that they can’t be completely trusted. Meaning, that if an army were to be established, they would {{have a great deal of}} power. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that the militants may misuse the given power for their own advantage. Under false pretenses of protection, militants may deceive the same people they swore to protect by stealing from them. Promising the people protection for something in return.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{psychology}} versus social intelligence—as {{a separate}} and distinct perspective, seldom articulated. An appropriate introduction contains certain hypothetical assumptions about social structure and function, {{as it relates to}} intelligence defined and expressed by groups, constrained by cultural expectations that assert potential realities, but make no claims that there is an [...] "exterior" [...] social truth to be defined. This perspective pursues the view that social structures can be defined with the warning that what is mapped into the structure and how that information is stored, retrieved, and decided upon are variable, but can be contained in an abstract and formal grammar—a sort of game of definitions and rules that permit and project an evolving intelligence. Two halves of the coin: one half psychology; the other half social. Unfortunately, most references to social intelligence relate to an individual's social skills. Not mentioned, and more important, is how social intelligence (speaking of a group or assembly of groups) processes information about the world and shares it with participants in the group(s). Are there social structures or can they be designed to accumulate and reveal information to the individual or to other groups. The bigger question is how groups and societies map the environment (ecological, social and personal) into a social structure. How is that structure able to contain a worldview and to reveal that view to the participants? How are decisions made? ...|$|E
