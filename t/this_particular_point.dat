Garcia, who previously starred as Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes from J.J. Abrams' Lost, appears as a Massive Dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with Walter {{at the start of}} the episode. Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick, the person behind the floating bodies. Ruck was approached by the show's producers having envisioned him for the role. Ruck described the character, [...] "He is no dummy... and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it. Ultimately he would like to use it for good, but in so doing he causes a lot of damage. So I guess you can say he's obsessed. And <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point</b> in time where the episode of Fringe starts, time is fleeting and he's just... under the gun." [...] On his character's possible reappearance, Ruck commented, [...] "I think not... Technically yes , but probably not." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{originally}} constituted, Bergen Township {{began at}} Bergen Point and included {{the area between}} Hudson's River {{to the east and}} the Hackensack River to the west, north to the present-day Hudson-Bergen line. Why <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point</b> was chosen is not clear, as there is no clear geological or topographical feature indicating a natural separation. It may have been the place where the Lenape sub groups-the Hackensack and the Tappan-saw the extent of their territories. It may have also been the border between the patroonships of Pavonia and Vriessendael, and corresponds to Stuyvesant's re-purchase. As described in the charter for [...] "Towne of Bergen" [...] in 1668, the northern border of the town was determined by landmarks that no longer exist.|$|E

He explained why he chose to write the book at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point,</b> emphasizing it was to provide a guide for the public, and [...] "because impeachment is a political process that occurs outside of the courts. It is responsive to the people, and if impeachment is going to take place, it will be because the American people demand it."

2500|$|The protests {{captured}} the attention of the world and gained extensive global media coverage. Student leader Joshua Wong featured on the cover of Time magazine during the week of his 18th birthday, and the movement was written about, also as a cover story, the following week. While the local pan-democrats and the majority of the Western press supported the protesters' aspirations for universal suffrage, Martin Jacques, writing for The Guardian, argued that the PRC had [...] "overwhelmingly honoured its commitment to the principle of one country, two systems". He believed that the reason for the unrest is [...] "the growing sense of dislocation among a section of Hong Kong's population" [...] since 1997. Tim Summers, in an op-ed for CNN, said that the protests were fuelled by dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong government, but the catalyst was the decision of the NPCSC. Criticising politicians' and the media's interpretation of the agreements and undertakings of the PRC, Summers said [...] "all the Joint Declaration said is that the chief executive will be 'appointed by the central people's government {{on the basis of the}} results of elections or consultations to be held locally [...]' Britain's role as co-signatory of that agreement gives it no legal basis for complaint on <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>point,</b> and the lack of democracy for the executive branch before 1997 leaves it little moral high ground either." ...|$|E

Sudden bursts of intense radiation emanate from rapid rearrangements {{of the magnetic}} field network in the corona. Avalanches are triggered by loops of flux that reconnect or snap into lower energy configurations when they are overly stressed.

The statistics of the avalanches and of the network structure are unified through a simple dynamical model where the avalanches and network co-generate each other into a complex, critical state. <b>This</b> <b>particular</b> example <b>points</b> toward a general dynamical mechanism for self-generation of complex networks.

However, Elisabeth did not waiver from her initial explanation of her vision which did just the opposite of maintaining these boundaries.
