5000|$|On April 12, 1963, Grafman joined {{seven of}} the signatories to the {{previous}} Appeal in issuing a second statement, known as a [...] "A Call for Unity". This statement {{was a response to}} the preparations for the Birmingham campaign, a strategic movement organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), led by King to bring attention to the unequal treatment of black Americans in Birmingham. Reaffirming the January statement, the Call for Unity expressed the view that the planned demonstrations were [...] "unwise and untimely", and that attempts to correct the very real injustices should be pursued patiently in the courts, by local residents. The Call asked the [...] "Negro community" [...] of Birmingham to withdraw support from King's demonstrations. Responding to the April 12, 1963, Call for Unity, King, incarcerated in the city jail after being arrested for his part in the Birmingham campaign, wrote an open letter on April 16, 1963, known as The [...] "Letter from Birmingham Jail". Addressing the eight authors of the Call for Unity as [...] "My Dear Fellow Clergymen", and acknowledging that they were [...] "men of genuine good will" [...] and that their criticisms were sincere, King attempted to explain why he had come to Birmingham (he had been invited by one of the SCLC's local affiliates, the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights; why even outsiders had an obligation <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the <b>racial</b> <b>discrimination</b> there ("injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere"); and why the campaign had not waited to see what the courts and new city leaders would do (Wait' has almost always meant 'Never and [...] "justice too long delayed is justice denied"). King also notes that he has been disappointed with [...] "white moderates" [...] ("Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will").|$|R
40|$|Social {{networks}} do {{matter in}} the process of individual participation in social movements 1. Many of the African-Americans activists involved {{in the civil rights movement}} during the 1950 s and later were members of Baptist churches before they devoted their time and energy <b>to</b> the <b>fight</b> against <b>racial</b> <b>discrimination</b> in American society (McAdam 1982; Morris 1984). The young students who worked on the Freedom Summer Project in 1964 enjoyed social links which greatly facilitated their commitment to that risky campaign (McAdam 1988). Most of the women who contributed to the emergence of the women’s movements in the United States, and probably in other countries as well, were socially embedded in dense networks, mainly on the radical left (e. g. Freeman 1973). Similar processes occurred in European countries. For example, social ties crucially expanded individual support for what became one of the biggest street demonstrations in Dutch history, when 550, 000 peace supporters went to The Hague to protest against the deployment of NATO cruise missiles in the country (Klandermans and Oegema 1987). Interpersonal ties have also played a key role in more radical forms of protest, such as terrorism. They were crucial to the involvement of activists in Italian and German left-wing underground organizations (della Porta 1995). Socia...|$|R

From 1929 to 1935, Houston served as Vice-Dean and Dean of the Howard University School of Law. He developed the school, beginning its years as a major national center for training black lawyers. He extended its part-time program to a full-time curriculum and gained accreditation by the Association of American Law Schools and the American Bar Association. Bringing prominent attorneys to the school as speakers and to build a law network for his students, Houston served as a mentor to a generation. He influenced nearly one-quarter of all the black lawyers in the United States at the time, including former student Thurgood Marshall, who became a United States Supreme Court justice. Houston believed that the law could be used <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>racial</b> <b>discrimination</b> and encouraged his students to work for such social purpose.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} analyzes welfare {{conditions of}} Afro-Colombians vis-à-vis non Afro-Colombians using Amartya Sen 2 ̆ 7 s Capability Approach as the theoretical framework, and the latent variable modeling as the empirical method. Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models are estimated {{using data from}} the Colombian Quality of Life Survey, 2003. Two latent constructs, namely, 2 ̆ 7 knowledge 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 being adequately sheltered 2 ̆ 7, represent the two 2 ̆ 7 Capability 2 ̆ 7 dimensions to be analyzed. Ethnic background appears to have a consistently negative influence after controlling statistically by a set of relevant variables (e. g. being poor, area, marital status, age and gender, among others) included in the models as exogenous 2 ̆ 2 causes 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 determinants 2 ̆ 2 of each capability dimension. This implies that the capability set or the freedom an Afro-descendant enjoys in achieving the life he or she wants in terms of 2 ̆ 7 knowledge 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 shelter 2 ̆ 7 is consistently lower than that of a non Afro-descendant (whites and mestizos). As a consequence, achieved welfare or functioning achievement as expressed in terms of aspects such as years of education or dwelling conditions in the household is and would be consistently lower for individual members of this ethnic group. This evidence points toward the proposition that embedded patterns of <b>racial</b> <b>discrimination</b> are limiting Afro-Colombian capabilities and individual agency, beyond income levels or even access to educational resources. Hence, from a capability perspective removing <b>racial</b> <b>discrimination</b> must be an explicit objective of developmental policy. Accordingly, national policy must be directed not only to improving access for Afro-Colombians to resources and economic wellbeing, as traditional analysis of class disparity argues, but also toward the nurturing and expansion of the real freedom they have to pursue the goals they value. Thus, development policy in Colombia must altogether work toward the improvement of resource access for Afro-descendants and toward the creation of specific mechanisms to enforce the judicial instruments <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> against <b>racial</b> <b>discrimination.</b> These laws and judicial mechanisms were created to open spaces for political, social and economic participation for this population group on an equal basis, as their fellow citizens of non African descent, and are yet to be fulfilled...|$|R

The Black Movement explicitly decided to make land central to their political agenda during the constitutional debates. They capitalised on the perception that there were very few quilombos and that it would thus be mainly a symbolic gesture in order to get it into the Constitution. It was assumed that any community would have to prove its direct descent from a runaway slave settlement.|$|E

40|$|In 2000, the European Union {{adopted a}} Directive against {{discrimination}} {{on the grounds of}} racial or ethnic origin. This book provides an in-depth evaluation of the Race Directive and its effects, questioning how successful the Race directive has been. The EU Race Directive discusses the history of the <b>fight</b> against <b>racial</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the EU and the equality clauses in international Human Rights instruments. It then examines the terms race, racism and <b>racial</b> <b>discrimination</b> and equality in the Directive. The book also looks at the concepts of equality which can be distinguished in the Race Directive and in the subsequent developments at EU level. Examining whether the Directive has improved the protection against racial or ethnic origin discrimination for people within the EU, the book concludes with an assessment of how far the EU has come on the road to racial equality with the adoption of the Race Directive and the subsequent developments. It also contains proposals for possible improvements.
