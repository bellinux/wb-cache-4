5|$|Cooked <b>tarantula</b> spiders are {{considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela.

Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
