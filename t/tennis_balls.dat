5|$|As a child, Keenor had a keen {{interest}} in football, using <b>tennis</b> <b>balls</b> or rags tied together to form a ball, due to the expensive nature of footballs at the time, to play the game in his local streets. He attended Stacey Road primary school in Adamsdown and captained the school's football team for several years and he was later selected to represent the city of Cardiff's schoolboy team. One of his former teachers at the school, Walter Riden, would later go on to join the board at Cardiff City while Keenor was a player.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the All England Regulations for the Management of Prize Meetings, the draw for the 22 entrants was made on Saturday, 7 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. in the club's pavilion. H.T. Gillson had {{the distinction of being}} the first player in the history of modern tennis to be drawn for a tournament. The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from Woolwich, while the rackets used were an adaptation of those used in real tennis, with a small and slightly lopsided head. The ball-boys kept the <b>tennis</b> <b>balls,</b> 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells. The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them a better view of the court.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> {{adhesive}} {{formula is}} optimized {{by studying the}} impact of reinforcing system, tackifier, vulcanization system and solvent {{on the performance of}} NR-based <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> adhesive. The optimizing formula of rubber is: NR 100, Carbon Black N 220 30, ZnO 8. 3, Stearic Acid 2. 2, Phenolic Tackifying Resin 3, Sulfur 3, Accelerator D 0. 5. The adhesive made through such optimizing formula shows good performance and the finished <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> has excellent adhesion and air tightness, satisfying the design requirements. Intorduction The excellent elasticity of <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> is provided by the internal air inflation. Therefore, air retaining of <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> is an important influencing factor of its performance, which is not only related with the air tightness of <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> bladder, but also closely related with the adhesion of <b>tennis</b> <b>ball.</b> The vulcanization of <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> is very unique. Firstly, it vulcanizes the rubber into two hemispheres and puts in inflating agent. Then, these two hemispheres will be bonded together for secondary vulcanization. This indicates that the bonding of <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> is the bonding between vulcanized rubbers, which is more difficult than that between unvulcanized rubbers. Therefore, firm adhesion requires experiment on the adhesive formula in order to gain qualified <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> adhesive. This paper optimized the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> adhesive formula by studying the impact of reinforcing system, tackifier, vulcanization system and solvent on the performance of NR-based <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> adhesive...|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to demonstrate the principle more simply with just two balls, such as a basketball and a <b>tennis</b> <b>ball.</b> If an experimenter balances the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> {{on top of the}} basketball and drops the pair to the ground, the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> will rebound to many times the height from which it was released.|$|R
25|$|Many casual players use a <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> {{wrapped in}} layers of {{some type of}} {{adhesive}} tape (often electrical tape), which makes the relatively soft <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> harder and smoother. This is {{commonly referred to as}} a tape ball. A common variant is to tape only half the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball,</b> to provide two different sides and make it easy to bowl with prodigious amounts of swing.|$|R

25|$|A popular {{demonstration}} {{involves the}} bounce of multiple stacked <b>balls.</b> If a <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> is stacked {{on top of}} a basketball, {{and the two of them}} are dropped at the same time, the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> will bounce much higher than it would have if dropped on its own, even exceeding its original release height. The result is surprising as it apparently violates conservation of energy. However, upon closer inspection, the basketball does not bounce as high as it would have if the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> had not been on top of it, and transferred some of its energy into the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball,</b> propelling it to a greater height.|$|R
40|$|The {{coefficient}} of restitution of a damp <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> {{is of interest}} to tennis players. Using a spray bottle, water was added to a <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> and the mass {{of water on the}} wet ball was determined. The ball was then dropped from a fixed height of 0. 86 m. The motion was recorded with a video camera and the bounce height was measured. Using the bounce height and the original height, the {{coefficient of}} restitution for that mass of added water was determined. The research found the mass of water added to the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball</b> to have a negatively linear relationship with the coefficient of restitution of the <b>tennis</b> <b>ball...</b>|$|R
