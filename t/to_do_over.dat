5|$|Wheeler {{had been}} keen {{to return to}} {{excavation}} in Britain. Based on {{the one he had}} organised in India, Wheeler developed an archaeological training course, which he ran at Verulamium in the summer of 1949 to instruct British students in the methodologies of excavation. In summer 1950, he was invited by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments to direct a trial excavation at Bindon Hill in Dorset. It was a leisurely project which he treated as a seaside holiday. He was invited by the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works to excavate the Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications in North Riding, Yorkshire, which he proceeded <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> the summers of 1951 and 1952. Aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the British archaeological scene, he was joined by Alcock and Alcock's wife, among others. Wheeler published his report on the site in 1954.|$|E

Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents and she had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> five {{interviews}} before she got the part. Watson took her audition seriously, but [...] "never really thought [...] had any chance of getting the role." [...] The producers were impressed by Watson's self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied.|$|E
500|$|Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project {{appeared}} {{inevitable in}} October 1990, {{as a new}} area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered {{in the path of}} the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying [...] "God only knows when [...] be completed," [...] describing the project as a [...] "total disaster" [...] and commenting [...] "If we had it all <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> again, we wouldn't do that project." [...] OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in [...] dollars) to the total cost of the project. USACE finally issued the permit on November 15, over a year after OTA applied for it.|$|E

500|$|Bryant and Bob Green were {{divorced}} in May 1979, {{in a dispute}} made public through newspapers. Bryant moved to Alabama and gave a candid interview to Ladies Home Journal in 1980 where she told {{the details of her}} marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been [...] "married for the wrong reasons" [...] and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce. Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ( [...] dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family. Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had [...] "ever met the Lord", to her humiliation. As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: [...] "The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and try to understand. If I had it <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over,</b> I'd do it again, but not in the same way," [...] and feminism: [...] "The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. I believe in the long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on the fundamentalists, who have become so legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible." ...|$|E

A stroke in 1978 caused a loss of vision in one eye. Faced with declining health and career prospects, he committed suicide by gunshot in Los Angeles three years later. Toward {{the end of his}} life, an embittered Wood would say, according to one biography, [...] "If I had it all <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> again, I'd cut off my hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of an}} all-American line-up {{of musicians}} at the sessions, other {{participants}} included bassist Willie Weeks, drummer Alvin Taylor, keyboard players Richard Tee and David Foster, and jazz percussionist Emil Richards. Harrison's regular associates Gary Wright and Billy Preston also contributed, on keyboards, the latter in between his commitments to the Rolling Stones' concurrent European tour. According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, {{one of the few}} items of recording Harrison was able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> the summer months was an overdubbed acoustic guitar solo on the ballad [...] "Learning How to Love You".|$|E

Now {{the fact that we}} were lied to about the reasons for entering into war against Iraq and thousands of people have diedit's just as immoral as racism." [...] Her remarks drew international headlines. In an August 14, 2007, interview, she commented on all her well-publicized, outspoken views, in particular the Aladdin incident, by noting, [...] "If I had it <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> I would be much more gracious to everyone … you can be as outspoken as you want if you are very, very respectful.

2500|$|The {{inclusion}} of Elizabeth also served to better extend Irrational's vision of storytelling first-person shooters {{and to avoid}} other tropes used in similar games that have become [...] "long in the tooth" [...] such as receiving information over a radio or from someone {{on the opposite side}} of a window; according to Levine, having Elizabeth as a person working aside the player-characters helps to make the game [...] "feel more grounded in humanity". In contrast to the silent Jack from BioShock, the player character Booker is also given a voice, a decision to avoid complacency with the [...] "silent protagonist" [...] motif as well to have face-to-face interactions with other non-player characters instead of being told what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> a radio or separated by a barrier.|$|E

2500|$|Neither critics nor {{the public}} responded enthusiastically, {{although}} Robert Osborne {{has stated that}} the film was a success when he hosted a telecast of it on Turner Classic Movies. Graham Greene wrote that he was [...] "less than ever convinced {{that there is an}} aesthetic justification for filming Shakespeare at all... the effect of even the best scenes is to distract." [...] Cinemagoers considered the film too [...] "arty", staying away as they had from Warner's A Midsummer Night Dream a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade. The film nevertheless received four Oscar nominations. Subsequent film versions would make use of less experienced, but more photogenic, actors in the central roles. Cukor, interviewed in 1970, said of his film: [...] "It's one picture that if I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> again, I'd know how. I'd get the garlic and the Mediterranean into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American {{trade in}} Guangzhou existed {{primarily}} through private traders {{and without the}} supervision and supporting authority of the United States government. [...] Soon after 1784, an American consul was appointed in Guangzhou and functioned as a reporting agent on trade to the U.S. government. [...] The consul was not recognized by the Chinese authorities or the hoppo, and {{was not allowed to}} fly the American flag over its factory until well after 1799. The Americans had to trade with the Chinese as subordinates instead of equals and use the cohong for any and all demands. [...] Consequently, the Americans did not have the leverage to raise political or legal protests and had to submit themselves to the Chinese justice system that believed in a [...] "life for a life" [...] and holding groups accountable for the actions of individuals. [...] The chief concern of foreign traders was preventing the Chinese from closing trade, as they could threaten <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>over</b> legal disputes.|$|E
