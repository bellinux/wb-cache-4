Double D then confesses that he {{recently}} found his magnifying glass as well, proving that there never actually was a serial <b>toucher.</b> Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and roll down the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E

6000|$|To {{the feeling}} of a refined gentleman, or of a lady whose eye loves to rest always on the beautiful, an {{agricultural}} population that touches its hat, eats plain victuals, and goes to church, is more picturesque and delightful than the thronged crowd of a great city, by which a lady and gentleman is hustled without remorse, which never touches its hat, and perhaps also never goes to church. And as we are always tempted to approve of that which we like, and to think that that which is good to us is good altogether, we--the refined gentlemen and ladies of England I mean--are very apt to prefer the hat <b>touchers</b> to those who are not hat <b>touchers.</b> In doing so we intend, and wish, and strive to be philanthropical. We argue to ourselves that the dear excellent lower classes receive an immense amount of consoling happiness from that ceremony of hat touching, and quite pity those who, unfortunately for themselves, know nothing about it. I would ask any such lady or gentleman whether he or she does not feel a certain amount of commiseration for the rudeness of the town-bred artisan who walks about with {{his hands in his pockets}} as though he recognized a superior in no one? ...|$|R

Jonny (David Paul Grove) soon walks by, carrying his imaginary friend Plank, who is a board of wood. Impressed with Ed's hair cut, Jonny ignores the sign and rubs Plank against Ed's head. Eddy and Double D then jump out from behind a nearby bush and capture Jonny, accusing him of being the serial <b>toucher.</b> Eddy interrogates Jonny and Plank after tying them to chairs in Double Dee's garage and hooking them up to a homemade lie detector. However, when they give him no answers, he resorts to using chinese water torture on Plank. This makes Jonny need to use the bathroom and in his desperation, he falsely confesses to the crime. The Eds then collect their money and punish Jonny by trapping him in a tire.|$|E

40|$|Research into {{emotional}} {{communication to}} date has largely focused on facial and vocal expressions. In contrast, recent studies by Hertenstein, Keltner, App, Bulleit, and Jaskolka (2006) and Hertenstein, Holmes, McCullough, and Keltner (2009) exploring nonverbal communication of emotion discovered that people could identify anger, disgust, fear, gratitude, happiness, love, sadness and sympathy {{from the experience of}} being touched on either the arm or body by a stranger, without seeing the touch. The study showed that strangers were unable to communicate the self-focused emotions embarrassment, envy and pride, or the universal emotion surprise. Literature relating to touch indicates that the interpretation of a tactile experience is significantly influenced by the relationship between the <b>touchers</b> (Coan, Schaefer, & Davidson, 2006). The present study compared the ability of romantic couples and strangers to communicate emotions solely via touch. Results showed that both strangers and romantic couples were able to communicate universal and prosocial emotions, whereas only romantic couples were able to communicate the self-focused emotions envy and pride...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{previous}} {{studies have shown that}} an emotional context may alter touch processing, {{it is not clear how}} visual contextual information modulates the sensory signals, and at what levels does this modulation take place. Therefore, we investigated how a <b>toucher’s</b> emotional expressions (anger, happiness, fear, and sadness) modulate touchee’s somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) in different temporal ranges. Participants were presented with tactile stimulation appearing to originate from expressive characters in virtual reality. Touch processing was indexed using SEPs, and self-reports of touch experience were collected. Early potentials were found to be amplified after angry, happy and sad facial expressions, while late potentials were amplified after anger but attenuated after happiness. These effects were related to two stages of emotional modulation of tactile perception: anticipation and interpretation. The findings show that not only does touch affect emotion, but also emotional expressions affect touch perception. The affective modulation of touch was initially obtained as early as 25 ms after the touch onset suggesting that emotional context is integrated to the tactile sensation at a very early stage...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-eight 30 -month-old {{children}} and their mothers were observed during a task in which the child was asked to refrain from touching an attractive toy. Child and ma-ternal regulatory strategies were independently coded in 5 -sec intervals. Consistent with past research, the ability to refrain from touching the toy was associated with less time orienting to the forbidden object and more time focusing on other stimuli. Mothers of children who refrained from touching the toy {{were more likely to}} use dis-traction as a technique to assist in their children’s regulation than were mothers of <b>touchers,</b> whereas mothers of children who transgressed used more nondistracting strategies than did mothers of nontouchers. Analysis of contingent behaviors sug-gested that mothers and children effectively coregulated behavior during this chal-lenging situation, as {{children and}} mothers followed one another’s lead in the alloca-tion of attention away from the toy. These findings indicate the benefits of proactive, rather than reactive, parental strategies for assisting child delay of gratification. Requests for reprints should be sent to Samuel P.

40|$|A major {{learning}} disability {{is a failure}} or breakdown {{in the process of}} audition. An auditory language quantum is reported to provide a basis for assessment of an audi-tory {{learning disability}}. A seven point scale of sensitivity, discrimination, perception, processing, pattern making, retention and conceptualization is presented as the meas-uring instrument. To listen is to have language. To speak is to have language. To read is to have lan-guage. Yet, what is language and how is it measured? The disciplines of linguistics, 1 psychology 2 and speech pathology 3 have all been concerned with language and language development. Hardy 4 - 5 has re-viewed the question in two keynote presen-tations to the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf. Many students of language including Hutchinson 0 have suggested that some chil-dren are primarily hearers, some seers and some <b>touchers.</b> Language breakdown may occur when the hearing child is a "failure" at the seeing problem—he sees but does not read; or the seeing child is a "failure " at the hearing problem—he hears but does not listen. In an extreme case a child with a primary touch input system may be a failure in both reading and listening. Hardy has suggested levels or steps of language acquisition which have the poten-tial of being informal measures leading to an auditory language quantum. Hardy's presentation is in terms of audition—hear...|$|R
6000|$|What was occupying {{his mind}} at the present moment was the {{thoroughly}} unsatisfactory conduct of his wife's brother, Bertie Baxter. The more tensely he brooded over the salient points in the life-history of his wife's brother, Bertie Baxter, the deeper did the iron become embedded in his soul. Bertie was one of Nature's <b>touchers.</b> This is {{the age of the}} specialist, Bertie's speciality was borrowing money. He was a man of almost eerie versatility in this direction. Time could not wither nor custom stale his infinite variety. He could borrow with a breezy bluffness which made the thing practically a hold-up. And anon, when his victim had steeled himself against this method, he could extract another five-pound note from his little hoard with the delicacy of one playing spillikins. Mr Blatherwick had been a gold-mine to him for years. As a rule, the proprietor of Harrow House unbelted without complaint, for Bertie, as every good borrower should, had that knack of making his victim feel during the actual moment of paying over, {{as if he had just}} made a rather good investment. But released from the spell of his brother-in-law's personal magnetism, Mr Blatherwick was apt to brood. He was brooding now. Why, he was asking himself morosely, should he be harassed by this Bertie? It was not as if Bertie was penniless. He had a little income of his own. No, it was pure lack of consideration.

You see, the way things had been going on I was rapidly becoming a dashed serf. The man had jolly well oppressed me.

Pour surcroit de bonheur pour eux, tous ces Colons sont parvenues, dans un etat tres-florissant; ils sont nombreux et riches:--ils recueillent dans le sein de leur patrie toutes les necessites de la vie. L'ancienne Angleterre a ete assez sotte, et assez dupe, pour leur laisser etablir chez eux les arts, les metiers, les manufactures:--c'est a dire, qu'elle leur a laisse briser la chaine de besoins qui les liait, qui les attachait a elle, et qui les fait dependants.

6000|$|The {{sense of}} touch seems less liable to {{perversion}} than either that of sight or smell, nor are there many cases in which it can become accessary to such false intelligence as the eye and ear, collecting their objects from a greater distance and by less accurate enquiry, are but too ready to convey. Yet there is one circumstance in which the {{sense of touch}} {{as well as others}} is very apt to betray its possessor into inaccuracy, in respect to the circumstances which it impresses on its owner. The case occurs during sleep, when the dreamer touches with his hand some other part of his own person. He is clearly, in this case, both the actor and patient, both the proprietor of the member touching, and of that which is touched; while, to increase the complication, the hand is both <b>toucher</b> of the limb on which it rests, and receives an impression of touch from it; and the same is the case with the limb, which at one and the same time receives an impression from the hand, and conveys to the mind a report respecting the size, substance, and the like, of the member touching. Now, as during sleep the patient is unconscious that both limbs are his own identical property, his mind is apt to be much disturbed by the complication of sensations arising from two parts of his person being at once acted upon, and from their reciprocal action; and false impressions are thus received, which, accurately enquired into, would afford a clew to many puzzling phenomena in the theory of dreams. This peculiarity of the organ of touch, as also that it is confined to no particular organ, but is diffused over the whole person of the man, is noticed by Lucretius:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|J'aurais dû déjà vous remercier de tout le plaisir que vous m'avez fait en m'envoyant Sapho. Je vous suis très-reconnaissant de cette bonne et amicale pensée, qui s'ajoutera désormais, pour moi, au {{souvenir}} du livre. Je n'avais pas attendu l'arrivée de votre volume pour le lire--mais cela m'a donné l'occasion de m'y remettre encore et de tirer un peu au clair les diverses impressions que tant d'admirables pages m'ont laissées. Je n'essaierai pas de vous rapporter ces impressions dans leur plénitude--dans la crainte de ne réussir qu'à déformer ma pensée--tout autant que la vôtre. Un nouveau livre de vous me fait passer par l'esprit une foule de belles idées, que je vous confierais de vive voix--et de grand cœur--si j'avais le bonheur de vous voir plus souvent. Pour le moment, je vous dirai seulement que tout ce qui vient de vous compte, pour moi, comme un grand évènement, une jouissance rare et fructueuse. Je vous aime mieux dans certaines pages que dans d'autres, mais vous me charmez, vous m'enlevez toujours, et votre manière me pénètre plus qu'aucune autre. Je trouve dans Sapho énormément de vérité et de vie. Ce n'est pas du roman, c'est de l'histoire, et de la plus complète et de la mieux éclairée. Lorsqu'on a fait un livre aussi solide et aussi sérieux que celui-là, on n'a besoin d'être rassuré par personne; ce n'est donc que pour m'encourager moi-même que je constate dans Sapho encore une preuve--à ajouter à celles que vous avez données--de tout ce que le roman peut accomplir comme révélation de la vie et du drôle de mélange que nous sommes. La fille est étudiée avec une patience merveilleuse--c'est un de ces portraits qui épuisent un type. Je vous avouerai que je trouve le jeune homme un peu sacrifié--comme étude et comme recherche--sa figure me paraissant moins éclairée--en comparaison de celle de la femme--qu'il ne le faudrait pour l'ntérêt moral la valeur tragique. J'aurais voulu que vous nous eussiez fait voir davantage par où il a passé--en matière d'expérience plus personnelle et plus intime encore que les coucheries avec Fanny--en matière de rammollissement de volonté et de relâchement d'âme. En un mot, le drame ne se passe peut-être pas assez dans l'âme et dans la conscience de Jean. C'est à mesure que nous touchons à son caractère même que la situation devient intéressante--et ce caractère, vous me faites l'effet de l'avoir un peu négligé. Vous me direz que voilà un jugement bien anglais, et que nous inventons des abstractions, comme nous disons, afin de nous dispenser de <b>toucher</b> aux grosses réalités. J'estime pourtant qu'il n'y a rien de plus réel, de plus positif, de plus à peindre, qu'un caractère; c'est là qu'on trouve bien la couleur et la forme. Vous l'avez bien prouvé, du reste, dans chacun de vos livres, et en vous disant que vous avez laissé l'amant de Sapho un peu trop en blanc, ce n'est qu'avec vous-même que je vous compare. Mais je ne voulais que vous remercier et répondre à votre envoi. Je vous souhaite tout le repos qu'il vous faudra pour recommencer encore!
