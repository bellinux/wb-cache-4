2500|$|Jon Dolan, {{writing for}} Blender, gave the album {{three out of}} five stars and commended Norwood's {{decision}} to re-team with Jerkins: [...] "Now she's gone back to girlie hip-hop Eden; four songs were written by Jerkins, author of her best late-'90s hits. Fluttery jams about long distance longing and time-suspending slow dances are balanced by grown-up moments of deeply felt, if slightly weird, balladic fortitude." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the sentiments of the songs, whether self-affirming or heartbroken, were back to generic ones: [...] "Song titles like 'Torn Down' and 'Shattered Heart' show how much Brandy is trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>serious,</b> taking on an adult world where happily ever after is elusive. But she still {{comes across as a}} fledgling, a personality still being formed, eagerly tagging along after her role models." [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Henry Goldblatt noted [...] "the huskiness that defined Brandy's prior work has been replaced by wispier and higher tones. The result is pleasant but far less ambitious than her last CD, 2004's Afrodisiac." [...] Mikael Wood's review for Los Angeles Times was less emphatic. He gave the album one and a half stars out of four, and said: [...] "Unfortunately, it's also hard {{to make it through the}} thing. Brandy's strong suit has never been her thoughtfulness; appropriately for someone with her Hollywood history, she's long been one of R's emptiest vessels, a gorgeous voice used by a series of gifted producers to communicate their own unique ideas." ...|$|E
