5|$|Despite {{their losses}} the French {{survivors}} {{returned to the}} remaining guns, although most of their first broadside scattered into the sea, and {{at least some of}} their shot was misdirected towards the merchant ships. The French gunners aimed too high however, most of their shot tearing through the rigging of Sybille while the British broadsides slammed into the hull of Forte. This problem was partly attributed to the French gun quoins which had been replaned three days earlier, exacerbated by the lack of suitable gun crews which meant that many of the upperdeck guns were unmanned. The French gunners were also more used to firing warning shots at distant merchant ships and may not have realised that their guns needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>depressed</b> for combat at point blank range.|$|E
5|$|The first crews {{arrived at}} Subic Bay on 11 June and a {{squadron}} office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard. The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and ammunition ready boxes for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits. Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on-station time. Modifications {{were made to the}} bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>depressed</b> below the horizon for close-range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the gunwales of each cutter.|$|E

25|$|Depressing {{carriages}} {{had been}} invented before – in the 15th century, a German engineer had devised {{a platform for}} a culverin that had four wheels and could be moved in two arcs for adjusting the elevation – but Koehler found a simple and effective solution that solved both the problems of elevation and recoil. It {{was based on an}} existing garrison carriage, a type of heavy gun carriage mounted on small wheels known as trucks. Koehler split the carriage in two horizontally, joining the two parts with a hinge created with a spindle at the front. This allowed the gun <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>depressed</b> to an angle of between 20 and 70 degrees. The cannonball and powder were held in place using wadding to secure them in the bore.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{like all}} of the old high voltage equipment, the cars {{featured}} a ten point brass controller with manual acceleration, which required motormen to notch up gradually as the train came up to speed. Should a motorman advance too quickly with the controller handle, however, a device would actually prevent the car's propulsion system from notching up at too rapid a rate. Mounted {{on the top of}} the controller handle was a button which had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>depressed</b> at all times, acting as a deadman's switch, which would automatically apply the train's emergency brakes should the motorman let go. This was a safety feature designed to stop a train should a motorman become incapacitated.

25|$|Feelings of {{depression}} {{can cause a}} child to overeat. Researchers provided an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered {{that there was not}} a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression.

Researchers provided a depression questionnaire to 487 overweight/obese subjects and found that 7% of those with low depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.3, 27% of those with moderate depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.7, and 31% of those with major depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.2.|$|E

A similar trend existed for depression. Nurius did not believe that firm conclusions can be drawn from this for a variety of reasons.|$|E
500|$|During construction, it was {{anticipated}} that the Severn Bridge Railway would mainly receive its revenue from carrying coal from the Forest of Dean. However, the Severn Bridge Railway Company ran into financial difficulties as coal was not carried in the volumes that had been anticipated, nor had tourist travel risen to the expected levels.

500|$|The {{poor design}} of the breech allowed the Type 94 Nambu to be fired unintentionally. The sear bar on the Type 94 Nambu {{converts}} the forward pull of the trigger into a lateral movement that frees the hammer.

The forward end of the [...] sear bar would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>depressed</b> approximately [...] 2mm to cause the weapon to fire. The ability to fire the Type 94 without pulling the trigger gave rise to war stories of Japanese soldiers surrendering, only to fire the pistol, earning the pistol monikers such as the [...] "suicide special" [...] and the [...] "surrender pistol". These stories are widely discredited because of the difficulty to fire the weapon by squeezing the sear bar. If the safety is engaged on the Type 94 it is impossible for the weapon to discharge unintentionally.|$|E
