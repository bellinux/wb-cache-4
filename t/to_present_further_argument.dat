The purpose is rather to consider the arguments which have been done by others. The purpose is rather to consider the arguments which have been advanced in favor of a budget deficit limited by the capital expenditure budget separate from the current expenditure. The structure of this paper is as follows. We first consider some possible rationales for the so-called ‘golden rule' that current expenditure by government should be covered by taxation and capital expenditure may be financed by borrowing. The next section points out the ways in which the government sector should be treated differently from the private sector in matters of deficits and their financing. The application of any ‘golden rule' is dependent on how capital expenditure is conceptualized and measured, and that is discussed in section 4. The next section suggests ways in which the ‘golden rule' may lead to some problems. Section 6 provides some further discussion on the debt stability condition, and section 7 is a brief conclusion. The central point which is at the heart of this paper is the current expenditure and capital expenditure by government have the essentially similarities that they use current resources, have to be financed but do not yield a direct monetary revenue for the government. ...|$|R

We support the case by analogy to Yang–Mills and distinction from metric general relativity, whose tree network structure blows up. We argue a correspondence between the structures of a network {{and those of the}} effective action for a theory, which correlates by way of the SQC to its renormalizability properties.

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} the Dyson-Schwinger equations for the gluon and ghost propagators and the ghost-gluon vertex of Landau-gauge gluodynamics in two dimensions. While this simplifies {{some aspects of}} the calculations as compared to three and four dimensions, new complications arise due to a mixing of different momentum regimes. As a result, the solutions for the propagators are more sensitive to changes in the three-point functions and the ansätze used for them at the leading order in a vertex expansion. Here, we therefore go beyond this common truncation by including the ghost-gluon vertex self-consistently for the first time, while using a model for the three-gluon vertex which reproduces the known infrared asymptotics and the zeros at intermediate momenta as observed on the lattice. A separate computation of the three-gluon vertex from the results is used to confirm the stability of this behavior a posteriori. We also <b>present</b> <b>further</b> <b>arguments</b> for the absence of the decoupling solution in two dimensions.

40|$|We <b>present</b> <b>further</b> <b>arguments</b> {{that the}} Hipparcos parallaxes {{for some of}} the {{clusters}} and associations represented in the Hipparcos catalog should be used with caution {{in the study of the}} Galactic structure. It has already been shown that the discrepancy between the Hipparcos and ground-based parallaxes for several clusters including the Pleiades, Coma Ber, and NGC 6231 can be resolved by recomputing the Hipparcos astrometric solutions with an improved algorithm diminishing correlated errors in the attitude parameters. Here we present new parallaxes obtained with this algorithm for another group of stars with discrepant data - the galactic cluster Cr 121. The original Hipparcos parallaxes led de Zeeuw et al. to conclude that Cr 121 and the surrounding association of OB stars form a relatively compact and coherent moving group at a distance of ≃ 550 - 600 pc. Our corrected parallaxes reveal a different spatial distribution of young stellar populace in this area. Both the cluster Cr 121 and the extended OB association are considerably more distant (750 - 1000 pc), and the latter has a large depth probably extending beyond 1 kpc. Therefore, not only are the recalculated parallaxes in complete agreement with the photometric uvbyβ parallaxes, but the structure of the field they reveal is no longer in discrepancy with that found by the photometric method...|$|R

40|$|The {{study has}} been {{performed}} to compare the immediate and long-term outcomes of Vitreoretinal Surgery (VS) on patients with Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) in relation to Prior Retinal Laser Coagulation (PLC). The study included 56 patients (71 eyes) with diabetes mellitus (type 2 - 52 / 93 %, men – 39 / 75 %) complicated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), requiring VS. Of these, 33 eyes (no PLC) underwent primary vitrectomy, while the remaining 38 eyes (PLC) had undergone panretinal laser coagulation {{over the past five}} years. In our study, PLC significantly contributed to the preservation of improved functional retinal status, despite the development of complications, which is an indication for VS. The PLC patients exhibited early recovery and a higher visual acuity throughout the observation period. Thus, the study revealed {{that in the case of}} prior VS, laser photocoagulation of the retina helps preserve the visual acuity, both at the time of and during the first year after surgery, reduces surgery duration and decreases the need to tamponade the vitreous cavity with silicone oil. Besides, PLC of the retina is accompanied by a significantly lower incidence of intra- and post-operational hemorrhage and reduces the need for repeated vitreoretinal procedures.

40|$|Recent {{writers have}} invoked {{the idea that}} epistemic {{rationality}} gives us options {{in an attempt to}} show that we can exercise direct doxastic control without irrationality.

This paper argues against the version of epistemic permissivism (``Discretion'') invoked by these writers and shows that other defensible permissivisms do not support their cause.
