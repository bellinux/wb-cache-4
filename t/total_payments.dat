40|$|This note {{considers}} {{a situation in}} which the publisher of an academic journal seeks to maintain the number of contributions to the journal by subsidizing the contributors with some incentive payments. We show that under the incentive payment scheme that distributes some pre−determined <b>total</b> amount of <b>payments</b> equally to each contributor (the constant <b>total</b> <b>payment</b> scheme), the number of contributions can fluctuate cyclically as well as chaotically over time when the potential contributors form adaptive expectations. Numerical simulations suggest, among other things, that the performance of the constant <b>total</b> <b>payment</b> scheme may be more efficient than the constant per−capita payment scheme when the <b>total</b> amount of <b>payments</b> is supposed to be small...|$|R

2500|$|In 1999, Ontario Hydro {{was broken}} up and its {{generation}} facilities re-formed into Ontario Power Generation (OPG). In {{order to make}} the successor companies more attractive for private investors, $19.4 billion in [...] "stranded debt" [...] was placed in the control of the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation. This debt is slowly paid down through a variety of sources, including a 0.7-cent/kWh tariff on all power, all income taxes paid by all operating companies, and all dividends paid by the OPG and Hydro One. Even with these sources of income, the amount of debt has grown on several occasions, and in 2010 stood at almost $15 billion. This is in spite of <b>total</b> <b>payments</b> on the order of $19 billion, ostensibly enough to have paid off the debt entirely if interest repayment requirements are ignored.|$|E

Assuming, therefore, that Germany is not able to provide any appreciable surplus towards Reparation before 1921, she will have to find a sum of $375,000,000 annually from 1921 to 1925, and $900,000,000 annually thereafter.[113] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{manager was}} {{convinced}} from the beginning, as he ingenuously said, quite independently of handwriting, that {{the letters were}} genuine. Why? he was asked. Because he felt they were the sort of letters that Mr. Parnell {{would be likely to}} write. He counted, not wholly without some reason, on the public sharing this inspiration of his own indwelling light. The day was approaching for the division on the Coercion bill. Every journalist, said the manager, must choose his moment. He now thought the moment suitable for making the public acquainted with the character of the Irishmen. So, with no better evidence of authority than his firm faith that {{it was the sort of}} letter that Mr. Parnell would be likely to write, on the morning of the second reading of the Coercion bill, he launched the fac-simile letter. In the early part of 1888 he received from the same hand a second batch of letters, and a third batch a few days later. His <b>total</b> <b>payments</b> amounted to over two thousand five hundred pounds. He still asked no questions as to the source of these expensive documents. On the contrary he particularly avoided the subject. So much for the cautious and experienced man of business.|$|E
