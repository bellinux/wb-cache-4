5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E
5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> and {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so {{it acts as}} a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E

5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E

5|$|The lower esophageal sphincter, or {{gastroesophageal}} sphincter, {{surrounds the}} lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stomach</b> {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate. Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E

5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E

5|$|Lindow Man's {{last meal}} was {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail.

The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> <b>stomachs</b> of 32 {{individuals}} of seven cetacean species incidentally caught in gill net and purseseine fisheries along Mangalore and Chennai coasts (India) between 2004 and 2006 were examined. <b>The</b> whole <b>stomach</b> (fore-gut, mid-gut and hind-gut) was examined in all cases. Prey remains (666 prey items comprising six species of teleosts, one crustacean and one squid species) {{were found in}} <b>the</b> <b>stomachs</b> of eight individuals (<b>the</b> remaining 24 <b>stomachs</b> {{were found to be}} empty). All cetaceans were found to feed mostly on teleosts with wide range of trophic levels. Based on an index that included frequency of occurrence, percentage by number and by weight, the oil sardine Sardinella longiceps was the main prey in the sample. Cetaceans appear to favour both pelagic as well as demersal prey, possibly indicating surface and benthic feeding habits...|$|R
