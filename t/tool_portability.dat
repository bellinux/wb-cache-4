40|$|FPGA {{overlays}} {{have shown}} the potential to improve designersâ€™ productivity through balancing flexibility and ease of configuration of the underlying fabric while maintaining considerable overall performance promised by FPGAs. To truly facilitate full application acceleration, it is often necessary to also include a highly efficient processor that integrates and collaborates with the accelerators while maintaining the benefits of being implemented within the same overlay framework. This thesis presents an open-source soft processor that is tightly-coupled with FPGA accelerator {{as part of an}} overlay framework. RISC-V is chosen as the instruction set for its openness and simplicity, and the soft processor is designed as a 4 -stage pipeline to balance resource consumption and performance when implemented on FPGAs. The processor is generically implemented so as to promote design portability and compatibility across different FPGA platforms. Experiment shows that the integrated software-hardware applications using the proposed tightly-coupled architecture achieve comparable performance as hardware-only accelerators while the proposed architecture provides additional run-time flexibility. The processor can be synthesized to both low-end and high-performance FPGA families from different vendors, achieving the highest frequency of 268 : 67 MHz on Virtex- 7 device. Synthesized results of the soft processor also display improvement on FPGA resource consumption and efficiency when compared to existing RISC-V design. In addition, this thesis also presents an FPGA-centric approach that allows gateware to directly access the virtual memory space as part of the executing process without involving the CPU. It allows efficient access to memory in heterogeneous systems and complements traditional software-centric approach by providing a simplified memory access model to improve designersâ€™ productivity and high-level compilation <b>tools</b> <b>portability.</b> In this approach, a caching address translation buffer was implemented alongside the user FPGA gateware to provide runtime mapping between virtual and physical memory addresses. It coordinates with the OS running on the CPU to update address translations and to maintain memory consistency. The system was implemented on a commercial off-the-shelf FPGA add-on card to demonstrate the viability of such approach in low-cost systems. Experiment with a 2 D stencil computing application implemented with this FPGA-centric approach results in reasonable performance improvement when compared to a typical software-centric implementation; while the number of context switches between FPGA and CPU in both kernel and user mode was significantly reduced, freeing the CPU for other concurrent user tasks. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

In response to this changing landscape, we are, over the next two years, deploying the next generation of the Montage toolkit ([ascl: 1010. 036]). The first release (October 2015) supports multi-dimensional data sets ("data cubes"), and insertion of XMP/AVM tags that allows images to "drop-in" to the WWT. The same release offers a beta-version of web-based interactive visualization of images; this includes wrappers for visualization in Python. Subsequent releases will support HEALPix (now standard in cosmic background experiments); incorporation of Montage into package managers (which enable automated management of software builds), and support for a library that will enable Montage to be called directly from Python.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{portability}} and reproducibility {{of the software}} used to conduct computational experiments has recently come to the fore. Container virtualisation {{has proved to be}} a powerful <b>tool</b> to achieve <b>portability</b> of a code and it's execution environment, through runtimes such as Docker, LXC, Singularity and others - without the performance cost of traditional Virtual Machines (Chamberlain, Invenshure, and Schommer 2014; Felter et al. 2014). However, scientific software often depends on a system foundation that provides middleware, libraries, and other supporting software in order for the code to execute as intended. Typically, container virtualisation addresses only the portability of the code itself, which does not make it inherently reproducible. For example, a containerized MPI application may offer binary compatibility between different systems, but for execution as intended, it must be run on an existing cluster that provides the correct interfaces for parallel MPI execution. As a greater demand to accomodate a diverse range of disciplines is placed on high performance and cluster resources, the ability to quickly create and teardown reproducible, transitory virtual environments that are tailored for an individual task or experiment will be essential. The Virtual Container Cluster (VCC) is a framework for building containers that achieve this goal, by encapsulating a parallel application along with an execution model, through a set of dependency linked services and built-in process orchestration. This promotes a high degree of portability, and offers easier reproducibility by shipping the application along with the foundation required to execute it - whether that be an MPI cluster, big data processing framework, bioinformatics pipeline, or any other execution model (Higgins, Holmes, and Venters 2017) ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the human}} {{population}} grows, there is an increasing demand for early detection {{of a variety of}} analytes in different fields. This demand mainly includes early and sensitive detection of pathogens, disease biomarkers, pesticides, food contaminants, and explosives. To address this, lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology has emerged as a <b>tool</b> to improve <b>portability,</b> automation and sensitivity of sensors by taking advantage of integrated laboratory functions on a miniaturized chip. It is agreed that LOC has the potential to make various sensing modules practical for real- world applications. In this work, we have developed a highly sensitive, portable, and automated optofluidic surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) microsystem for chemical and biological detection. SERS is a powerful molecular identification technique that combines laser spectroscopy with optical properties of metal nanoparticles. Optofluidic SERS is defined as the synergistic use of microfluidic functions to improve the performance of SERS. By leveraging microfluidic functions, the optofluidic SERS microsystem mixes and concentrates the sample and nanoparticles resulting in an improved performance as compared to conventional open microfluidic SERS systems. The device requires low sample volume and has multiplexed detection capabilities. Moreover, it is suitable for on-site detection of analytes in the field because of its improved automation and portability due to the integrated fiber optics. The final device consists of two regions of packed silica beads inside microchannels for biomolecular interaction as well as sample concentration for SERS measurements. Additionally, an on-chip micromixer and fiber optics are integrated into the device. Optical fibers aligned to the detection zone make the biosensor alignment-free, which greatly improves automation. Practical applications for the detection of real-world analytes (e. g., pesticides, fungicides, food contaminants, and DNA sequences) are demonstrated utilizing our optofluidic SERS microsystem. Detection of biological samples could be extended to proteins and proteolytic enzymes through displacement assays. Consequently, the integration of microfluidic functions, including a microporous reaction zone, a nanoparticle concentration zone, and a micromixer, combined with the use of integrated fiber optics and portable spectrometers, make our microsystem suitable for on-site detection of analytes at trace levels...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{fabrication}} tools, specifically {{additive manufacturing}} systems, have consistently advanced in efficiencies such as print speed, gantry size, material cost {{and ease of}} use. However most of these systems remain limited {{in their ability to}} enable automated mixing and extrusion of multiple materials with variable properties on large scales. This thesis focuses on the first steps of realizing this enabling technology by operating across two distinct trajectories. The first aims at digitally controlling precision path placement of material with high levels of tunability through analog mixing, while the second explores do-it-yourself <b>tool</b> customization, compactness, <b>portability</b> and the possibility of fabrication node-to-node communication. Inspired by the silkworm's ability to spin highly sophisticated and tunable material architectures, the aim of this thesis is to develop an enabling technology for digital fabrication requiring high levels of material tunability in product and architectural scales. Specifically, I designed, developed, built and evaluated an array of six unique customizable and compact deposition heads for tunable material properties. Amongst those tools is a freeform extrusion head for tunable geometry without the need for auxiliary support structure; a fast thread deposition head and a fiber winding head for tunable compressive and tensile strength respectively; a portable cable-suspended paste droplet extrusion head for tunable drop size of paste material; and a chitosan gel extrusion head for tunable plasticity using biomaterials. Operating across the two trajectories of tunability and portability, this thesis argues that highly tunable, compact and portable extrusion heads developed within a Fab Lab environment can support variable property printing of one or more materials outside of commercial based systems. This capability will in the future enable the digital fabrication of larger-scale prototypes, sustainable products and architectural structures inspired by nature in Fab Lab settings. by Jared Smith Laucks.

40|$|Validation and {{verification}} are {{key points}} within a space project {{to check for}} reliability of the designed product. Of course, those phases are fundamental within the development of projects focused on planetary exploration too, such as those involving mobile elements on the surface; on board software, operations, and operational modes must be checked in a specific simulation environment, possibly including some software representation of the on board hardware too. A space mission simulator allows checking for the design robustness too, as different and complex faulty scenarios may be analysed either to revise the hardware solutions or to correctly define the reconfiguration procedures. Although spacecraft simulators are routine at control centers, rover virtual simulator is a young area for Europe as no space rover has been deployed yet. While the ExoMars program offers a great field for Martian applications, the Lunar Google XPrize challenge represents a perfect lunar scenario to start working on that topic: according to the challenge statement, a rover must be sent on the Moon within 2012, built exploiting only private sponsorships. Italy is running the race with the so called Team Italia: a mainly academic consortium supported by three important space involved national companies. To support the project, the Aerospace Engineering Department of Politecnico di Milano tailored an under development virtual simulator on the lunar mission scenario: at this early phase of the project the robustness of the sensorsarclhteeturc can be checked; to visualize the rover behaviour on the surface greatly helps the designers revising and refining the preliminary choices. Moreover, activity planning, operation sequences and operational modes can be easier defined and cross checked. The effects {{of a lot of}} faulty conditions may be analyzed to better understand how to cope with either through the design or during operational phases. The simulator here presented supplies: the representation of our satellite environment; orbital mechanics features to let the user identify the visibility windows between the rover antenna and a selected ground station on Earth; representation of the rover - user defined - according to the current design; a navigation module, to define the safe path according to the current map of the environment surrounding the rover; the multi-body model of the rover integrated in the simulation environment, including the traction control of the wheels. The drivers for designing the simulator architecture and selecting the implementation environment for the <b>tool</b> were the <b>portability</b> and the flexibility. The simulator, in fact, must provide a software framework for testing different levels of autonomy - plug-in of external modules and tools must be easy - simulated hardware must be simply redefineable to support the system design process; validation of different granularity of the mission plan shall be feasible The proposed tool merges a physic and a graphic (Irrlicht) engine. Irrlicht is a cross-platform high performance real-time 3 D engine; it is a high level API for creating complete 3 D and 2 D applications like games or scientific visualizations. It comes with a wide documentation and integrates all the state-of-the-art features for visual representation like dynamic shadows, particle systems, character animation, indoor and outdoor technology. The engine is open source. The virtual environment contains all physical properties of the planetary surface, rock distribution and terrain properties, exploited to evaluate the interaction with the rover. The map of the soil properties is an output of the tool, the user can select the soil type, introducing the soil parameters or a predefined soil class; currently the data of Lunar and Martian surface are available, but the tool is highly flexible and configurable. The tool exploits those inputs to build the soil map. The navigation module solves the pathplanning problem by applying a potential field method, the target position attracts the rover while obstacles repulse it; therefore, the global effects on the rover, evaluated at each step, determines the future travelling direction. The rover simulator is going to be exploited by the Team Italia to check for rover operations feasibility and robustness both in nominal and possibly faulty scenarios and to validate the design before starting integrating the whole system.
