30|$|Ever {{since people}} began {{manipulating}} land, various approaches and techniques were practiced to reduce degradation of watershed resources.

40|$|This book {{challenges}} the accepted {{notion that the}} transition from the command economy to market based systems is complete across the post-Soviet space. While it is noted that different political economies have developed in such states, such as Russia’s ‘managed democracy’, events such as Ukraine gaining ‘market economy status’ by the European Union and acceding to the World Trade Organisation in 2008 are taken as evidence that the reform period is over. Such thinking is based on numerous assumptions; specifically that economic transition has defined start and end points, that the formal economy now has primacy over other forms of economic practices and that national economic growth leads to the ‘trickle down’ of wealth to those marginalised by the transition process. Based on extensive ethnographic and quantitative research, conducted in Ukraine and Russia between 2004 - 2007, this book questions these assumptions by stating that the economies that operate across post-Soviet spaces are far from the textbook idea of a market economy. <b>Through</b> <b>this</b> the <b>whole</b> notion of ‘transition’ is problematised and the importance of informal economies to everyday life is demonstrated. Using case studies of various sectors, such as entrepreneurial behaviour and the higher education system, it is also shown how corruption has invaded almost all sectors of the post-Soviet every day...|$|R

We therefore have decided to move him to indefinite probation and waive the Chase requirement. He has fully complied with our reinstatement program during his suspension and the health care expert who conducted his evaluation recommended his immediate return. We have made it very clear to Kurt Busch our expectations for him moving forward, which includes participation in a treatment program and full compliance with all judicial requirements {{as a result of his}} off-track behavior." [...] A statement released by NASCAR executive vice-president Steve O'Donnell, relating to Kurt Busch's reinstatement. The entry list for the CampingWorld.com 500 was released on Monday, March 9, 2015 at 10:16 a.m. Eastern time. Forty-seven drivers were entered for the race, but was reduced to 46 after Ron Hornaday, Jr. and The Motorsports Group withdrew from the event. This was further reduced to 45 after Reed Sorenson's RAB Racing Toyota withdrew. Team owner Robby Benton stated that the team had [...] "no need to chase points" [...] and that [...] "after missing Las Vegas, it made sense to skip Phoenix and take the added time to better prepare for California". All 45 who were entered at Las Vegas, except for Ryan Blaney, Ty Dillon and Michael McDowell, were entered for Phoenix. The only car with a different driver was Tanner Berryhill - making his Sprint Cup début - driving in place of Mike Wallace in the No. 66 Premium Motorsports Chevrolet. Alex Kennedy was named the driver of the No. 33 Hillman-Circle Sport LLC Chevrolet. On Wednesday, March 11, NASCAR reinstated Kurt Busch and cleared him to return to active driving. As a result, he retook his No. 41 Chevrolet that has been driven by Regan Smith the last three races. In a statement, Busch stated that he understood [...] "why NASCAR needed to take the action that it did", while also stating that [...] "the important factor is that what I was accused of was a complete fabrication, and I never wavered <b>through</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> process because of the confidence in the truth, and I had the support from Gene Haas and everybody at SHR, and that's where my focus has been".|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{children}} in a fourth and fifth grade Swedish primary school class and their play during breaktimes. The study takes the theoretical point of departure in seeing children’s breaktime play as a cultural historical activity. The overarching research problem concerns breaktime play emphasising the phenomena of children’s negotiation, participation and agency. It concerns how breaktime play takes shape and which capacities children possess, who are breaktime play literate, to participate and to uphold play. What {{is the significance of}} children’s capacity to negotiate rules and roles? How do they use culturally, historically developed objects and motives to transform and expand established versions of play and games? The research problem foregrounds how the play activity emerges, is carried out and how participation is enabled through negotiation. The aim of the study is to explore the phenomena of children’s negotiation and agency in dialectical change processes in breaktime play activity. The questions explored are:  RQ: What are the mechanisms in dialectical processes of collectividual action and collective object transformation in children’s play activity?  How does the play activity emerge? How does the object of the play activity transform? The data consists of field notes from participant observations and of audio memos. Audio memos, short smartphone recordings of the children’s verbal reflections on aspects of their actions and experiences, were continuously produced to get the children’s verbal reflections in the immediacy of acting. Various documents and interviews form additional data. The findings show how the children negotiate involvement, rules, role set-up and the hierarchy of demands as a continuous elaboration of the conditions to establish and maintain boundaries of playfully accomplished activity. The notion of negotiagency is introduced, uncovering that breaktime play literacy does not occur in the children’s minds apart from social interaction but develops in and through negotiation. Negotiagency emerges and is realised when the children are engaged in a playfully accomplished activity. The dialectical processes of collectividual action and collective object transformation in playfully accomplished activity are enabled <b>through</b> negotiation. <b>This</b> <b>whole</b> mechanism is referred to as Dialectics of Negotiagency...|$|R
