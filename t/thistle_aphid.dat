5000|$|Brachycaudus cardui is {{a species}} of aphid, {{commonly}} known as the <b>thistle</b> <b>aphid</b> or the plum-thistle aphid. It infests trees in the genus Prunus in the spring and autumn, and mostly plants in the aster family in the summer.|$|E
50|$|The {{viviparous}} wingless {{females have}} an oval or pear-shaped body and grow to {{a length of}} up to 2 mm. Early in the season they are brownish but later they are yellowish-green. The antennae are pale green and short, about half {{the length of the}} body. There is no dark, shining patch on the dorsal surface of the abdomen, a fact which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar <b>thistle</b> <b>aphid</b> (Brachycaudus cardui). The cauda (tail-like elongation) is bluntly rounded, the legs are pale except for the extremities, and the cornicles are pale-coloured, short and flanged. Winged females range from 1.3 to 1.8 mm in length and have a blackish head with longer antennae, blackish thorax and a green abdomen with dark spots on the third to sixth segments. The overwintering eggs are black.|$|E
