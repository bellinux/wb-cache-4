While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Blush finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which scans his eye. Bond is seen by Blush, who sends an assassin to kill him in the clinic gym, but Bond manages to defeat the assassin.|$|E

5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E
5|$|Fairley tackled an {{outbreak}} of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered {{of their own accord}} but some cases of shigellosis became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug was administered <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} {{will be unable}} to provide care <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient,</b> either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E
5|$|The deadliest fire in Davenport history came on January 7, 1950, when 41 {{people were}} killed in a fire at the St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a mental ward {{operated}} by Mercy Hospital. Most of the people who lost their lives were female patients trapped behind windows locked shut by rusty, iron bars. The cause was attributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> who was lighting curtains on fire with a cigarette lighter.|$|E
5|$|An infant with {{a severe}} heart {{condition}} is admitted in neonatology, and is revealed to have been abandoned in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. When a patient, Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient,</b> making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, thus ruining her emotionally, but subsequently apologizes. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back to work so early. Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, causing him to cry in front of Meredith and Yang.|$|E

He also does not know of any of his surgeon colleagues having inflicted injury <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> liver during <b>an</b> appendectomy.

25|$|A common {{example of}} overuse of {{echocardiography}} when not indicated {{is the use}} of routine testing in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> diagnosis of mild valvular heart disease. In this case, patients are often asymptomatic for years before the onset of deterioration and the results of the echocardiogram would not result in a change in care without other change in clinical status.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Israeli {{physician}} Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> {{critically ill}} with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL), a painful skin condition, {{one of the}} complications of leprosy. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours {{and was able to}} get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.|$|E
25|$|Gene therapy {{refers to}} a form of {{treatment}} where a healthy gene is introduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient.</b> This should alleviate the defect caused by a faulty gene or slow the progression of disease. A major obstacle has been the delivery of genes to the appropriate cell, tissue, and organ affected by the disorder. How does one introduce a gene into the potentially trillions of cells which carry the defective copy? This question has been the roadblock between understanding the genetic disorder and correcting the genetic disorder.|$|E

50|$|In {{the timing}} diagram, the {{horizontal}} axis represents time. The vertical axis represents: (top row) amplitude of radio frequency pulses; (middle rows) amplitudes {{of the three}} orthogonal magnetic field gradient pulses; and (bottom row) receiver analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Radio frequencies are transmitted at the Larmor frequency of the nuclide to be imaged. For example, for 1H in a magnetic field of 1 T, a frequency of 42.5781 MHz would be employed. The three field gradients are labeled GX (typically corresponding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> left-to-right direction and colored red in diagram), GY (typically corresponding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> front-to-back direction and colored green in diagram), and GZ (typically corresponding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> head-to-toe direction and colored blue in diagram). Where negative-going gradient pulses are shown, they represent reversal of the gradient direction, i.e., right-to-left, back-to-front or toe-to-head. For human scanning, gradient strengths of 1-100 mT/m are employed: Higher gradient strengths permit better resolution and faster imaging. The pulse sequence shown here would produce a transverse (axial) image.|$|R
