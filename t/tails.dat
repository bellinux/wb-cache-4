40|$|<b>Tail</b> biting in pigs is a {{widespread}} behavioural vice with significant animal welfare and economic consequences. All too often, <b>tail</b> biting is not diagnosed nor dealt with until <b>tail</b> damage is present. To effectively reduce {{the negative effects of}} <b>tail</b> biting, it must be diagnosed in an early stage. So far no predictors for <b>tail</b> damage have been found. Predictors that recognise <b>tail</b> biting in an early stage, however, would be helpful in practice. We tested the hypothesis that <b>tail</b> behaviour can predict <b>tail</b> damage. To analyse this, we observed <b>tail</b> posture, <b>tail</b> motion and <b>tail</b> damage of 992 weaned piglets on an experimental farm with known <b>tail</b> biting problems. <b>Tail</b> posture (curled <b>tail,</b> hanging <b>tail</b> or <b>tail</b> between legs), <b>tail</b> motion (motionless, wagging or intense wagging) and <b>tail</b> damage (no damage, bite marks or a <b>tail</b> wound) were observed three times a week during the 32 days post-weaning period. Results showed that both <b>tail</b> posture and <b>tail</b> motion were related to <b>tail</b> damage at the same observation moment (P 0. 05). When a piglet was observed with a curled <b>tail</b> (and no <b>tail</b> damage), the chance of bite marks or a <b>tail</b> wound 2 – 3 days later were 8. 6 % and 3. 5 %. When a piglet was observed with its <b>tail</b> between the legs (and no <b>tail</b> damage), the chance of bite marks or a <b>tail</b> wound 2 – 3 days later increased to 22. 3 % and 8. 5 %. Furthermore, when a piglet was observed with its <b>tail</b> between the legs (and no <b>tail</b> damage) in two consecutive observations, the chance of bite marks or a <b>tail</b> wound 2 – 3 days later increased to 32. 4 % and 23. 7 %. It was concluded that a piglet's <b>tail</b> posture is strongly related to <b>tail</b> damage at the same moment and can predict <b>tail</b> damage 2 – 3 days later. Checking <b>tail</b> postures on a regular basis increases early recognition of <b>tail</b> biting. This can help pig producers to take appropriate measures to prevent further escalation of the problem...|$|R

We daily measured {{the length of the}} regenerative <b>tail</b> and of the remaining <b>tail</b> in 20 % to 60 % <b>tail</b> removal treatments.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Tail</b> biting is {{a common}} and serious welfare problem in pig production, causing large {{economical}} losses. <b>Tail</b> docking is performed routinely in most EU countries to reduce the <b>tail</b> biting risk. However, <b>tail</b> docking is painful, and does not prevent <b>tail</b> biting totally. The risk factors behind <b>tail</b> docking are multifactorial and most analyses are based on studies using biological or epidemiological approaches. There is very little information available on how producers deal with <b>tail</b> biting on-farm. There are also no studies on the attitude of producers towards <b>tail</b> docking and <b>tail</b> biting in systems with long-tailed pigs. We aimed to study how farmers rate the efficiency of different measures for preventing and intervening with <b>tail</b> biting, when <b>tail</b> docking is not allowed. Furthermore, we investigated the attitudes of Finnish farmers to <b>tail</b> docking and <b>tail</b> biting. Results Respondents scored feeding-related issues to be most important for prevention of <b>tail</b> biting, identifying and removing the biting pig as most important intervention measures, and straw {{as the most important}} manipulable material when preventing <b>tail</b> biting. <b>Tail</b> biting was not perceived as a very serious problem by over 70  % of the respondents, even though docking is not allowed, and was reported to occur close to a level which was also considered acceptable by the respondents. Most respondents did not think it is probable they would raise <b>tail</b> docked pigs if it were possible, but about 21  % probably would. Conclusions In comparison with other authors’ findings, the ranking of importance of risk factors for <b>tail</b> biting differs between scientists and farmers, and between farmers in different cultures of pig production. In addition, the attitude towards <b>tail</b> biting and <b>tail</b> docking appears to be very different in producers with different experiences of <b>tail</b> docking. These results indicate that a scientist-farmer dialogue, as well as international communication is important when trying {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>tail</b> biting, and subsequently the need for <b>tail</b> docking...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tail</b> biting is {{an adverse}} {{behaviour}} characterised by manipulation of a pig’s <b>tail</b> by another pig resulting in <b>tail</b> damage {{and a possible}} <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. <b>Tail</b> biting is a common problem in the pig husbandry causing economic losses and reduced animal welfare worldwide. To prevent <b>tail</b> biting, the majority of newborn piglets are <b>tail</b> docked, a procedure which is not only painful but generates more and more public concern. This emphasizes the need to prevent the occurrences of <b>tail</b> biting without having to dock a pig’s <b>tail.</b> So far, research focused mainly on the risk factors that can induce <b>tail</b> biting. However, the way a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak evolves {{in a group of}} pigs (the ‘aetiology’) is still poorly understood. For that reason, the main aim of this thesis was to gain more insight in the aetiology of a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. This will not only enhance our understanding of the current preventive and curative treatments of <b>tail</b> biting, but can also generate more effective measures to prevent, predict and counteract a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. Therefore, the development of <b>tail</b> biting behaviour and <b>tail</b> damage was studied in relation to preventive and curative measures, group composition and indicators for an upcoming <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. The results showed that the provision of twice daily a handful of long straw strongly reduced <b>tail</b> biting. Furthermore, this measure was also effective in counteracting an ongoing <b>tail</b> biting outbreak (an outbreak was defined as the first day with a minimum of one piglet with a <b>tail</b> wound or two piglets with bite marks in a pen), although this outbreak could not be totally eliminated. In pens without straw almost all pigs performed and received <b>tail</b> biting behaviour at low levels prior to a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. However, considerable variation in <b>tail</b> biting behaviour between pigs was found. In most pens one or a few pigs could be identified as pronounced biters prior to the <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. Although less clear, often one or a few pigs could similarly be identified as pronounced victims. In mixed-sex pens male pigs developed <b>tail</b> damage most rapidly, while in single-sex pens the quickest <b>tail</b> damage development was found in all-female groups. These results indicate that female pigs are more likely to become biters and male pigs are more likely to become victims. More detailed study of pronounced biters and victims showed that prior to a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak, biters not only directed more of their biting behaviour to their penmates’ <b>tail,</b> but also to the enrichment device. Victims were the heavier pigs in the pen and tended to be more often male and more restless preceding an outbreak. Victims also performed more aggressive behaviour, while biters tended to receive more aggressive behaviour. Furthermore, it was found that <b>tail</b> posture is a predictor for <b>tail</b> damage. Pigs with their <b>tail</b> between the legs had a higher chance of <b>tail</b> damage 2 - 3 days later. Based on the results of this research an aetiology model of a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak was developed. Subsequently practical suggestions were given to prevent (e. g. providing effective environmental enrichment), predict (e. g. observing the pigs’ <b>tail</b> posture) and counteract (e. g. removing the biter) a <b>tail</b> biting outbreak. This provides opportunities to omit <b>tail</b> docking without the negative consequence of <b>tail</b> biting...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tail</b> biting {{behaviour}} in pigs is {{a common}} problem in conventional housing systems. Our study examined the consistency over time in <b>tail</b> biting and <b>tail</b> damage and it explored the predictive value of general behaviours observed in individual pigs and in pens as a whole. Pigs (n = 480), reared in conventional farrowing pens with a sow crate, were followed from pre-weaning to slaughter (23 weeks). Post-weaning, piglets were housed barren (B) or enriched (E). Behaviours were observed pre-weaning (averaged per litter) and post-weaning in three phases (weaner, grower, finisher) (averaged per pig/phase). <b>Tail</b> damage of individual pigs was scored weekly from weaning (4 weeks) onwards (averaged per phase). Relationships between <b>tail</b> biting and <b>tail</b> damage with behaviour were investigated both at individual and pen level using mixed or generalized linear mixed models and Spearman's rank correlations, respectively. <b>Tail</b> biting and <b>tail</b> damage (2. 1 ± 0. 05, 1 = no <b>tail</b> damage, 4 = <b>tail</b> wound) were already observed pre-weaning. Post-weaning, <b>tail</b> biting and <b>tail</b> damage were less prevalent in E compared to B housing (P < 0. 001). <b>Tail</b> biting behaviour in individual pigs was not consistently observed over time, i. e. none of the pigs was <b>tail</b> biter in all three phases, so new <b>tail</b> biters were found in later phases {{and some of the}} already identified <b>tail</b> biters stopped <b>tail</b> biting completely or temporarily. In B housing 38. 3 % and in E housing 5. 6 % of pigs was identified as <b>tail</b> biter in at least one phase post-weaning. B housed <b>tail</b> biters in different phases were likely to originate from litters with a relatively high level of <b>tail</b> biting behaviour pre-weaning (P < 0. 05 – 0. 01). Generally, post-weaning victims were likely to be a victim again in successive phases of life (B: P < 0. 10 – 0. 001; E: P < 0. 01). <b>Tail</b> biting and <b>tail</b> damage were best predicted by behaviours at pen level and less by behaviours at the individual level: a higher activity, and more pig and pen-directed manipulative behaviours were observed in pens with high levels of <b>tail</b> biting. Particularly higher levels of chewing or consuming objects such as jute sacks could be useful in predicting <b>tail</b> bite outbreaks. To conclude, <b>tail</b> biting in pigs starts early in life and is difficult to predict due to its inconsistency, although <b>tail</b> damage is more consistent throughout life. Especially behaviour observed at litter or pen level is a promising tool in predicting <b>tail</b> biting and <b>tail</b> damage...|$|R
