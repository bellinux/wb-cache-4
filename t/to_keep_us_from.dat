500|$|Desiring {{their own}} home stadium, in the early 1970s the Giants reached an {{agreement}} with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to play their home games at a brand-new, state-of-the-art, dedicated football stadium. Some New Yorkers were furious and Mayor John Lindsay had attempted to keep the team in the city by proposing to buy Yankee Stadium and renovate it at a cost of $24 million. Lindsay estimated that they brought $3 million to the city, and was anxious to keep that revenue, as well as satisfy New York Giant fans. Axthlem characterized the Giants fan base at the time as mostly [...] "white, suburban and fairly well to do, and its members drive cars to football games." [...] The battle became nasty with members of the New York City side claiming that the Maras [...] "complained of how inconvenient it was for them to park, or for them to get out to the neighborhood." [...] They claimed the Maras [...] "never really negotiated. They just listened...I think they were afraid if they asked for something, we might give it to them—and they wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> offering a deal that they couldn't turn down." [...] In fact, the Maras had already made the agreement {{to move out of the}} city, even though Wellington was still placating the city. He felt this was a factor in the Mara's decision to move the stadium, as the attendees could drive to their New Jersey stadium as opposed to traveling through the Bronx to Yankee Stadium. The new stadium, which would become known as Giants Stadium, was to be built at a brand new sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The decision met with outrage from some New Yorkers, and the city's mayor John Lindsay sought legal action to prevent the team from playing in Yankee Stadium — or anywhere else in New York — and demanded a congressional investigation into the deal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} {{a debate}} over banning gay and lesbian marriage occurred in the Minnesota Legislature. On the House floor Lindner claimed that allowing same-sex marriage would {{open the door to}} [...] "a man marrying a child or a man marrying a dog." [...] Openly gay State Rep. Karen Clark (whose partner, parents, and her partner's parents were attending the debate) expressed dismay at the comment. Lindner told her “I don't know why you felt that was insulting. I was trying to make a point, that we've got a norm of one man, one woman. Once we begin to deviate...what's <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> having to pass laws to allow a man to marry several women, or a man and a boy relationship -- and there [...] are people who would like to have that. When we start changing that definition of marriage, that does open up the door to others who will say 'Why not us?'” He told Clark that while he saw her as “one of God’s creations. ...I personally don't think the lifestyle you've chosen and other homosexuals have chosen is really good [...] for you, your partner or society. ...I'm talking in general, the HIV/AIDS problem, other diseases. It probably affects more homosexual men. ...I don't know of any [...] couple, where they've been faithful to each other, a man and a woman, has any fear of any sexually transmitted disease unless they have to get a blood transfusion. ...you're living in sin." [...] He also stated [...] "I don't believe adoption of children by homosexual couples is [...] {{in the best interests of}} children." [...] (In 1997 Minnesota enacted the Marriage Protection Act defining marriage as a [...] "civil contract between a man and a woman" [...] and stating that [...] "Lawful marriage may be contracted only between persons of the opposite sex".) ...|$|E

5000|$|On 23 January, Iraq dumped [...] {{of crude}} oil into the Persian Gulf , causing the largest {{offshore}} oil spill in history at that time.

About 30-40% of this came from allied raids on Iraqi coastal targets.|$|R
5000|$|Undercover has {{received}} critical acclaim {{as well as}} becoming a hit with viewers, managing to attract a strong audience from its debut. Critic Emil Antonov said the show [...] "offers viewers a dynamic and tense atmosphere, and interesting characters in a crime drama attractive {{to much of the}} native audience. Although many of the stories in the new Bulgarian cinema navigate around the time of transition and development of crime in Bulgaria, Dimitar Mitovski manages to break this pattern.

Trying to be too clever was considered at the time to be going in another direction. Whether it has helped us in the long run is questionable. We were maybe cleverer in those early years, which could have introduced us to new things - but it never happened, apart from [...] "How Does It Feel".

"My father knew," [...] {{said the}} grave-digger, [...] "and {{he told me}} the reason too; but since we are under the republic, we have given up remembering those old-world legends, as we used <b>to.</b> The {{newspapers}} <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> talking in the chimney-corner; and so things go out of our minds. An old man, with his stories of what he has seen, and what his great- grandfather saw before him, is of little account since newspapers came up.

6000|$|... [232] Thus we read of {{some who}} were once enlightened, and had tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers {{of the world}} to come (Heb. 6:6). It is hard to say how far or how long a person may carry on a profession, and yet fall away, and come short of the kingdom at last. This should excite to diligence, humility, and circumspection, ever looking to Jesus <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> falling-(Mason).|$|E

25|$|Hughes's poetry was {{frequently}} {{published in the}} CPUSA newspaper and {{he was involved in}} initiatives supported by Communist organizations, such as the drive to free the Scottsboro Boys. Partly as a show of support for the Republican faction during the Spanish Civil War, in 1937 Hughes traveled to Spain as a correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American and other various African-American newspapers. In August 1937 he broadcast live from Madrid alongside Harry Haywood and Walter Benjamin Garland. Hughes was also involved in other Communist-led organizations such as the John Reed Clubs and the League of Struggle for Negro Rights. He was more of a sympathizer than an active participant. He signed a 1938 statement supporting Joseph Stalin's purges and joined the American Peace Mobilization in 1940 working <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> participating in World War II.|$|R

50|$|In 1940, Marcantonio helped {{form the}} American Peace Mobilization (AMP), a group whose aim was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> {{participating}} in World War II (thus similar in aim to the rightist America First Committee). Before the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (a Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact) {{was signed in}} Moscow 23 August 1939, the AMP's precursor organization, the Comintern-directed American League Against War and Fascism, had been anti-Nazi. Marcantonio served as the AMP's vice-chair. He appeared in a newsreel in 1940 denouncing 'the imperialist war', the line taken by Joseph Stalin and his supporters in the Soviet Union until {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union by Nazi Germany. The Pact lasted until the Germans broke it by invading the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. In 1942 Marcantonio worked to expand the U.S. military commitment to a second front in Europe against the Nazi expansion. The USSR ordered Communists throughout the world to promote the idea to help it defeat Nazism. Marcantonio was also a Vice President of the International Workers Order, a fraternal benefit society unofficially affiliated with the Communist Party.|$|R
60|$|Here a {{scene of}} tumult succeeded. The table was nearly overturned. Bottles, glasses, and tankards, rolled {{crashing}} and clattering about the floor.

5000|$|Pro-whaling advocates {{argue that}} the {{economic}} analysis assumes unsustainable whaling by arguing that whaling deprives the whale-watching industry of whales, and counter that if whales are hunted on a sustainable basis, there is no competition between the two industries. Furthermore, {{they point out that}} most whaling takes place outside of coastal areas where whale watching takes place, and communication between any whaling fleet and whale-watching boats would ensure that whaling and whale watching occurred in different areas. Pro-whaling advocates also argue that whaling continues to provide employment in the fishery, logistic and restaurant industries and that whale blubber can be converted into valuable oleochemicals while whale carcasses can be rendered into meat and bone meal. Poorer whaling nations {{argue that the}} need for resumption of whaling is pressing. Horace Walters, from the Eastern Caribbean Cetacean Commission stated, [...] "We have islands which may want to start whaling again - it's expensive to import food from the developed world, and we believe there's a deliberate attempt <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> away <b>from</b> our resources so we continue to develop those countries' economies by importing from them." ...|$|R
5000|$|They {{also agreed}} that [...] "we shall {{by all means}} labor <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> off <b>from</b> <b>us</b> all such as are {{contrary}} minded, and receive only such unto us as may be probably of one heart with us, such as that we either know or may well and truly be informed to walk in a peaceable conversation with all meekness of spirit, this for the edification {{of each other in}} the knowledge and faith of the Lord Jesus…" [...] The covenant also stipulated that if differences were to arise between townsmen, they would seek arbitration for resolution and each would pay his fair share for the common good.|$|R
2500|$|Philosophy of {{education}}: in {{his book}} Empathic education – a critique of neo-capitalism [...] (published in Hebrew 2008), Lampert extends his social criticism. He analyses the post-modern education system and argues that social exclusion, alienation and failure is an inherent part of a social reproduction ideology. The critical analysis reveals {{the gap between the}} smug self-image of those engaged in education, and the harsh and violent face of the system, of which teachers are victims as much as students. As an alternative, Lampert offers a return to the roots of educational practice; i.e. the human-encounter based on our natural empathy, especially in its radical form. This type of resistance, means a radical change in school, that like other cultural institutions, is built <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> all away <b>from</b> authentic human encounter.|$|R
