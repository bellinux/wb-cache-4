5|$|With Delilah {{being too}} {{powerful}} to defeat by normal means, Sokolov suggests the player investigate {{the home of}} mining magnate Aramis Stilton (Richard Cansino). Upon entering Stilton's mansion, the player discovers that he had gone insane after witnessing Delilah's resurrection. With {{the aid of a}} <b>timepiece</b> granted by the Outsider, the player travels back in time and observes the Duke, Jindosh, and Ashworth pull Delilah from the Void. Afterwards, Delilah siphons part of her soul into a statue, effectively making her immortal. The player invades the Duke's palace to eliminate him and retrieve Delilah's soul. After either killing the Duke or working with his body double to depose him, the player finds the statue and extracts Delilah's soul. With Delilah's soul in hand, the player returns to Dunwall for a final confrontation with Delilah. After reuniting Delilah with her soul, the player may choose to kill Delilah or trick her into trapping herself inside her own painting.|$|E
5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate <b>timepiece.</b> Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E

25|$|The two buildings, {{the town}} hall and the Victoria Memorial Hall, were joined {{together}} by a clock tower built in 1906 {{to give the impression}} of a single building. The 54 metre-high tower connects the two buildings with a common corridor, and is topped by a <b>timepiece</b> donated by the Straits Trading Company. The tower is built on an axial line with the Anderson Bridge nearby. Renovation of the Town Hall began in July 1906.

25|$|The Bay Observatory {{building}} {{is the only}} new building constructed on the Exploratorium’s campus. It holds the Seaglass restaurant on its lower level and exhibits on the upper level relating to the waterfront and the cityscape. The gallery focuses on what visitors can see in real time, including the movement of clouds and tides, the changing waterfront, the movement of ships, and interpretation of oceanographic data. The Observatory has glass walls on all four sides to facilitate observation. Many of the exhibits were developed specifically for the location, such as Oculus (a circular opening in the ceiling that allows the entire gallery {{to be used as}} a <b>timepiece,</b> tracking seasons, solstices, and the sun’s movement), Visualizing the Bay (a 3-D topographic map of the Bay Area that allows visitors to see real data mapped over the landscape, such as the movement of fog and the salinity of the Bay over the course of days or years), and the Map Table (an assortment of historic and contemporary maps and atlases displaying different views and perspectives on the landscape).|$|E
25|$|At {{its base}} is a porte-cochere within four {{equilateral}} pointed arches, {{the north of}} which frames the main entrance of the Centre Block, and the jambs of the south adorned by the supporters of the Royal Arms of Canada. Near the apex, just below the steeply pitched roof, are the tower's 4.8m (16ft) diameter clock faces, one {{on each of the}} four facades. The mechanical workings of the <b>timepiece</b> were manufactured by the Verdin Company and are set by the National Research Council Time Signal. One level below, running around the circumference of the tower's shaft, is an observation deck. This was the highest accessible space in Ottawa until the early 1970s; the Peace Tower dominated the Ottawa skyline, as a strict 45.7m (150ft) height limit was placed on other buildings. That limit, however, was later rescinded, leading the Peace Tower to lose its distinction as the city's tallest structure. Cantilevered out at each of the four corners of the tower, {{at the level of the}} observation platform, are four 2.5 m (8ft 4 in) long, 75cm (2ft 6 in) high, and 45cm (1ft 6 in) thick gargoyles made of Stanstead grey granite from Beebe, Quebec.|$|E

500|$|Chronometers were {{formerly}} {{used for}} the accurate determination of longitude by ships at sea. [...] By measuring the time of local solar noon compared {{to the time of}} noon at a reference point the difference in longitude can be directly found. [...] For this system to work, a <b>timepiece</b> showing the time at the reference point must be carried to the measuring point. [...] A <b>timepiece</b> intended to remain accurate while subjected to the motions of a ship at sea and through extreme changes in environment, especially temperature, is called a chronometer. [...] These were first built in the 18th century and were used extensively by mariners in the 19th century and into the 20th century, even after the widespread use of radio for time signals – the time signal was used to set the chronometer, but the instrument was still necessary to display the time.|$|E
500|$|Although a {{harsh winter}} {{sometimes}} made work difficult, {{construction of the}} courthouse progressed far enough that work on the large (3 stories high) arch on the southern façade began during February 1894.

[...] Much of the carving work around the building's entrances was conducted under Mr. Steuber's direction. [...] The building’s cornice was finished in April, and {{nearly all of the}} structure’s stone was cut by that time.

500|$|Along {{with the}} {{conventional}} rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent synthesizers to their sound. For example, the band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on [...] "Brain Damage" [...] and [...] "Any Colour You Like", and a Synthi A on [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "On the Run". [...] They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, {{such as an}} assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during [...] "On the Run"), and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat (during [...] "Speak to Me", [...] "On the Run", [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "Eclipse"). [...] This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, {{but it can also}} be heard sporadically on [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "On the Run". The assorted clocks ticking then chiming simultaneously at the start of [...] "Time", accompanied by a series of Rototoms, were initially created as a quadraphonic test by Parsons. The engineer recorded each <b>timepiece</b> at an antique clock shop, and although his recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of the material were eventually used in the track.|$|E

2500|$|A banjo {{clock is}} a wall clock with an {{inverted}} banjo-shaped case.
