2500|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II in Europe the French mandate {{may be said to}} {{have been}} {{terminated}} without any formal action {{on the part of the}} League of Nations or its successor the United Nations. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: [...] "The <b>trusteeship</b> <b>system</b> shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality." [...] So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members, as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained.

Using Kosovo {{as a case}} study, Bernhard Knoll analyses {{the identity of the}} administrating UN organ, {{the ways in which the}} territories under consideration have acquired partial subjectivity in international law and the nature of legal obligations in the fiduciary exercise of transitional administration developed within the League of Nations’ Mandate and the UN <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>systems.</b> Knoll discusses Kosovo’s internal political and constitutional order and notes the absence of some of the characteristics normally found in liberal democracies, before proposing that the UN consolidates accountability guidelines related to the protection of human rights and the development of democratic standards should it engage in the transitional administration of territory. • Examines the human rights obligations of international organisations assuming functions of government, highlighting to the reader areas in which UN territorial governance is problematic • Discusses the legitimacy for Chapter VII-mandated UN governance missions that assume control over territories, using an interdisciplinary approach • Discusses what constitutes a ‘person’ in international law, thus providing an overview of claims to legal personality by UN-administered entities, and makes clear their connection to claims to self-determination.

50|$|Although the Spanish <b>trusteeship</b> labor <b>system,</b> or encomienda {{had been}} {{abolished}} in 1720, most natives {{at the time}} living in the Andean region {{of what is now}} Ecuador and Bolivia, who made up nine tenths of the population were still pushed into forced labor for what were legally labeled as public work projects. However, most natives worked under the supervision of a master either tilling soil, mining or working in textile mills. What little wage that was acquired by workers was heavily taxed and cemented Native-American indebtedness to Spanish masters. The Roman Catholic Church also had a hand in extorting these natives through collections for saints, masses for the dead, domestic and parochial work on certain days, forced gifts, etc. Those not employed in forced labor were still subject to the Spanish provincial governors, or corregidores who also heavily taxed any free natives, similarly ensuring their financial instability.|$|R
40|$|On March 21 1990, Namibia {{became an}} {{independent}} state after 70 years of being a mandated territory under South African control. This thesis examines the dialectical relationship between power politics and international law in securing this outcome. From the beginning when South West Africa became a pawn in the European {{balance of power in}} the late 19 th century, its atypical nature amongst other colonial territories reflected the ambiguous relationship between power politics and law. The Namibia conflict was essentially driven by balance of power politics. As this thesis demonstrates, it was at once a creation, a victim and a beneficiary of power politics. Nonetheless, while power drove the conflict, law constrained it. Indeed, its history paradoxically demonstrated a degree of complementarity between the two. By itself, international law was impotent to secure change in opposition to the realities of power and the interests of the great powers. On the other hand, the Namibian question was posed within the legal framework of the international arrangements for the transfer of power, i. e. mandate <b>system,</b> <b>trusteeship,</b> and decolonization regimes. At each stage, the complex and changing relationship between power and law became manifest. From the establishment of the mandate system in 1920, the ideas of self-determination and international accountability were ingrained in the consciousness of the metropolitan power. These ideas survived to influence much of the transfer of power debate. They did not stop power politics, but over the long term, they changed the legal framework within which it operated. Consequently, international law served as an institutional device for communicating the prevailing norms of the international community to the South Africa government and restrained South Africa from annexing Namibia. Yet international law alone could never create the optimal balance of incentives and costs necessary to resolve the Namibian issue. However, as the conflict became externalized within the Cold War, the United States, acting out of self-interest in containing Soviet expansionism in Southern Africa, discovered that a solution was an effective means of achieving this objective. Thus Namibia was a beneficiary of power politics, and the international community finally sanctioned the outcome...|$|R

It advances three arguments. First, UN membership represents an explicit commitment by the member state to abide by the charter. Failure to comply due to state incapacitation triggering the R 2 P and causing a threat to international peace and stability represents a de facto condition of suspended sovereignty. Second, since UN membership depends on sovereignty, such situation entails consequences regarding membership provisions.

40|$|Why do {{peacekeeping}} agencies, {{such as the}} United Nations, pursue certain {{strategies and}} not others? Most accounts suggest that peacekeeping mandates reflect the interests of major parties, along with perceptions of how effectively certain strategies will accomplish the goals of peacekeeping. This article argues that another factor — the international normative environment, sometimes called ‘global culture ’ — also shapes the design of peacekeeping operations in fundamental ways. Peacekeeping agencies seem predisposed to adopt strategies that conform with global culture, and to reject strategies that they view as normatively inappropriate, even if the rejected strategies are potentially more likely to accomplish the goals of peacekeeping. Changes in the international norms have been accompanied by corresponding shifts in peacekeeping policy; and UN officials have summarily rejected certain proposals for more effective peacekeeping, including the idea of establishing a new <b>trusteeship</b> <b>system,</b> on largely normative grounds. These observations suggest that global culture limits the range of possible policies that peacekeepers can realistically pursue.

[...] Boston UniversityIt is {{difficult}} to understand petitions as a particular aspect of the <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>System</b> without knowledge of the historical forces which helped to shape the modern concept of trusteeship. It is easy, in fact, to think of trusteeship as a purely contemporary phenomenon. The opening statement of the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the first session of the Trusteeship Council highlights this point: "This is an occasion of historic significance. For {{the first time in}} the world's history a permanent international body, whose membership is composed solely of official representatives of Governments, is assembled to deal exclusively with the problems of non-self-governing peoples. " The statement of the Secretary-General is, of course, correct, but it does not tell the lay reader any of the precedents behind the formation of this August body. If one accepts the principle that the protection of native rights is the cornerstone of modern trusteeship, there is evidence that ever since the 16 th century there seems to have been a logical progression toward the evolution of the philosophy eventually advanced in the Covenant of the League of Nations and presently in the Charter of the United Nations.
