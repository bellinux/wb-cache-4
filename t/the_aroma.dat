5|$|The Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations {{requires}} that the beer should {{be made by the}} alcoholic fermentation of yeast.

5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E

5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. <b>The</b> <b>aroma</b> of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is {{initially}} {{described as an}} animal that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. In defining the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> of meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.|$|E

25|$|Some {{strains of}} O. oeni can {{synthesize}} higher alcohols which {{can contribute to}} fruity notes in <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> of the wine. Additionally, some strains of the bacterium have beta-glucosidase enzymes that can break down monoglucosides which are aroma compounds attached to a sugar molecule.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential for <b>the</b> <b>aromas</b> of <b>the</b> essential oils of Salvia species to affect cognition and mood in healthy adults. Research has demonstrated that orally administered Salvia officinalis and Salvia lavandulaefolia are capable of modulating cognition and mood. The active compounds in the herbal products might also be present in <b>the</b> <b>aromas</b> and so produce similar effects. In an independent groups design, three conditions, S. officinalis aroma, S. lavandulaefolia aroma and no aroma were employed. One hundred and thirty-five healthy volunteers acted as participants, with 45 in each condition. Cognitive performance was assessed via the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System. Bond-Lader mood scales measured the participants' mood on three dimensions {{before and after the}} cognitive tasks. Data analysis revealed that <b>the</b> S. officinalis <b>aroma</b> group performed significantly better than the control group on the quality of memory and secondary memory primary outcome factors from the test battery. The Alert mood measure displayed significant differences between both <b>aromas</b> and <b>the</b> control condition. These findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>aromas</b> of essential oils of Salvia species reproduce some but not all of the effects found following oral herb administration, and that interesting dissociations occur between subjective and objective responses...|$|R
25|$|Wines {{infected}} with L. brevis, L. hilgardii, and L. fermentum {{have been known}} to occasionally develop an aroma reminiscent of rodent droppings. <b>The</b> <b>aroma</b> becomes more pronounced when the wine is rubbed between the fingers and, if consumed, can leave a long, unpleasant finish. <b>The</b> <b>aroma</b> can be very potent, detectable at a sensory threshold as low as 1.6 parts per billion (µg/l). The exact compound behind this is derivatives of the amino acid lysine created through an oxidation reaction with ethanol. While undesirable LAB species have been most commonly associated with this fault, wine infected by Brettanomyces yeast in the presence of ammonium phosphate and lysine have also been known to exhibit this fault.|$|E

25|$|In {{the manner}} of Greek wine, Roman wine was often flavored with herbs and spices (similar to modern vermouth and mulled wine) and was {{sometimes}} stored in resin-coated containers, giving it a flavor similar to modern retsina. Romans were particularly interested in <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> of wine and experimented with various methods of enhancing a wine's bouquet. One technique that gained some usage in southern Gaul was planting herbs such as lavender and thyme in the vineyards, believing that their flavors would pass through the ground and into the grapes. Modern-day wines from the Rhone are often characterized by using <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> descriptors of lavender and thyme, presumably {{as a reflection of}} the grape varieties used and the terroir. Another widespread practice was the storage of amphoras in a smoke chamber called a fumarium to add smokiness to a wine's flavor.|$|E

25|$|In Argentina, writer Alejandro Dolina, in {{his book}} Crónicas del Ángel Gris ("Chronicles of the Gray Angel"), tells the legend of a massive jacarandá tree planted in Plaza Flores (Flores Square) in Buenos Aires, which was able to whistle tango songs on demand.

25|$|The {{scent of}} amber was {{originally}} derived from emulating {{the scent of}} ambergris and/or labdanum but due to the endangered species status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum. The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. Benzoin is usually part of the recipe. Vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance <b>the</b> <b>aroma.</b>|$|E
