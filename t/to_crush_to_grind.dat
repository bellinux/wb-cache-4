50|$|Teams {{were then}} {{instructed}} {{to head to}} the rural town of Idelssan and find Café La Pirgola, where they discovered the Detour: Throw It or Grind It. In Throw It, teams traveled 4 mi to Guedara to a marked pottery shop, where they made two clay pots. The potter would give them their next clue when the pots were made to his specifications. In Grind It, teams traveled 4 mi towards Ouarzazate to North Africa Horse, where they had <b>to</b> use <b>crushing</b> mills <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> 77 lb of olives and pack them into bags. When they had properly crushed and packed the olives, the olive miller would give them their next clue. Each Detour selection only had workstations for three teams. After completing the Detour, teams drove toward Marrakech until they reached a marker, where they turned into the desert to the Berber camp that served as the Pit Stop.|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{antipathy}} is one," [...] continued Miss Petrie, [...] "which {{has been}} common {{on the face}} of the earth since the clown first trod upon the courtier's heels. It is the instinct of fallen man to hate equality, <b>to</b> desire ascendancy, <b>to</b> <b>crush,</b> <b>to</b> oppress, to tyrannise, to enslave. Then, when the slave is at last free, and in his freedom demands--equality, man is not great enough to take his enfranchised brother to his bosom." ...|$|R

500|$|Goldman {{believed}} that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. [...] "The only demand that property recognizes," [...] she wrote in Anarchism and Other Essays, [...] "is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power <b>to</b> subdue, <b>to</b> <b>crush,</b> <b>to</b> exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade." [...] She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, [...] "turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron." ...|$|R

50|$|Abrasion {{occurs when}} larger rock {{particles}} roll and strike against bedrock walls, chipping and splintering particles {{and pieces of}} rock (Strahler and Strahler). As these cobbles and boulders roll across the stream bed, they continue <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> and <b>grind</b> the bedrock, producing an assortment of eroded rock sizes (Ritter, 2006). Again, the severity {{of this type of}} erosion is dependent upon stream velocity and stream load (i.e. the presence of larger rock particles)..|$|R
50|$|Roller mills are mills {{that use}} {{cylindrical}} rollers, either in opposing pairs or against flat plates, <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> or <b>grind</b> various materials, such as grain, ore, gravel, plastic, and others. Roller grain mills are {{an alternative to}} traditional millstone arrangements in gristmills. Roller mills for rock complement other types of mills, such as ball mills and hammermills, in such industries as the mining and processing of ore and construction aggregate; cement milling; and recycling.|$|R

50|$|One main {{characteristic}} of elasmobranch fishes is {{their ability to}} continually replace the teeth in their upper and lower jaw. Smooth dogfish differ from other sharks because of their 10 rows of flat, blunt teeth. The teeth in {{the upper and lower}} jaw are similar in size and are asymmetrical with a rounded cusp. These teeth are used <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> and <b>grind</b> food, rather than bite it. Their unique dentition is important for their crustacean-based diet.|$|R

50|$|Where stamp mills {{were used}} <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> gold-bearing ore <b>to</b> fines, {{a part of}} the {{extraction}} process involved the use of mercury-wetted copper plates, over which the crushed fines were washed.

25|$|Three {{processes}} {{were involved}} in extracting lead from the ore brought out of the mine. First the ore had <b>to</b> be <b>crushed</b> <b>to</b> liberate the galena in it from the gangue minerals. Then the galena was separated from the other minerals, using some form of gravity separation process, or (after 1938) a froth flotation process. Finally the concentrated galena was smelted in a furnace to extract the metallic lead from it.|$|R
