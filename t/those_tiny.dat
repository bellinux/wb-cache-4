40|$|Due {{to their}} low thermal {{expansion}} coefficient, Fe 54 Ni 29 Co 17 alloys are of interest for many applications as in the electronic or automotive industries. Processing via MIM (Metal Injection Molding) allows cost-effective large scale production of parts with complex shapes with a very good accuracy and surface finish. There is today on the market a number of commercially available feedstock but as the trend goes {{to the production of}} smaller and more complex MIM parts new feedstock are needed to still meet the shape accuracy and surface finish required on <b>those</b> <b>tinier</b> pieces. In this study Fe 54 Ni 29 Co 17 parts were prepared by MIM starting from feedstock made of blended iron, nickel and cobalt powders, iron with co-precipitated 37 Co 63 Ni and a fully pre-alloyed powder. The feedstock composition was optimized according to the different metal powder mixes used. The sintering parameters were evaluated accordingly. Shrinkage, density, thermal expansion coefficient, carbon content, microstructure and distribution of the metal elements of the sintered parts were studied as a function of feedstock composition, sintering temperature and sintering duration. For blends and co-precipitated 37 Co 63 Ni, densities close to the theoretical density were achieved. The surface roughness of the sintered pieces was close to surface of polished parts. All prepared MIM parts showed no cracks and a very good contour accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Each year, {{more than}} a half-million infants are born prematurely in the United States. Many of these preemies, {{particularly}} <b>those</b> whose <b>tiny</b> digestive systems are simply too underdeveloped to handle mother’s milk or infant formula, {{may need to be}} nourished exclusively via intravenous feeding, known as “total parenteral nutrition,” or TPN. TPN solutions, usually administered at the hospital for anywhere from a few days to a month or more, provide essential nutrients broken down into a very basic form. This liquid is gently and continuously infused into the infant’s bloodstream, completely bypassing the digestive tract. “TPN helps save the lives of newborns and supports their growth and development, especially of the brain,” says Douglas G. Burrin, an Agricultural Research Service physiologist at the Children’s Nutrition Research Center in Houston, Texas, and a faculty member at Baylor College of Medicine, also in Houston. But preemies who are on TPN for longer than 2 weeks may develop complications that might affect their health later in life. Since 1998, Burrin and colleague Barbara Stoll, who is also with the nutrition center and the college faculty, have worked with teams of scientists in the United States and abroad to discover more about the unwanted side effects of TPN and to develop new, safe, effective ways to prevent these unintended consequences or, at the very least, to minimize their impact...|$|R

If Gilbert {{had been asked to}} describe his ideal woman the description would have answered point for point to Anne, even to <b>those</b> seven <b>tiny</b> freckles whose obnoxious presence still continued to vex her soul. Gilbert was as yet little more than a boy; but a boy has his dreams as have others, and in Gilbert's future there was always a girl with big, limpid gray eyes, and a face as fine and delicate as a flower. He had made up his mind, also, that his future must be worthy of its goddess. Even in quiet Avonlea there were temptations to be met and faced. White Sands youth were a rather [...] "fast" [...] set, and Gilbert was popular wherever he went. But he meant to keep himself worthy of Anne's friendship and perhaps some distant day her love; and he watched over word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to pass in judgment on it. She held over him the unconscious influence that every girl, whose ideals are high and pure, wields over her friends; an influence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals and which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them. In Gilbert's eyes Anne's greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped to the petty practices of so many of the Avonlea girls--the small jealousies, the little deceits and rivalries, the palpable bids for favor. Anne held herself apart from all this, not consciously or of design, but simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign to her transparent, impulsive nature, crystal clear in its motives and aspirations.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe medial amygdaloid nucleus (Me) {{integrates}} pheromonal and olfactory {{information with}} gonadal hormone cues, being implicated in social behaviors.

Here, MeAV efferents {{were examined in}} the rat with the anterograde Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde Fluoro-Gold (FG) tracers and {{compared with those of}} other Me parts. The present PHA-L observations show that the MeAV projects profusely to itself, but its projections to other Me parts are modest. In conjunction with FG experiments, they suggest that the MeAV innervates robustly a restricted set of structures it shares with the anterodorsal and/or posteroventral Me. Its major targets are the core of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (especially the dorsomedial and central parts), reached mainly via the stria terminalis, and the amygdalostriatal transition area. In addition, the MeAV innervates substantially the lateral and posterior basomedial amygdaloid nuclei and the intraamygdaloid bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In contrast to other Me parts, it provides only modest inputs to the main and accessory olfactory systems, medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and reproductive hypothalamic nuclei. This anatomical framework suggests that the MeAV {{may play a role in}} orienting responses to chemosensory cues and defensive behaviors elicited by the odor of predators...|$|R
