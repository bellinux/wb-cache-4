500|$|Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand {{after his}} presentation, several of Bush's aides and {{supporters}} walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide {{commented that the}} President had [...] "that look that he's ready to blow". Colbert recalled that [...] "not {{a lot of people}} laughed in the front row" [...] during the speech, and that [...] "when it was over, no one was even making eye contact with me ... no one is talking to me in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> room"; only Scalia came to him afterward, praising Colbert's imitation of a gesture the justice had recently been photographed making.|$|E
500|$|On February 13, 1945, Dresden {{became the}} target of Allied forces. In the hours and days that followed, the Allies engaged in a fierce firebombing of the city. The {{offensive}} subsided on February 15, with around 25,000 civilians killed in the bombing. Vonnegut marveled {{at the level of}} both the destruction in Dresden and the secrecy that attended it. He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground. [...] "It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around", Vonnegut said. [...] "When we came up the city was gone... They burnt <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> town down." [...] Vonnegut and other American prisoners were put to work immediately after the bombing, excavating bodies from the rubble.

500|$|Kemper {{then left}} the scene in Hallett's car, driving eastward, leaving California and through Nevada and Utah. He arrived in Pueblo, Colorado and, after not hearing any news on the radio about the murders {{of his mother and}} Hallett, found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he {{personally}} knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited in his car for the police to arrive, arrest him and take him into custody, where he then also confessed to the murders of the six students. When asked after his arrest what motivated him to turn himself in, Kemper said: [...] "The original purpose was gone... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off." ...|$|E

A neolithic ancestor {{by the name of}} Bad Reek is mentioned as being present at the construction of Stonehenge.

2500|$|German First Lieutenant Paul Jürgen Vollmer, {{commander}} of the First Battalion, 120th Landwehr Infantry, emptied his pistol trying to kill York while he was contending with the machine guns. Failing to injure York, and seeing his mounting losses, he offered in English to surrender the unit to York, who accepted. By {{the end of the}} engagement, York and his seven men marched 132 German prisoners back to the American lines. [...] Upon returning to his unit, York reported to his brigade commander, Brigadier General Julian Robert Lindsey, who remarked [...] "Well York, I hear you have captured <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> German army." [...] York replied [...] "No sir. [...] I got only 132."

2500|$|On October 31, 1983, about 2:00p.m., {{five members}} of a {{construction}} crew saw a 100-foot-long sea serpent off Stinson Beach, which is just north of San Francisco, California. A flagman named Gary saw it first swimming towards the cliffside road which the work crew was repairing. He radioed {{another member of the}} work crew, Matt Ratto, and told him to grab the binoculars. Ratto began looking at the sea serpent when it was 100 yards offshore and {{less than a quarter of}} a mile away. Ratto said, [...] "The body came out of the water first." [...] He added, [...] "It was black with three humps." [...] He continued, [...] "There were three bends. like humps and they rose straight up." [...] He further described it as a [...] "humpy, flat-backed thing". He also made a sketch of the animal which appeared to be a round headed, blunt nosed, snake-like creature followed by 3 vertical arches or coils sticking out of the water. Another eyewitness, Steve Bjora, said [...] "The sucker was going 45 to 50 miles an hour." [...] He also described the animal saying, [...] "It was clipping. It was boogying. It looked like a long eel." [...] Marlene Martin, the Caltran safety engineer who was over seeing the work crew also saw the animal. She said, [...] "It shocked the hell out of me" [...] adding, [...] "That thing's so big he deserves front page coverage." [...] She went on to say, [...] "It was hard to describe how big it was. I have no creative imagination. It was a snake-like thing that arched itself up and was so long it made humps above the water." [...] Martin first saw it near Bolinas and saw it swim the whole way to Stinson beach then watched it turn around and head towards the Farallon Islands. Martin said, [...] "It had a wake as big as a power boat's and it was going about 65 miles an hour. It looked like a great big rubber hose as it moved. If someone had gotten in its way it would have plowed right though them." [...] Before it went underwater Martin saw it lift its head and a portion of its body directly behind its head out of the water then open its mouth. Martin said, [...] "It was like it was playing." [...] She described the animal as a [...] "giant snake or a dragon, with a mouth like an alligator's." [...] She continued, [...] "It was at least 15 or 20 feet in circumference, but it was hard to tell how long it was. I mean, how long is a snake? Marlin Martin concluded by saying, [...] "He should have <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>damn</b> ocean. It's his territory. He's the King of the Sea!" ...|$|E

500|$|Booth was pro-Confederate, but {{his family}} was divided, like many Marylanders. He was outspoken in his love of the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred of Lincoln.

In early 1863, Booth was arrested in St. Louis while on a theatre tour, when he was heard saying that he [...] "wished the President and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>damned</b> government would go to hell." [...] He was charged with making [...] "treasonous" [...] remarks against the government, but was released when he took an oath of allegiance to the Union and paid a substantial fine.|$|R
