40|$|Given the {{complexity}} and range <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> early childhood education and care (ECEC) services, {{as well as the}} diversity of family situations, research eliciting parent conceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> early childhood services is both necessary and timely. This paper brings to light some important issues in relation to knowledge and understanding <b>of</b> parent <b>choice</b> regarding early childhood services. It synthesises findings from an initial study that aimed to investigate the ways parents make <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> early childhood services, and examines and interprets the meanings they ascribe to those choices (see Noble, 2005) ...|$|R

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the European Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. These frequently hold pre-meetings of their European Council members, prior to its meetings. However, the European Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and decisions are generally made on these lines, though ideological alignment can colour their political agreements and <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> appointments (such as their president).|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch {{from which to}} watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E

5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, Wallace gave {{evidence}} {{before a}} Royal Commission investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted {{to support his}} testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. The Lancet averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime, attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by The Lancet, which stated that it contained {{many of the same}} errors as his evidence given to the commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while {{auditioning for}} a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that {{performed}} rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality {{and the ability to}} sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing.|$|E

Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured {{in an automobile accident}} near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another vehicle that crossed into his path. He suffered two broken legs in the crash that killed two people in the other vehicle. Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again.|$|E
40|$|In {{cross-cultural}} situations, <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> address terms often reflect cultural differences. Although a {{good number}} of studies have discussed address terms in mono-linguistic settings, literature directly related to cross-cultural address terms is scarce. The current study intends to investigate common forms of address terms in Chinese and American cultures. Two hypotheses are examined: 1) Differences between Americans and Chinese in <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> address terms are governed by cultural norms such as politeness, as well as by contexts or styles, and 2) The Chinese students in the U. S., who are undergoing the process of assimilation and acculturation, tend to accommodate the American culture and be more like the Americans in <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> address terms.

5|$|The {{practical}} {{source of}} an emperor's {{power and authority}} was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor (sacramentum). The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis. Most emperors indicated <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, much less to reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the donativum, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game.

All players play at the same time, entering <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money.

40|$|AbstractProblems of spherical {{trigonometry}} in 17 th- and 18 th-century China were often reduced to problems in plane trigonometry and then solved {{by means of}} the proportionality of corresponding sides of similar right triangles. Nevertheless, in the literature on the history of Chinese mathematics, there is not much discussion on the transformation and reduction of spherical problems to the plane, and how the techniques utilized for such transformations evolved over time. In this article, I investigate the evolution of the transformation media involved. I will show that in the trigonometric treatises by Mei Wending (1633 – 1721) and Dai Zhen (1724 – 1777), the authors’ views on Western learning shaped <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> transformation media, and conversely <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> transformation media offered support to their views on trigonometry in the debate of Chinese versus Western methods.
