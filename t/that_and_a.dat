After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> promise that he would issue {{a call to the}} Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{a sudden}} decline in sea level, {{intermittent}} periods of ocean-bottom hyperoxia and anoxia (high-oxygen and low- or zero-oxygen conditions) {{may have caused}} the 13C/12C ratio fluctuations in the Early Triassic; and global anoxia may {{have been responsible for}} the end-Permian blip. The continents of the end-Permian and early Triassic were more clustered in the tropics than they are now, and large tropical rivers would have dumped sediment into smaller, partially enclosed ocean basins at low latitudes. Such conditions favor oxic and anoxic episodes; oxic/anoxic conditions would result in a rapid release/burial, respectively, of large amounts of organic carbon, which has a low 13C/12C ratio because biochemical processes use the lighter isotopes more. That or another organic-based reason may have been responsible for both <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> late Proterozoic/Cambrian pattern of fluctuating 13C/12C ratios.|$|E

She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLet Gn,p be the Sylow p-subgroup of SL(n,p) {{formed by}} the upper unitriangular matrices. The aim {{of this paper is}} to {{describe}} algorithms for the computation of the number of conjugacy classes, the conjugacy vector of Gn,p, the character (rational or real) of the elements of Gn,p, the cardinality of the centralizer of each matrix of Gn,p, the conjugacy vector of the normal subset Nπ corresponding to a pivot disposition π, and the character (inert or ramification) of each entry of any matrix of Gn,p. For p= 2, by using these algorithms, we have proved that Kirillov's conjecture, every matrix of Gn, 2 is conjugate to its inverse, holds for n⩽ 12, but for n= 13 there exists a unique pair of inverse conjugacy classes not conjugate. A representative pair of these conjugacy classes is given in [J. Algebra 202 (1998) 704]. For n= 14, we give the complete list of the canonical matrices of the 22 counterexamples to Kirillov's conjecture. For n⩽ 14, we have proved <b>that</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>A</b> 5 are conjugate and for n= 25 we have found a matrix A∈G 25, 2 such <b>that</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>A</b> 5 are not conjugate. In addition, for n= 32 we have found a matrix A∈G 32, 2 such <b>that</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> A− 1 are conjugate but <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>A</b> 5 are not conjugate. So, Isaacs' conjecture, every real matrix in Gn, 2 m is actually rational, is not true. For p= 3, Isaacs and Kereguezian give in [ibid. ] a matrix A∈G 20, 3 such <b>that</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>A</b> 4 are not conjugate. In this paper, for every odd prime p, we obtain a matrix A∈Gn,p, with n= 6 p+ 1 such <b>that</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>A</b> 1 +p are not conjugate. Consequently, there exist irreducible characters of G 6 p+ 1,p that are not Q(ϵp) -valued, where ϵp is a primitive pth root of unity. Besides, for p= 3 and n⩽ 13 we have computed the conjugacy vector of Gn, 3 <b>and</b> verified <b>that</b> every matrix A∈Gn, 3 is conjugate to A 4. Thus, for all n⩽ 13, the character values of Gn, 3 always lie in Q(ϵ 3) ...|$|R
