5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related <b>that</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and she would be able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E

500|$|Returning to San Francisco, Sylvester {{was offered}} the {{opportunity}} to record a demo album by Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner. Financed by A Records, the album featured a cover of Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell's song [...] "Superstar," [...] which had been a recent hit single for The Carpenters; nevertheless, A felt that the work was not commercially viable and declined to release the album. For the album, Sylvester and his manager Dennis Lopez had assembled a group of heterosexual white males—Bobby Blood on trumpet, Chris Mostert on saxophone, James Q. Smith on guitar, Travis Fullerton on drums, and Kerry Hatch on bass—whom he named The Hot Band. After A's initial rejection, the band provided two songs for Lights Out San Francisco, an album compiled by San Francisco's KSAN radio and released on the Blue Thumb label. Gaining a number of local gigs, they were eventually asked to open for English glam rock star David Bowie at the Winterland Ballroom; the gig did not sell particularly well, and Bowie later commented <b>that</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> did not need him, because [...] "They've got Sylvester," [...] referring to their shared preference for androgyny.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{controlled}} the 49ers throughout the game, and with four minutes {{left in the}} third quarter held a 38–14 lead, which would have been even larger had not Shockey dropped a touchdown pass in the third quarter. The 49ers rallied however, scoring a field goal and three touchdowns—two on Jeff Garcia touchdown passes, one on a Garcia 14-yard touchdown run, and two two-point conversions made by Terrell Owens—which gave the 49ers a 39–38 lead with a minute to go. Collins then drove the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds to play, setting up a 41-yard potential game-winning field goal attempt by Matt Bryant. However, Bryant never got an opportunity to make the kick. 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin—who had been signed out of retirement for this playoff game—snapped the ball low and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball for the attempt. With no other options, Allen threw it downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert. The Giants were penalized for an illegal man downfield (Seubert), and the game was over. However, after the game, the NFL recognized <b>that</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> should have been penalized on that play as well for pass interference. This would have created offsetting penalties and given New York a chance to kick again. After the game a devastated Junkin said [...] "I cost 58 guys a chance to go to the Super Bowl.
