5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Millwall's form was poor, {{and they were}} relegated into (and became a {{founding}} member of) Division Four. The {{first time in their}} history they had competed in the fourth tier of English football, which they remained in for four seasons until 1962. They returned for the 1964–65 season, but were immediately promoted. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time Millwall played in the fourth tier.|$|E

5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Walworth, NY441 becomes Walworth–Penfield Road. Just east of the county line, NY441 shifts {{slightly}} northward by way of an S-curve that serves as a connector between the segmented West Walworth Road, which NY441 intersects {{at both ends of the}} curve. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> curve along NY441 as it follows a linear east–west routing over several small hills to a junction with NY350 west of the hamlet of Walworth, where NY441 terminates. The roadway, however, continues east to Marion as Walworth–Penfield Road, Walworth–Marion Road, and Buffalo Street, a continuous highway maintained by Wayne County as County Route205 (CR205) west of Hall Center Road and Maple Avenue and as CR207 east of those roads.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructing a {{timetable}} for {{the day of the}} battle is tentative due to ambiguous statements in Ammianus (which may have been caused by manuscript copying-errors). It appears that Julian's army set forth at dawn, and apparently arrived within sight of the barbarian entrenchments (vallum) outside Strasbourg at around midday, after a march of 21 Roman miles. (A contradictory statement in Julian's speech implies that the army was still far off its destination and faced a night march to reach it. But this is incompatible with all the other available data and should thus probably be disregarded). The starting-point was probably Saverne, since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> stated location of Julian's army, and it lay a consistent distance from Strasbourg on the Roman highway.|$|E

5|$|The album {{begins with}} two cover songs, and {{features}} a third on Side 2. Lyrics circle various themes, while the structuring {{of the songs}} shifted towards hard rock, psychedelic rock. The album was deemed by critics to {{be an attempt to}} retreat to the band's roots and received mostly positive reviews. Subterranean Jungle was not very successful commercially, peaking at number 83 on the US Billboard 200 and failing to chart internationally. The singles released from the album did not chart either. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> album by the band to feature Marky Ramone on drums until the 1989 album Brain Drain.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{campaign}} {{associated with}} Nikephoros Phokas, and Symeon Logothetes {{reports that he}} died in 895/6. His death reportedly encouraged Tsar Simeon to reopen hostilities, with devastating success against Nikephoros' successor as Domestic, Leo Katakalon. The later chronicle of Theophanes Continuatus, however, reports a different story, according to which Nikephoros was disgraced and dismissed from his post after refusing proposals for a marriage alliance with Leo's powerful chief minister, Stylianos Zaoutzes. After a period out of office, Nikephoros was then appointed strategos either of Charsianon or of the Thracesian Theme, spending his remaining years, until his death around 900, fighting against the Arabs. Leo VI's Tactica and the later De velitatione further mention a successful raid into the Arab lands of Cilicia led by Nikephoros, in retaliation of an Arab attack on the fortress of Mistheia in the Anatolic Theme. While directing the strategoi of the Anatolics and of the Opsician Theme {{to deal with the}} Arab invasion, Nikephoros led his forces to raid the vicinity of Adana, making many prisoners, and confounded the Arabs by following a different course on his return, thereby avoiding the Arab army sent to block his retreat. This undated raid probably took place either in the years before or directly after the Bulgarian war.|$|E
