50|$|Many {{equations}} in relativistic physics appear far simpler when {{expressed in}} geometric units, because all appearances of G or c drop out. For example, the Schwarzschild radius of a nonrotating uncharged black hole with mass m becomes simply r = 2m. Therefore, many {{books and papers}} on relativistic physics use geometric units exclusively. An alternative system of geometrized units is often used in particle physics and cosmology, in which 8πG = 1 instead.

50|$|The {{roughness}} {{small scale}} (Rs) is established visually and tactile (by feeling).

The trace (with a length of about 0.2 m) or surface (with an area of about 0.2 x 0.2 m2 of a discontinuity is compared with the example graphs in figure 2; this gives stepped, undulating, or planar.
