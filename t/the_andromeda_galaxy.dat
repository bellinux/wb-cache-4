5|$|Close {{examination}} of the inner region of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust ring that {{is believed to have}} been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> along the latter's polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxy</b> by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|Like the Milky Way, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> has {{satellite}} galaxies, {{consisting of}} 14 known dwarf galaxies. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110. Based on current evidence, {{it appears that}} M32 underwent a close encounter with <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> in the past. M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past.|$|E
50|$|Our own Milky Way and <b>the</b> nearby <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{currently}} {{appear to}} be undergoing the quenching transition from star-forming blue galaxies to passive red galaxies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{was formed}} roughly 10 {{billion years ago}} from the {{collision}} and subsequent merger of smaller protogalaxies.This violent collision formed most of the galaxy's (metal-rich) galactic halo and extended disk. During this epoch, star formation {{would have been very}} high, to the point of becoming a luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years. <b>Andromeda</b> and <b>the</b> Triangulum <b>Galaxy</b> had a very close passage 2-4 billion years ago. This event produced high levels of star formation across <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> disk - even some globular clusters - and disturbed M33's outer disk.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> {{satellite}} system consists of Messier 32 (M32), Messier 110 (M110), NGC 147, NGC 185, Andromeda I (And I), And II, And III, And IV, And V, And VI (also known as Pegasus Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy, or Pegasus DSph), And VII (also known as Cassiopeia Dwarf Galaxy), And VIII, And IX, And X, And XI, And XIX, And XXI and And XXII, plus several additional ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies.|$|R
5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> are typically oblate spheroids in shape, while {{those in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Milky Way, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{appears to}} have {{predominantly}} more old stars with ages >7 years. The estimated luminosity of Andromeda Galaxy, , is about 25% {{higher than that of}} our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> (including to propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21 or close).|$|E
5|$|The first {{professional}} astronomer {{to support the}} concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. The distance to <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxy,</b> and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.|$|E

500|$|Mass {{estimates}} for <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> halo (including dark matter) give {{a value of}} approximately [...] (or 1.5 trillion solar masses) compared to [...] for the Milky Way. This contradicts earlier measurements, that {{seem to indicate that}} <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> and <b>the</b> Milky Way are almost equal in mass. Even so, <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> spheroid actually has a higher stellar density than that of the Milky Way and its galactic stellar disk is about twice the size of that of the Milky Way. The total stellar mass of <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> is estimated to be between [...], (i.e., around twice as massive as that of the Milky Way) and , with around 30% of that mass in the central bulge, 56% in the disk, and the remaining 14% in the halo.|$|R

5|$|While earlier {{findings}} {{suggested that}} the Milky Way galaxy contained more dark matter than Andromeda, {{and that it could}} be the largest in the Local Group - the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope led to the revelation that <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxy</b> contains one trillion stars; at least twice the amount of the Milky Way’s stars, with the figure being estimated at 200-400 billion. It is also now evident that spanning approximately 220,000 light years across, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies. The mass of <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, whereas the Milky Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.4, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{is among the}} brightest of the Messier objects - making it {{visible to the naked}} eye on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.|$|E
5|$|Based on its {{appearance}} in visible light, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{is classified as}} an SA(s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs–Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies. However, data from the 2MASS survey showed that Andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar oriented along its long axis.|$|E
5000|$|Distance moduli {{are most}} {{commonly}} used when expressing the distance to other galaxies in the relatively nearby universe. For example, the Large Magellanic Cloud is at a distance modulus of 18.5, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> distance modulus is 24.4, and the galaxy NGC 4548 in the Virgo Cluster has a DM of 31.0. [...] In {{the case of the}} LMC, this means that the supernova SN1987A, with a peak apparent magnitude of 2.8, had an absolute magnitude of -15.7, which is low by supernova standards.|$|R

5|$|M110 {{also appears}} to be {{interacting}} with <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> has a {{total of}} 15 {{satellite}} galaxies, including M32 and M110.

5|$|The {{estimated}} {{distance of}} <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{from our own}} was doubled in 1953 when {{it was discovered that}} there is another, dimmer type of Cepheid.

Here we report that the measurement of the velocity of pairs of diametrically opposed galaxy satellites provides a means to determine statistically the prevalence of kinematically coherent planar alignments.

5|$|The Milky Way <b>galaxy</b> and <b>the</b> nearby <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{are moving}} toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years.

5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy.</b> The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E
5|$|Multiple X-ray {{sources have}} since been {{detected}} in <b>the</b> <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> using observations from the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton orbiting observatory.
