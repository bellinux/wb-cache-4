5|$|According to Lokasenna, Loki rebukes {{the gods}} {{at the start}} of the poem for not {{properly}} welcoming him to the feast at Ægir's hall. In stanza 10, Odin finally relents <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of hospitality, urging Víðarr to stand and pour a drink for the quarrelsome guest. Víðarr does so, and then Loki toasts the Æsir before beginning his flyting.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by {{the change}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> McCool had a five-year stint from 1956 in English county cricket. Somerset, having {{finished}} {{on the bottom of}} the County Championship table for the four years between 1952–1955, had embarked on a renewal programme. Part of the programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign, including an offer to McCool that saw him return to first-class cricket at the age of 39.|$|E

30|$|In each case, {{irrespective}} of the marginal probabilities, those students conforming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> have a virtually 100 % chance of seeing the course as excellent. For instance, 27 % of all students expecting to fail assigned an excellent rating to their courses, but when they conformed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> percentage rose <b>to</b> 97 %. <b>The</b> same finding is true when students were asked about their desire <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> course with those who strongly disagreed assigning excellent ratings to their courses 26 % of the time. However, for those conforming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> that category rose to 92 %. When course modality is considered in the marginal sense, blended learning is rated as the preferred choice. However, from Table  6 we can observe that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> equates student assessment of their learning experiences. If they conform <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> they will see excellence.|$|R
5|$|The name Amanita inaurata, {{given by}} Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan in 1833, {{has also been}} used for this species.

Other synonyms are Agaricus ceciliae, Amanitopsis inaurata and Amanitopsis ceciliae. The present name, Amanita ceciliae, was given by Cornelis Bas, a Dutch mycologist, in 1984.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E

5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all modern}} paleontologists agreed with Riggs {{that the two}} dinosaurs should be {{classified}} together in a single genus. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name Apatosaurus, having been published first, has priority as the official name; Brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that A.ajax and A.excelsus were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no changes have been made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No changes have been made since.|$|E
40|$|This {{work has}} as purpose the {{analysis}} of the notion of &# 39;State Subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> of Law&# 39;, considered within the doctrine as being ambiguous due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that there are several methods <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> base of state being subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law, on one hand {{and on the other hand}} because, similarly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concept of democracy, the abusive use of <b>the</b> concept <b>to</b> describe political and legal regimes which are completely different from one another voids it of any meaning. The concept of state subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law is a doctrinary creation. Although normativised by many current constitutions, its contents mostly remains uncertain, precisely due to its origin which makes it an incessant debate theme, a theme upon which a generalised agreement has not been possible up <b>to</b> presently. <b>The</b> analysis of this notion shall approach the visions upon <b>the</b> state subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law expressed within the doctrine: formalist, functionalist and material which provide three different types of organisation of <b>the</b> state subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law which are complementary instead, not antagonistic ones...|$|R

5|$|Between {{these two}} seasons, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the day, {{would have ended}} his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, {{making it more difficult}} to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius violaceus was {{designated}} as the type species for the genus Cortinarius by Frederic Clements and Cornelius Lott Shear in their 1931 work The Genera of Fungi. Mycologist David Arora considers this odd, due to the mushroom's unusual colour and cystidia. Because of this designation, if C.violaceus were to be split {{from the rest of}} the current genus, then, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, it would retain the name Cortinarius, while the other species would have to be reclassified. The species was one of only two placed in the Cortinarius subgenus Cortinarius by the Austrian mycologist Meinhard Moser. Molecular investigation of webcaps worldwide has increased this number to at least twelve.|$|E

She hid by dressing as a choirboy and remained a secret for a long time, but when the bishop visited Haapsalu again, the young singer caught his attention and he ordered an investigation of the singer's gender.|$|E

5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} {{important}} issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established {{as part of the}} Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{regarded}} Geastrum indicum as the correct name for G.triplex. This is because G.indicum—a species described by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch in 1832 as Cycloderma indicum {{and then moved}} to Geastrum by Stephan Rauschert in 1959—may be the same species as Geastrum triplex. If {{it is in fact}} the same species, the first published name (i.e., G.indicum) has nomenclatorial priority according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. More recently, several authors argue that G.indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and G.triplex maintained as the correct name for the species.|$|E
5|$|The 1872 FA Cup Final was a {{football}} match between Wanderers and Royal Engineers on 16 March 1872 at Kennington Oval in London. It {{was the final}} of the first staging of the Football Association Challenge Cup (known in the modern era as the FA Cup), which became the primary cup competition in English football and the oldest football competition in the world. Fifteen teams entered the competition in its first season and, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> in place at the time, Wanderers reached the final having won only one match in the four preceding rounds. In the semi-finals, they drew with the Scottish club Queen's Park, but reached the final when the Scots withdrew from the competition as they could not afford to return to London for a replay.|$|E
5|$|The game itself {{continued}} to evolve during this time. Numerous innovations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> and equipment were put forward as the NHL sought {{to improve the}} flow of the game and make the sport more fan-friendly.

The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt's radio broadcasts were heard coast-to-coast starting in 1933.|$|E
