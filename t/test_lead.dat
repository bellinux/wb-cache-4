500|$|Respawn {{chose to}} build Titanfall on the Source game engine {{early in their}} {{production}} cycle due to their developers' familiarity {{and its ability to}} maintain 60 frames per second on both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In an interview, Respawn software engineer Richard Baker said the company chose Source since Portal 2 performed well on the PlayStation 3 with it, and the console was [...] "the riskiest platform in seventh generation". The company built upon the engine during development in features such as lighting, rendering, visibility, networking, and tools pipelines. The game also uses Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform for multiplayer servers, physics, and artificial intelligence. Offloading this non-player activity frees the local console for visual rendering tasks and better graphics, and the developers for game development (instead of backend maintenance). This arrangement determines world events in the cloud instead of locally, so position and movement data is downloaded simultaneously by all player-clients. The studio's cloud server access is considered vital to the game's viability, and Respawn artist Joel Emslie said they would not have attempted this game without the cloud support. The team ran a small alpha test and followed up with a large beta test to stress test the new Xbox Live compute platform {{as one of the first}} games to use the network. The platform broke for seven hours at one point of the <b>test.</b> <b>Lead</b> programmer Jon Shiring figured that the ten problems they found during the test were ten problems they didn't need to find at launch. Respawn felt that Kinect support did not suit the game and chose not to support the peripheral. The development team reported considerable interest in support for esports competitive play, and while such features were not prioritized for the initial release, Respawn indicated that esports accommodations were under consideration for future iterations.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the signal}} source {{has its own}} coaxial connector, then a simple coaxial cable is used; otherwise, a {{specialized}} cable called a [...] "scope probe", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general, for routine use, an open wire <b>test</b> <b>lead</b> for connecting to the point being observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{change control}} board {{consists}} of the development manager, the <b>test</b> <b>lead</b> and a product manager. In few of the cases the client representation is also done in CCB to ensure {{the acceptance of the}} deliverable.|$|E
50|$|A {{directly}} connected {{test probe}} (so called 1× probe) puts the unwanted lead capacitance across the circuit under test. For a typical coaxial cable, loading {{is of the}} order of 100pF per meter (the length of a typical <b>test</b> <b>lead).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A lineman's handset {{typically}} connects via {{a pair of}} <b>test</b> <b>leads,</b> not the modular connector {{found on}} most consumer telephone equipment. The <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> will feature some combination of alligator clips (to connect to bare wires), a piercing spike or [...] "bed-of-nails" [...] (for insulated wires), and something designed to fit a punch block. Adapters designed to fit other punch block types, heat coil sockets, or modular jacks may also be used.|$|R
40|$|These {{virulence}} <b>tests</b> <b>lead</b> us {{to believe}} that Micrococcus florens is pathogenic for mice, rabbits, and monkeys (Macacus rhesus), producing septicemia, and that it will also cause purulent meningitis in the two latter animals. The combined results of the biological reactions and of the agglutination <b>tests</b> <b>lead</b> {{us to believe}} that we are dealing with an organism which, though morphologically similar to the meningococcus, yet is entirely distinct. A review of the literature fails to reveal any description of a Gramnegative micrococcus which grows luxuriantly on all media tested, forms no pigment, and ferments arabinose, dextrose, and galactose...|$|R
50|$|The tester {{consists}} of an indicator in series with a source of electrical power - normally a battery, terminating in two <b>test</b> <b>leads.</b> If a complete circuit is established between the test-leads, the indicator is activated.|$|R
50|$|Where {{electrical}} safety is an issue, {{various kinds of}} protected plugs and sockets are available. These have sliding covers on plugs or other devices to protect the user from accidental contact with live conductors, but are still largely compatible with the original design. A typical design is now required (IEC 61010) on digital voltmeter test leads and several other measurement and laboratory equipment. In this design, the metal banana plug is entirely sheathed in plastic and presses into a deep recess in the DVM. Alternatively, the equipment has the male part of the banana plug and it is deeply recessed; the <b>test</b> <b>lead</b> contains a sheathed banana jack. Also, the <b>test</b> <b>lead</b> wire is specified for higher voltage isolation.|$|E
50|$|Rational Quality Manager {{is based}} on the Jazz™ {{platform}} and inherits characteristics from that platform. Rational Quality Manager supports user roles that include test manager, test architect, <b>test</b> <b>lead,</b> tester, and lab manager.

5000|$|Far Gate began life in 1999 {{under the}} title The Rift, {{developed}} by a four-man team at Thrushwave Technology headed by James Thrush. [...] The team included Dustin Wood (<b>Test</b> <b>Lead,</b> 3D Artist), Jeff House (3D Artist) and Chris Overstreet (Music and Sound Design). [...] The Rift was notable for its large space-based battlefields, where solar systems remained in motion as battles progressed.|$|E
5000|$|Software testing {{can be done}} by {{software}} testers. Until the 1980s, {{the term}} [...] "software tester" [...] was used generally, but later it was also seen as a separate profession. Regarding the periods and the different goals in software testing, different roles have been established, such as test manager, <b>test</b> <b>lead,</b> test analyst, test designer, tester, automation developer, and test administrator.|$|E
50|$|A {{test probe}} is a {{physical}} device used to connect electronic test equipment to a device under test (DUT). Test probes range from very simple, robust devices to complex probes that are sophisticated, expensive, and fragile. Specific types include test prods, oscilloscope probes and current probes. A test probe is often supplied as a <b>test</b> <b>lead,</b> which includes the probe, cable and terminating connector.|$|E
25|$|Patients with ESKD are at {{increased}} overall risk for cancer. This risk is particularly high in younger patients and gradually diminishes with age. Medical specialty professional organizations recommend that physicians do not perform routine cancer screening {{in patients with}} limited life expectancies due to ESKD because evidence does not show that such <b>tests</b> <b>lead</b> to improved patient outcomes.|$|R
30|$|A Fisher’s test, {{based on}} Fisher’s distribution, {{can be used}} to test whether a {{relationship}} is meaningful. With a single independent variable, the Fisher’s <b>test</b> <b>leads</b> to the same conclusion as the Student test. On the other hand, with more than one independent variable, only the F test {{can be used to}} test the overall meaning of a relationship.|$|R

5000|$|Factory {{testing is}} {{sometimes}} statistical, for example, a process check. A profiling {{system may be}} used to ensure the overall polished shape is correct, and a good quality optical microscope to check for blemishes. Optical Loss / Return Loss performance is checked using specific reference conditions, against a reference-standard single mode <b>test</b> <b>lead,</b> or using an [...] "Encircled Flux Compliant" [...] source for multi-mode testing. Testing and rejection ("yield") may represent {{a significant part of the}} overall manufacturing cost.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{voltmeter}} probe {{consists of}} a single wire <b>test</b> <b>lead</b> that has on one end a connector that fits the voltmeter {{and on the other}} end a rigid, tubular plastic section that comprises both a handle and probe body. The handle allows a person to hold and guide the probe without influencing the measurement (by becoming part of the electric circuit) or being exposed to dangerous voltages that might cause electric shock. Within the probe body, the wire is connected to a rigid, pointed metal tip that contacts the DUT. Some probes allow an alligator clip to be attached to the tip, thus enabling the probe to be attached to the DUT so that it need not be held in place.|$|E
5000|$|In most cases, a trial (<b>test)</b> <b>lead</b> {{placement}} {{is performed}} {{in order to}} assess whether the stimulation will work as expected. Local anesthetic is applied {{to the back of the}} neck and a Tuohy needle is advanced towards the location of the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve under fluoroscopic guidance. When the location is confirmed, a temporary lead is placed through the needle before the needle is carefully removed. Electrical impulses are sent through the lead and its position is adjusted until the patient reports a [...] "pins-and-needles" [...] sensation, called paresthesia, across the areas of the nerves. If paresthesia is successfully achieved in the right place, permanent leads are usually implanted at a later date. In some cases, the trial leads are left in for up to one week to see whether there is any relief of symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{signal to}} be {{measured}} is fed {{to one of the}} input connectors, which is usually a coaxial connector such as a BNC or UHF type. Binding posts or banana plugs may be used for lower frequencies.If the signal source has its own coaxial connector, then a simple coaxial cable is used; otherwise, a specialized cable called a [...] "scope probe", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general, for routine use, an open wire <b>test</b> <b>lead</b> for connecting to the point being observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary.General-purpose oscilloscopes usually present an input impedance of 1 megohm in parallel with a small but known capacitance such as 20 picofarads. This allows the use of standard oscilloscope probes. Scopes for use with very high frequencies may have 50‑ohm inputs, which must be either connected directly to a 50‑ohm signal source or used with Z0 or active probes.|$|E
50|$|A {{lamp and}} battery {{can be used}} to test for contact closure or wire continuity. Care must be taken to ensure that all {{circuits}} are completely de-energized before use of a continuity tester lamp, or the lamp will be destroyed. Sometimes a flashlight (torch) is field-modified or factory-manufactured with <b>test</b> <b>leads,</b> to allow the flashlight {{to be used as a}} continuity tester.|$|R
50|$|Boston {{was invited}} to attend the 2012 AFL Combine {{and became the first}} player in history to {{register}} a perfect score in the goal kicking <b>test.</b> <b>Leading</b> into the 2012 AFL Draft, fourteen clubs showed interest in Boston but he was overlooked on the day. However, Boston was rookie drafted as an academy graduate by the Gold Coast in December.|$|R
50|$|When a test access {{crosspoint}} {{itself was}} stuck closed, {{it would cause}} sporadic FCG failures all over both grids that were tested by that controller. Since the J links were externally connected, switchroom staff discovered that such failures could be found by making busy both grids, grounding the controller's <b>test</b> <b>leads,</b> and then <b>testing</b> all 128 J links, 256 wires, for a ground.|$|R
