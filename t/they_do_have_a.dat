5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

25|$|Although mice {{are small}} animals and {{care must be}} taken to avoid injury, they are also {{surprisingly}} robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children as they may be overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or very frightened. Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as mice are generally considered non-aggressive. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> greater likelihood of biting unfamiliar people, especially males who are wild and territorial.|$|E

[...] "Call My Name" [...] borrows similarities to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love" [...] (2011) and Scissor Sisters' [...] "Only the Horses" [...] (2012), tracks that were also produced by Harris. Brogan Driscoll of The Huffington Post speculated that the [...] "dance anthem" [...] title, [...] "Call My Name", could be linked Cheryl's recent decision to drop her married name from her professional career. Sarah Deen of Metro stated that the track features a [...] "typical Calvin Harris beat and singalong chorus", the chorus of the song was considered a departure from Cheryl's previous works, namely [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] (2009) and [...] "Promise This" [...] (2010), while Marie Claire columnist Eleanor Young described [...] "Call My Name" [...] as a [...] "fast paced party track". When Peter Robinson of Popjustice compared the song to [...] "We Found Love" [...] during {{an interview with the}} singer, she responded, [...] "that's going to be natural because it's Calvin. They're both Calvin-produced songs. So naturally you're going to think that. But if you play them side by side they don't sound the same. Although you might naturally think that, because it's the same producer. It's not a bad thing."

2500|$|Ricord's iguana {{was thought}} until 2008 {{to be found}} only in the southwestern Dominican Republic, where it is {{restricted}} to the arid Valle de Neiba and the most xeric portion of the Peninsula de Barahona coastal lowlands. These two populations are separated by the Sierra de Bahoruco (Massif de la Selle in Haiti), with three peaks exceeding [...] that form an extensive ecological barrier. Past drier Pleistocene climates may have allowed genetic exchange between the two subpopulations. Throughout their range, Ricord's iguanas coexist with rhinoceros iguanas and both species have been observed swimming and floating in freshwater by herpetologist Jose Ottenwalder. In 2008 it was found to exist in Anse-a-Pitres, Haiti. All other Caribbean islands, if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rock iguana species, are home to a single species.|$|E
