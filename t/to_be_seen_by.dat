5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. This {{operation}} preempted Britain's own {{plans to}} invade Norway. Denmark surrendered immediately, and, after a short-lived {{attempt by the}} British to make a stand {{in the northern part}} of the country, Norway also fell. The invasion of Norway was a combined forces operation in which the German war machine projected its power across the sea; this German success would come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the British as a dire portent.|$|E
5|$|The sport enjoyed an {{unprecedented}} surge in popularity during the Regency period {{when it was}} openly patronised by the Prince Regent (later George IV) and his brothers. Championship boxing matches acquired a louche reputation as the places <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the wealthy upper classes. Thus a match would often be attended by thousands of people, {{many of whom had}} wagered money on the outcome. The Duke of Cumberland (an uncle of King George III) was reported to have bet thousands of pounds on Jack Broughton, who was the English champion for 18years.|$|E
5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> anyone other than him.|$|E

5|$|In this {{situation}} one Ivaylo, {{a native of}} north-eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near Provadia, began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name Bardokva (lettuce) or Lakhanas (vegetable) and his real name is known only from a note, attached to the Svarlig gospel. The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated {{that he was a}} swineherd who took care of pigs for money. However, the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock product at the time and the possessor of a large herd could {{have been part of the}} elite of the local community. Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints. In fact, his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers. He came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour.|$|E
5|$|The Triangulum Galaxy, {{also known}} as Messier 33, was {{discovered}} by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in the 17th century. A distant member of the Local Group, it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> the naked eye under the darkest skies. Under light-polluted skies, it is challenging or invisible even in a small telescope or binoculars. Because of its low surface brightness, low power is required. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller than both the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis {{that it is a}} satellite of the larger galaxy. Within the constellation, it lies near the border of Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of Beta Andromedae. Within the galaxy, NGC 604 is an H II region where star formation takes place.|$|E
5|$|Top seed Rafael Nadal {{faced an}} uphill battle against Stanislas Wawrinka in the fourth round match, facing a tiebreak in each set and {{eventually}} defeating him. Second seed Roger Federer defeated Dent in the fourth round {{to set up a}} quarterfinal match with longtime rival Andy Roddick, who overcame Gaël Monfils in a two-set match. Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Juan Martín del Potro, Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga made it into the quarterfinals. Del Potro defeated Nadal in the three-set quarterfinal match to reach the first ATP Masters semifinal of his career. Del Potro took the final set on a tiebreak after losing the second set. Murray faced Verdasco in the second quarterfinal in a rematch of 2009 Australian Open fourth round. Verdasco suffered an injury in the second game of the match and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> his physio. He was not in good enough shape to compete with Murray and eventually lost. Federer defeated Roddick while Djokovic moved past Tsonga to advance to the semifinals. Djokovic rallied back to defeat Federer in the first semifinal after losing the first set. The third seed however kept his consistency in the next two sets and won them. Murray edged past del Potro in the second semifinal to enter his second straight Masters final. Murray faltered in the second set of the match conceding two service breaks. However he recovered in the final set, gaining an early break of serve, to win the match.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a Notice to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a Notice to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E
