50|$|The Regata {{was also}} {{featured}} in National Lampoon's European Vacation. When the Griswolds go to Rome, they {{rent a car}} unknowingly from two villains, whom just hid the <b>travel</b> agency <b>clerk</b> {{in the trunk of}} the said vehicle.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Trout River, the son of Francis Skanes and Diana Payne and was educated at Bonne Bay. In 1920, he became a <b>travelling</b> mail <b>clerk.</b> Skanes married May Roberts in 1926. After {{retiring}} from politics in 1932, he was employed in the civil service and private companies.

50|$|Gall, {{the son of}} a notary, {{was born}} at Linkhouse, near Dunbar, in December 1776. Having {{attended}} the parish school of Haddington, he was apprenticed at the age of eleven to his maternal uncle, a carpenter and builder. He afterwards became a printer's apprentice in Edinburgh, and there he gave his leisure to study. He then became <b>travelling</b> <b>clerk</b> to a Mr. Ramsay, in whose employment he remained till his death, 10 May 1801. His powers attracted considerable attention during his lifetime, and he enjoyed the friendship of Burns and Thomas Campbell. Several of his songs were set to music, and became popular. Two of these, ‘The Farewell to Ayrshire,’ and ‘Now bank and brae are clad in green,’ were falsely assigned to Burns; the former was sent by Gall to Johnson's ‘Scots Poetical Museum,’ with Burns's name prefixed, and the latter appeared in Cromek's ‘Reliques of Burns.’ An edition of Gall's ‘Poems and Songs’ was published at Edinburgh in 1819.|$|R

Piermont introduces him to model June Evans (Maureen O'Sullivan), but neglects to mention neither {{one is a}} guest. June is there to help the daughter with her wedding dress. Both pretend to be rich. Tommy gives June his telephone number, but neither expects anything to come of their momentary attraction to each other.|$|R
50|$|The MTA {{had tried}} to reduce station agent {{positions}} since full MetroCard vending machine (MVM) deployment in 1997. Agents, whose primary responsibility was selling tokens, now sell MetroCards. However, AFC eliminated long token booth queues, so fewer clerks were needed. Passengers now interact with agents only for requests like mutilated farecards, concessionary fares, or <b>travel</b> directions. <b>Clerks</b> were not cross-trained for AFC maintenance; that function was assigned to turnstile maintainers. The MTA determined that each station required only one full-time booth, serving dominant (or both) travel directions. Some booths were removed altogether because {{it was felt that}} MVMs would be sufficient.|$|R
5|$|In 1727 Adam and Sir John <b>Clerk</b> <b>travelled</b> to London, {{visiting a}} number of country seats along the way, {{including}} Cliveden, Wilton, and Wanstead House. In London, Adam attempted to make further political contacts, as well as seeking out an engraver for his projected book of architectural plans, which would eventually become Vitruvius Scoticus. Also while in London, he sat to William Aikman for his portrait.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Newcastle, New South Wales but raised in Singapore, Victoria and Western Australia. He left Australia in 1984 to live in Europe, Africa and Asia, where {{he worked as a}} barman, actor, streetseller, labourer, exterminator, factory worker, gardener, <b>clerk,</b> <b>travel</b> agent, teacher and drug trial guinea pig. During this time he began to publish short stories in Australia (anthologised in Pascoe Publishing's Best Fifty Stories Collection) and had a longer piece short-listed for the Vogel/Australian Literary Award.|$|R
50|$|More than 20 years pass, and the Cold War {{gradually}} {{gives way}} to détente. Narrowly escaping a relentless purge of old Stalinism loyalists, Nikolai Dalchimsky (Donald Pleasence), a rogue KGB headquarters <b>clerk,</b> <b>travels</b> to America, taking with him the Telefon Book which contains the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all the sleeper agents. He starts activating them, one by one. American counterintelligence is thrown into confusion when seemingly ordinary citizens blow up what were formerly top secret facilities that have since become relatively inconsequential, and then commit suicide.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} in Montreal, the son of Joseph Frobisher, and studied in England. In 1799, he joined the North West Company and <b>travelled</b> west, {{becoming}} <b>clerk</b> in the English River department. He later worked as a clerk for a merchant in the fur trade at Quebec City. Frobisher represented Montreal County in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada from 1804 to 1808. He was named a {{justice of the peace}} for Trois-Rivières district in 1805. He served in the local militia, later becoming lieutenant-colonel. In 1815, he was named provincial aide-de-camp for colonial administrator Sir Gordon Drummond and, in 1816, for Governor Sir John Coape Sherbrooke.|$|R
40|$|Curriculum {{developed}} {{in partnership with}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and the American Nurses Association (ANA). In the field of nursing, work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), such as back and shoulder injuries, persist as the leading and most costly U. S. occupational health problem (Nelson et al., 2009). A large body of evidence indicates that a substantial number of work-related MSDs reported by nurses are due to the cumulative effect of repeated manual patient-handling activities and work done in extreme static awkward postures. In a list of at-risk occupations for musculoskeletal disorders in 2007, nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants ranked first in incidence rate with a case rate of 252 cases per 10, 000 workers, a rate seven times the national MSD average for all occupations. Emergency medical personnel ranked second, followed by laborers and material movers, ticket agents and <b>travel</b> <b>clerks,</b> and light and heavy truck drivers among the top six at-risk occupations [Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 2009]. The nursing occupation also typically ranks in the top ten in yearly incidence rate of sprain and strain injuries. The training program has four main objectives: 1. Provide evidence-based training on SPH to instructors at schools of nursing so that they can teach SPH methods to students. 2. Ensure that the training is sound and that the curriculum is effective in improving the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of the students. 3. Provide a full range of educational tools nursing educators can use to increase effectiveness of the training program (see Tool Kit for Safe Patient Handling and Movement Training Program). 4. Encourage all nursing educators at schools of nursing to use the evidence-based, safe-patient-handling curriculum module and recommended laboratory activities for nurse training. The ultimate goal is to move students beyond simply knowing content to applying what they've learned in a clinical setting.

50|$|By now the £10,000 {{from the}} GWR had been {{swallowed}} up, {{with little to}} show for it, and the GWR demanded an inspection of the accounts. On 18 October, Hadingham, the company <b>clerk,</b> <b>travelled</b> to London with the books, and GWR officials began to reaudit the accounts. When they wrote to Thomas Goold for various documents and bills to help them in their task he decided to call a halt. He {{pointed out that the}} GWR had two seats on the board, but that their nominees had never attended a meeting, and if they were to allow the GWR to audit their accounts they might have to extend the same facility to all other shareholders.|$|R
50|$|Six months later, Gilfain {{has managed}} to become the owner of Abercoed Castle, Frank's ancestral home in Wales, and {{everyone}} has <b>travelled</b> there. Gilfain's <b>clerks,</b> having been discharged rather than marry the island girls, finally meet up with their English girls (Angela's friends). Tweedlepunch has finally realized that Dolores is the rightful heir to the Florodora fortune. He tells her that her father was his only friend, {{and that he will}} help her retrieve her family business. They break into the Abercoed castle but are surprised by a chorus of lords and ladies who demand to know who they are. In desperation they try to convince everyone that they are the evening's entertainment.|$|R
50|$|Stubbs {{was born}} in Warrnambool, Victoria, to Agnes (née Aitken) and William Alexander Stubbs. He worked as a schoolteacher {{for a time in}} the late 1870s before {{securing}} a position with John Danks & Son, a hardware company with which he was employed from 1879 to 1894, working variously as a <b>clerk,</b> <b>travelling</b> salesman, and engineer. Stubbs arrived in Western Australia in 1895, and with a partner established a hardware firm in Perth, Drake & Stubbs. The firm was eventually bought out by another hardware merchant, Alfred Sandover, in 1907. In 1901, Stubbs (a resident of the suburb of Claremont) was elected mayor of the Claremont Municipality unopposed, replacing Joseph Langsford. In 1903, it was initially reported that would contest the vacancy in the Legislative Council left by the death of Barrington Clarke Wood, but he did not go on to nominate for the election.|$|R
5|$|Warelwast {{served the}} king as an envoy to Pope Urban II in 1095, when {{the king was}} seeking to have the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Canterbury, removed from office. He visited the pope with another royal clerk, Gerard, with orders to recognize Urban as pope in return for Anselm's deposition, {{at least according to}} Eadmer, an Anselm partisan. The two <b>clerks</b> <b>travelled</b> very quickly, as they did not leave before 28February 1095 and were back in England by 13May 1095. Eadmer claimed that the ambassadors were supposed to acquire a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, for the king to give to his new choice as archbishop. But although the king may have instructed his envoys to attempt to secure these objects, he was probably willing to negotiate and to settle for less. The two clerks returned with a papal legate, Walter of Albano, who accepted the king's recognition of Urban but refused to allow Anselm's deposition. The king did nevertheless manage to secure recognition of his royal rights in the church, and a concession that no papal legates or communications would be sent without his approval. It may well be that the king always regarded Anselm's deposition as unlikely.|$|R
