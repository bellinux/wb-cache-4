Rhodamine-labeled alpha-actinin microinjected into living cultured chick skeletal myotubes became localized in discrete cellular structures within 1 h and remained specifically associated with structures for up to 4 d, allowing individual identified structures to be followed during development. In the most immature cells used, alpha-actinin was found in diffuse aggregates, some of which displayed sarcomeric periodicity. Aggregates were observed to coalesce into better defined structures (Z bands) that were approximately 1. 0 -micron wide. Z bands condensed into narrow, more intensely fluorescent Z lines in 4 - 48 h. During this period, Z lines grew laterally, primarily by the addition of small beads of alpha-actinin to existing Z lines or by the merging of small Z lines. In more mature cells, alpha-actinin added to Z lines without going through a visible intermediary structure. Mean sarcomere length did not change significantly during the stages examined, although the variability of sarcomere length did decrease markedly over time for identified sets of sarcomeres. At early stages, myofibrils frequently shifted position in both the longitudinal and lateral directions. Neighboring myofibrils were frequently associated for one or more sarcomeres sporadically along their length, such that the intervening sarcomeres were often misaligned. Associations between myofibrils were often transitory. Shifts in myofibril location in conjunction with the formation, breaking, and reformation of lateral associations between myofibrils facilitated the alignment of Z lines through a trial and error process...|$|E
40|$|Polycarbonate and {{stainless}} steel are commonly used cage materials for laboratory rodents. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess within-cage preference of rats for cage material, when the effect of illumination was eliminated. Altogether 64 male rats were used in two different facilities. The cages were made of either {{stainless steel}} with a polycarbonate false inner half with or without a false food hopper (Kuopio) or transparent or non-transparent polycarbonate with a steel false inner half (Oulu). A video camera with <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>recording</b> of one second per min was used and the positions of the rats were recorded. Once each week recording started at 16. 00 and ended at 01. 30, and each cage was recorded when the rats were aged four, five, six, seven and eight weeks. The results were processed separately for each facility and for day and night. Statistical analysis was carried out with repeated measures ANOVA. In cages with a stainless steel body and a polycarbonate false half, the rats chose always the cage half with the food hopper, irrespective of the cage material. Thus, the food hopper is more important to rats than the material of the cage; but when the rats were allowed to choose between those two materials, both with a hopper, they favoured steel. In cages with a polycarbonate body and a steel false inner half, the combination of food hopper with low illumination was favoured during light time. In conclusion, this study shows that rats, when given a choice, prefer low illumination and cage material may be of less importance...|$|E

40|$|Closed microphysiological {{systems are}} miniaturized, chip-sized {{platforms}} {{that can be}} used as cellularized organoid systems to study cellular processes like migration, regeneration or proliferation in-vitro. Due to the limited accessibility of the cells inside of closed microphysiological systems, the establishment of a well-defined mechanism to induce specific cell damage is difficult. Here we present a novel laser based method to induce well-defined leasions in closed cell layers. This could be a novel tool to study cellular mechanisms of different cell lines after injury. The present project aimed to establish well-defined lesion in cellular layers without removing the dead cells and their signals. Considering that we constructed a microphysiological system that was produced by layer laminate manufacturing at Fraunhofer IWS. According to the experimental needs the microphysiological system contains two fluidic circuits wich includes reservoirs, channels, and an integrated micropump. To establish the method, blood endothelial outgrowth cells (BEOC) were seeded into the microfluidic system previously coated with collagen (5 ìg/cm²) at a density of approximately 7, 5 x 104 cells/cm². After 3 hours of attachment, a pulsatile flow was applied to the channels. When the whole channel was covered with an BEOC monolayer, laser ablation took place between day 3 and 6 after seeding. To induce the selective cell injury we used an JenLas® D 2. mini laser that was optically integrated into an inverted microscope. The irradiation took several seconds at a power of 3 W with a wave length of 532 nm. The damage and the following regeneration processes were observed by fluorescence microscopy using LIVE/DEAD® Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit. <b>Time</b> <b>Lapse</b> <b>recording</b> was used to visualize the regeneration of the injured cell layers and to study the interacton between different cell types within the system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Signal {{transduction}} processes {{mediated by}} phosphatidyl inositol phosphates affect {{a broad range}} of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, migration and cell survival. The protein kinase AKT {{is one of the major}} effectors in this signaling network. Chronic AKT activation contributes to oncogenic transformation and tumor development. Therefore, analogs of phosphatidyl inositol phosphates (PIAs) were designed as new small drugs to block AKT activity for cancer treatment. Here we characterize the biological effects of the PIAs SH- 5 and SH- 6 in colorectal cancer cell lines. Methods Serum-starved or serum-supplemented human colorectal cancer cell lines SW 480, HT 29 and HCT 116 were exposed to SH- 5 and SH- 6. AKT activation was determined by western blotting. Cell viability was assessed using a colorimetric XTT-based assay, apoptosis and cell cycle changes were monitored by FACS analysis. The dynamics of cell morphology alterations was evaluated by confocal and time-lapse microscopy. Transcriptional changes due to inhibitor treatment were analyzed using Affymetrix HG-U 133 A microarrays and RT-PCR. Results While the PIAs clearly reduce AKT phosphorylation in serum starved cells, we did not observe a significant reduction under serum supplemented conditions, giving us the opportunity to analyze AKT independent effects of these compounds. Both inhibitors induce broadly the same morphological alterations, in particular changes in cell shape and formation of intracellular vesicles. Moreover, we observed the induction of binucleated cells specifically in the SW 480 cell line. Gene expression analysis revealed transcriptional alterations, which are mostly cell line specific. In accordance to the phenotype we found a gene group associated with mitosis and spindle organization down regulated in SW 480 cells, but not in the other cell lines. A bioinformatics analysis using the Connectivity Map linked the gene expression pattern of the inhibitor treated SW 480 cells to PKC signaling. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>recording</b> we identified a specific defect in the last step of the cytokinesis as responsible for the binucleation. Conclusions The PIAs SH- 5 and SH- 6 impinge on additional cellular targets apart from AKT in colorectal cancer cells. The effects are mostly cell line specific and have an influence at the outcome of the treatment. In view of potential clinical trials it will be necessary to take these diverse effects into consideration to optimize patient treatment. </p...|$|E

40|$|Three {{innovative}} and complementary morphological approaches {{were employed to}} study the T cell/antigen presenting cell (APC) interaction: (i) high resolution three-dimensional confocal microscopy of the T cell-APC contact site; (ii) <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> video <b>recording</b> in living T cells of [Ca 2 +]I and changes in distribution of various GFP fusion proteins with TCR/CD 3 -zetacomplex associated- and other signaling components; (iii) measurement of lateral TCR mobility and that of recruited signaling components using techniques based on fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching. These approaches were combined with biochemical and functional experiments to investigate two principal issues: (A) Recruitment and the three-dimensional arrangement of receptors and signaling components at the contact site between human CD 4 + T lymphocytes and APCs, (B) Structure of the immunological synapse formed at the contact site between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and target cells. We discuss evidence indicating that TCR engagement and triggering can occur {{in the absence of}} large-scale molecular segregation into the T cell-APC contact site.

FENS- 1040 The proper {{positioning of}} neurons {{for the establishment}} of functional connectivity of defined neural circuits relies on neuronal migration. We and others reported the restrictive role of chondroitin sulphate (CS) moieties of proteoglycans in axonal fasciculation. CS moieties are therefore hypothesized to regulate the timely orchestration of cranial motor neuron migration during hindbrain development by the differential sulfation patterns of the chondroitins between the migrating and ready-to-migrate neurons. Hindbrain explants of E 11. 5 Sprague Dawley rats were maintained in culture for <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> video <b>recording</b> of individual neuronal somal movements. In control cultures, we observed the advancement of neuronal cell bodies {{in the direction of the}} leading process away from the explant core. In test cultures treated with chondroitinase ABC, the neuronal somata lost the direction movement but retained the motility. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of CS 56 epitopes among Tuj- 1 -positive neurons not only in the explant core and those advancing beyond the core, but also in the environments surrounding the migrating neuronal somata. Chondroitin- 4 -sulfotransferases 2 (C 4 ST 2) showed relatively abundant mRNA expression among cells heading away from the core whereas chondroitin- 4 -sulfotransferase 1 (C 4 ST 1) mRNA was found essentially in the centre of the explant by in situ hybridization. Thus far, the results suggest varying sulfation of chondroitins on proteoglycans expressed by neurons in determining the migratory phenotype. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|FRAP {{has been}} used to {{quantify}} the mobility of GFP-tagged proteins. Using a strong excitation laser, the fluorescence of a GFP-tagged protein is bleached in the region of interest. The fluorescence of the region recovers when the unbleached GFP-tagged protein from outside of the region diffuses into the region of interest. The mobility of the protein is then analyzed by measuring the fluorescence recovery rate. This technique could be used to characterize protein mobility and turnover rate. In this study, we express the (enhanced green fluorescent protein) EGFP vector in cultured hippocampal neurons. Using the Zeiss 710 confocal microscope, we photobleach the fluorescence signal of the GFP protein in a single spine, and then take <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> images to <b>record</b> the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Imaging {{and image}} {{analysis}} advances are yielding increasingly complete and complicated records of cellular events in tissues and whole embryos. The ability to follow hundreds {{to thousands of}} cells {{at the individual level}} demands a spatio-temporal data infrastructure: tools to assemble and collate knowledge about development spatially in a manner analogous to geographic information systems (GIS). Just as GIS indexes items or events based on their spatio-temporal or 4 D location on the Earth these tools would organize knowledge based on location within the tissues or embryos. Developmental processes are highly context-specific, but the complexity of the 4 D environment in which they unfold is a barrier to assembling an understanding of any particular process from diverse sources of information. In the same way that GIS aids the understanding and use of geo-located large data sets, software can, with a proper frame of reference, allow large biological data sets to be understood spatially. Intuitive tools are needed to navigate the spatial structure of complex tissue, collate large data sets and existing knowledge with this spatial structure and help users derive hypotheses about developmental mechanisms. RESULTS: Toward this goal we have developed WormGUIDES, a mobile application that presents a 4 D developmental atlas for Caenorhabditis elegans. The WormGUIDES mobile app enables users to navigate a 3 D model depicting the nuclear positions of all cells in the developing embryo. The identity of each cell can be queried with a tap, and community databases searched for available information about that cell. Information about ancestry, fate and gene expression can be used to label cells and craft customized visualizations that highlight cells as potential players in an event of interest. Scenes are easily saved, shared and published to other WormGUIDES users. The mobile app is available for Android and iOS platforms. CONCLUSION: WormGUIDES provides an important tool for examining developmental processes and developing mechanistic hypotheses about their control. Critically, it provides the typical end user with an intuitive interface for developing and sharing custom visualizations of developmental processes. Equally important, because users can select cells based on their position and search for information about them, the app also serves as a spatially organized index into the large body of knowledge available to the C. elegans community online. Moreover, the app can be used to create and publish the result of exploration: interactive content that brings other researchers and students directly to the spatio-temporal point of insight. Ultimately the app will incorporate a detailed <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>record</b> of cell shape, beginning with neurons. This will add the key ability to navigate and understand the developmental events that result in the coordinated and precise emergence of anatomy, particularly the wiring of the nervous system...|$|R

40|$|The HeCo {{mouse model}} is {{characterized}} by a subcortical heterotopia formed by misplaced neurons normally migrating into the superficial cortical layers. The mutant mouse has a tendency to epileptic seizures. In my thesis project we discovered the mutated Eml 1 gene, a member of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein (EMAP) family, in HeCo as well as in a family of three children showing complex malformation of cortical development. This discovery formed an important step in exploring the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the HeCo phenotype. In vitro results showed that during cell division the EML 1 protein is associated with the midbody and a mutated version of Eml 1 highlighted an important role of the protein in the astral MT array during cell cycle. In vivo, we found that already at an early age of cortical development (E 13), ectopic progenitors such as RGs (PAX 6) and IPCs (TBR 2) accumulate in the IZ along the entire neocortex. We demonstrated that in the VZ of the HeCo mouse, spindle orientation and cell cycle exit are perturbed. In later stages (E 17), RG fibers are strongly disorganized with deep layer (TBR 1) and upper layer (CUX 1) neurons trapped within an ectopic mass. At P 3, columns of upper layer neurons were present between the heterotopia and the developing cortex; these columns were also present at P 7 but at lesser extent. <b>Time</b> <b>lapse</b> video <b>recording</b> (E 15. 5) revealed that the parameters characterizing the migration of individual neurons are not disturbed in HeCo; however, this analysis showed that the density of migrating neuron was smaller in HeCo. In conclusion, truncated EML 1 is likely to play a prominent role during cell cycle but also acts on the cytoskeletal architecture altering the shape of RG fibers thus influencing the pattern of neuronal migration. The signal transduction between external cues and intracellular effector pathways through MTs may be secondary but sustains the heterotopia development and further studies are needed to clarify the impact of EML 1 in progenitors versus post-mitotic cells...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Specific {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis C {{is effective in}} 50 % of patients, improving the]liver`s fibrosis, necroinflammatory changes and steatosis. However, in patients still viremic after treatment the extension of these benefits remains doubtful. The evolution of the disease in this group {{and its relationship to}} demographic data, biometric indices and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies was evaluated. Methodology: In 141 patients, paired biopsies were classified and compared according to fibrosis grading. Necroinflammation, steatosis, demographic data (age and gender), body mass index (BMI) and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies were compared with fibrosis grading. Results: The grade of fibrosis of the patients, after approximately 3. 5 years <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies, could be classified into 4 groups; Improved: 29 (20. 0 %), Unaltered: 64 (45. 0 %), Worsened: 48 (34 %) and Cirrhotic: 14 (9. 93 %).
