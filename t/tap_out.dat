5|$|Following {{the fight}} at UFC 92, Jackson drew {{criticism}} from Todd Martin of CBS Sports for ignoring referee Yves Lavigne's attempt {{to stop the}} contest. Martin compared Jackson's actions to Renato Sobral's continued choke of David Heath following a <b>tap</b> <b>out,</b> which led to Sobral's dismissal from the UFC. Martin called for punishment against Jackson, but no action was taken against Jackson for this allegedly unsportsmanlike behavior.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2010, London {{made his}} debut for Dragon Gate USA in a tag team match, {{where he and}} Jimmy Jacobs were {{defeated}} by Brian Kendrick and Jon Moxley. After the match, Kendrick turned on Moxley and re-formed his team with London, {{which led to a}} Loser Leaves Company tag team match between London and Kendrick and Jacobs and Jack Evans at the following day's tapings of the Mercury Rising pay-per-view. In the end Jacobs forced Kendrick to <b>tap</b> <b>out</b> and as a result he was forced to leave Dragon Gate USA for good. After the match London was assaulted by Teddy Hart.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} the main event from the SmackDown brand, a {{standard}} match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At {{the beginning of the}} match, Lesnar tried {{to walk away from the}} ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including DDT and Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a guillotine choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon, who had accompanied Lesnar to the ring, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to <b>tap</b> <b>out.</b> As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the fight}} (and {{criticism}} from Dana White), Falcão {{stated that the}} lack of action in the third round was because he was waiting for Harris to attack, however he later conceded that White's criticism was fair. The bout's heavy criticism cost Harris his job shortly afterwards. Falcão remarked on his opponent's behavior during the fight, stating [...] "he <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> in three different occasions, hiding it. It was a new thing for me, {{it was the first time}} I got three wins on the same bout. On the first round, he <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> the first time when he was on the four points position, then he <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> again in the end of the first round, when I got him on the rear-naked choke with his body turned up, and on the third round he <b>tapped</b> <b>out</b> again on a rear-naked choke." ...|$|R

5|$|For {{the second}} match, Fuerza Guerrera was {{designated}} {{the captain of}} the rudo team while Heavy Metal served as {{the captain of the}} tecnico team. To win the match, a team would either pin or force the captain to submit, or pin both of the other team members. The two captains started off the match fighting each other before Rey Misterio Jr. and Psicosis quickly took over. Under the Lucha Libre rules, a tag team partner can enter the ring when the other wrestler tags out or leaves the ring, unlike normal tag team rules. At one point, Rey Misterio Jr. threw Psicosis to the outside; Psicosis then ran away from ringside to avoid falling victim to a diving attack from his opponent. Moments later, Madonna's Boyfriend entered the ring and used his superior size to throw Rey Misterio Jr. around before Latin Lover took over for him. After about 10 more minutes of wrestling, Heavy Metal missed a dive, which Fuerza Guerrera took advantage of by locking in an arm submission hold that quickly caused Heavy Metal to <b>tap</b> <b>out.</b> In Lucha Libre, submissions quickly end the first or second fall, but in this case, the end came off so quickly that the announcers questioned if this had turned into a best-of-three falls match. This was one clear example of how plans had changed from three falls to one right before the show.|$|E
5|$|On the November 16 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Hardy and MVP dropped the WWE Tag Team Championship to John Morrison and The Miz. Despite {{the fact that}} Hardy was hurt, MVP {{immediately}} invoked the rematch clause. After the rematch, in which Hardy was forced to <b>tap</b> <b>out,</b> MVP attacked Hardy, repeatedly targeting his knee. It was later confirmed by WWE.com that Hardy had suffered an injury at his former partner's hands and {{that he might not}} be able to compete at Survivor Series. Despite his absence at the pay-per-view, his team was able to win the match. On November 21, WWE's official website reported that Hardy underwent an emergency appendectomy in Tampa, Florida. A CAT scan revealed an inflamed appendix after Hardy was feeling extreme pain. Later surgery revealed that his appendix had already burst. According to Hardy himself, on December 8 doctors back in North Carolina found an abscess of infection that had not been caught, and he had it drained, spending an additional several days in the hospital. Hardy made an appearance at the December 31 episode of Raw supporting his brother Jeff. To further Jeff's storyline with Randy Orton, however, Hardy was attacked by Orton. Hardy made his return at a live event in Muncie, Indiana on March 1, 2008.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to <b>tap</b> <b>out</b> to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar {{successfully}} {{defended his}} newly won title against the debuting Paul London on October 9 episode of SmackDown!. He returned to feud with The Undertaker, as Lesnar had previously cost Undertaker the title in a match against then champion Kurt Angle, which granted him {{a shot at}} Lesnar's title. At No Mercy on October 19, Lesnar defeated Undertaker in a Biker Chain match. After Paul Heyman returned to WWE as SmackDown! General Manager, Lesnar aligned himself with his former manager. With Survivor Series coming up, Lesnar decided to challenge Angle to a traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Lesnar chose Big Show as his first teammate, with Heyman adding a returning Nathan Jones and a debuting Matt Morgan to bring the team number to four. Angle chose Chris Benoit and The APA to join his team. However, Faarooq was injured during a match with Lesnar and Angle's team was forced to find a replacement for him. Lesnar's team picked A-Train to fill the fifth and final spot for them after he attacked John Cena, who refused to accept an invitation to join Lesnar's team. Cena instead joined Angle's team and Angle added Hardcore Holly as the fifth member (Lesnar had legitimately injured Holly the year before and he had not wrestled since). On November 16 at Survivor Series, Lesnar was eliminated after Benoit forced him to <b>tap</b> <b>out</b> to the Crippler Crossface. Lesnar defended the WWE Championship against Benoit on SmackDown!, where Lesnar won after Benoit passed out to Lesnar's debuting Brock Lock submission hold.|$|E
25|$|His next {{fight was}} an {{anticipated}} rematch with Manabu Yamada, which lasted only 0:54 before Rutten made him to <b>tap</b> <b>out</b> to a leg-entangled toehold. Following the match, he relinquished his title {{to be present}} {{for the birth of}} his second daughter.|$|E

25|$|The feud {{ended on}} February 24, 2002, at Pride 19, where Shamrock fought Frye {{in the main}} event in a match that {{potentially}} had PRIDE Heavyweight Championship title implications (PRIDE FC considered giving the winner of this fight a title shot against Pride heavyweight champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira). Frye got the edge {{on a series of}} clinch battles, while Shamrock dropped down for an ankle lock and transitioned into both a kneebar and a toehold, wrenching Frye's leg badly; however, despite the damage, Frye refused to <b>tap</b> <b>out</b> and managed to knock Shamrock down in a subsequent punching exchange. The bout moved to the mat, where Shamrock attempted another ankle lock, only for Frye to try to counter with one of his own and finally refusing to <b>tap</b> <b>out</b> by sheer will until the time ran out. Shamrock lost a close split decision, and the two hugged after the fight ended, putting an end to their rivalry.|$|E

Regardless of the loophole, Transit police or designated transit security fare enforcement officers may issue a fine if they catch riders without adequate fare in a Fare Paid Zone. Furthermore, the <b>tapping</b> <b>out</b> process on buses {{was reported to be}} slow, and failure to record a passenger's <b>tapping</b> <b>out</b> may have resulted in the passenger being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they only travelled through one or two zones.|$|R

25|$|On September 9, 1994, Shamrock {{returned}} to the octagon at UFC 3 in an event that was marketed by the UFC as the ultimate rematch between two-time champion Royce Gracie and #1 contender Shamrock. Shamrock's first fight, now allowed to wear his shoes, was against top ranked judo practitioner Christophe Leininger. Leininger engaged for a takedown, but Shamrock blocked and got on top, unloading hard punches and headbutts until the <b>tap</b> <b>out.</b> Shamrock crossed faced Leininger so hard into the mat that Leininger admitted to being knocked out for a second, and he later was revealed to have suffered a mild concussion. Shamrock's next fight was in the semifinals against kickboxer Felix Mitchell. Shamrock took Mitchell down and forced him to <b>tap</b> <b>out</b> due to a rear naked choke. With this win, Shamrock advanced to the finals of UFC 3.
