5|$|Polar {{bears are}} thought to have diverged from a {{population}} of brown bears, Ursus arctos, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> might not be considered a species under some species concepts.|$|E
5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear,</b> ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of extant bear {{species is}} shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Yu et al., 2007. The giant panda, followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species. The relationships of the other species are not very well resolved, though <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> and the brown bear form a close grouping.|$|E

5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E

5|$|The {{brown bear}} and both species of black bears {{sometimes}} take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly {{the young and}} weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. <b>The</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{subfamily}} Ursinae {{experienced a}} dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first {{members of the}} genus Ursus appeared around this time. The sloth bear is a modern survivor {{of one of the}} earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4 Mya, the species Ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's Asian black bear. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from U. minimus: the black bears (including the sun bear, the Asian black bear, and the American black bear); and the brown bears (which includes <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear).</b> Modern brown bears evolved from U. minimus via Ursus etruscus, which itself is ancestral to the extinct Pleistocene cave bear. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. <b>The</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> is the most recently evolved species and descended from the brown bear around 400,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|These small {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. <b>The</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.|$|E
5|$|Taurus {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing the spirit of <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear.</b> Aldebaran represents the bear, with {{the remainder of the}} stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.|$|E

5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). <b>The</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammal {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. <b>The</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|E
5|$|Smeerenburg {{was one of}} {{the first}} settlements, {{established}} by the Dutch in 1619. Smaller bases were also built by the English, Danish and French. At first the outposts were merely summer camps, but from the early 1630s, a few individuals started to overwinter. Whaling at Spitsbergen lasted until the 1820s, when the Dutch, British and Danish whalers moved elsewhere in the Arctic. By the late 17th century, Russian hunters arrived; they overwintered to a greater extent and hunted land mammals such as <b>the</b> <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> and fox. After British raids into the Barents Sea in 1809, Russian activity on Svalbard diminished, and ceased by the 1820s. Norwegian hunting—mostly for walrus—started in the 1790s. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast Sámi people from the Hammerfest region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795. Norwegian whaling was abandoned about the same time as the Russians left, but whaling continued around Spitsbergen until the 1830s, and around Bjørnøya until the 1860s.|$|E
