5|$|Although each {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger <b>than</b> <b>female</b> ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting {{out to sea}} when resting and eating, sea otters may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker <b>than</b> <b>female</b> skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
5|$|Soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic, but {{insoluble}} thulium salts {{are completely}} nontoxic. When injected, thulium can cause degeneration {{of the liver}} and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate. Liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice <b>than</b> <b>female</b> mice. Despite this, thulium has {{a low level of}} toxicity. In humans, thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver, kidneys and bones. Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year. The roots of plants do not take up thulium, and the dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium. Thulium dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions. Radioactive thulium isotopes can cause radiation poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Male gilt darters {{grow faster}} and larger <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> They reach {{a length of}} around 70mm in their third year. Larger specimens, up to 94mm have been {{reported}} in the Ozarks. Males are also more colorful <b>than</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes <b>than</b> <b>female</b> ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other whales (and {{most other}} mammals), the females {{are larger than}} the males. Sexual {{dimorphism}} is usually reversed, with the males being larger, but the females of all baleen whales are usually five percent larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is also displayed through whale song, notably in humpback whales where the males of the species sing elaborate songs. Male right whales have bigger callosities <b>than</b> <b>female</b> right whales. The males are generally more scarred than females which {{is thought to be}} because of aggression during mating season.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price <b>than</b> <b>female</b> concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{males are}} {{four times more}} likely to die by suicide <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> {{although}} more women than men report suicide attempts. Male suicide rates are higher <b>than</b> <b>females</b> in all age groups (the ratio varies from 3:1 to 10:1). In other western countries, males are also much more likely to die by suicide <b>than</b> <b>females</b> (usually by a factor of 3-4:1). It was the 8th leading cause of death for males, and 19th leading cause of death for females. Excess male mortality from suicide is also evident from data from non-Western countries.|$|R
5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a small, narrow-bodied worm. It is narrowest at {{the front}} and {{increases}} in width to about three fourths of its length. The cuticle, the surface layer, is smooth. Females are 13.8 to 19.4mm long, averaging 16.9mm, which makes them substantially longer <b>than</b> <b>female</b> A.putorii, and 55 to 70 (average 62) μm wide. The eggs are smooth, lacking the elaborate pattern on the surface seen in A.putorii, and are 53 to 58 (54) μm long and 21 to 24 (21) μm broad. The esophagus, the frontmost part of the digestive system, is 2.9 to 3.9 (3.6) mm long and is lined by 36 to 45 (40) cells known as stichocytes. The vulva is located 66 to 105 (83) μm behind {{the end of the}} esophagus and the anus is {{near the end of the}} worm, which is rounded.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow (Passer pyrrhonotus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found {{around the}} Indus valley region in South Asia. It {{is also known}} as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. Very similar to the related house sparrow, it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. As in the house sparrow, the male has brighter plumage <b>than</b> <b>female</b> and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other sparrow species do. Its main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the house sparrow, but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. Discovered around 1840, this species went undetected for several decades after its discovery.|$|E
5|$|These minks {{were large}} and heavily built, {{with a low}} {{sagittal}} crest and short, wide postorbital processes (projections on the frontal bone behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, {{in that it was}} clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital fenestrae (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger <b>than</b> <b>female</b> sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.|$|E

25|$|One common {{misconception}} of BDSM and kink is {{that women}} are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study <b>than</b> <b>female,</b> and fewer male dominants <b>than</b> <b>female.</b> The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{association}} with gender on the SAT {{is found in}} the math section where male students, on average, score higher <b>than</b> <b>female</b> students by approximately 30 points.

25|$|LH {{stimulates the}} Leydig {{cells of the}} testes to make {{testosterone}} and blood levels begin to rise. For much of puberty, nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime.

25|$|The {{effects of}} {{paternal}} age on offspring {{are not yet}} well understood and are studied far less extensively than the effects of maternal age. Fathers contribute proportionally more DNA mutations to their offspring via their germ cells than the mother, with the paternal age governing how many mutations are passed on. This is because, as humans age, male germ cells acquire mutations at a much faster rate <b>than</b> <b>female</b> germ cells.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Fuegen et al. {{found that}} when evaluators rated fictitious {{applicants}} for an attorney position, female applicants with children were held {{to a higher standard}} <b>than</b> <b>female</b> applicants without children. Fathers were actually held to a significantly lower standard than male non-parents. Cuddy, Fiske, and Glick show that describing a consultant as a mother leads evaluators to rate her as less competent than when she is described as not having children.|$|E

30|$|Generally, {{as in this}} study, {{males are}} taller <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> which might explain why, on average, males {{resulted}} in lower AUC(CV[*]>[*] 20 %) values <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> The possibility to analyse the outer part of the lungs separately {{makes it possible to}} discriminate between healthy and non-healthy distributions in this region (see Figures  4 and 5).|$|R
40|$|Gonadal steroids masculinize and defeminize neuroendocrine development, {{including}} behavior. Defeminization makes males {{less sensitive}} <b>than</b> <b>females</b> to estrogen for showing female sexual behavior and cyclic gonadotropin secretion. Masculinization makes males more sensitive <b>than</b> <b>females</b> to estrogen for showing male sexual behavior. Thus masculinization and defeminization produce opposite effects on estrogen sensitivity. To study {{the relationship between}} estrogen sensitivity and estrogen binding, we studied sex differences in estrogen binding to hypothalamic cell nuclei on a regional and temporal basis. We measured the amount of estradiol (Ez) bound to cell nuclei in the preoptic area (POA), mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), corticomedial amygdala, and cortex of gonadectomized male and female rats 30 and 60 min after [3 H]E 2 was injected intravenously. In the MBH, males consistently bound less Ea <b>than</b> <b>females</b> did. In the POA, males bound less En <b>than</b> <b>females</b> after 60 min, but they bound more Ez <b>than</b> <b>females</b> after 30 min. Decreased estrogen binding in the MBH may underlie defeminized sexual behavior. Similarly, decreased estrogen binding in the POA at 60 min may be a correlate of defeminized gonadotropin secretion, whereas increased estrogen binding in the POA at 30 min may be a correlate of masculinized sexual behavior...|$|R
