According to Knight, Barkley was cut because of poor defense.|$|E
5|$|Born in Munich, Germany, Hamauzu's {{mother was}} a piano teacher and his father, Akimori Hamauzu, an opera singer. He {{developed}} an interest in music while in kindergarten. Growing up in Germany, Hamauzu received piano and singing lessons from his parents and created his first original compositions during high school. After his brother, Hiroshi, was born, {{the family moved to}} Osaka. He enrolled in the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, where he joined a student ensemble as a pianist. Hamauzu met his wife, Matsue Hamauzu (née Fukushi), at the university, and they have two children. Matsue worked alongside Hamauzu on the soundtrack <b>to</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VII as a soprano and Sigma Harmonics as a scat singer; she was also a soprano for the score <b>to</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VIII & a lead vocalist in Final Fantasy XIII. After graduating from the university, he thought about becoming a classical musician, but he eventually found out that he wanted to work with game music instead.|$|E

The first compilation album produced by an outside group was The Best of Final Fantasy 1994–1999: A Musical Tribute, released in 2000 by Sherman F. Heinig; the newest is Voices of the Lifestream, a download-only album from OverClocked ReMix released in 2007.|$|E

The player has the choice to follow the story of either the hero or the heroine, who are named by the player, instead of only the hero as in the original game. The two stories parallel each other, and the two protagonists are often together.|$|E

5|$|Adam Cleveland at IGN called Revelations: The Demon Slayer a fun but not {{innovative}} game. The American game magazine Nintendo Power did however find it innovative; for instance, they {{cited the}} automatic battle option. Cleveland disliked the monster conversation system, which he found irritating; {{he said that}} players never know what answer they should give a monster, and that the questions the monsters ask feel monotone due to how often they are repeated. Writers for the Japanese game magazine Famitsu thought the monster fusion system was fun. In their review of Last Bible III, they commented on how different the game is from the Megami Tensei series, and instead compared it <b>to</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove wrote for Hardcore Gaming 101 that while The Demon Slayer was {{not by any means}} an outstanding game, it was one of few competent role-playing games on Game Boy. They found Last Bible III to be the best game in the series.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Final Fantasy I, Uematsu {{remained}} with the series to compose the soundtrack <b>to</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy II (1988). Although I and II were composed separately, music from the two games have only been released on albums together. These albums include a soundtrack album and two arranged albums. Final Fantasy III (1990) was released two years later and featured a soundtrack from Uematsu that has been lauded {{as one of the}} best soundtracks of any NES game. The soundtrack spawned two soundtrack albums, as well as a disc of vocal and orchestral arrangements.|$|E

5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on <b>to</b> <b>final</b> approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development <b>to</b> <b>final</b> production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

Before each chapter begins, the player is given the option of viewing the story or skipping to the race except when playing the Story Mode for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Citizen Kane was {{the only}} film made under Welles's {{original}} contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control. Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941, Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO under which he produced and directed The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), produced Journey into Fear (1943), and began It's All True, a film he agreed to do without payment. In the new contract Welles was {{an employee of the}} studio and lost the right <b>to</b> <b>final</b> cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut The Magnificent Ambersons over his objections. In June 1942 Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors <b>to</b> <b>final</b> products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
5|$|Compared <b>to</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E

5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story <b>to</b> <b>final</b> release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Collection {{sold over}} 400,000 copies in 1999, {{making it the}} 31st best selling release of that year in Japan. Weekly Famitsu gave it a 54 out of 60 points, scored {{by a panel of}} six reviewers. The Game Boy Advance version, Final Fantasy IV Advance, was met with praise from reviewers, {{although}} a few noted the game's graphics do not hold up well to current games, especially when compared <b>to</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VI. Reviewers noted that some fans may still nitpick certain errors in the new translation. The Nintendo DS version of the game was praised for its visuals, gameplay changes and new cutscenes. It was a nominee for Best RPG on the Nintendo DS in IGN's 2008 video game awards.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy II {{introduced}} {{many elements}} {{that would later}} become staples of the Final Fantasy franchise, including chocobos and the recurring character Cid. It also eliminated the traditional experience point leveling system of the previous and later games in the series, instead introducing an activity-based progression system where the characters' statistics increase according to how they are used or acquired. Despite being a sequel <b>to</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy, the game includes no characters or locations from the first game. Final Fantasy II received little attention at the time from non-Japanese reviewers, though its remakes have garnered favorable reviews.|$|E
