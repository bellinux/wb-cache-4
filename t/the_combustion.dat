5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because <b>the</b> <b>combustion</b> process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in <b>the</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|Single motor {{extended}} – The battery {{reaches its}} minimum charge which triggers <b>the</b> <b>combustion</b> engine.

The primary motor can still provide its 111kW for short acceleration, albeit not sustained.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing <b>the</b> <b>combustion</b> of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
50|$|The fuel {{efficiency}} of <b>the</b> staged <b>combustion</b> cycle {{is in part}} {{a result of all}} propellant ultimately flowing to <b>the</b> main <b>combustion</b> chamber; contributing to thrust. <b>The</b> staged <b>combustion</b> cycle is sometimes referred to as closed cycle, as opposed to the gas generator, or open, cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches <b>the</b> main <b>combustion</b> chamber. <b>The</b> engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.|$|R
40|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine fueled with a coal-water slurry is described. About 90 percent of the coal-water slurry charge utilized in the power cycle of the engine is directly injected into <b>the</b> main <b>combustion</b> chamber where it is ignited by a hot stream of combustion gases discharged from a pilot combustion chamber of a size less than about 10 {{percent of the total}} clearance volume of main <b>combustion</b> chamber with <b>the</b> piston at top dead center. The stream of hot combustion gases is provided by injecting less than about 10 percent of the total coal-water slurry charge into <b>the</b> pilot <b>combustion</b> chamber and using a portion of the air from <b>the</b> main <b>combustion</b> chamber that has been heated by the walls defining <b>the</b> pilot <b>combustion</b> chamber as <b>the</b> ignition source for the coal-water slurry injected into <b>the</b> pilot <b>combustion</b> chamber...|$|R
40|$|The {{ignition}} {{characteristics of}} lean primary reference fuel (PRF) /air/exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) mixture under reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) and direct duel fuel stratification (DDFS) conditions are investigated by 2 -D direct numerical simulations (DNSs) with a 116 -species reduced chemistry of the PRF oxidation. The 2 -D DNSs of <b>the</b> DDFS <b>combustion</b> are performed by varying the injection timing of iso-octane (i-C 8 H 18) with a pseudo-iso-octane (PC 8 H 18) model {{together with a}} novel compression heating model {{to account for the}} compression heating and expansion cooling effects of the piston motion in an engine cylinder. The PC 8 H 18 model is newly developed to mimic the timing, duration, and cooling effects of the direct injection of i-C 8 H 18 onto a premixed background charge of PRF/air/EGR mixture with composition inhomogeneities. It is found that <b>the</b> RCCI <b>combustion</b> exhibits a very high peak heat release rate (HRR) with a short combustion duration due to the predominance of the spontaneous ignition mode of <b>combustion.</b> However, <b>the</b> DDFS <b>combustion</b> has much lower peak HRR and longer combustion duration regardless of the fuel injection timing compared to those of <b>the</b> RCCI <b>combustion,</b> which is primarily attributed to the sequential injection of i-C 8 H 18. It is also found that the ignition delay of <b>the</b> DDFS <b>combustion</b> features a non-monotonic behavior with increasing fuel-injection timing due to the different effect of fuel evaporation on the low-, intermediate-, and high-temperature chemistry of the PRF oxidation. The budget and Damköhler number analyses verify that although a mixed combustion mode of deflagration and spontaneous ignition exists during the early phase of <b>the</b> DDFS <b>combustion,</b> <b>the</b> spontaneous ignition becomes predominant during <b>the</b> main <b>combustion,</b> and hence, <b>the</b> spread-out of heat release rate in <b>the</b> DDFS <b>combustion</b> is mainly governed by the direct injection process of i-C 8 H 18. Finally, a misfire is observed for <b>the</b> DDFS <b>combustion</b> when <b>the</b> direct injection of i-C 8 H 18 occurs during the intermediate-temperature chemistry (ITC) regime between the first- and second-stage ignition. This is because the temperature drop induced by the direct injection of i-C 8 H 18 impedes the main ITC reactions, and hence, <b>the</b> main <b>combustion</b> fails to occur...|$|R
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for <b>the</b> <b>combustion</b> of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room.

The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E

They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709.

40|$|To simplify {{analysis}} {{of an internal}} combustion engine, air-standard cycles are conceived. Air is assumed to behave like an ideal gas. In practice, air-standard analysis provides useful indication of the trends that the engine is likely to follow. Air-standard Otto and Joule-Brayton cycles are bona fide assumption and cannot represent <b>the</b> complex <b>combustion</b> process occurring in <b>the</b> internal <b>combustion</b> engines. In this paper, <b>the</b> complex <b>combustion</b> process is represented by a parameter called fuel-flame temperature. <b>The</b> effect of <b>combustion</b> on <b>the</b> thermoeconomic performances of Otto and Joule-Brayton engines are studied. It is observed that the efficiency at maximum power {{is less than the}} Curzon-Ahlbom efficiency. The economic performance of the engine deteriorates due to <b>combustion.</b> <b>The</b> efficiency of the engine corresponds to maximum specific-power output, depends not only on the fuel-flame temperature, but also on the specific heats of the air and fuel. Ideal gas assumption of the working fluid is relaxed in this paper.

40|$|Through {{separating}} coal pyrolysis and char <b>combustion</b> {{and letting}} <b>the</b> pyrolysis gas burn in its {{passing through the}} combusting char bed, <b>the</b> so-called decoupling <b>combustion</b> has been proven to be effective for lowering NOx emission of coal and biomass <b>combustion.</b> <b>The</b> original design of <b>the</b> decoupling <b>combustion</b> was based on coal pyrolysis incurring with the heat transferring from <b>the</b> char <b>combustion</b> zone, thus causing the difficulty of scale-up in matching the reactions of slow coal pyrolysis and quick char combustion. An idea of using partial gasification to replace such a pyrolysis was proposed to allow the combination of reburning part of the gasification gas over the combusting char layer and <b>the</b> decoupling <b>combustion</b> of <b>the</b> left gasification gas by letting it pass through the char bed. This article compared first the effectiveness of reducing NOx emission by a few different combustion methods including reburning of gasification gas and <b>the</b> decoupling <b>combustion</b> based on coal pyrolysis in a laboratory scale dual-stage reactor for five different kinds of coal. It was shown that both <b>the</b> decoupling <b>combustion</b> and reburning of gasification gas represented the most effective low-NOx combustion methods, which can reduce the NOx emission by 30 - 40 % in comparison with <b>the</b> traditional <b>combustion</b> without air-staging and reburning. The fuel ratio of fixed carbon to volatile matters of the coal also affected the effectiveness of NOx reduction, the lower the fuel ratio, the higher the NOx reduction effect was. The actual running test of a 1. 4 MW industrial boiler based on combining <b>the</b> decoupling <b>combustion</b> and reburning part of the partial gasification gas reduced the NOx emission by 33 % {{in comparison with the}} traditional industrial boiler. The result showed a successful scale-up of the technology and verified the idea of reducing NOx emission by combining <b>the</b> decoupling <b>combustion</b> and <b>the</b> reburning of coal gasification gas.

5|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{of water}} is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode.

5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as <b>the</b> <b>combustion</b> of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by <b>the</b> <b>combustion</b> of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in <b>the</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
