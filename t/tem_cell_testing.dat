40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Conventional {{immunity}} tests are both time consuming and costly. There {{is thus a}} reasonable interest in relatively quick, but accurate and cost effective, in-house pre-compliance test techniques within an engineering design-house. This thesis provides information on the equivalence between in-house and conventional immunity test techniques. Three techniques were evaluated, namely: 1. E-field radiation with a log periodic antenna (conventional test technique); 2 E-field radiation with an inhouse designed and constructed modified <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> (in-house <b>test</b> technique); 3. Current injection using a complete off the shelf EMCO current probe device (in-house test technique). After the transfer data of the EMCO probe was verified, the modified <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> design, construction and equivalent measurement tests were performed. These tests revealed that within the respective bandwidth of interest, the devices produced results that are equivalent to each other within 0. 9 dB. Hence equivalence between in-house and conventional test techniques is possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a two-port <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> has been numerically {{investigated}} {{with respect to the}} shape of the transitions connecting the small rectangular terminations, where connectors are fixed, and the <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> rectangular central part. At first, using a commercial code, the model has been developed and its validation has been done on an existing <b>TEM</b> <b>cell.</b> Then, starting from this <b>TEM</b> <b>cell,</b> a parametric analysis has been performed. The numerical results are shown and the effects of each parameter on the voltage standing wave ratio are discussed, with simple and practical diagrams useful for the {{design of a}} <b>TEM</b> <b>cell.</b> On the basis of the numerical analysis, modifications of the septum were performed on the <b>TEM</b> <b>cell,</b> and a substantial reduction of the highest values of VSWR has been obtained. Finally, a numerical optimized solution for the <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> with a maximum VSWR of 1. 02 has been identified...|$|R
40|$|SummaryEffector memory T (<b>Tem)</b> <b>cells</b> are {{essential}} mediators of autoimmune disease and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a convenient model for two-photon imaging of <b>Tem</b> <b>cell</b> participation in an inflammatory response. Shortly (3 hr) after entry into antigen-primed ear tissue, <b>Tem</b> <b>cells</b> stably attached to antigen-bearing antigen-presenting cells (APCs). After 24 hr, enlarged <b>Tem</b> <b>cells</b> were highly motile along collagen fibers {{and continued to}} migrate rapidly for 18 hr. <b>Tem</b> <b>cells</b> rely on voltage-gated Kv 1. 3 potassium channels to regulate calcium signaling. ShK- 186, a specific Kv 1. 3 blocker, inhibited DTH and suppressed <b>Tem</b> <b>cell</b> enlargement and motility in inflamed tissue but {{had no effect on}} homing to or motility in lymph nodes of naive and central memory T (Tcm) cells. ShK- 186 effectively treated disease in a rat model of multiple sclerosis. These results demonstrate a requirement for Kv 1. 3 channels in <b>Tem</b> <b>cells</b> during an inflammatory immune response in peripheral tissues. Targeting Kv 1. 3 allows for effector memory responses to be suppressed while central memory responses remain intact...|$|R

40|$|In the {{development}} of a low-cost two-port <b>TEM</b> <b>cell,</b> a new analytical model of the capacitance of the terminations has been performed. The model has been verified by calculating the termination capacitance by means of a commercial 3 D code. A <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> modified in accordance with the obtained results has been tested, with reference to the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) parameter, and the obtained improvements on VSWR versus frequency are reported. The <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> is the principal part of a test system for RF exposure (up to 230 MHz), including signal generator, power amplifier, dual directional coupler, 50 Ω load attenuator and 1 GHz bandwidth oscilloscope, whose commissioning has been performed.

40|$|Primary simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) infections of rhesus macaques {{result in the}} dramatic depletion of CD 4 + CCR 5 + effector–memory T (<b>TEM)</b> <b>cells</b> from extra-lymphoid effector sites, but in most infections, an increased rate of CD 4 + memory T cell proliferation appears to prevent collapse of effector site CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> populations and acute-phase AIDS. Eventually, persistent SIV replication results in chronic-phase AIDS, but the responsible mechanisms remain controversial. Here, we demonstrate that in the chronic phase of progressive SIV infection, effector site CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> populations manifest a slow, continuous decline, and {{that the degree of}} this depletion remains a highly significant correlate of late-onset AIDS. We further show that due to persistent immune activation, effector site CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> are predominantly short-lived, and that their homeostasis is strikingly dependent on the production of new CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> from central–memory T (TCM) cell precursors. The instability of effector site CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> populations over time was not explained by increasing destruction of these cells, but rather was attributable to progressive reduction in their production, secondary to decreasing numbers of CCR 5 − CD 4 + TCM cells. These data suggest that although CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> depletion is a proximate mechanism of immunodeficiency, the tempo of this depletion and the timing of disease onset are largely determined by destruction, failing production, and gradual decline of CD 4 + TCM cells...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that the maturation state of dendritic cells (DCs) is a critical parameter determining the balance between tolerance and immunity. We report that mouse CD 4 + effector memory T (<b>TEM)</b> <b>cells,</b> but not naive or central memory T cells, constitutively expressed CD 40 L at levels sufficient to induce DC maturation in vitro and in vivo {{in the absence of}} antigenic stimulation. CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> were excluded from resting lymph nodes but migrated in a CD 62 P-dependent fashion into reactive lymph nodes that were induced to express CD 62 P, in a transient or sustained fashion, on high endothelial venules. Trafficking of CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> into chronic reactive lymph nodes maintained resident DCs in a mature state and promoted naive T cell responses and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to antigens administered in the absence of adjuvants. Antibodies to CD 62 P, which blocked CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> migration into reactive lymph nodes, inhibited DC maturation, T cell priming, and induction of EAE. These results show that <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> can behave as endogenous adjuvants and suggest a mechanistic link between lymphocyte traffic in lymph nodes and induction of autoimmunity...|$|R
40|$|Memory T {{cells can}} be divided into central memory T cell (T(CM) cell) and {{effector}} memory T <b>cell</b> (<b>T(EM)</b> <b>cell)</b> subsets based on homing characteristics and effector functions. Whether <b>T(EM)</b> and T(CM) <b>cells</b> represent interconnected or distinct lineages is unclear, although the present paradigm suggests that <b>T(EM)</b> and T(CM) <b>cells</b> follow a linear differentiation pathway from naive T cells to effector T <b>cells</b> to <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cells</b> to T(CM) cells. We show here that naive T cell precursor frequency profoundly influenced the pathway along which CD 8 + memory T cells developed. At low precursor frequency, those <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cells</b> generated represented a stable cell lineage that failed to further differentiate into T(CM) cells. These findings do not adhere to the present dogma regarding memory T cell generation and provide a means for identifying factors controlling memory T cell lineage commitment...|$|R

A double-ended monopole antenna is proposed as the lead signal inducer between the inside and the outside areas of the <b>TEM</b> <b>cell.</b> The coupling voltage at the <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> ports and the field distribution within the area under test (AUT) {{were found to be}} a function of the phone position, polarization, and dialing type. The measurements for a GSM 850 MHz cellular phone showed that the optimum setup is achievable when the phone is placed outside the <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> and co-polarized with the signal leader.

40|$|International audienceThe T cell {{compartment}} {{is considered}} to be naïve and dedicated to the development of tolerance during fetal development. We have identified and characterized a population of fetally developed CD 4 T cells with an effector memory phenotype (TEM), which are present in cord blood. This population is polyclonal and has phenotypic features similar to those of conventional adult memory T cells, such as CD 45 RO expression. These cells express low levels of CD 25 but are distinct from regulatory T cells because they lack Foxp 3 expression. After T cell receptor activation, neonatal <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> readily produced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We also detected interferon-γ (IFN-γ) -producing T helper 1 (TH 1) cells and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) /IL- 13 -producing TH 2 -like cells, but not IL- 17 -producing cells. We used chemokine receptor expression patterns to divide this TEM population into different subsets and identified distinct transcriptional programs using whole-genome microarray analysis. IFN-γ was found in CXCR 3 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas IL- 4 was found in both CXCR 3 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> and CCR 4 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells.</b> CCR 6 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> displayed a genetic signature that corresponded to TH 17 cells but failed to produce IL- 17 A. However, the TH 17 function of <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> was observed in the presence of IL- 1 β and IL- 23. In summary, in the absence of reported pathology or any major infectious history, T cells with a memory-like phenotype develop in an environment thought to be sterile during fetal development and display a large variety of inflammatory effector functions associated with CD 4 TH cells at birth...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE: Accumulating {{evidence}} supports a role of adaptive immunity and particularly T {{cells in the}} pathogenesis of hypertension. Formation of memory T cells, which requires the costimulatory molecule CD 70 on antigen-presenting cells, is a cardinal feature of adaptive immunity. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that CD 70 and immunologic memory contribute to the blood pressure elevation and renal dysfunction mediated by repeated hypertensive challenges. METHODS AND RESULTS: We imposed repeated hypertensive challenges using either N(ω) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) /high salt or repeated angiotensin II stimulation in mice. During these challenges effector memory T <b>cells</b> (<b>T(EM))</b> accumulated in the kidney and bone marrow. In the L-NAME/high-salt model, memory T cells of the kidney were predominant sources of interferon-γ and interleukin- 17 A, known to contribute to hypertension. L-NAME/high salt increased macrophage and dendritic cell surface expression of CD 70 by 3 - to 5 -fold. Mice lacking CD 70 did not accumulate <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cells</b> and did not develop hypertension to either high salt or the second angiotensin II challenge and were protected against renal damage. Bone marrow-residing <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cells</b> proliferated and redistributed to the kidney in response to repeated salt feeding. Adoptively transferred <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cells</b> from hypertensive mice homed to the bone marrow and spleen and expanded on salt feeding of the recipient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate a previously undefined role of CD 70 and long-lived <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the development of}} blood pressure elevation and end-organ damage that occur on delayed exposure to mild hypertensive stimuli. Interventions to prevent repeated hypertensive surges could attenuate formation of hypertension-specific <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cell...</b>|$|R
40|$|HIV {{infection}} selectively targets CD 4 + effector memory T (<b>TEM)</b> <b>cells,</b> {{resulting in}} dramatic depletion of CD 4 + T cells in mucosal effector sites in early infection. Regeneration of the <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> compartment {{is slow and}} incomplete, even when viral replication is controlled by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we demonstrate that IL- 15 dramatically increases in vivo proliferation of rhesus macaque (RM) CD 4 + and CD 8 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> with {{little effect on the}} naive or central memory T (TCM) cell subsets, a response pattern that is quite distinct from that of either IL- 2 or IL- 7. <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> produced in response to IL- 15 did not accumulate in blood. Rather, 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling studies suggest that many of these cells rapidly disperse to extralymphoid effector sites, where they manifest (slow) decay kinetics indistinguishable from that of untreated controls. In RMs with uncontrolled SIV infection and highly activated immune systems, IL- 15 did not significantly increase CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, but with virologic control and concomitant reduction in immune activation by ART, IL- 15 responsiveness was again observed. These data suggest that therapeutic use of IL- 15 in the setting of ART might facilitate specific restoration of the CD 4 + T cell compartment that is the primary target of HIV with less risk of exhausting precursor T cell compartments or generating potentially deleterious regulatory subsets...|$|R

40|$|Background: Persistent {{expansion}} of circulating CD 4 (+) effector memory T <b>cells</b> (<b>TEM)</b> {{in patients with}} granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) suggests their fundamental role in disease pathogenesis. Recent {{studies have shown that}} distinct functional CD 4 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> subsets can be identified based on expression patterns of chemokine receptors. The current study aimed to determine different CD 4 (+) <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> subsets based on chemokine receptor expression in peripheral blood of GPA patients. Identification of particular circulating CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> subsets may reveal distinct contributions of specific CD 4 (+) TEM subsets to the disease pathogenesis in GPA. Method: Peripheral blood of 63 GPA patients in remission and 42 age-and sex-matched healthy controls was stained immediately after blood withdrawal with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for cell surface markers (CD 3, CD 4, CD 45 RO) and chemokine receptors (CCR 4, CCR 6, CCR 7, CRTh 2, CXCR 3) followed by flow cytometry analysis. CD 4 + <b>TEM</b> memory <b>cells</b> (CD 3 (+) CD 4 (+) CD 45 RO(+) CCR 7 (-)) were gated, and the expression patterns of chemokine receptors CXCR 3 + CCR(4) CCR 6 -CRTh 2 (-), CXCR 3 -CCR 4 (+) CCR 6 -CRTh 2 (+), CXCR 3 -CCR 4 (+) CCR 6 (+) CRTh 2 (-), and CXCR 3 (+) CCR 4 -CCR 6 (+) CRTh 2 -were used to distinguish T(EM) 1, T(EM) 2, T(EM) 17, and <b>T(EM)</b> 17. 1 <b>cells,</b> respectively. Results: The percentage of CD 4 (+) T-EM cells was significantly increased in GPA patients in remission compared to HCs. Chemokine receptor co-expression analysis within the CD 4 (+) T-EM cell population demonstrated {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of <b>T(EM)</b> 17 <b>cells</b> with a concomitant significant decrease in the <b>T(EM)</b> 1 <b>cells</b> in GPA patients compared to HC. The percentage of <b>T(EM)</b> 17 <b>cells</b> correlated negatively with <b>T(EM)</b> 1 <b>cells</b> in GPA patients. Moreover, the circulating proportion of <b>T(EM)</b> 17 <b>cells</b> showed a positive correlation with the number of organs involved and an association with the tendency to relapse in GPA patients. Interestingly, the aberrant distribution of T(EM) 1 and <b>T(EM)</b> 17 <b>cells</b> is modulated in CMV-seropositive GPA patients. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates the identification of different CD 4 (+) T-EM cell subsets in peripheral blood of GPA patients based on chemokine receptor co-expression analysis. The aberrant balance between T(EM) 1 and <b>T(EM)</b> 17 <b>cells</b> in remission GPA patients, showed to be associated with disease pathogenesis in relation to organ involvement, and tendency to relapse...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is associated with an ongoing immune effector response, even in remission, we examined the distribution of peripheral naive and memory T-lymphocytes in this disease, and analyzed the function-related phenotypes of the memory T-cell population. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were freshly isolated from WG-patients in remission (R-WG, n = 40), active WG-patients (A-WG, n = 17), and age-matched healthy controls (HCs, n 21). Expression of CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RO, CCR 7, interleukin (IL) - 18 R alpha, ST 2 L, and FoxP 3 were determined by four-color flow cytometric analysis. CD 45 RO and CCR 7 were used for distinction between naive and memory T cells, IL- 18 R alpha, ST 2 L, and FoxP 3 for the assessment of Type 1, Type 2, and regulatory T-cells, respectively. In R-WG, the CD 4 (+) CD 45 RO(+) CCR 7 (-) effector memory T-cell subpopulation (T-EM) was relatively increased, whereas the CD 4 (+) CD 45 RO(-) CCR 7 (+) naive T-cell population (T-Naive) was decreased as compared to HC. The distribution of naive and memory CD 8 (+) T cells did not differ between R-WG, A-WG, and HC, nor did CD 4 (+) CD 45 RO(+) CCR 7 (+) central memory T cells (T-CM). In contrast to HC, the percentage of CD 4 (+) T(Naive) cells in R-WG correlated negatively with age, whereas CD 4 (+) <b>T(EM)</b> <b>cells</b> showed a positive correlation.

40|$|Through a {{combination}} of fluorescence microscopy and patch-clamp analysis we have identified a striking alteration in K+ channel expression in terminally differentiated human CCR 7 –CD 45 RA– effector memory T lymphocytes (TEM). Following activation, <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> expressed {{significantly higher levels of}} the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv 1. 3 and lower levels of the calcium-activated K+ channel IKCa 1 than naive and central memory T cells (TCM). Upon repeated in vitro antigenic stimulation, naive cells differentiated into Kv 1. 3 highIKCa 1 low <b>TEM</b> <b>cells,</b> and the potent Kv 1. 3 -blocking sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus peptide (ShK) suppressed proliferation of <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> without affecting naive or TCM lymphocytes. Thus, the Kv 1. 3 highIKCa 1 low phenotype is a functional marker of activated TEM lymphocytes. Activated myelin-reactive T cells from patients with MS exhibited the Kv 1. 3 highIKCa 1 low TEM phenotype, suggesting that they have undergone repeated stimulation during the course of disease; these cells may contribute to disease pathogenesis due to their ability to home to inflamed tissues and exhibit immediate effector function. The Kv 1. 3 highIKCa 1 low phenotype was not seen in glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulin-peptide or ovalbumin-specific and mitogen-activated T cells from MS patients, or in myelin-specific T cells from healthy controls. Selective targeting of Kv 1. 3 in <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> may therefore hold therapeutic promise for MS and other T cell–mediated autoimmune diseases...|$|R

The final outcome seems that the system can still be efficiently used to expose small animals in the Wi-Fi band, provided they are properly placed in correspondence to the maxima of the electric field along the guide. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) /HIV {{coinfection}} {{is associated}} with rapid progression of hepatic fibrosis and liver disease. T-cell response has been implicated in the pathophysiological outcome of the disease. DESIGN: This study sought to evaluate the role of memory T-cell exhaustion in enhancing immune dysfunction during coinfection. METHODS: Sixty-four patients {{were included in the}} study; HCV monoinfected (n = 21), HIV monoinfected (n = 23), HCV/HIV coinfected (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 20). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated; immunophenotyped and functional assays were performed. RESULTS: A significant increase in the naive T cells and central memory T cells and a marked reduction in effector memory T <b>cells</b> (<b>TEM)</b> were observed with coinfection as compared to monoinfection. Inhibitory markers programmed death 1 (PD- 1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing molecule 3 (TIM 3) were highly upregulated on TEM in coinfection and functionally, these <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> displayed lowered proliferation. Increased expression of PD- 1 and TIM 3 correlated with decreased levels of CD 8 +CD 107 a+ <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> in coinfection. Pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) secretion by <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> were also reduced during chronic viral infection. Secretion of IL- 10, a human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, was significantly upregulated in CD 4 TEM with HCV/HIV coinfection in comparison to HCV monoinfection. CONCLUSION: <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> play an important role during viral infection and enhanced expression of inhibitory markers {{is associated with}} decreased proliferation and cytotoxicity and increased IL- 10 production, which was pronounced in HCV/HIV coinfection. Thus, decreased TEM functionality contributes to diminished host immune responses during HCV/HIV coinfection as compared to HCV or HIV monoinfection...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells (DC) {{have been}} {{proposed}} to facilitate sexual transmission of HIV- 1 by capture of the virus in the mucosa and subsequent transmission to CD 4 + T cells. Several T cell subsets can be identified in humans: naïve T cells (TN) that initiate an immune response to new antigens, and memory T cells that respond to previously encountered pathogens. The memory T cell pool comprises central memory (TCM) and effector memory <b>cells</b> (<b>TEM),</b> which are characterized by distinct homing and effector functions. The <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> subset, which can be further divided into effector Th 1 and Th 2 cells, {{has been shown to}} be the prime target for viral replication after HIV- 1 infection, and is abundantly present in mucosal tissues. RESULTS: We determined the susceptibility of TN, TCM and <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> to DC-mediated HIV- 1 transmission and found that co-receptor expression on the respective T cell subsets is a decisive factor for transmission. Accordingly, CCR 5 -using (R 5) HIV- 1 was most efficiently transmitted to <b>TEM</b> <b>cells,</b> and CXCR 4 -using (X 4) HIV- 1 was preferentially transmitted to TN cells. CONCLUSION: The highly efficient R 5 transfer to <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> suggests that mucosal T cells are an important target for DC-mediated transmission. This may contribute to the initial burst of virus replication that is observed in these cells. TN cells, which are the prime target for DC-mediated X 4 virus transmission in our study, are considered to inefficiently support HIV- 1 replication. Our results thus indicate that DC may play a decisive role in the susceptibility of TN cells to X 4 tropic HIV-...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Transverse {{electromagnetic}} (<b>TEM)</b> <b>cells</b> can be {{used for}} exposing biological culture specimens to electromagnetic fields and observing possible anomalous effects. The uniformity of field exposure is critical to quantifying the biological response versus the electromagnetic dose. Standing waves and other electromag-netic field nonuniformities can cause nonuniform exposure. This paper reports the results of high-resolution three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of a complete <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> designed for operation at 837 MHz. Several different cases were studied in which the number of culture dishes, the depth of the culture liquid, and the orientation of the culture dishes were varied. Further, the effect of the culture-dish glass bottom thickness and the meniscus of the liquid medium were examined. The FDTD results show that there is a significant nonuniform field and specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution within the culture medium for each case examined. Hence, biolog-ical dose-response experiments using the <b>TEM</b> <b>cell</b> should account for the possibility of strong localized SAR peaking in the culture media to provide useful data in setting exposure standards for wireless communications.

40|$|Autoreactive memory T {{lymphocytes}} are {{implicated in}} the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Here we demonstrate that disease-associated autoreactive T cells from patients with type- 1 diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are mainly CD 4 +CCR 7 −CD 45 RA− effector memory T <b>cells</b> (<b>TEM</b> <b>cells)</b> with elevated Kv 1. 3 potassium channel expression. In contrast, T cells with other antigen specificities from these patients, or autoreactive T cells from healthy individuals and disease controls, express low levels of Kv 1. 3 and are predominantly naïve or central-memory (TCM) <b>cells.</b> In <b>TEM</b> <b>cells,</b> Kv 1. 3 traffics to the immunological synapse during antigen presentation where it colocalizes with Kvβ 2, SAP 97, ZIP, p 56 lck, and CD 4. Although Kv 1. 3 inhibitors [ShK(L 5) -amide (SL 5) and PAP 1] do not prevent immunological synapse formation, they suppress Ca 2 +-signaling, cytokine production, and proliferation of autoantigen-specific <b>TEM</b> <b>cells</b> at pharmacologically relevant concentrations while sparing other classes of T cells. Kv 1. 3 inhibitors ameliorate pristane-induced arthritis in rats and {{reduce the incidence of}} experimental autoimmune diabetes in diabetes-prone (DP-BB/W) rats. Repeated dosing with Kv 1. 3 inhibitors in rats has not revealed systemic toxicity. Further development of Kv 1. 3 blockers for autoimmune disease therapy is warranted...|$|R
