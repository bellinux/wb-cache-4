40|$|Protective relays {{are used}} to show {{the current status of}} a given power system. It is used to {{determine}} whether parameters like voltage or current violate any <b>trip</b> or <b>reset</b> specification or condition. In this project, overcurrent time invariant model of protective relay is implemented using CORDIC algorithm. Here we use CORDIC algorithm to implement the relay flowchart. All of the arithmetic calculations and relaying algorithms can be managed by a CORDIC processor. As CORDIC algorithm is simple to implement, it has a very low FPGA footprint and it negates any need of multipliers as well. In this project: 1) 	A basic implementation of sine/cosine calculation of CORDIC using VHDL in Xilinx ISE 10. 1 is implemented to check the accuracy 2) 	Various modules needed to calculate the protective relay status of <b>trip</b> or <b>reset</b> condition were developed 3) 	A final implementation of overcurrent relay was done and accuracy checked...|$|R
2500|$|Actuator lever - used to {{manually}} <b>trip</b> and <b>reset</b> {{the circuit}} breaker. Also indicates {{the status of}} the circuit breaker (On or Off/tripped). Most breakers are designed so they can still trip even if the lever is held or locked in the [...] "on" [...] position. This is sometimes referred to as [...] "free trip" [...] or [...] "positive trip" [...] operation.|$|R
50|$|The first fault {{indicators}} came {{onto the}} market from Horstmann (Germany) in 1946. The E.O. Schweitzer Manufacturing Company (now {{a division of}} Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc.) introduced a product to the U.S.A in 1948. The first fault indicators were manual reset devices. Later fault indicators automatically reset on system restoration or after a set period of time. More recent fault indicators communicate their status (<b>tripped</b> or <b>reset)</b> via cell signal or radio to a central station, handheld device, or pole-mounted receiver.|$|R
40|$|Developments in {{the area}} Ambarawa showed {{increased}} very rapidly, {{as shown by the}} many activities of the <b>trip</b> <b>reset</b> - shuttle from Semarang - Yogyakarta, passing Ambarawa. Barriers of time and is very important to know because it is the minimum travel time for a vehicle to the place of destination. As we know often times it happens that so long queue of vehicles caused by several factors during the journey, such as the existence of market centers along the road, not signalized intersections and also the driver 2 Ì† 7 s lack of discipline have contributed to the low road. Barriers of this trip will be a negative impact, such as in the form of lost time due to the long trip and the increase in vehicle operating costs (VOC) to the existing road. The purpose of this evaluation is to analyze the velocity space (space mean speed) and the Vehicle Operating Cost comparison Ambarawa ring road and the existing road. The calculation of Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) using the formula for the ring road Pacific Consultant International (PCI) and using the formula in the existing road curve Vehicle Speed. This is because the ring road are relatively few barriers while relatively many barriers existing road. So using a different method for determining vehicle operating costs. From the analysis of the average velocity (space mean speed) {{it can be seen that}} the travel time through the streets ring with a distance of 7. 3 miles faster than the road with a distance of 6. 5 km eksisiting this can be seen from the average velocity (space mean speed) vehicles both cars (58. 52 km / h), buses (52. 36 km / h) and a truck (47. 67 km / h) faster past the ring road ring road vehicles as cars, buses and trucks are not a lot of experience travel barriers. The results of the comparison vehicle operating cost (VOC), obtained past the ring road Ambarawa cost more frugal when dibandingankan the existing road. Where the economic value of automobiles Rp 415. 11 (3. 09...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the actual}} concert on live television, the second, {{third and fourth}} songs, [...] "The Thin Ice","Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)" [...] and [...] "The Happiest Days of Our Lives" [...] were {{disrupted}} when a circuit breaker <b>tripped.</b> It was <b>reset,</b> but immediately <b>tripped</b> again {{so they had to}} rewire some equipment. Those three songs had to be re-recorded for the issue of the videotape.|$|R
5000|$|During {{production}} at Canley, the seat trim was again revised, with a plaid cloth in navy blue or tan, with matching coloured leather effect edging, and matching door cards. A further trim change during {{production at}} Solihull saw {{the use of}} a ruched velour in blue or tan on the seats, with matching inserts on the doors. Also, the internal door lock buttons were changed from the earlier standard BL round ones, to rectangular buttons held on with small grub screws. There was also a change to the <b>trip</b> mile counter's <b>reset</b> button, which became a push type operated through the instrument [...] "glass", rather than a turn type under the dash.|$|R
50|$|Most modern cars {{include a}} trip meter (trip odometer). Unlike the odometer, a <b>trip</b> meter is <b>reset</b> {{at any point}} in a journey, making it {{possible}} to record the distance traveled in any particular journey or part of a journey. It was traditionally a purely mechanical device but, in most modern vehicles, it is now electronic. Luxury vehicles often have multiple trip meters. Most trip meters will show a maximum value of 999.9. The trip meter may be used to record the distance traveled on each tank of fuel, making it very easy to accurately track the energy efficiency of the vehicle; another common use is resetting it to zero at each instruction in a sequence of driving directions, to be sure when one has arrived at the next turn.|$|R
