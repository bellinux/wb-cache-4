40|$|Insurance {{sector in}} India was privatised to {{publicise}} insurance products. After privatisation of this industry in India {{in the year}} 2000, the next important step taken in the general insurance industry was the removal of tariffs on the non-life insurance products with effect from January 1, 2007. The introduction of the free price regime has provided an impetus to the non-life sector. Before the introduction of de-tariffication almost 70 % {{of the business of}} the non-life sector was driven by various tariffs prescribed by the <b>Tariff</b> Advisory <b>Committee</b> (TAC). The TAC was established under the Insurance Act, 1938, to control and regulate the rates, terms, conditions of general insurance business. TAC has been playing a significant role to specify the tariffs for the product offered by the various insurers in India. Withdrawal of the administered price mechanism from January 1, 2007 has led insurers to design new and innovative suitable products to sustain in the competitive market. The public sector insurance companies enjoyed the monopoly status as a result they lacked flexibility and were not much concerned with profitability. This resulted in erosion of underwriting skills and income of the public sector insurance companies So, the present study is an attempt to examine the growth and performance of the public sector insurance companies operating in India in the competitive scenari...|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} that Mr. Gladstone {{even in the}} thick of his <b>tariffs,</b> his <b>committees</b> and deputations, his cabinet duties, and all the other absorbing occupations of an important minister in strong harness, should let a publication, in his view so injurious, pass in silence.[191] With indignation he flew to his intrepid pen, and dealt as trenchantly with Ward as Ward himself had dealt trenchantly with the reformers and all others whom he found planted in his dialectic way. Mr. Gladstone held the book up to stringent reproof for its capricious injustice; for the triviality of its investigations of fact; for the savageness of its censures; for the wild and wanton opinions broached in its pages; for the infatuation of mind manifested in some of its arguments; and for the lamentable circumstance that it exhibited a far greater debt in mental culture to Mr. John Stuart Mill than to the whole range of Christian divines. In a sentence, Ward 'had launched on the great deep of human controversy as frail a bark as ever carried sail,' and his reviewer undoubtedly let loose upon it as shrewd a blast as ever blew from the Æolian wallet. The article was meant for the Quarterly Review, and it is easy to imagine the dire perplexities of Lockhart's editorial mind in times so fervid and so distracted. The practical issue after all was not the merits or the demerits of Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, nor the real meaning of Hooker, Jewel, Bull, but simply what was to be done to Ward. Lockhart wrote to Murray that he had very seriously studied the article and studied Ward's book, and not only these, but also the Articles and the canons of the church, and he could not approve of the Review committing itself to a judgment on the line proper to be taken by the authorities of church and university, and the expression of such a judgment he suspected to be Mr. Gladstone's main object in writing. Mr. Gladstone, describing himself most truly as 'one of those soldiers who do not know when they are beat,' saw his editor; declared that what he sought was three things, first, that the process of mobbing out by invective and private interpretations is bad and should be stopped; second, that the church of England does not make assent to the proceedings of the Reformation a term of communion; and third, that before even judicial proceedings in one direction, due consideration should be had of what judicial proceedings in another direction consistency might entail, if that game were once begun. As Ward himself had virtually put it, 'Show me how any of the recognised parties in the church can subscribe in a natural sense, before you condemn me for subscribing in a non-natural.'[192] The end was a concordat between editor and contributor, followed by an immense amount of irksome revision, mutilation, and re-revision, reducing the argument in some places 'almost to tatters'; but the writer was in the long run satisfied that things were left standing in it which it was well to plant in a periodical like the Quarterly Review.|$|R
