50|$|The 1830 bridge {{needed a}} replacement.With site {{investigations}} in 1841 by John Harris, Robert Stephenson designed a five span cast iron <b>trussed</b> <b>girder</b> bridge on piled masonry piers.This was {{built over the}} period 1841 - 1844 by contractor Grahamsley and Read and {{when it opened in}} May 1844 it replaced the suspension bridge.|$|E
50|$|Trestles in cast- or wrought-iron {{were used}} during the 19th Century on the {{developing}} railway network in the United Kingdom. These generally carried decking consisting of some form of <b>trussed</b> <b>girder,</b> as at Crumlin Viaduct, Belah and Meldon; though two rare examples, at Dowery Dell (demolished in 1962), and Bennerley had lattice girder decks.|$|E
50|$|Designing the bridge, Proskouriakov {{proposed}} a new constructive solution — an original <b>trussed</b> <b>girder.</b> By using featheredge design for its upper chord (similar to Schwedler truss), Proskouriakov extended {{the height of}} the main trusses up to 21.64 m. The engineer also utilized the theory of influence lines for truss analysis that enabled more accurate calculation of internal forces in every member in a truss due to moving loads. Since then, the theory of influence lines for truss analysis has been used in engineering both in Russia and around the world. Incidentally, the Yenisei bridge was the first in Russia, during the construction of which the incremental launching method was applied for the first time.|$|E

5000|$|The Short No.2 {{was ordered}} from Short Brothers in April 1909 with the {{intention}} of competing for the £1,000 prize announced by the Daily Mail for the first closed-circuit flight made by a British aircraft. [...] The layout of the aircraft was {{similar to that of the}} Wright Model A, which the Short Brothers were building under license. It was a biplane with a forward elevator and rear-mounted tailplane, driven by a pair of pusher propellers, chain-driven by the single centrally-mounted engine, but differed in a number of significant respects. It was designed to take off using a dolly and launching-rail, like the Wright aircraft, but the landing skids were incorporated into a considerably more substantial structure, each forming the lower member of a <b>trussed</b> <b>girder</b> structure resembling a sleigh, the upturned front end serving to support the biplane front elevators, behind which the rudder was mounted. A single fixed fin was mounted behind the wings on a pair of booms. Lateral control was not effected by wing-warping. Instead it used [...] "balancing planes", each consisting of a pair of low aspect ratio surfaces, mounted at either end of a strut which was pivoted from the midpoint of struts connecting the wingtips.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation into the behaviour of precast hybrid FRP-concrete, two-panel <b>truss</b> <b>girders</b> under static loading are presented. The investigation {{is part of a}} comprehensive research program on the development of a corrosion-free system for short and medium span bridges. The <b>truss</b> <b>girders</b> consist of pretensioned concrete chords connected by vertical and diagonal truss elements made of glass FRP tubes filled with concrete. The truss elements are reinforced and connected to the top and bottom chords by means of long double-headed steel or glass FRP bars. The top and bottom chords are also reinforced with glass FRP stirrups and double-headed longitudinal bars. This new system is expected to reduce the initial and maintenance costs and enhance the durability of bridges, and thus, extend their useful life. Moreover, by replacing the solid concrete web of traditional precast I-girders with the truss elements, the weight of the structure is significantly reduced, and thus, longer spans can be achieved and the number of supporting piers and size of the substructure can be reduced. The main objective of the research presented herein was to examine the efficiency of the FRP in comparison to steel reinforcement. The work included fabricating and testing three large-scale two-panel <b>truss</b> <b>girders</b> with an overall depth of 1. 32 m and length of 2. 83 m. The test parameters included the type and amount of reinforcement. The girders were tested under monotonic loading up to failure.
