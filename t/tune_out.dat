5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and <b>tune</b> <b>out</b> irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory, {{the ability to think}} about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action. Higher order {{executive function}}s, require multiple cognitive processes including planning, reasoning, and problem solving.|$|E

According to Doinel Tronaru, the book chapter on which the film was based was itself controversial, and {{seen by many as}} [...] "indigestible". Tronaru writes: [...] "the film was made during the bloody Yugoslav conflict, but Pintilie is telling us [...] not to <b>tune</b> <b>out</b> believing we are somehow better, that, if need be, we could be just as bloodthirsty as our shunned neighbors." ...|$|E

[...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the <b>tune</b> <b>out</b> of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time.

500|$|Hosseini {{disclosed}} {{that in some}} ways, A Thousand Splendid Suns was more difficult to write than his first novel, The Kite Runner. This is partly because when he penned The Kite Runner, [...] "no one was waiting for it." [...] He also found his second novel to be more [...] "ambitious" [...] than the first due to its larger number of characters, its dual focus on Mariam and Laila, and its covering of a multi-generational-period of nearly forty-five-years. However, he stated, [...] "As I began to write, as the story picked up pace and I found myself immersed {{in the world of}} Mariam and Laila, these apprehensions vanished on their own. The developing story captured me and enabled me to <b>tune</b> <b>out</b> the background noise and get on with the business of inhabiting the world I was creating."

He stated that although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first all worked together on all three scripts: [...] "I didn't assign each writer which film {{they were going to}} work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd <b>tune</b> <b>out</b> every time {{we were talking about the}} other movie." [...] "We... worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga." [...] Cameron also stated that Weaver would be featured in all three sequels and that her character Grace Augustine would be alive. In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.|$|E

Taibbi characterizes the phenomenon of the 2016 election campaign as, [...] "simultaneously the most thrilling and disgusting political event of our generation." [...] In the work's introduction, Taibbi quotes from his 2008 book The Great Derangement, and documents how he foresaw the increasing influence of disruptive societal factors such as the alt-right and fake news ten years before the book's publication. He asserts such factors led to a political climate where Trump could flourish. Taibbi observes, [...] "The country’s leaders are corrupt and have become unresponsive {{to the needs of the}} population. People all over are beginning to notice. This being America, as ordinary people <b>tune</b> <b>out</b> their corrupt leaders, they will replace official propaganda with conspiratorial explanations even more ridiculous than the original lies." [...] Taibbi warns, Donald Trump's [...] "vulgarity and defiant lack of self-awareness make him, unfortunately, the perfect foil for reflecting the rot and neglect of the corrupted political system". He laments, [...] "A system unable to stop this must be very sick indeed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Retrospectively, Pop {{is viewed}} in the music press and public as a disappointment.

When the system being investigated has one group symmetry or another, solution of the problem mentioned above is facilitated, as a consequence of breaking down the frequency equations into several, which are smaller in size.
