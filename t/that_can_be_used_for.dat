5|$|Wind shear {{can also}} create wave. This occurs when an {{atmospheric}} inversion separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction. If the wind encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by thermals {{coming up from}} below, it will create significant shear waves <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> soaring.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, the perxenate {{compounds}} {{are used}} as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry. Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly {{in the production of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used in protein crystallography. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> solving the phase problem.|$|E

5|$|Today, vector {{spaces are}} applied {{throughout}} mathematics, science and engineering. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion {{to deal with}} systems of linear equations; offer a framework for Fourier expansion, which is employed in image compression routines; or provide an environment <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> solution techniques for partial differential equations. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free {{way of dealing with}} geometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.|$|E
