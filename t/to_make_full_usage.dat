5|$|Concepts {{for a third}} {{installment}} in the Parasite Eve {{video game}} series had been around for some time. As work was being finished on , Nomura voiced his wish {{to create a new}} game for the character Aya Brea, and this time it was taken up. Despite the story of Parasite Eve II not leaving many avenues for a sequel, the development team wanted to take advantage of advancing gaming technology and popularity by creating a mature gaming experience that would re-introduce Aya to players around the world. The main staff consisted of director Hajime Tabata, producer Yoshinori Kitase, creative producer and character designer Tetsuya Nomura, art director Isamu Kamikokuryo, scenario director Motomu Toriyama, and main writer Toshimitsu Takeuchi. Nomura requested Tabata as the two had worked well together on previous projects, and Nomura was busy with other projects despite his strong interest. The 3rd Birthday was originally announced in May 2007 as an episodic mobile game developed by Square Enix for Japan's FOMA mobile service. In 2008, during a special Square Enix event, the game was announced to have changed to a game for the PlayStation Portable. Part of the reason, as stated by Nomura, was that the desired level of realism was not possible on mobile phones. The game became exclusive to PSP as Tabata wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>full</b> <b>usage</b> of the platform's hardware capabilities, along with it being a gaming platform available worldwide. Tabata and his team worked on The 3rd Birthday {{at the same time as}} fellow mobile-turned-PSP title Final Fantasy Type-0. Square Enix requested Tabata to concentrate on finishing The 3rd Birthday, leading to Type-0 almost being cancelled.|$|E
40|$|A {{family of}} curves based fiber path {{optimization}} approach is developed to optimize the fiber paths in composite laminate with a centered hole, {{in an attempt to}} improve the uniaxial tensile load carrying capabilities. In the proposed optimization method, a novel {{family of curves}} with two design variables is assumed to approximate the fiber paths in composite laminate. The principal stress trajectories are chosen as the desired fiber paths in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>full</b> <b>usage</b> of the mechanical properties of continuous fibers. The objective function is constructed by the nonlinear weighted least squares method, taking the first principal stress components as the weights. Using the Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm, the design variables appeared in the family of curves can be optimized. Once the optimal design variables are obtained, consequently, the fiber paths are optimized. With the obtained optimal path results, a comparative study will be given by means of two laminates, the path optimized laminate and the unidirectional laminate. Four failure criteria will be used to evaluate the maximum strength indexes of the laminates under a uniaxial tensile load. From the finite element results, it is shown that the maximum strength indexes can be reduced by 19 %- 39 % when using the fiber path optimized laminate. Meanwhile, the tensile testing results of these two laminates also agree well with the predicted maximum strength indexes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Recent linkage {{studies of}} {{genome-wide}} scan for genes affecting {{the risk for}} alcoholism provided evidence for linkage between susceptibility loci for alcohol dependence (AD) and regions on chromosomes 1, 2 and 7 [Reich et al., 1998]. These results were obtained based on nonparametric sib-pair methods, and the affected status phenotypes used were derived according to the COGA diagnostic criterion. Since breaking families into sib-pair data may lose information for linkage, we explored alternative approaches of linkage methods that <b>make</b> <b>fuller</b> <b>usage</b> of information provided by families as a whole. In addition to using phenotypes under the COGA criterion, we also use affected status data under the World Health Organization diagnosis (ICD 10).
