50|$|The slats {{that were}} set shallowly {{into the side}} element {{were not able to}} {{withstand}} abrupt burdens and so are replaced by perforated three-dimensionally bent plywood, shaped to the contours of the body. The panels are inserted between two sidepieces. The edge pieces on the front of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>panel</b> and the top of the back panel are replaces by glued strips.In 1954, Model No. 56 was accepted for mass production under the name Rex 120.|$|E
50|$|Essentially the {{new model}} was a revised and updated version of the 308 GTS, which had survived for eight years without any radical change to the overall shape, albeit with various changes to the 3-litre engine. The 328 model {{presented}} a softening of the wedge profile of its predecessor, with a redesigned nose that had a more rounded shape, which was complemented by similar treatment to the tail valance panel. The revised nose and tail sections featured body colour bumpers integral with the valance panels, which reflected the work done concurrently to present the Mondial 3.2 models, with which they also shared a similar radiator grille and front light assembly layout. Thus all the eight-cylinder cars in the range shared fairly unified front and rear aspects, providing a homogeneous family image. The exhaust air louvres behind the retractable headlight pods on the 308 series disappeared, coupled {{with an increase in}} the size of the front lid radiator exhaust air louvre, which had been introduced on the 308 Quattrovalvole models, whilst a new style and position of exterior door catch was also provided. The interior trim also had a thorough overhaul, with new designs for <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>panel</b> upholstery and stitching, revised door panels and pulls, together with more modern switchgear, which complemented the external updating details. Optional equipment available was air conditioning, metallic paint, Pirelli P7 tyres, a leather dashboard, leather headlining to the removable roof panel plus rear window surround, and a rear aerofoil (standard on Japanese market models).|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} Australian stock saddle {{was designed}} for security and comfort in the saddle no matter how harsh the conditions. While having stylistic roots from the English saddle {{in the design of}} <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>panels,</b> fenders, and stirrups, it has a much deeper seat, higher cantle, and knee pads in the front to create a very secure saddle for riders who ride in rough conditions or spend long hours on a horse.|$|R
50|$|Engineers {{spent the}} next five years {{developing}} the Dauphine. Within the first year, designers had created a ⅛th-scale clay model, studied the model's aerodynamics, built a full-scale clay model, studied wood interior mockups of <b>the</b> <b>seating,</b> instrument <b>panel,</b> and steering column - and built the first prototype in metal.|$|R

Power was transmitted through a three-speed transmission operated by a twist grip.|$|R
50|$|In Europe {{the brand}} has been {{launched}} in almost 40 countries across Northern, Western, Southern, Eastern Europe and Russia. SEAT today also sells its cars in 11 countries in Asia, {{mostly in the}} Middle East and the Arabian peninsula, in 16 countries in Americas including North America, the Caribbean Sea, Central America and South America, and finally Africa, mainly in North Africa. Some of its cars have been sold outside Europe, branded as Volkswagens, such as <b>the</b> <b>SEAT</b> Ibiza hatchback, known in South Africa as the Volkswagen Polo Playa, <b>the</b> <b>SEAT</b> Inca <b>panel</b> van as the Volkswagen Caddy, or <b>the</b> <b>SEAT</b> Córdoba, {{also known as the}} Volkswagen Polo Classic.|$|R

50|$|However, the {{modernisation}} programme {{has been}} met with severe {{criticism from the}} passengers due to lowered comfort and colder ambience. The redesigned cabin appears to be sterile and uninviting. The cabin illumination is toward bluish white rather than warmer white and cannot be dimmed during the night journeys. <b>The</b> new <b>seats</b> are uncomfortable for the journeys longer than two hours, especially for the tall passengers. <b>The</b> first class <b>seats</b> have thinner cushion and less luxurious leather upholstery. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> reservation <b>panels</b> are oriented {{in a way that}} the passengers must lower their heads to read the LED display.|$|R
50|$|The stylist {{responsible}} {{for the design of}} the vehicle interior develops the proportions, shape, placement, and surfaces for <b>the</b> instrument <b>panel,</b> <b>seats,</b> door trim <b>panels,</b> headliner, pillar trims, etc. Here the emphasis is on ergonomics and the comfort of the passengers. The procedure here is the same as with exterior design (sketch, digital model and clay model).|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and <b>panels,</b> English saddles feature leather flaps on either side; the underside flap {{is called the}} sweat flap, and the upper flap is called the saddle flap (or, simply and appropriately, the [...] "flap"). The flaps sit between the rider's leg and the horse's side and protects the horse from being pinched by the stirrup leather or girth, and the rider's leg from being chafed by the girth buckles. On some saddles it is also specially padded to protect or support the rider's knee.|$|R

5000|$|The show car for 1955 was {{an ivory}} white fixed-head coupé {{based on a}} DK400 chassis. The car was called [...] "Golden Zebra"; all {{brightwork}} inside and out was in gold plate and <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> and door <b>panels</b> were upholstered in zebra skin. The mascot on the radiator grille was a gold-plated miniature zebra sculpture. Lady Docker's initials were inscribed on the door.|$|R
50|$|In {{summer of}} 1981, the Giulietta {{received}} a minor facelift, externally and internally, while the engines remained the same. The car got plastic protection around the lower body, while interior modifications included a new {{steering wheel and}} new <b>seats.</b> <b>The</b> instrument <b>panel</b> and the centre armrest were also modified.|$|R

50|$|Standard {{equipment}} included power steering, brakes, windows, vacuum activated concealed headlamps, {{and split}} bench electrically adjustable front <b>seats.</b> <b>The</b> instrument <b>panel</b> and trim panels {{on the doors}} featured simulated wood appliques in either English Oak or East-Indian Rosewood. After a few months, a Cartier-branded clock became standard equipment. The upholstery was either the standard vinyl with cloth inserts, or the optional leather.|$|R
5000|$|Working {{with four}} others, Marrot {{proposed}} new body and interior colors after {{setting up a}} new test laboratory to measure fabric wear as well as paint wear and uniformity. The new colors contrasted with the colors from the competition, the Peugeot 203 and Simca Aronde, including bright colors with evocative names including Rouge Montijo, Jaune Bahamas, Bleu Hoggar and Blanc Réja.

50|$|Side-impact airbags or side torso airbags (side thorax/abdomen airbags) are a {{category}} of airbag usually located in <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> or door <b>panel,</b> and inflate between <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> occupant and <b>the</b> door. These airbags are designed {{to reduce the risk}} of injury to the pelvic and lower abdomen regions. Most vehicles are now being equipped with different types of designs, to help reduce injury and ejection from the vehicle in rollover crashes. More recent side airbag designs include a two chamber system; a firmer lower chamber for the pelvic region and softer upper chamber for the ribcage.|$|R
5000|$|Leather {{is added}} {{on all sides}} of the tree to create <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> flaps and <b>panels.</b> Cowhide is usually used, though pigskin and other leathers are also seen. The panels on the {{underside}} of the saddle traditionally are stuffed with wool flock, which is still preferred and used on the highest quality saddles. Synthetic materials, including foam and fiberfill materials, are used on more moderately priced saddles, and one company currently sells a design that uses airtight sealed panels that are inflated with air.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{a special}} yellow SC2 coupé model was also built. The model was officially named [...] "Limited Edition", but soon {{became known as}} the [...] "Bumblebee Edition". 99 were produced, each with a {{certificate}} of authenticity.

Two bottles are located behind <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> - one for drinking has a tube attached, {{and the other}} is for squirting and cooling purposes. Also behind <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> are two 12-volt Pulsar batteries. In front of <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>the</b> control <b>panel</b> contains digital readout instruments for the voltage and amp readings of both, the battery and the solar cells. Because of its racing context, a clock and stop watch are also part of the control panel. There is also a twenty-channel CB radio beneath the control panel. The steering wheel, shaped like a boomerang, is set in the centre.|$|R
50|$|As {{with its}} predecessors, the 1998 Lincoln Town Car visibly shares few common {{interior}} parts with its Ford and Mercury counterparts (aside from its steering column, radio, and climate controls). To improve ergonomics, power seat controls on Signature and Cartier models are relocated from <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> to door <b>panel</b> (Executive Series, in 1999). In {{a move to}} improve safety, seat-mounted side airbags become standard on all Town Cars for 1999. In the same year, the Executive Series regains its rear-seat center armrest (initially deleted in a cost-cutting move).|$|R
5000|$|The {{redesign}} in 1992 for 1993 featured mild restyling, flush-mounted door glass, wider doors, and slight fender flares. The 1989-style dashboard remained, but <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> {{and door}} <b>panels</b> were new. The 2.9-liter engine was discontinued. The engines offered were offered in displacements of 2.3, 3.0 and 4.0 liters. A new [...] "Splash" [...] model was introduced, {{which had a}} flare side bed, unique chrome wheels, 1 in lowered rear suspension and a 2 in lowered front suspension (on 4x2 models), and special vinyl [...] "Splash" [...] decals on the sides and the tailgate.|$|R
50|$|On 11 April 2017, Deutsche Bahn {{announced}} the modernisation programme called ICE 3 Redesign for its 66-unit ICE 3 fleet {{to be completed}} by the end of 2020. The renovation involves replacing <b>the</b> <b>seats,</b> tables, and floor coverings. The six-seat compartment rooms are eliminated from the second class section as to increase <b>the</b> number of <b>seats</b> and to add more luggage compartments. In addition, the number of disability seating has been increased to two; however, no integrated wheelchair lift has been installed, and still no disability seating is offered in the first class section. <b>The</b> <b>seats</b> in some Bordrestaurant have been converted to <b>the</b> red bench <b>seating</b> while Bordbistro receives the new stand tables. The cabin illumination is provided by LED lamps, providing more illumination, while the reading lamps are eliminated. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> reservation <b>panels</b> are moved from the walls above the windows to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> headrests per EU directive on accessibilities: the new panel has bigger and more visible white lettering and Braille. The yellow LCD information monitors in the antechambers are replaced with larger full-colour LED monitors, showing the map, train number, speed, and other pertaining information. The new smaller monitors are attached to the ceiling above the aisle throughout the cabins.|$|R
50|$|Inside the Series III {{the changes}} were more evident. Rootes stylists {{completely}} redesigned <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> and interior <b>panels</b> and specified that they be trimmed in single colour vinyl with contrasting piping. For the first time, deep pile carpets were fitted as standard in the foot-wells (previous versions had rubber mats). The steering wheel, control knobs and switches were in black plastic instead of beige. The dashboard, instead of being, as in the earlier cars, padded metal and plastic, was covered in burr walnut veneer surmounted by a padded crash roll fitted with black-faced British Jaeger instruments.|$|R
