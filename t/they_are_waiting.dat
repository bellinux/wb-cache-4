5|$|Peter {{realizes that}} September's message was literal, {{and returns to}} his home, where he is knocked out by Jones' men. He is brought to the same {{facility}} as Olivia and tied up. As they prepare to torture him, Olivia begins to use her powers to activate the lights, {{not only on the}} box but within the facility, creating electrical sparks that kill one of Jones' men. As Jones and Nina retreat, Olivia frees Peter and they give chase, though Olivia suffers from a seizure, following excessive use of her powers. They catch up to Jones and Nina as they are crossing back to the parallel universe, but the two are able to escape. Peter contacts the authorities to bring medical help for Olivia. As <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting,</b> Peter admits to Olivia that he fears what he has done to her memories, and has seen his original Olivia through the Observer's mind.

25|$|On day 290, {{they are}} {{hanging out in}} a cafe. Tom {{wants to go back}} to Summer's place but she insists on seeing The Graduate and weeps at the ending, which surprises Tom as he'd always thought it was a romantic fairy tale. They visit the record store, but Summer is distracted, appears to have lost {{interest}} in Tom, and kisses him good night. Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn't been working and breaks up with Tom while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for the food to arrive.

Muniz also has a portrait of himself, running after a wayward suitcase while papers fly away behind him. A married same-sex couple is also depicted, marking the first permanent, non-political LGBT art in New York City.

500|$|Symbols {{of death}} proliferate {{throughout}} The Wind Will Carry Us with scenes {{set in a}} graveyard, the imminence of the old woman’s passing, and the ancestors that the character of Farzad mentions in an early scene. Such devices ask the viewer to consider {{the parameters of the}} afterlife and the concept of immaterial existence. [...] In the film’s opening sequence, Behzad tells Farzad that like people, cars have ghosts. This becomes the theme of the work and the subject of the film — <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for the old woman to give up the ghost. The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to the soul after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami stated that his function is that of one who raises questions, rather than answers them. Kiarostami affirms that [...] the audience must decide for themselves.|$|E
500|$|The {{way that}} a person frames a {{situation}} heavily influences a decision's outcome. Research on [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for as a real reward {{by focusing on the}} reward's arousing, [...] "hot" [...] qualities (taste, smell, sound, feel, etc.) their self-control and delay of gratification decreases, while directing attention to a symbol of the reward by focusing on its abstract, [...] "cool" [...] qualities (shape, color, number, etc.), can enhance self-control and increase the delay. Optimal self-control and the longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item, especially the arousing, [...] "hot" [...] qualities of a competing item. For example, delays are increased when thinking about the taste and smell of popcorn while waiting to eat candy. This illustrates an individual's ability to manipulate his/her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal-directed purposes.|$|E

500|$|Dougan {{dropped down}} to the Third Division to join Peterborough United for a £21,000 fee {{in the summer of}} 1963. He later {{admitted}} that [...] "I had made a mistake in going to the Third Division when I was a First Division player". The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years. He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the 1963–64 season, {{and at the end of}} the campaign manager Jack Fairbrother was replaced by Gordon Clark, who Dougan said [...] "renewed my sense of vocation". He then scored seven goals in the club's 1964–65 run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2–1 win over top-flight Arsenal at London Road. Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that [...] "after playing at Stamford Bridge it was not easy to go to places like Gillingham on a cold Tuesday evening, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for you with their sleeves rolled up".|$|E
500|$|Shawn Spencer (James Roday) buys a {{newspaper}} and walks {{back into a}} restaurant to find his seat taken. The girl in his seat introduces herself as Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson). Shawn realizes she's a cop, and immediately after he does, she and several officers arrest {{a man at the}} bar. Later, Burton [...] "Gus" [...] Guster (Dulé Hill) is in the Psych office, watching the local spelling bee on TV. Shortly after Shawn enters the office, expected spelling bee champion Brandon Vu (Issey Lamb) collapses, to the shock of the audience. Shawn notices something wrong with Vu's inhaler, and realizes that Vu was intentionally harmed. They receive a phone call from interim police chief Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson) asking them to investigate the bee. They interview Vu at the hospital, who tells them that his inhaler was not working during the competition. They begin individual interviews with the competitors, but discover no leads. While <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> between interviews, spellmaster Cavanaugh (Alex Bruhanski) experiences chest pain and falls over a railing to his death, in front of Shawn and Gus. The police write off his death as a heart attack; Shawn and Gus are skeptical, and break into Cavanaugh's booth to investigate.|$|E
500|$|The game {{starts with}} the protagonist, along with schoolmates Hidehiko, Yuka and Masao, playing a fortune-telling parlor game called [...] "Persona" [...] while Kei and Yukino watch. After playing the game, the group see a ghostly figure, and the protagonist, Masao, Nanjō, and Yukino are {{rendered}} unconscious. The protagonist is then drawn {{into the realm of}} Philemon, who grants him the power of Persona and warns him that his new power will soon be needed. After the four recover and at the suggestion of their teacher Saeko, they go to have a check-up and visit classmate Maki at the hospital. While visiting, Maki is taken ill, and while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for news, the ICU where Maki is being treated vanishes and the town is attacked by demons, the summoned manifestations of people's inner darkness. Using their Personas, the four defend themselves, and after meeting up with Eriko, they head to the town's Ayama Shrine to find Maki's mother Setsuko. Upon arrival, they find Setsuko wounded after an attack by Kandori. Setsuko reveals him to be the culprit behind the changes to the town, caused by a reality-altering machine called the Deva System. Nanjō and Masao head out to confront SEBEC, while the protagonist, Eriko and Yukino bring Setsuko back to the school. After this point, the game splits into two story routes: the main SEBEC route, and the alternate Snow Queen route.|$|E

[...] The Illusionist says he will arrange a little private entertainment while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting.</b> [...] As to what they would like to see, everyone is curious to see what will happen when Hans and the embittered Bertha finally meet after avoiding each other for three months. [...] The Illusionist says he can arrange for this event to take place at once. [...] Bertram objects asking, “Why are we doing this evil thing?” [...] The Chamberlain cynically replies, “Sooner or later it would have to happen. [...] That's life.” [...] They all conceal themselves behind a pillar and watch as the inevitable events unfold. [...] Hans and Bertha meet. [...] Bertha manipulates Hans with guilt. [...] The Illusionist gives the spectators a further glimpse into the future showing them the scene when Hans realizes that he married the wrong woman. [...] Bertha intimately knows the Wittenstein family history, she plays the lute, she recites, she illuminates manuscripts—she is the perfect woman. [...] When Bertha asks Hans what Ondine does that might advance her husband's interests at court, he replies, “Oh, she swims. [...] Occasionally.” ...|$|E
