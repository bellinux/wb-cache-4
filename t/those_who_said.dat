5|$|Stone {{found the}} short skirt {{convenient}} during her travels and defended it against <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> {{it was a}} distraction that hurt the women’s rights cause. Nevertheless, she disliked the instant attention it drew whenever she arrived in a new place. In the fall of 1854, she added a dress a few inches longer, for occasional use. In 1855, she abandoned the dress altogether and {{was not involved in}} the formation of a National Dress Reform Association in February, 1856. Her resumption of long skirts drew the condemnation of such dress-reform leaders as Gerrit Smith and Lydia Sayer Hasbrouk, who accused her of sacrificing principle for the sake of pleasing a husband.|$|E
25|$|<b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> {{they were}} {{following}} the situation not too closely {{or not at}} all supported the unions over governors, with a 14–point (45% to 31%) margin. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> they were following the situation somewhat closely supported the unions over governors by a 52–41 margin. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that they were following the situation very closely were only slightly more likely to support the unions over the governors, with a 49-48 margin.|$|E
25|$|An {{instance}} of a Japanese atrocity was {{committed in the}} area of the rubber trees around Trolak. In this area were a number of Argyll and Hyderabad wounded. 2nd Lieutenant Ian Primrose reports that after he regained consciousness from an injury during the fighting he discovered that the Japanese were dividing the wounded into <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> they could walk and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> they could not. Primrose decided he could walk, which was fortunate as the Japanese soldiers proceeded to shoot and bayonet the wounded who could not. Afterward the survivors were forced to dig graves for the dead and then told to carry the Japanese wounded.|$|E

25|$|When the Germany reoccupied the Rhineland in February 1936, Churchill was holidaying in Spain, and {{returned}} to a divided Britain. Labour opposition was adamant in opposing sanctions and the National Government was divided between advocates of economic sanctions and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that even these {{would lead to a}} humiliating backdown by Britain, as France would not support any intervention. Churchill's speech on 9 March was measured and praised by Neville Chamberlain as constructive. But within weeks Churchill was passed over for the post of Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in favour of the Attorney General, Sir Thomas Inskip.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs {{went on to}} win 4–2 in the {{contentious}} and controversial series versus the Suns. The series featured a Robert Horry foul on Steve Nash toward the end of Game 4 which resulted in Horry being suspended for two games. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> the second-round series against the Suns was the true NBA Finals would be proven right, as the Spurs easily dispatched the Utah Jazz in five games to reach the NBA Finals. In the Finals, the Spurs swept the Cleveland Cavaliers and captured their fourth title in nine years. Tony Parker, who dominated in the Finals averaging 24.5 ppg on 57% shooting, was named Finals MVP and became the first European-born player to win the award.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} an Ipsos MORI survey, polling the British public as a whole, {{released}} on 14 July indicated that 66% of those surveyed believed that the Labour party needed a new leader before the 2020 elections. As well, only 23 percent believed that Corbyn {{would make a good}} Prime Minister while Theresa May had an approval rating of 55 percent. A Opinium/Observer poll on 23 July found that among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> they backed Labour, 54% supported Corbyn against just 22% who would prefer Smith. Some 20% said they are undecided and 4% said they do not intend to vote. When voters were asked who they thought would be the best prime minister – Corbyn or Theresa May – among Labour supporters 48% said Corbyn and 22% May, among all UK voters 52% chose May and just 16% were for Corbyn.|$|E

500|$|Once warmly social with her, in the 1880s Ambrose Bierce {{turned his}} caustic pen to {{criticism}} of Coolbrith's work, and thus lost {{her as a}} friend. In 1883, he wrote that her finely-wrought poem [...] "Our Poets" [...] should have been made a dirge, as the great poets of California were dead. He wrote that the periodical she worked for should be named the Warmed-Overland Monthly because it delivered nothing new. Regarding her poem [...] "Unattained", Bierce complained of [...] "this dainty writer's tiresome [...]" [...] In response, Coolbrith sided with <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> his incessant needling led local writer David Lesser Lezinsky to suicide.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Sotomayor's unjoined {{concurrence}} in {{the prior}} year's United States v. Jones decision, {{in which she}} {{said that in the}} digital age, [...] "It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties," [...] was cited by federal judge Richard Leon in his ruling that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment. [...] Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that Sotomayor's Jones concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, [...] "in which people reveal {{a great deal of information}} about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks." ...|$|E
500|$|Taft {{began the}} {{campaign}} on the wrong foot, fueling the arguments of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> he was not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill for advice on his acceptance speech, saying that he needed [...] "the President's judgment and criticism". Taft supported most of Roosevelt's policies. He argued that labor {{had a right to}} organize, but not boycott, and that corporations and the wealthy must also obey the law. Bryan wanted the railroads to be owned by the government, but Taft preferred that they remain in the private sector, with their maximum rates set by the Interstate Commerce Commission, subject to judicial review. Taft attributed blame for the recent recession, the Panic of 1907, to stock speculation and other abuses, and felt some reform of the currency (the U.S. was on the gold standard) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times, that specific legislation on trusts was needed to supplement the Sherman Antitrust Act, and that the constitution should be amended to allow for an income tax, thus overruling decisions of the Supreme Court striking such a tax down. Roosevelt's expansive use of executive power had been controversial; Taft proposed to continue his policies, but place them on more solid legal underpinnings through the passage of legislation.|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} [...] “Aaron {{and his sons}} shall set it in order, to burn from evening to morning,” means that God {{instructed}} them to provide the Menorah with the requisite amount of oil {{so that it could}} burn from evening to morning.. And the Sages calculated that a half-log of oil (roughly 5 ounces) would burn from evening to morning. The Gemara reported that some said that they calculated this by reducing the original quantity of oil, first filling each lamp with a large quantity of oil and on finding in the morning that there was still oil in the lamp, gradually reducing the quantity until they arrived at a half-log. [...] Others said that they calculated it by increasing it, first filling the lamp with a small quantity of oil and the next evening increasing the quantity of oil until they arrived at the standard of the half-log. [...] <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that they calculated it by increasing the quantity of oil said that the Torah has consideration for the Israelites' resources and to calculate by using the larger quantity of oil in the first instance wasted the oil that was still in the lamp in the morning. [...] And <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that they calculated it by reducing it said that there was no stinting in the place of wealth, the Sanctuary..|$|E

And {{it shall be}} upon Aaron to minister, and the sound thereof shall be heard." [...] thus implies that this sound made atonement {{for the sound of}} evil speech.

[...] Some said that the forehead-plate atoned for the shameless, while others said for blasphemers. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that it atoned for the shameless deduced it from the similar use of the word [...] "forehead" [...] in [...] which says of the forehead-plate, [...] "And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead," [...] and [...] which says, [...] "You had a harlot's forehead, you refused to be ashamed."

In an article in Aftonbladet, Guillou argued that the event was an act of hypocrisy, stating that [...] "the U.S. is the great mass murderer of our time. The wars against Vietnam and its nearby countries alone claimed four million lives. Without a minute of silence in Sweden".
