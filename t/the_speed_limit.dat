5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 {{miles an hour and}} there were {{concerns}} that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> was reduced to 20 miles an hour in the summer of 2004.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is , due to curves, {{wildlife}} and tourists. Bicycles, motor vehicles, and pedestrians share the road. There are also deer, black bears, turkey, and other wildlife, which may appear and cross the road without warning. These all require extra precautions. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> {{within the park}} is strictly enforced by park rangers. Numerous trails can be accessed along the drive, including {{a portion of the}} Appalachian Trail, which follows the road's path.|$|E

The first two criteria take into account safety whereas the third criterion takes into account the mobility needs. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> selected with these criteria were then refined basing on: maximum difference between <b>the</b> section <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> and <b>the</b> minimum <b>speed</b> evaluated with criteria 1 and 2, evaluation of critical conditions, and consistency between <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> and <b>the</b> highway function. 	Overall, non compliance to <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> was equal to 50 %. Non compliance was higher for heavy vehicles (60 - 70 %) than for light vehicles (32 - 65 %). Non compliance of light vehicles was much higher in the sections with the most constrained alignments (64 % in sections with <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> equal to 80 kph vs. 34 % in sections with <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> equal to 100 kph).

5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a direct connection, {{arguing that it}} would be no different from a typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely to}} exceed <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E

40|$|Average speed {{enforcement}} {{is a new}} traffic safety measure that is used increasingly in recent years. The advantage of this enforcement system is that <b>the</b> average <b>speed</b> of drivers can be recorded along a whole section {{in order to determine}} whether they obey <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> or not. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>speeding</b> behavior and violation behaviors of drivers were quantified in accordance with only the traffic signs and <b>the</b> provided <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> with no penal sanctions on 11 sections at the Akdeniz University with <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> of 20, 30 and 50 km/h. Two month average travel speeds of each vehicle that passes from the application sections were measured via mobile average speed enforcement system without announcing to the drivers which were then analyzed via Independent Sample t test. The results of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> study indicate that they differ on sections with different physical properties according to the preferences of drivers. Low compliance in general to <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> indicate non-optimal <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> A higher compliance to <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> may be ensured by an enforcement measure in the follow-up of the violations. ...|$|R

5|$|The two daily round-trips were branded Turboliner, {{replacing}} the individual names Abraham Lincoln and Prairie State. Amtrak repeated this {{experiment with the}} Detroit and Milwaukee corridors. Track conditions limited the new trainsets to , but they were clean, comfortable, quiet and reliable. In the first year, the Chicago–St. Louis running time dropped from 5.5 to 5 hours. The Federal Railroad Administration refused a request from Amtrak to raise <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> to , citing inadequate signalling along the route. The new trains {{had fallen out of}} favor by the end of 1974: food service was inadequate, and the five-car fixed consist could not handle demand. Amfleet coaches and new conventional diesels replaced both of the Turboliner trainsets in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

5|$|At the Delaware Breakwater East End Lighthouse in Lewes, strong waves {{destroyed}} the lower {{deck of the}} lighthouse, while powerful winds blew out the watchroom window. A group of eight volunteers quickly repaired the damage. Moderate wind gusts knocked down numerous trees, tree limbs, and power lines, causing widespread power outages in the state. Conectiv Energy reported the power outage associated with the hurricane {{as one of the}} worst in its history. At least 15,300 were left without power during the worst of the hurricane, including 2,500 in the capital city of Dover. Due to the power outages, only one traffic light north of the city of Wilmington was operational. The strong winds also resulted in the Delaware River and Bay Authority to reduce <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on the Delaware Memorial Bridge to 40mph (65km/h). 62roads throughout the state were initially closed due to flooding, downed trees, or downed power lines. Eight roads, including U.S. Route 13A remained closed for several days, primarily due to flooding. Flooding affected the cities of Seaford, Blades, Bayview, and Augustine Beach, with residents in the latter two being forced to evacuate due to severe flooding conditions. Several state parks reported downed trees and damage. Damage in the state totaled $40million (2003USD, $44million 2006USD), and there were no deaths in the state {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E

5|$|The suit {{alleged that}} the EIS focused almost {{exclusively}} on the Pleasant Avenue alignment, and {{that it did not}} consider the effect of a direct connection on speed limit compliance; faster traffic would mean more noise. Judge Paul Magnuson ruled in February 1984 that the EIS was valid, stating that the Pleasant Avenue alternative was the only reasonable one that would meet goals. This court order has been interpreted as a legal contract, prohibiting the state from raising <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> or allowing trucks. Construction went forward, and I-35E was opened from MN5 north to Saint Clair Avenue in 1984, using original bridges that had been built for three lanes in each direction. Further extensions, including all new bridges, were opened to Grand Avenue in 1986, to Kellogg Boulevard in November 1988, and to I-94 on October 15, 1990, 26years after construction began. The 1990 opening ceremony of I-35E in downtown Saint Paul was attended by a group of highway experts from the Soviet Union, and both the US and Soviet national anthems were played.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Hamilton lost time due to struggling {{to pass the}} lapped cars of Senna and Glock. Glock attempted to pass Senna around the outside heading into the first corner {{but was unable to}} move ahead. On lap 37, Glock again attempted to overtake Senna but the two cars collided. The incident caused a puncture on Glock's car that very nearly threw him into the wall and forced him to make a pit stop, though his crew were not ready for him and he lost several seconds as the tyres were brought out. Senna remained on the circuit with a damaged front wing, and made a pit stop on the next lap. Sutil overtook Buemi for seventh place on lap 40. Hamilton was eight tenths of a second quicker than race leader Vettel on the same lap and reduced the gap to 11.9 seconds. Hülkenberg's car emitted blue smoke from the rear on the next lap but disappeared on the 42nd lap.

At one point, Chanchu was forecast to become a strong typhoon and make landfall near Hong Kong. In response to the threat, officials at the Hong Kong Observatory, {{as well as in}} Macau, issued a standby signal to inform the public of the approaching typhoon. The HKO issued a warning signal number 3 on May17. In the territory, 60flights were canceled with another 14 delayed, beaches were closed, and ferry service was disrupted. Ahead of the storm, about 1million people evacuated from coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces to government warehouses, schools, tents, or the houses of relatives. In the former province, 62,000fishermen were ordered to return to port, while four flights were canceled at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Residents were advised to remain indoors, and workers reinforced billboards in anticipation of the strong winds. Rail and boat transport was stopped between Guangdong and Hainan across the Qiongzhou Strait due to the typhoon.
