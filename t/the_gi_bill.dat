5|$|After World War II, Syracuse University {{began to}} {{transform}} {{into a major}} research institution. Enrollment increased {{in the four years}} after the war due to <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill,</b> which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class. Branch campuses were established in Endicott, New York and Utica, New York.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Bill Murray's {{performance}} in the 1981 comedy film Stripes, Keenan joined the United States Army, {{with the intention of}} having <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill</b> fund his dream of attending art school. By this point, he had lived in Kansas, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas. He initially served in the Army as a forward observer before studying at West Point Prep School from 1983 to 1984.|$|E

He {{lives in a}} dark, grimy, garbage-strewn urban netherworld, where a company named Blump's {{apparently}} owns everything. His best friend and fellow trash collector, <b>Gus</b> (<b>Bill</b> Paxton), is <b>the</b> only one who laughs at his jokes, and his sincerity is questionable. <b>The</b> obnoxiously exuberant <b>Gus</b> plays an accordion, which he always carries with him.

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to New York, Koppelman continued {{his study of}} Aesthetic Realism, and under <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill,</b> he studied at the Amédée Ozenfant School and became Ozenfant's assistant. While he continued to exhibit sculpture and drawings, he also began printmaking, a medium which, he said, combines the carving quality of sculpture with the subtleties of light and shade in drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Green served from 1943 to 1946, {{rising to}} the rank of Sergeant. He {{returned}} to Philadelphia in March 1946, intending to use the benefits of <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill</b> to attend Drexel University. He planned to major in electrical engineering, which was the field he had worked in during his time in the Army. Drexel did not have classes starting until September, so Green began to look to work. While seeking employment at Temple University Green learned that Temple had classes beginning in two weeks, so he decided to enroll there.|$|E
5|$|More than 5,400 St. Louisans became {{casualties}} of the war, listed as either missing or killed in action. The {{end of the}} war led to the closure of many St. Louis factories, with major layoffs beginning in May and continuing through August 1945. By late 1945, returning soldiers encountered a chronic housing and job shortage in the city. <b>The</b> <b>GI</b> <b>Bill</b> allowed many St. Louis veterans to purchase homes and pursue higher education, which encouraged sub-urbanization that after the war reduced the city's population.|$|E

5|$|Service members {{holding a}} blue {{discharge}} {{were subjected to}} discrimination in civilian life. They were denied the benefits of <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill</b> by the Veterans Administration and had difficulty finding work because employers {{were aware of the}} negative connotations of a blue discharge. Following intense criticism in the press—especially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{discharge}} from the Army {{and return to the}} States in 1946, Benedetto studied at the American Theatre Wing on <b>the</b> <b>GI</b> <b>Bill.</b> He was taught the bel canto singing discipline, which would keep his voice in good shape for his entire career. He continued to perform wherever he could, including while waiting tables. Based upon a suggestion from a teacher at American Theatre Wing, he developed an unusual approach that involved imitating, as he sang, the style and phrasing of other musicians — such as that of Stan Getz's saxophone and Art Tatum's piano — helping him to improvise as he interpreted a song. He made a few recordings as Bari in 1949 for small Leslie Records, but they failed to sell.|$|E
5|$|World War II caused {{enrollment}} {{to decline}} {{and the student}} body consisted mainly {{of high school students}} and seminarians. Following the war, new students enrolled, and the school built a temporary facility in 1947 to accommodate them. Students from Illinois began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill.</b> By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. Better times and higher birth rates led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
40|$|Post-transcriptional gene {{silencing}} (PTGS) {{has been shown}} to occur in many transgenic dicotyledonous plants. Although trans{{gene silencing}} has been documented in transgenic monocots, PTGS has been only recently de-scribed in monocotyledonous plants. To study PTGS in rice, we generated 25 transgenic rice cell lines in which the 35 S-gus gene was stably integrated. In one transgenic cell line, lack of gus expression was shown to be caused by PTGS {{based on the results of}} run-on transcription assays. Furthermore, to examine whether reintroduction of the same plasmid DNA into cells in which <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> gene was highly expressed causes the suppression of <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> expres-sion, <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> plasmid was introduced into protoplasts iso-lated from a high gws-expressing line. Results of the kinetic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> activities in transfected protoplasts indicated that <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> expression in transfected protoplasts was suppressed by <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> plasmid but not by the luc plasmid harboring the 35 S-luciferase gene, suggesting that suppression of <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> expression by introduced plasmid DNA was homology-dependent. These results suggest that the transgenic protoplasts may be a useful experimental system to study PTGS in rice and other species.

5|$|After he {{returned}} to the United States, 22-year-old Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, his high school girlfriend and classmate since kindergarten, on September 1, 1945. The pair relocated to Chicago; there, Vonnegut enrolled in the University of Chicago as an anthropology student (in an unusual five-year joint undergraduate/graduate program that only conferred the higher master's degree) on <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill.</b> He augmented his income by working as a reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago at night. Jane accepted a scholarship from the university to study Russian literature as a graduate student. Jane dropped out of the program after becoming pregnant with the couple's first child, Mark (born May 1947), while Kurt also left the University without any degree (despite having completed his undergraduate education) when his master's thesis on the Ghost Dance religious movement was unanimously rejected by the department.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{sought to}} be {{discharged}} as the war neared its end, and married Betty Moore on July 6, 1945. They married at the First Baptist Church in Mitchell while on leave, and his brother Norman served as his best man. He was discharged from the army in November 1945. Grissom {{took a job at}} Carpenter Body Works, a local bus manufacturing business, and rented an apartment in Mitchell. He had trouble earning a sufficient income and was determined to attend college. Using <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill</b> for partial payment of his school tuition, Grissom enrolled at Purdue University in September 1946. During his time in college, Betty returned to live with her parents and took a job at the Indiana Bell Telephone Company while he worked part-time as a cook at a local restaurant. Grissom took summer classes to finish early and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in February 1950.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, {{after school}} and having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him {{to listen to the}} greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens College in New York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill</b> and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E

5|$|Returning {{soldiers}} using <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill</b> after World War II {{stressed the}} state university system {{to the point that}} a Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was opened {{on the campus of the}} Florida State College for Women with the men housed in barracks on nearby Dale Mabry Field. By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and designated it Florida State University. The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an airport later became the location of the Tallahassee Community College. The post-war years brought substantial growth and development to the university as many departments and colleges were added including Business, Journalism (discontinued in 1959), Library Science, Nursing and Social Welfare. Strozier Library, Tully Gymnasium and the original parts of the Business building were also built at this time.|$|E
5|$|The University of Alaska also grew {{during this}} period. In 1946, Congress {{appropriated}} money {{for construction of}} a Geophysical Institute to study Arctic phenomena such as the aurora borealis. The institute was established in 1949 and spurred the university's growth as <b>the</b> <b>GI</b> <b>Bill</b> simultaneously boosted the student population. Elementary education also developed as the Fairbanks Independent School District (the precursor to today's Fairbanks North Star Borough School District) was established in 1947 to collect school taxes from areas outside city limits that were sending students to Fairbanks' school. The Golden Valley Electric Association, an electrical cooperative, was founded in the 1940s to provide electricity to areas outside Fairbanks city limits. In 1953, it bought the FE Co. power plant that served Fairbanks and provided electricity to customers as varied as Fairbanks' second radio station, KFRB, and the town's largest farm, Creamer's Dairy.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans Administration (VA), {{charged with}} {{implementing}} {{the provisions of}} <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> <b>Bill,</b> denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans, despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge {{as if it were}} dishonorable.|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{cultivation}} of the mushroom fungus, Agaricus bisporus, utilizes a substrate {{consisting of a}} lower layer of compost and upper layer of peat. Typically, the two layers are seeded with individual mycelial inoculants representing a single genotype of A. bisporus. Studies aimed at examining the potential of this fungal species as a heterologous protein expression system have revealed unexpected contributions of the mycelial inoculants in the morphogenesis of the fruiting body. These contributions were elucidated using a dual-inoculant method whereby the two layers were differientially inoculated with transgenic b-glucuronidase (GUS) and wild-type (WT) lines. Surprisingly, use of a transgenic <b>GUS</b> line in <b>the</b> lower substrate and a WT line in the upper substrate yielded fruiting bodies expressing GUS activity while lacking <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> transgene. Results of PCR and RT-PCR analyses for <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> transgene and RNA transcript, respectively, suggested translocation of <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> protein from <b>the</b> transgenic mycelium colonizing the lower layer into the fruiting body that developed exclusively from WT mycelium colonizing the upper layer. Effective translocation of <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> protein depended {{on the use of}} a transgenic line in the lower layer in which <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> gene was controlled by a vegetative mycelium-active promoter (laccase 2 and b-actin), rather than a fruiting body-active promoter (hydrophobin A). GUS-expressing fruiting bodies lacking <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> gene had a bonafide WT genotype, confirmed by the absence of stably inherited GUS and hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker activities in their derived basidiospores and mycelial tissue cultures...|$|R
