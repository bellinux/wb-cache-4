Piston speed 3792fpm @ 4250rpm. Compression 6.5 to 1 in the Grand Prix but 7.6 to 1 with different pistons in post-Works Brooklands racing.|$|E
50|$|In {{four-stroke}} cycle engines and some two-stroke cycle engines, the valve timing {{is controlled by}} the camshaft. It can be varied by modifying the camshaft, or it can be varied during engine operation by variable valve timing. It is also affected by the adjustment of the valve mechanism, and particularly by the <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance.</b> However, this variation is normally unwanted.|$|E
50|$|Some mass-market {{car engines}} from the 1960s {{replaced}} the rocker-end adjustment screw with a non-adjustable rocker pivoted on a central stud with a hemispherical nut. Tappet adjustment {{was made by}} moving the pivot nut up and down. Some of these designs also required the <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance</b> to be set with the engine running. As this rapidly wore out feeler gauges, long rolls of disposable feeler strip were needed instead.|$|E
50|$|The 30-98s {{used the}} Prince Henry chassis, they were {{distinguished}} by having more-or-less flat rather than V-shaped radiators. Laurence Pomeroy took the Prince Henry L-head side-valve engine, bored it out 3 mm, then cold-stretched the crankshaft throws 5 mm using a steam power hammer to lengthen the stroke. The camshaft {{was given a}} new chain drive {{at the front of}} the engine, high lift cams and new <b>tappet</b> <b>clearances.</b> The Prince Henry chassis was slightly modified and the whole given a narrow alloy four-seater body, a pair of alloy wings (front mudguards) and no doors.|$|R
5000|$|Credited to Coatalen {{the design}} is an Ernest Henry type Straight Eight in line twin {{overhead}} camshaft. Bore and stroke 65x112mm, Capacity 2973cc. Lightweight aluminum alloy cylinder blocks and crankcase. Block cast in two blocks of four; non-detachable head cast in one. Shrunk-in steel liners and screwed- in phosphor-bronze valve seats. Crankshaft of nickel-chrome forging, machined from a single billet; plain bearings. Hollow five main journals and eight crankpins. Each crank throw is counterbalanced. No flywheel. Camshaft driven by train of straight-tooth pinions at the front. Rotation viewed from above anti-clockwise both inlet and exhaust. Pistons are aluminium domed- head carrying three compression rings and an oil groove in the skirt serving instead of scraper ring. Piston clearance 0.015’’ to 0.018’’. Groves 1/16’’. Connecting rods H-section, white metal big end bearings. Four tulip-shape overhead valves (twin inlet and twin outlet) per cylinder (32 in total) inclined at 60 degrees operated by two overhead camshafts through inverted cup-style <b>tappets.</b> Valve <b>clearance</b> (cold) inlet 0.010, exhaust 0.015. Valve timing varies between chassis and in time viz. in 1922 open 12 degrees BBDC close 55 degrees ATDC; 1960 - chassis II: inlet opens 5 degrees BTC and closes 35 degrees ABC. Exhaust opens 45 degrees BBC and closes 10 degrees ATC. Compression 1921 French G.P. was 5.7 to 1, increased for the 1922 IoM T.T. to 6.3 to 1. Output 112bhp at a maximum 4,700rpm. (See footnote below.) ...|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic tappets are tappets {{that contain}} a small {{hydraulic}} piston, pressurised by the engine's lubricating oil supply. Although the piston {{does not move}} appreciably or frequently, it acts as a hydraulic spring that automatically adjusts the <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance</b> according to the oil pressure. This makes the valve actuation self-adjusting {{and there is no}} need to adjust the rockers. Hydraulic tappets depend on a supply of clean oil at the appropriate pressure. When starting a cold engine, with low oil pressure, hydraulic tappets are often noisy for a few seconds, until they position themselves correctly.|$|E
5000|$|All K {{series are}} non-crossflow engines - the inlet and exhaust {{manifolds}} {{are on the}} same side. They have cast iron blocks and aluminium alloy heads, with a crankshaft supported by five main bearings. K series motors have both hydraulic tappet or hydraulic valve lifters, solid lifters and 1.5 ratio rockers with an adjustment thread for <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance.</b> 7k engines were released with only the hydraulic valve lifters from factory, whereas 4k and 5k engines were made with both hydraulic and solid lifters (depending on year and which model vehicle.) ...|$|E
50|$|This type {{of engine}} still has tappet noise even after adjustment. This noise is said {{to come from the}} cams due to {{incorrect}} valve setup (when setting valve clearance each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect oil grade. The correct oil grade is 5W-30 semi synthetic oil. Another reason is the large <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance</b> on the exhaust valve. This could of course be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a rough idle and usually stalled.|$|E
50|$|Mechanically, the carburetors were re-jetted in {{an effort}} to improve {{throttle}} response, especially in the low end, {{all the way up to}} the bike's 11,750 rpm redline. The redesigned camshafts were lightened and used internal oil ways to lubricate journals that, when combined with reduced <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance,</b> provided less friction and created less engine noise. The gearbox received a taller first gear, a hollow chrome-moly shift-shaft with an additional bearing and a completely redesigned shift linkage and foot pedal. These changes were aimed at eliminating problems with the transmission in earlier models, and to help to seamlessly transfer the bike's power to the road.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} the Lawrence was an oddity. Most {{air-cooled}} engines at that time were rotary engines using cylinders that rotated together with the propeller, but Kimihei overheard that an engine with good cooling capability with fixed cylinders was being developed in England. He observed the English Gloster Gamecock fighter with its Bristol Jupiter engine, which was an advanced design for the era with an automatic adjustment device for <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance,</b> spiral piping for even intake distribution, and a four-valve intake and exhaust system. He acquired a manufacturing license for the Jupiter in 1925. In 1927, after inviting two production engineer instructors from the Bristol company,the Jupiter Type 6 of 420 PS and Type 7 of 450 PS with a turbocharger were put into production at the Nakajima factory.|$|E

40|$|The {{preignition}} {{characteristics of}} the R- 2800 cylinder, as effected by fuel consumption, engine operating variables, and spark plug type and condition, were evaluated. The effects on preignition-limited performance of various percentages of aromatics (benzene, toluene, cumene, xylene) in a base fuel of triptane were investigated. Two paraffins (triptane and S + 6. 0 ml TEL/gal) and two refinery blends (28 -R and 33 -R) were preignition rated. The effect {{of changes in the}} following engine operating variables on preignition limit was determined: inlet-air temperature, rear spark plug gasket temperature, engine speed, spark advance, <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance,</b> and oil consumption. Preignition limits of the R- 2800 cylinder using Champion C 34 S and C 35 S and AC-LS 86, LS 87, and LS 88 spark plugs were established and the effect of spark plug deterioration was investigated. No definite trends in preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure were indicated for aromatics as a class when increased percentages of different aromatics were added to a base fuel of triptane. Three types of fuel (aromatics, paraffins, and refinery blends) showed a preignition range for this cylinder from 65 to 104 percent when based on the performance of S plus 6. 0 ml TEL per gallon as 100 percent. The R- 2800 cylinder is therefore relatively insensitive to fuel composition when compared to a CFR F- 4 engine, which had a pre-ignition range from 72 to 100 percent for the same fuels. Six engine operating variables were investigated with the following results: preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure decreased, with increases in engine speed, rear spark plug gasket temperature, inlet-air temperature, and spark advance beyond 20 F B. T. C. and was unaffected by rate of oil consumption or by <b>tappet</b> <b>clearance.</b> Spark plugs were rated over a range of preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure from 200 to 390 pounds per square inch at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 07 in the following order of increased resistance to preignition: AC-LS 97, AC-LS 88, Champion C 358, AC-LS 86, and Champion C 34 S. Spark plug deterioration in the form of cracks in the porcelain had been broken away from the center electrode and were retained in the spark plug cavity, the preignition limit was decreased as much as 57 percent. When the broken pieces had been removed, the preignition limit increased from that of the undamaged porcelain as the weight of removed porcelain was increased...|$|E
