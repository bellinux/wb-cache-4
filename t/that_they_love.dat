5|$|After {{three weeks}} Brian decides {{to meet again}} with Arielle. She gives him a hotel key and in the evening at the hotel room they consummate their relationship. They begin to meet {{regularly}} at the same hotel room in the evenings. Valéry, who is aware of Brian's affair with Arielle, approaches {{him on the street}} and invites Brian to his house for dinner. At dinner, Brian meets Arielle and Valéry's children and is introduced to Valéry's lover, a 25-year-old editor named Jane (Olivia Thirlby). Arielle later meets Brian's parents, Sam (Frank Langella) and Arlene (Glenn Close). Upon learning that Arielle is a married mother of two, Sam tells Brian that he disapproves of the relationship, while Arlene accepts <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> each other despite the circumstances. When Brian is invited to a New Yorker ceremony to receive an award for one of his short stories, he is joined by Arielle, Valéry, Jane, and his parents.

5|$|After the show's {{transition}} from NBC to DirecTV, Eve's storylines emphasize her romance with Julian and difficult relationship with Vincent. Believed dead, Vincent reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to Eve after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens {{to kill her}} if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks Eve into rehab after she relapses, abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. Vincent arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, Viki Chatsworth, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent {{with the birth of}} his son on the Russells' kitchen table, when Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Eve assures Julian <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> each other emotionally and intellectually; Julian vows that the Crane family will take more responsibility for their actions now that Alistair is dead. At the rehearsal dinner, Eve and the other dinner guests eat Vincent and Viki's poisoned mushroom sauce. She dies, but is resurrected when witch Tabitha Lenox renounces magic and becomes a born-again Christian. In the series finale, Kay uses her magic to heal Julian's penis. Since T. C., Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two Russells in the final episode.|$|E
25|$|In Montfermeil, the duplicitous innkeepers, the Thénardiers, use Cosette as {{a servant}} and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by {{claiming}} that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, Éponine. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly ("Castle on a Cloud"). The Thénardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and {{live a life of}} criminal depravity ("Master of the House"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Thénardiers payment to adopt her ("The Bargain"). The Thénardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris ("The Waltz of Treachery").|$|E

25|$|Miley is {{especially}} close with her father, from whom she receives much good advice and emotional support. She also values her relationships with her best friends Lilly and Oliver. However Miley {{is shown to}} be very uncomfortable {{with the fact that}} they're dating and even stops them from being a couple. Her relationship with Lilly occasionally suffers the occasional setback, but they always make up. In the episode 'What I Don't Like About You', Miley is asked to choose a side between a fight Lilly and Oliver had. But Miley, showing what a kind friend she was, made a mini-Indiana Joannie movie, which made Lilly and Oliver forgive each other. Miley's relationship with her brother Jackson is often hostile. The two siblings constantly fight and trash talk each other. However, in a few private conversations, both Miley and Jackson say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> and appreciate each other, but they are both unwilling to admit this in public.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem is that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Allan Poe {{was very}} close to his brother, as he wrote: [...] "there can be no tie more strong than that of brother for brother — {{it is not so much}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> one another as that they both love the same parent." [...] Edgar {{occasionally}} used the alias [...] "Henri Le Rennet", a French version of his older brother's name. He was also inspired by his brother Henry's travels, often incorporating some of his stories from overseas into tellings of his own life story. The character of August Barnard in Edgar's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) seems to be inspired by Henry, especially in his travels across the sea and his drinking. Poe may have also transformed his brother's name into the title character in his poem [...] "Lenore".|$|E

He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness.

Neha, upset at being passed over for promotion, goes home and is consoled by Rani; in turn, she helps Rani accept her son's sexuality. Kunal and Sam help Neha with a project assigned by Abhi, who is impressed with her work. They later take Neha on separate dates, both telling her <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> her. Neha, convinced that they are gay, sees the dates as friendly outings. When Abhi and Neha begin dating, Sam and Kunal sabotage the budding relationship by giving Abhi inappropriate advice; this irritates Neha, and she and Abhi quarrel. When Neha discovers Kunal and Sam's plan, she misinterprets it as jealousy of Abhi. Sam and Kunal redirect their efforts into frightening Veer, Abhi's five-year-old son, about his future with Neha. During a basketball game, Neha discovers that Abhi plans to propose to her and asks Kunal and Sameer's advice. They ask her to turn him down, admitting that their homosexuality is a ruse and they both love her. Veer tells Abhi about his fears, and during the game Abhi breaks up with Neha. She tearfully evicts Kunal and Sameer from her apartment, and resigns from Verve.|$|E

According to George Lang of The Oklahoman, [...] "Kittie's lyrics {{are full of}} spit and venom, {{directed}} at preppy cheerleaders, rich kids, rude boys and women who trade on their sexuality". According to the Sun-Sentinel, [...] "Raven" [...] is [...] "inspired by a death threat" [...] from another band. [...] "Jonny" [...] is reportedly a reaction to male domination of women, and [...] "Paperdoll", according to Morgan Lander, is about the degradation of women as objects. Fallon Bowman said that [...] "Choke" [...] is [...] "about someone telling you <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> you so much, and they put you up on a pedestal and make you feel great, then they {{turn around and say}} 'screw you. According to Morgan Lander, [...] "Do You Think I'm a Whore" [...] "is about not judging a book by its cover" [...] and the song's title was given [...] "basically to prove people wrong".

[...] Danielle's death received a mixed reaction from viewers, with 90% of viewers polled by The Sun opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake. The decision was defended by Santer, who stated: [...] "We acknowledge that we didn't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for, and that for some people this was upsetting. We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending. EastEnders – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines, both happy and sad. We’re proud of the episode, the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it."

[...] Brian has also credited Carl for the title, while Carl said with uncertainty that it might have come from Brian: [...] "The idea he [...] had was that everybody has these sounds <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>love,</b> and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.. It was just so much more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality.
