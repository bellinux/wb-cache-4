At that time the flight designator was changed to flight LX 023, and operated by Airbus A330-300s.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, the Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) {{granted a}} five-year licence to {{transport}} passengers, {{cargo and mail}} to China; the airline was free to apply for <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> to 10 cities in China. On 5 July 2005, the airline announced the purchase of two Bombardier CRJ700s from Danish carrier Maersk Air, scheduled to arrive in July and mid-August, respectively. In addition, the airline had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Boeing {{for the purchase of}} 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 30 Boeing 737–800s on 20 December 2005 at a listed price of US$3.28 billion. An executive of the airline had told reporters that some of the Boeing aircraft was from Hainan Airlines' order.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June 2003, CR Airways became Hong Kong's third {{passenger}} airline {{after receiving}} a revised AOC from the Director of Civil Aviation Albert Lam and operated its first passenger flight on the next day. It started passenger charter operations to Laoag, Philippines on 5 July 2003, with a Bombardier CRJ200 leased from GE Capital Aviation Services. In September 2003, the airline applied for <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> to operate scheduled passenger services to Laoag and Chinese cities of Jinan, Naning, Meixian and Wenzhou. In addition, Robert Yip sold 40 percent of the airline to his company, China Rich Holdings, for HK$180 million. By March 2004, the airline had added Siem Reap, Cambodia to its charter network.|$|E

5|$|Bob Ayling's {{leadership}} {{led to a}} {{cost savings}} of £750m {{and the establishment of}} a budget airline, Go, in 1998. The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years. In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. That year, British Airways and KLM conducted talks on a potential merger, reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission. The plan fell through in September 2000. British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei. Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm 3i in June 2001. Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to reduced demand following 11 September attacks in 2001, and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004. In 2005 Willie Walsh, managing director of Aer Lingus and a former pilot, became {{the chief executive officer of}} British Airways. BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies in January 2008, taking advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> between Europe and the United States. OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York's JFK and Newark airports.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

25|$|Paris-San Francisco {{became the}} first route UTA served in {{competition}} with Air France non-stop from Paris.

25|$|In 1986 the {{government}} relaxed {{its policy of}} dividing <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> for scheduled services between Air France, Air Inter and UTA, without route overlaps between them. The decision opened some of Air France's most lucrative routes on which it had enjoyed a government-sanctioned monopoly since 1963 and which were within its exclusive sphere of influence, to rival airlines, notably UTA. The changes enabled UTA to launch scheduled services to new destinations within Air France's sphere, in competition with that airline.|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} days when {{liberalisation}} of the EU/EEA internal air transport market was still in progress and when domestic <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> were reserved for each member country's own airlines. The German government therefore insisted that all non-German EU/EEA carriers either withdraw their internal German scheduled services from Berlin or transfer them to majority German-owned subsidiaries {{by the end of}} 1992. It also wanted the bulk of all charter flights from Berlin to be operated by German airlines. These measures were squarely aimed at UK carriers with a major presence in the internal German air transport market from Berlin as well as the city's charter market, specifically British Airways and Dan-Air. Lufthansa and other German airlines reportedly lobbied their government to curtail British Airways's and Dan-Air's activities in Berlin, arguing that German airlines enjoyed no equivalent rights in the UK. This resulted in British Airways taking a 49% stake in Friedrichshafen-based German regional airline Delta Air, renaming it Deutsche BA (DBA) and transferring its internal German <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> to the new airline. BA also replaced the commuter aircraft DBA had inherited from Delta Air with new Boeing 737-300s. These in turn replaced the Boeing 737-200 Adv and BAe ATP airliners British Airways had used on its internal German scheduled services from Berlin.|$|E
