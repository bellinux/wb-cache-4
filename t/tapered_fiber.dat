40|$|Highly e¤cient {{generation}} of spectrally-broad single-mode supercontinuum （SC） light in conventional tapered fibers is investigated by many researchers. It {{has recently been}} reported that optical pulses propagating through a <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> immersed in heavy-water（ D 2 O） yield an broad and flat SC spectrum because the dispersion characteristics of the fiber is flattened at zero dispersion around 1064 nm. In the present paper, we analyzed numerically properties of the SC generation for the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> in D 2 O in more detail. The influence of incident light pulse parameters and waist length of a <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> on SC spectra was also examined.

40|$|Adiabaticity {{criteria}} and optimal shapes for <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> are theoretically analyzed. In the analysis, it is {{discovered that a}} narrower taper waist {{can be achieved by}} using a small hot-zone length or increases the elongation distance. The <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> fabrication based on flame brushing technique is then demonstrated using a homemade fiber tapering rig. The heat source comes from an oxy-butane torch with a flame width of 1 mm. Two stepper motors are incorporated in the rig to control the movement of the torch and translation stage. A biconical <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> with a waist diameter as small as 400 nm can be achieved with the rig. To achieve low loss tapered fibers, the shape of the taper should be fabricated according to adiabaticity criteria, whereby the longer transition length is desirable.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{high-power}} narrow-linewidth fiber amplifier {{based on a}} tapered Yb-doped fiber. In the experiment, the narrow end of the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> is used as the input port of both pump source and signal light to form a robust all-fiber configuration. The stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is effectively suppressed owing to its gradually increased mode area as well as continuously changed Brillouin frequency shift dependent on the core diameter. As a result, an output power of 260 W without SBS and mode instability (MI) is obtained, with a slope efficiency of 71. 3 % and a narrow linewidth of ~ 2 GHz. However, the MI rather than SBS is observed when output power reaches 260 W. The features of MI are experimentally studied in detail. It is pointed out that, the MI seems the primary and durative limitation factor of the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> amplifier for high-power narrow-linewidth output, although it has advantage to reduce other nonlinear effect. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first detailed experimental study on MI in a <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber.</b> At last, some worthwhile discussion about the optimization of the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> and the whole system for both SBS and MI suppression is conducted based on the present and previous results...|$|E

40|$|In-line single-mode-fiber (SMF) {{filters and}} polarizers require the {{interaction}} of electric fields which, in principle, are essentially confined to the fiber core. The reduction of the core and cladding diameters in a <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> cause the evanescent field to extend beyond the outer boundary. Thus, when a metal film is evaporated on a <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber,</b> the surface plasma modes cause coupling to the fiber mode.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} characteristics of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) for cold atoms by monitoring the spontaneous emission from trapped atoms coupled into the guided mode of a tapered optical nanofiber.

The size and shape of the MOT, determined by translating the cold atom cloud across the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber,</b> is in excellent agreement with measurements obtained using the conventional method of fluorescence imaging using a charge coupled device camera. The coupling of atomic fluorescence into the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> also allows us to monitor the loading and lifetime of the trap. The results are compared to those achieved by focusing the MOT fluorescence onto a photodiode and it was seen that the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> gives slightly longer loading and lifetime measurements due to the sensitivity of the fiber, even when very few atoms are present...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} formula for {{the shape of}} <b>tapered</b> <b>fibers</b> in movable large-zone furnace fiber-tapering system is derived by the discrete deducing method.

It is found that the furnace moving distance affects the fiber waist length and radius greatly, while the moving speed of the furnace and the holders can effect the fiber waist radius visibly.

40|$|Light {{is usually}} coupled to a {{whispering}} gallery mode cavity using a <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber.</b> However, {{it is difficult to}} stabilize the optical coupling against mechanical vibration because it requires sub-μm control of the gap distance between the fiber and cavity. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate mechanically robust coupling that we realize by allowing the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> to touch the sidewall of the cavity. By using an octagonal toroid microcavity, we prevent the cavity-waveguide system from over coupling and achieve critical coupling even when the fiber is in contact with the surface of the cavity. We show by numerical analysis that such a deformed microcavity is required if we need to control the coupling, since a circular cavity usually overcouples when the fiber contacts the surface. The fabricated octagonal silica toroid microcavity exhibits a quality factor of 2. 2 × 104 when the <b>tapered</b> <b>fiber</b> touches a cavity with a diameter of 80 μm...|$|E
