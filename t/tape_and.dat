5|$|Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) is a {{magnetic}} compound. Its ideal shape anisotropy, which imparts high coercivity and remnant magnetization, {{made it a}} compound superior to the Î³-Fe2O3. Chromium(IV) oxide is used to manufacture magnetic tape used in high-performance audio <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> standard audio cassettes. Chromates can prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions, and therefore chromates are added to drilling muds.|$|E
5|$|Logan informs Veronica {{about the}} sex tape {{of her and}} Piz and hands her a DVD, {{although}} she berates him and denies that the recording is authentic. She views the <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> goes to visit Piz, who is badly bruised. She makes sure that Piz did not upload the footage to the internet, which he confirms. After learning that Logan had attacked Piz, Parker visits Logan's hotel room and tearfully breaks up with him, claiming that he still loves Veronica. Veronica goes to Logan's hotel room and berates him for attacking Piz. She confronts Dick {{about the origins of}} the sex <b>tape,</b> <b>and</b> he reveals that he got it from Chip Diller before forwarding it to his whole address book. She investigates further before encountering a student who refuses to tell her anything. She gets Weevil to destroy the student's car, and he names the individual, whom she later wiretaps.|$|E

40|$|Different {{types of}} HTS joints of Bi- 2212 /Ag <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> laminates, which are {{fabricated}} by dip-coating and partial-melt processes, have been investigated. All joints are prepared using green single <b>and</b> laminated <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> {{according to the}} scheme: coating-joining-processing. The heat treated tapes have critical current (Ic) between 7 and 27 A, depending on <b>tape</b> thickness <b>and</b> the number of Bi- 2212 ceramic layers in laminated tapes. It is found that the current transport properties of joints depend {{on the type of}} laminate, joint configuration and joint treatment, Ic losses in joints of Bi- 2212 <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> laminates are attributed to defects in their structure, such as pores, secondary phases and misalignment of Bi- 2212 grains near the Ag edges. By optimizing joint configuration, current transmission up to 100 % is achieved for both single <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> laminated <b>tapes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a painful}} condition caused by microtrauma to plantar fascia due to overuse. It {{is a most}} common cause of heel pain in runners. Various studies proved <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> Iontophoresis as effective in the treating plantar fasciitis. But there are no studies comparing the combined effect of iontophoresis with <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> <b>taping</b> alone in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Methods: 50 patients suffering from plantar fasciitis who met the inclusion criteria were selected. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups i. e. Group A and Group B. Group A received taping, iontophoresis with plantar fascia stretching. Group B received <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretching. A total of 6 treatment sessions were given on alternate days over a period of two weeks for both the groups. Results: VAS and FFI scores across baseline and post intervention showed a significant improvement statistically in their mean scores between Groups A and B (P< 0. 05). Between group comparison of VAS and FFI scores, it showed that subject treated with Iontophoresis in combination with <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretch (Group A) had significant improvement in VAS and functional ability when compared to subjects treated with <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretching alone (Group B). Conclusion: Iontophoresis along with <b>Taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretching gave an additional benefit when compared with <b>Taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretching alone in reducing pain and improving function in plantar fasciitis.

5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E

Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the differences in electromyographic (EMG) activities of upper limb muscles between cross- <b>and</b> parallel-aligned <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> to compare the effects of these 2 taping methods in healthy adults. Thirty subjects, who volunteered for this study, were tested under 3 taping conditions in random order: (1) no taping, (2) cross-aligned <b>taping,</b> <b>and</b> (3) parallel-aligned <b>taping.</b> EMG activities of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, flexor carpi ulnaris, and extensor carpi radialis muscles were measured. All muscles showed significant differences in EMG activity among the 3 conditions (p<. 05). In the post hoc test, biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles showed significant differences in EMG activity between the no <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> the cross-aligned <b>taping</b> conditions <b>and</b> between the no <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> the parallel-aligned <b>taping</b> conditions. Additionally, the EMG activities of the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis muscles appeared to be significantly different between the no <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> parallel-aligned <b>taping</b> conditions. These findings demonstrate that taping may be helpful for decreasing muscle activity, regardless of the direction of tape application. This study provides useful information to future researchers regarding the effects of taping on muscle activity...|$|R

He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer Al Garcia (Armand Assante) begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing on <b>tape,</b> <b>and</b> he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, quits stripping, and gets back her job in the FBI. Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the release}} of Pixies' debut mini-album Come On Pilgrim in October 1987, Ivo Watts-Russell, head of 4AD, {{suggested}} they return to the studio to record a full-length album. The original plan was to record new material at Fort Apache Studios, where the band had produced The Purple <b>Tape</b> <b>and</b> Come On Pilgrim. However, due to differences between the band's manager Ken Goes and The Purple Tape producer Gary Smith, Pixies ended up {{looking for a new}} producer and recording studio. On the advice of a 4AD colleague, Watts-Russell looked to hire Steve Albini, ex-frontman of Big Black, as the record's engineer and producer. Having sent a pre-release tape of Come On Pilgrim to Albini, Pixies' manager, Ken Goes, invited him to a Boston dinner party at drummer David Lovering's house a few weeks after Come On Pilgrims release.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E
