5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture {{may have contributed to}} the historic Shoshones, but it is not well understood. Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures.|$|E
5|$|In classes where {{horses are}} {{turned out in}} saddle seat equipment, it is typical for <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> be shown in a single curb bit with a bit shank under , rather than the double bridle more common to other saddle seat breeds. Riders wear typical saddle seat attire. Hats are not always mandatory, but use of safety helmets is allowed and ranges from {{strongly}} encouraged to required in some pleasure division classes.|$|E

5|$|Lettice Knollys {{was born}} on 8 November 1543 at Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire. Her father, Sir Francis Knollys, was a Member of Parliament and acted as Master of <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> <b>to</b> Prince Edward.

Lettice was the third of her parents' 16 children.|$|E
5|$|Horses are {{frequently}} seen in television, films and literature. They are sometimes featured {{as a major}} character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products. The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, {{in a variety of}} poses and equipment. The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Norse, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun. The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, after {{studying}} butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation. Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance {{that would be}} difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth. He used examples such as the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species.|$|E

50|$|The {{gear box}} allowed <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> always walk {{at their best}} speed whilst the vehicle could then {{have a range of}} speeds and torques. Because of the gears, the top speed was not limited to the top speed of <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> <b>The</b> gearbox allowed <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>to</b> drive <b>the</b> vehicle in forward as well as reverse directions, and it was also {{possible}} to disengage the drive so that the vehicle could stop whilst <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> continued <b>to</b> walk up the treadmill. The vehicle travelled at 7 miles an hour during the trials, but it was thought that a final version would reach 15 to 20 miles per hour and would outrun a steam engine.|$|R

5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the horse collar removed the previous physical restrictions the old harness had on the animal, and allowed <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> be able to exert its full strength in plowing. Originally, {{the structure of the}} old harness forced <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> literally pull its workload, the horse collar’s development instead allowed <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> push its workload, increasing the efficiency of its labor output.|$|E
25|$|Direct rein: {{a squeeze}} and release {{on the line}} {{backwards}} helps to keep the horse from moving out on the circle, causes <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> bend inward, or asks <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> make the circle smaller.|$|E

25|$|Giving the longe: briefly {{releasing}} the line towards the horse's head, before re-establishing contact. Acts as a reward, asks <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> lower its head, or asks <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> move {{out onto a}} larger circle. The line should not drag or become very loose when this is performed.|$|E
25|$|A set toe can {{be applied}} to protect the toe from {{increased}} wear, as lack of flexion in the hock will cause <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> drag its toe. A trailer or lateral extension can be fitted to prevent an axial swing developed by the horse, allowing <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> make contact with the ground earlier and prevent rotation within the hock.|$|E
25|$|Contact—the third {{level of}} the pyramid—is {{the result of the}} horse’s pushing power, and should never be {{achieved}} by the pulling of the rider’s hands. The rider encourages <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> stretch into soft hands that allow <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> lift the base of the neck, coming up into the bridle, and should always follow the natural motion of the animal’s head. The horse should have equal contact in both reins.|$|E

25|$|The longe whip {{takes the}} place of the rider's legs, asking <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, {{pointing}} towards the horse's hocks, with the lash dragging on the ground. The whip is held in the hand that the horse is not going (so if the horse were going to the right, the whip would be held in the lunger's left hand). The horse is to accept the whip as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>to</b> adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and the whip turned backward, under the arm, so that it does not interfere with the horse.|$|E
