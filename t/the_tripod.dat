5|$|A hanap of gold, all {{its cover}} well and richly {{enamelled}} {{on the outside}} with the life of Madame St Agnes; and the cresting of the foot is garnished with 26 pearls, and the crown around the cover with 36 pearls; and the finial of the said cover (is) garnished with four sapphires, three balas rubies and fifteen pearls. And it weighs 9 marcs 3 ounces of gold. and the said hanap rests on a stand of gold {{in the form of}} a tripod, and in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> is represented Our Lady in a sun on a ground of clear red, and the three feet of <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> are formed by three winged dragons. The said hanap and cover were given to the king by monseigneur the duc de Berry on his journey into Touraine in the year 91.|$|E
5|$|George {{returns to}} Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, a {{colleague}} of Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a location in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt to steal <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who {{claim to be the}} Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in Syria: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as a crystal ball. He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, Baphomet; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, but George manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|Seven minutes later, {{two other}} high-calibre shells struck the Bretagne {{at the same}} time. The first detonated {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> mast, igniting some {{ready-to-use}} anti-aircraft projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti-aircraft mounts. The second went through the central 138 mm casement, exploding deep inside the ship. A fire started, with leaking oil burning next to the ship. In about thirty seconds, the ship rolled and exploded.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tripods</b> is a {{television}} adaptation of John Christopher's <b>The</b> <b>Tripods</b> series of novels. It was jointly {{produced by the}} BBC in the United Kingdom and the Seven Network in Australia. The music soundtrack was written by Ken Freeman.|$|R
50|$|When the BBC {{made the}} {{television}} series of <b>The</b> <b>Tripods</b> in <b>the</b> 1980s, they departed from Christopher's description. The Masters somewhat resembled <b>the</b> <b>Tripods</b> they drove. This makes <b>the</b> <b>Tripods</b> seem {{much more like}} mecha than purely eccentric vehicles. In the BBC serial, the Masters {{did not need to}} eat, sleep or drink. Additionally, they were not the rulers of the city, but were, in turn, under the rule of beings made of pure energy, known as Cognoscs. The Masters came from a planet named Trion that was {{in the center of a}} triple star system.|$|R
5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> foremast behind the forward funnel with <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing the smoke from the forward funnel.|$|E
5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel {{and a number of other}} prisoners. As <b>the</b> <b>Tripod</b> selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out the pins. <b>The</b> <b>Tripod</b> is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the other prisoners, making it out alive.|$|E
5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E

Developed under the fictional [...] "Rhodes Project", the 135-ton mechs closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>tripods</b> in <b>the</b> Steven Spielberg film, except that their legs are more squat and robust.

5|$|The ferry {{scene was}} filmed in the New York town of Athens, and Mary Ann's parents' house {{was located in}} Brooklyn (but was {{featured}} in the film in Boston). For the neighborhood plane crash scene, the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747, with transportation costs of $2 million, destroyed it into pieces, and built houses around them. The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back-lot tour. Ray's house was filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey (with a soundstage doubling the interior); meanwhile, the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington, Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California. The scene where <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck, Connecticut at the since dismantled Naugatuck Chemical. The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor, Connecticut by a second unit using a stand in for Dakota Fanning (the back of her character) with the portion showing {{the faces of the}} credited actors cut in later. Some filming was shot on the Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island, NY. The film used six sound stages, spread over three studio lots.|$|E
25|$|Seeing that Phi Sigma Pi {{had always}} placed {{exceptional}} emphasis on scholarship – the premise being that good teachers were also good scholars – {{it was suggested}} that an honor fraternity which stressed scholarship, leadership, and fellowship would preserve <b>the</b> <b>tripod,</b> while creating new opportunities for expansion.|$|E
25|$|During a {{modernisation}} {{starting in}} 1949, the aft 4.7-inch gun turret {{and the depth}} charge throwers were removed, with the freed-up deck space used to install a Squid anti-submarine mortar. The quadruple pom pom was exchanged for two 40mm Bofors in a twin mounting. The radar suite was upgraded, requiring that <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> radar mast be replaced with a stronger lattice structure.|$|E

25|$|Hesiod {{mentions}} {{a poetry}} contest at Chalcis in Euboea where {{the sons of}} one Amphidamas awarded him a tripod (Works and Days 654–662). Plutarch identified this Amphidamas with {{the hero of the}} Lelantine War between Chalcis and Eretria and he concluded that the passage must be an interpolation into Hesiod's original work, assuming that the Lelantine War was too late for Hesiod. Modern scholars have accepted his identification of Amphidamas but disagreed with his conclusion. The date of the war is not known precisely but estimates placing it around 730–705 BC, fit the estimated chronology for Hesiod. In that case, <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> that Hesiod won might have been awarded for his rendition of Theogony, a poem that seems to presuppose the kind of aristocratic audience he would have met at Chalcis.|$|E
25|$|On USS Atlanta, {{over 500}} {{high-speed}} cameras {{on the ship}} recorded {{the effects of the}} blast. During the tests, the ship was manned by a 169-man navy crew and 60 scientific personnel who remained below deck. In spite of the topside damage, the crew below deck experienced only a shock equivalent to a nine gun 16-inch salvo from an Iowa-class battleship. Had there been personnel in the superstructures, they would have been violently thrown about. Topside, the SPS-37 and SPS-10 antennas as well as the URD-4 radio direction finder were torn off by the blast, while other structures were severely deformed. The AN/SPG-51 Tartar guided missile radar was put out of operation for one hour. While the anti-submarine ASROC launcher and Mark 32 torpedo tubes were damaged, the rockets and Mark 44 and Mark 46 torpedoes inside were intact. The Mark 25 torpedo tube was severely damaged, aluminum casting cracked, hold down bolts elongated, the insulating blanket destroyed and the muzzle door sprung, but surprisingly, the tube remained operational. <b>The</b> <b>tripod</b> mast carrying electronics gear was destroyed and fell to the deck. On the blast side, components of the hardened deck house sustained a permanent 2 inch deflection. The entire DLG 16 deck-house between two levels was blown in after welds were ruptured.|$|E
500|$|All except Gunner Gasson were {{stationed}} in the fire control top located {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> foremast. [...] Gasson was stationed in 'Q' turret itself. When the magazine exploded he was somehow thrown clear of the ship.|$|E

Superman picks up a cannon and beats a tripod with it. As he finishes off the Martian inside, <b>the</b> four remaining <b>tripods</b> walk to Metropolis. Lois meets up with Lex and they retreat to Lex's laboratory. Earth's forces are being massacred until Superman joins the fight in Metropolis. Superman fights <b>the</b> <b>tripods</b> as best he can, but is subdued by another alien weapon, the black smoke. <b>The</b> <b>tripods</b> capture Lois, blast Clark with their heat ray and imprison him.|$|R

500|$|Twelve {{obsolete}} [...] Hotchkiss M1914 {{machine guns}} were carried in six twin mounts. Two mounts were {{on top of}} the bridge, two atop the after boiler room ventilator housing and two just forward of <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> mainmast. 48,000rounds were provided for them. They were removed shortly after Pluton was commissioned in 1932.|$|E
500|$|Mahan had {{a tripod}} {{foremast}} and a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> foremast was constructed without nautical rigging.

500|$|Much {{has also}} been said about various [...] "tactical errors" [...] made by both the German and American forces in the film's climactic battle. Spielberg responded, saying that in many scenes he opted to replace sound {{military}} tactics and strict historical accuracy for dramatic effect. Some other technical errors were also made, often censored, including the mistaken reversed orientation of the beach barriers; <b>the</b> <b>tripod</b> obstructions with a mine at the apex.|$|E
500|$|Barham was {{completed}} with two fire-control directors fitted with [...] rangefinders.

Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by 'B' turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted {{on each side of the}} compass platform on the foremast once they were fitted in July 1917.|$|E
500|$|Longtime Spielberg {{collaborator}} John Williams {{composed the}} music score of War of the Worlds. It {{was the first}} time Williams had to compose with an incomplete Spielberg film, as only the first six reels, totalling sixty minutes, were ready for him to use as reference. He considered the score [...] "a very serious piece," [...] which had to combine [...] "necessary frightening atmosphere" [...] with [...] "propulsively rhythmic drive for the action scenes" [...] – the music would be symbolically [...] "pulling forward" [...] vehicles in chase scenes such as Ray driving out of Bayonne or <b>the</b> <b>Tripod</b> attacking the Hudson ferry. Williams added small nods to classic monster movie scores by having orchestras doing a [...] "grand gesture" [...] in scenes overlooking Tripods. To increase the scariness, Williams added a female chorus with a crescendo resembling a shriek – which would [...] "humanize" [...] the track representing [...] "victims that go out without saying an 'ouch' – they're gone before they can say that" [...] – for <b>the</b> <b>Tripod</b> attacks, and a nearly inaudible male choir – which Williams compared to [...] "Tibetan monks, the lowest known pitch our bodies can make" [...] – for the aliens exploring the basement. The only deviation from orchestras were electronic sounds for the opening and closing narrations.|$|E
