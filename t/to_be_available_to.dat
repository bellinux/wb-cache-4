5|$|There {{were two}} friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary {{was founded in}} the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh {{sometime}} before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a school that was not purely a song school for the cathedral but was also <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> provide an education in music and reading for some children of Elgin.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{suggested}} that Congress should charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10million, one-fifth {{of which would}} be handled by the Government. Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments. The rest was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> individual investors. The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction. Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.|$|E

Seven regional European Hallmark Channels broadcast it, with other showings on NRK in Norway, RÚV in Iceland, YLE in Finland, Rai Tre in Italy and één in Flanders. The Australian rights {{were picked up}} by the Seven Network, although the ABC aired seasons 1 and 2 in 2011 and season 3 late in 2012, with TVNZ buying it for New Zealand.

25|$|On the {{borrowing}} end, after 10–20 years, the S 500 corporations {{become extremely}} accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, {{which are very}} stable. Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit, that was guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> them as they needed it, but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least 60 days out of the year.

25|$|Despite {{his move}} away from close {{reliance}} on the imperial family and its connections, John's court and government had many similarities to that of his father, not least in its serious tone and piety. Indeed, an extant collection of political advice couched in poetic form, called the Mousai, are attributed to Alexios I. The Mousai are addressed directly to John II and exhort him, amongst other things, to maintain justice during his reign and a full treasury.
