5|$|In late 2004, a man {{allegedly}} gave Murray's {{father a}} rusty, stained knife {{that belonged to}} the man's brother, who had a criminal past and lived {{less than a mile from}} where the car was discovered. His brother and his brother's girlfriend were said to have acted strangely after the disappearance, and the man's brother claimed he believed <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> had been used to kill Murray. Several days after <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> was given to Fred Murray, the man's brother allegedly scrapped his Volvo. Family members of the man who turned in <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> claimed he had made up the story in order to obtain reward money in the investigation, and that he had a history of drug use.|$|E

5|$|The Benchmade factory {{version was}} sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 {{depending}} on blade length.

However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|E
60|$|And hence I gather, {{that the}} Light {{which makes the}} Fringes upon the Paper {{is not the same}} Light at all {{distances}} of the Paper from <b>the</b> <b>Knives,</b> but when <b>the</b> Paper is held near <b>the</b> <b>Knives,</b> <b>the</b> Fringes are made by Light which passes by the edges of <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> at a less distance, and is more bent than when the Paper is held at a greater distance from <b>the</b> <b>Knives.</b>|$|R

5|$|The CQC-6 (Close Quarters Combat— Six) or Viper Six is a {{handmade}} tactical {{folding knife}} with a tantō blade manufactured by knifemaker Ernest Emerson. Although initially reported as the sixth design in an evolution of fighting knives {{and the first}} model in the lineup of Emerson's Specwar Custom Knives, Emerson later revealed that <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> was named for SEAL Team Six. It has a chisel-ground blade of ATS-34 or 154CM stainless steel and a handle made of titanium and linen micarta. The CQC-6 is credited as <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> that popularized {{the concept of the}} tactical folding knife.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these changes}} <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> was true to Emerson's {{original}} design, {{and even though}} it did not have the craftsmanship of a handmade piece of cutlery it satisfied customers with their own version of Emerson's work at a lower price point and without the five-year wait.|$|E

60|$|Obs. 9. When the Rays fell very obliquely {{upon the}} Ruler at the {{distance}} of the third Part of an Inch from <b>the</b> <b>Knives,</b> <b>the</b> dark Line {{between the first and second}} Fringe of the Shadow of one <b>Knife,</b> and <b>the</b> dark Line between the first and second Fringe of the Shadow of <b>the</b> other <b>knife</b> met with one another, at {{the distance of}} the fifth Part of an Inch from the end of the Light which passed between <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> at <b>the</b> concourse of their edges. And therefore {{the distance of the}} edges of <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> at <b>the</b> meeting of these dark Lines was the 160th Part of an Inch. For as four Inches to the eighth Part of an Inch, so is any Length of the edges of <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> measured from <b>the</b> point of their concourse to the distance of the edges of <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> at <b>the</b> end of that Length, and so is the fifth Part of an Inch to the 160th Part. So then the dark Lines above-mention'd meet in the middle of the Light which passes between <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> where they are distant the 160th Part of an Inch, and the one half of that Light passes by the edge of one Knife at a distance not greater than the 320th Part of an Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the Fringes of the Shadow of that <b>Knife,</b> and <b>the</b> other half passes by the edge of <b>the</b> other <b>Knife,</b> at a distance not greater than the 320th Part of an Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the Fringes of the Shadow of <b>the</b> other <b>Knife.</b> But if <b>the</b> Paper be held at a distance from <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> greater than <b>the</b> third Part of an Inch, the dark Lines above-mention'd meet at a greater distance than the fifth Part of an Inch from the end of the Light which passed between <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> at <b>the</b> concourse of their edges; and therefore the Light which falls upon the Paper where those dark Lines meet passes between <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> where <b>the</b> edges are distant above the 160th part of an Inch.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>knives</b> found {{were either}} made from flakes or from small cores. In addition, some knives were hafted {{while others were}} hand held. While <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> have similar {{characteristics}} to scrapers, they were distinguished through morphological analysis. Many of the items found have been heavily worn out and are only fragments of larger tools. <b>The</b> <b>knives</b> {{could be used for}} a number of tasks such as cutting and chopping. Further, wear on <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> can also provide clues for how they were used. “The characteristic of heavy ware coupled with relatively small dimensions of the tools strongly suggests that increased leverage was applied to the edges through a hafted handle.” (Gooding 1981) ...|$|R
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, <b>the</b> combat <b>knife</b> {{was tested}} against <b>the</b> cane <b>knife</b> in eliminating two targets. <b>The</b> combat <b>knife</b> killed both targets with a stabbing speed of 40 mph while <b>the</b> cane <b>knife</b> had a slashing speed of 45 mph {{but failed to}} kill the second target. The edge was given to <b>the</b> combat <b>knife</b> for its flexibility and portability.|$|R

5|$|As the greenstone belts were forming, volcanoes ejected tephra {{into the}} air which settled as sediments to become {{compacted}} into the greywackes and mudstones of <b>the</b> <b>Knife</b> Lake and Lake Vermilion formations. Greywackes are poorly sorted mixtures of clay, mica and quartz that may be derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier. The volcanism took place on the surface and the other deformations took place at various depths. Numerous earthquakes accompanied the volcanism and faulting.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement. The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline {{with the addition of}} a guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages. <b>The</b> <b>knife</b> is not available for purchase outside of NASA.|$|E
60|$|Obs. 8. I {{caused the}} edges of two Knives to be ground truly strait, and {{pricking}} their points into a Board so that their edges might look towards one another, and meeting near their points contain a rectilinear Angle, I fasten'd their Handles together with Pitch to make this Angle invariable. The distance of {{the edges of}} <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> from one another at the distance of four Inches from the angular Point, where the edges of <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> met, was <b>the</b> eighth part of an Inch; and therefore the Angle contain'd by the edges was about one Degree 54: <b>The</b> <b>Knives</b> thus fix'd together I placed in a beam of the Sun's Light, let into my darken'd Chamber through a Hole the 42d Part of an Inch wide, at the distance of 10 or 15 Feet from the Hole, and let the Light which passed between their edges fall very obliquely upon a smooth white Ruler at the distance of half an Inch, or an Inch from <b>the</b> <b>Knives,</b> and there saw the Fringes by the two edges of <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> run along <b>the</b> edges of the Shadows of <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> in Lines parallel to those edges without growing sensibly broader, till they met in Angles equal to the Angle contained by the edges of <b>the</b> <b>Knives,</b> and where they met and joined they ended without crossing one another. But if the Ruler was held at a much greater distance from <b>the</b> <b>Knives,</b> <b>the</b> Fringes where they were farther from the Place of their Meeting, were a little narrower, and became something broader and broader as they approach'd nearer and nearer to one another, and after they met they cross'd one another, and then became much broader than before.|$|R

60|$|Obs. 6. I placed another Knife by this, so {{that their}} edges might be parallel, and look towards one another, and that the beam of Light might fall upon both <b>the</b> <b>Knives,</b> and some part of it pass between their edges. And when the {{distance}} of their edges was about the 400th part of an Inch, the stream parted in the middle, and left a Shadow between the two parts. This Shadow was so black and dark that all the Light which passed between <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> seem'd to be bent, and turn'd aside to the one hand or to the other. And as <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> still approach'd one another the Shadow grew broader, and the streams shorter at their inward ends which were next the Shadow, until upon the contact of <b>the</b> <b>Knives</b> <b>the</b> whole Light vanish'd, leaving its place to the Shadow.|$|R
5|$|Scully and Ritter soon {{discover}} that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, {{who has worked}} as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos of the dying young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but he pulls <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's prints are on <b>the</b> <b>knife.</b> Ritter demands to know how Fellig always seems to be around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is in pain and asks whether he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire spread {{further the}} use of this type of knife. In the Balkans, where it was known as Handschar, such knives were {{regularly}} carried by Ottoman policemen, and it remained in local use also after the end of Ottoman rule. During the Second World War, the knife's name was bestowed on the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), composed of Bosnian Muslims (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic Croat soldiers; <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> also appeared on the division's emblem.|$|E
5|$|The first {{installment}} of the story-based DLC <b>The</b> <b>Knife</b> of Dunwall was praised for its level design, which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas. The modifications to certain abilities, particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game. The story, however, was generally criticized. Polygon noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption, and allowing him to be played as a non-lethal character created a disconnect with the narrative. IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game, lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion. The Brigmore Witches story received a mixed response, with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative, while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as <b>The</b> <b>Knife</b> of Dunwall, and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. However, the gameplay was generally considered an improvement, providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach. PC Gamer appreciated that the levels each had a distinct theme, and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay, while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC, introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players.|$|E

5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. <b>The</b> <b>knife</b> Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
