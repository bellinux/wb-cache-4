40|$|Embryonic trisomy {{leads to}} {{abortion}} or congenital genetic disorders in humans. The most common autosomal chromosome abnormalities are trisomy <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> 13, 18, and 21. Although alteration of gene dosage {{is thought to}} contribute to disorders caused by extra copies <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> genes associated with specific disease phenotypes remain unclear. To generate a normal cell from a trisomic cell {{as a means of}} etiological analysis or candidate therapy for trisomy syndromes, we developed a system to eliminate a targeted chromosome from human cells. Chromosome 21 was targeted by integration of a DNA cassette in HeLa cells that harbored three copies <b>of</b> <b>chromosome</b> 21. The DNA cassette included two inverted loxP sites and a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene. This system causes missegregation <b>of</b> <b>chromosome</b> 21 after expression of Cre recombinase and subsequently enables the selection of cells lacking the chromosome by culturing in a medium that includes ganciclovir (GCV).

The present results shaw the importance of CDKN 2 A on chromosome 9 in NPC development. There was no functional suppression of tumor development in nude mice with microcell hybrids harboring the newly transferred chromosome 9 containing an interstitial deletion at 9 p 21, whereas <b>transfection</b> <b>of</b> CDKN 2 A into the NPC HONEI cells resulted in obvious growth suppression.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{aimed at}} {{identifying}} the genetic events involved in immortalization of ovarian epithelial cells, {{which might be}} important steps in ovarian carcinogenesis. Methods. The genetic profiles of five human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cell lines immortalized by retroviral <b>transfection</b> <b>of</b> the human papillomavirus (HPV) E 6 /E 7 genes were thoroughly characterized by chromosome banding and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), at various passages pre- and post-crisis. Results. In pre-crisis, most cells had simple, non-clonal karyotypic changes. Telomere association was the commonest aberration, suggesting that tolermase dysfunction might be an important genetic event leading to cellular crisis. After immortalization post-crisis, however, the karyotypic patterns were non-random. Loss of genetic materials was a characteristic feature. The commonest numerical aberrations were - 13, - 14, - 16, - 17, - 18, and + 5. Among them, loss <b>of</b> <b>chromosome</b> 13 was common change observed in all lines. The only recurrent structural aberration was homogeneously staining regions (hsr) observed in three lines. FISH and combined binary ratio labeling (COBRA) -FISH showed in two cases that the hsrs were derived from chromosome 20. Clonal evolution was observed in four of the lines. In one line, hsr was the only change shared by all subclones, suggesting that it might be a primary event in cell immortalization. Conclusion. The {{results of the present study}} suggested that loss <b>of</b> <b>chromosome</b> 13 and the amplification <b>of</b> <b>chromosome</b> 20 might be early genetic events involved in ovarian cell immortalization, and might be useful targets for the study of genomic aberrations in ovarian carcinogenesis. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to define specific chromosomal imbalances in ccRCC that could be related to clinical or histologic prognostic factors. Tumors and karyotypes of 89 patients who underwent nephrectomy for ccRCC were analyzed from April 2009 to July 2012. The mean number of chromosomal aberrations was significantly higher (7. 8; P <. 05) in Fuhrman grade 4 (F 4) than in F 3 (4) and F 2 (3. 4) cases. The results were similar, considering separately the mean number of chromosomal losses and gains.

Reverse genetics systems for these orbiviruses with their ten-segmented genome of double stranded RNA have been developed. Initially, two subsequent <b>transfections</b> <b>of</b> in vitro synthesized capped run-off RNA transcripts resulted in the recovery of BTV. Reverse genetics has been improved by <b>transfection</b> <b>of</b> expression plasmids followed by <b>transfection</b> <b>of</b> ten RNA transcripts. Recovery of AHSV was further improved by use of expression plasmids containing optimized open reading frames. Results: Plasmids containing full length cDNA of the 10 genome segments for T 7 promoter-driven production of full length run-off RNA transcripts and expression plasmids with optimized open reading frames (ORFs) were used. BTV and AHSV were rescued using reverse genetics. The requirement of each expression plasmid and capping of RNA transcripts for reverse genetics were studied and compared for BTV and AHSV. BTV was recovered by <b>transfection</b> <b>of</b> VP 1 and NS 2 expression plasmids followed by <b>transfection</b> <b>of</b> a set of ten capped RNAs. VP 3 expression plasmid was also required if uncapped RNAs were transfected. Recovery <b>of</b> AHSV required <b>transfection</b> <b>of</b> VP 1, VP 3 and NS 2 expression plasmids followed by <b>transfection</b> <b>of</b> capped RNA transcripts. Plasmid-driven expression of VP 4, 6 and 7 was also needed when uncapped RNA transcripts were used. Irrespective of capping of RNA transcripts, NS 1 expression plasmid was not needed for recovery, although NS 1 protein is essential for virus propagation. Improvement of reverse genetics for AHSV was clearly demonstrated by rescue of several mutants and reassortants that were not rescued with previous methods. Conclusions: A limited number of expression plasmids is required for rescue of BTV or AHSV using reverse genetics, making the system much more versatile and generally applicable. Optimization of reverse genetics enlarge the possibilities to rescue virus mutants and reassortants, and will greatly benefit the control of these important diseases of livestock and companion animals. </p...|$|R

Results: Flagellin induced anti-sepsis protection through inhibition of inflammation and induction of endothelial proliferation by down-regulating the expression of TLR 3, TLR 4, and IL- 1 RN and promoting the expression of VCAN in mice 24 h post-CLP.
