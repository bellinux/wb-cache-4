5000|$|In the UK, {{the genre}} owes a {{considerable}} influence to [...] "working class literature", which often portrays characters <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> poverty by inventive means, {{while in the}} US, the genre focuses more on middle class characters <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> the emotional and spiritual limitations of their lifestyle.|$|R
5|$|Once {{they have}} been seen by a {{predator}} they commonly <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape,</b> {{but they can also}} use distraction with an ink cloud ejected from the ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{red panda}} include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. If they feel {{threatened}} or sense danger, they may <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> by climbing a rock column or tree.

5|$|Some {{species of}} ant {{are known to}} capture {{termites}} {{to use as a}} fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, Formica nigra captures termites, and those who <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> are immediately seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as Megaponera analis attack the outside the mounds and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some termites and ants can coexist peacefully. Some species of termite, including Nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species. The earliest known association between Azteca ants and Nasutitermes termites date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period.|$|E

She is apprehended by Wren, who rounds up {{the crew of the}} Betty for execution, but they overpower the USM soldiers and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> with Wren in custody. Wren shoots Call, who falls to her apparent death, but she reappears and reveals her synthetic origin. Call orders the Auriga to crash into Earth. On the Betty, Call is confronted by the Newborn; she is saved by Number 8, who ejects it into space.|$|E

5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape.</b> Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{grab hold}} of the {{captured}} Lich as he is transported to the Citadel. Once there, they discover a human figure encased in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting the Citadel and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as the Citadel guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape.</b> One of the Citadel guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg.

5|$|Khan lures Enterprise to {{the space}} station Regula I, and he {{launches}} a surprise attack that disables Kirk's ship. Kirk tricks Khan by using a special code to remotely lower Reliants shields, allowing Enterprise to inflict significant damage. Khan is forced to withdraw to make repairs. Using the mind-controlled Terrell and Chekov as spies, Khan captures the Genesis device and leaves Kirk marooned on Regula I. Spock deceives Khan into thinking that Enterprise is crippled, surprising Khan when Enterprise rescues Kirk and escapes to the nearby Mutara Nebula. Goaded into following Kirk, Khan pilots Reliant into the nebula, where shields and sensors are inoperable. Due to Khan's inexperience with three-dimensional space combat, Enterprise defeats Reliant and Khan is severely wounded. Refusing to accept defeat, Khan activates the Genesis device, intent on killing his foe along with himself. Khan quotes Ahab's words of vengeance from Moby Dick as he watches Enterprise <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, Bilac {{escapes from}} the room {{in which he is}} being held without exiting through the only door. Mulder notices a large drag mark through the dust on the floor, {{discovering}} a hatch leading to the museum's old steam tunnels. While exploring the tunnels, the agents find the remains of the victims and are attacked by a multitude of feral cats. As they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape,</b> they come across Bilac's mutilated body. The two agents make their way out and close the hatch on the pursuing cats. The episode closes with Mulder suspecting that the animal attacks were associated with the burial urn that had been removed against the wishes of the Ecuadorian tribespeople; it is shortly returned to the burial grounds, where the local shaman watches the urn's reburial with jaguar-like eyes.|$|E
5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape.</b> Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E

5|$|Sheldon then tells Rico {{to hurry}} to his hideout, where Rico learns that {{intelligence}} asset Jade Tan has been captured in Panay's military base {{and will be}} tortured and—possibly-summarily executed. Although Rico rescues her and destroys the base, Jade is bundled into a truck and a fleet of gunmen <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> along a frozen lake. A nuclear submarine emerges from the ice, but Rico hijacks the truck and they are airlifted to safety by Kane (Sheldon and Rico's mission handler). Jade later explains that the Roaches, Reapers, and Ular Boys are secretly backed by Russia, China, and Japan, respectively, to bring down Baby Panay, but Rico and Sheldon wonder what the small island has which is so attractive to superpowers. They track down and assassinate the foreign intelligence officers liaising with the factions.|$|E
5|$|The British ships {{set off in}} pursuit, and by 12:50, Sturdee's two battlecruisers had {{overtaken}} the Germans. A minute later, he {{gave the}} order to open fire at the trailing German ship, Leipzig. Von Spee ordered the three small cruisers to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> to the south, while he turned back with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{in an attempt to}} hold off the British squadron. Sturdee had foreseen this possibility, and so had ordered his armored and light cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers. The battlecruisers quickly overwhelmed von Spee's armored cruisers, and destroyed them with heavy loss of life. Dresden, with her turbine engines, was able to outpace her pursuers, and was the only German warship to escape destruction. Lüdecke decided to take his ship into the islands off South America to keep a steady supply of coal available.|$|E
5|$|The ideal age {{to start}} {{training}} dromedaries for riding is three years, {{although they may}} be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a camel will often <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads {{before the age of}} six. Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same camel.|$|E
