5|$|Chris Sabin's jaw {{was broken}} {{in the final}} round match. Sabin needed serious medical {{assistance}} afterwards backstage due to excessive bleeding from the mouth.

He suffered a legitimate back injury, but ended up appearing at the PWG show that Sabin was forced <b>to</b> <b>miss.</b> There, he aggravated the injury further, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> two Ring of Honor shows for which he was scheduled.|$|E
5|$|Hašek's injury {{caused him}} <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> {{the rest of}} the regular season and post-season, despite several rumours that he would return in time for the playoffs. He said that if he were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of $500,000 with bonuses.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effectiveness of two new procedures for improving judgment by increasing sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>missing</b> information. When consumers are insensitive <b>to</b> important <b>missing</b> information, overly extreme product evaluations are formed. However, when consumers are sensitive <b>to</b> important <b>missing</b> information, they form more moderate and appropriate evaluations. Sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>missing</b> information was increased by encouraging consumers to consider their criteria for judgment before receiving product information (Experiment 1) and by asking consumers to rate presented and missing product attributes before providing overall product evaluations (Experiment 2). Both procedures were effective for improving judgment by reducing omission neglect...|$|R

Illness again interrupted Ponsford's English summer, causing him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> the second Test at Lord's. In the final two Tests of the series, the two record breakers—Ponsford and Bradman—combined in two remarkable partnerships.|$|E

5|$|Angelou later gained fame as {{an author}} and a poet, most notably her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. In her fourth autobiography, The Heart of a Woman, she downplays her singing career and assigns little {{importance}} <b>to</b> <b>Miss</b> Calypso. In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD {{during a period of}} customer interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with a feeling for the tradition's roots.|$|E
5|$|As {{successful}} as Kansas' offense was, {{it was the}} Jayhawks' special teams (beating Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer at his own game) that earned them the victory. Kansas blocked one Virginia Tech field goal, and caused Tech kicker Jud Dunlevy <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> another short. Kansas punter Kyle Tucker {{did an excellent job}} pinning Virginia Tech deep in its own end of the field, kicking the ball five times for a total of 250yards, averaging 50yards a punt.

5|$|Beginning {{the tour}} with a duck, Kippax {{recovered}} with 89 at Leicester before contracting a {{heavy dose of}} influenza that forced him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> the next four matches. On his return, he struggled for form, and was not chosen for the first Test. Kippax was the third selector on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax failed in the next two tour matches, so he missed out on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E
