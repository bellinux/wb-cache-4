40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} was to assess whether satisfying basic psychological needs (BPN) in a Portuguese school-based mentoring (SBM) program improved <b>the</b> <b>mentored</b> students' well-being. One uncommon feature of this program was that <b>the</b> <b>mentors</b> were also teachers of the mentees. A two-wave experimental study design was implemented to compare <b>the</b> <b>mentored</b> (n = 157) and non-mentored students (n = 160). Surveys were completed twice, with a 6 -month interval between time points 1 and 2. The results indicate that SBM that was associated with increased support for BPN was the most effective condition for promoting academic well-being, particularly in terms of improving <b>the</b> <b>mentored</b> students' perceptions of their school environment. However, no significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>mentored</b> and non-mentored students were detected regarding personal well-being (e. g., psychological well-being) and social well-being (e. g., peer support). These findings suggest that the balanced support of BPN was important in this particular SBM program.

25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is up to each individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, {{so they have to}} make the decisions together. After the Bootcamp round, <b>the</b> <b>mentor</b> challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to <b>the</b> <b>mentor</b> to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if <b>the</b> <b>mentor</b> wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes. This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge.

40|$|Purpose This paper {{describes}} {{a case study}} where student peer mentors were employed to motivate and assist undergraduates to secure optional professional placement positions. Design/methodology/approach The paper describes the reasons for establishing the project and <b>the</b> recruitment of <b>mentors.</b> It outlines a survey of students who had not undertaken placements the previous year to try to identify the activities that would be most effective {{on the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>mentors.</b> It then describes <b>the</b> <b>mentoring</b> that was conducted. <b>The</b> <b>mentors,</b> together with <b>the</b> placement co-coordinator, devised support ranging from one to one mentoring, drop in ‘clinics’, online support through a social network and large group talks. It discusses the results of this work and evaluates the oral and written responses of both mentors and mentees. Findings Those mentees who took part in <b>the</b> <b>mentoring</b> were typically those who were already enthusiastic about placement opportunities. The majority of students did not take advantage of mentoring support either face to face or online. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>mentoring</b> scheme did not significantly affect the proportion of students seeking or securing placements. However, <b>the</b> <b>mentors</b> themselves gained tremendous benefits from <b>the</b> <b>mentoring</b> scheme in particular developing their communication skills and confidence. Research limitations A thorough survey of potential mentees was not carried out after the project to ascertain the reasons for their lack of engagement. Practical implications There are two separate implications of this project: 1) <b>The</b> <b>mentoring</b> scheme was valuable primarily for <b>the</b> <b>mentors</b> and not <b>the</b> mentees and 2) The level of support provided by the University is not the main factor in the low take up of optional placement opportunities. If such learning opportunities are felt to be sufficiently valuable for the student learning experience they need to be compulsory with appropriate support available – a mentoring scheme might then be of far more value to mentees. Originality/value There is very little published concerning <b>the</b> use of <b>mentoring</b> to facilitate work based learning. Furthermore most published work on mentoring is located in the ‘best practice’ school of pedagogical research where it is implicitly assumed that one must report on the success of an intervention. Frequently it is more valuable to examine more unexpected results of an intervention. This paper however shows much greater benefits achieved by <b>the</b> <b>mentors</b> than <b>the</b> mentees...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop and {{implement}} a mentoring intervention program and determine its effectiveness on completion, grades, and enrollment in courses during the following semester. The focus was on foundation reading courses at a community college. Students in the reading courses were informed that they were a part of a program called New Dimensions that provided mentoring and other support services to participants. Gender, marital status, and ethnicity were the major variables. An experimental design was used in this study. <b>The</b> effects of <b>mentoring</b> on course completion, grades, and retention were examined. Students were identified as potential dropouts or completors using the College Student Inventory (CSI). Students identified by the CSI as potential dropouts were randomly assigned either to a group that received <b>the</b> <b>mentoring</b> intervention program or to a group that did not receive <b>the</b> <b>mentoring</b> intervention program. <b>The</b> results indicated that <b>the</b> <b>mentoring</b> intervention had no effects on completion of the reading courses or enrollment into the next semester (retention). ^ There was a significant effect on grades for those students who received <b>mentoring.</b> <b>The</b> effect that <b>the</b> <b>mentoring</b> intervention and gender had on grades was also examined. Further, <b>the</b> effect of <b>mentoring</b> and marital status on grades was analyzed. In addition, <b>the</b> effect <b>mentoring</b> and ethnicity had on grades was examined. <b>The</b> <b>mentoring</b> intervention produced a minimal effect on grades by gender, however, the results were not statistically significant. <b>The</b> <b>mentoring</b> intervention with single students produced a significant effect on grades. <b>The</b> <b>mentoring</b> of minority students also indicated a significant effect on grades. There was no evidence that mentoring white or married students produced a significant difference on grades in comparison with the nonmentored group of students. ^ Based on the results of this study, mentoring intervention should be funded as an on-going retention strategy. Further research should include larger sample sizes and a wider range of courses. In addition, other variables such as economic factors and academic background should also be investigated. ...|$|R
