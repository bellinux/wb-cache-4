500|$|.....as I {{began to}} research, even I, {{as someone who}} had been paying {{attention}} {{to some of these}} sorts of <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time and was open to alternative explanations, even I was fairly astonished when I put it together, basically by going county by county and finding the criminal arrest records and the jail records in county after county after county from this period of time and seeing that if there had been crime waves, there had to have been records of crimes and people being arrested for crimes. And in reality, it's just not there."There's no evidence that that ever happened. In fact, it's the opposite. The crime waves that occurred by and large were the aftermath of the war and whites coming back from fighting in the Civil War and settling scores with people and all sorts of renegade activity that didn't involve black people at all, but they were blamed for it, and that was then used as a kind of ruse for why these incredibly brutal new legal measures then began to be put in place." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think it's timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and I think that's {{one of the most}} difficult <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E

500|$|Professor Maury Dean {{wrote in}} his book Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia, that the main appeal of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] lay in its teen appeal, {{although}} he understood that at its core, it was addressing {{a very important issue}} of female liberation. Kevin Phinney from Austin American-Statesman commented that with [...] "Express Yourself", Madonna struck out her [...] "Material Girl" [...] persona, there by demonstrating once more that no image of hers is concrete. Based on the lyrics of the song, Ken Blakely of Philadelphia Daily News declared the song as a rare example of good taste and good advice from Like a Prayer. Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post was impressed with Madonna's vocals on the song, complimenting the soul inlfluences. Rolling Stones J. D. Considine called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] an unabashed groove tune and felt that it seemed [...] "smart and sassy, right down to Madonna's soul-style testimony on the intro: 'Come on, girls, do you believe in love?" [...] Don McCleese from Chicago Sun-Times declared the song as {{one of the highlights of}} the album, feeling that it would become anthemic. Sal Cinquemani from Slant magazine, while reviewing Like a Prayer, announced [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the most soulful performance of Madonna's career. He added that the song [...] "turned Madonna's 'Material Girl' image on its head, denouncing material <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little r-e-s-p-e-c-t." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the song consisted of [...] "deep funk" [...] music.|$|E

[...] Landing speed with flaps down was 38mph (61km/h). [...] The machine was advertised as suitable for other engines up to powers of 130hp (97kW) and the de Havilland Gipsy Major was specifically mentioned. [...] Though Cole had by this time withdrawn his financial support, <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short while looked bright for CLW, with talk of an Australian order for 50 Curlews, but they were over extended and went bankrupt. [...] The sole Curlew, registered G-ADYU and built {{at a cost of}} Â£10,000 went to Essex Aero Ltd, also of Gravesend, in the asset sale. [...] It then went to Martlesham Heath and gained its Certificate of Airworthiness on 19 November 1936. It seems to have done little flying after that.

2500|$|Jon {{also said}} that his new band, Jon Oliva's Pain, is {{basically}} Savatage reincarnated, so it could co-exist with the more successful Trans-Siberian Orchestra. He did however state that a one-off anniversary tour featuring Skolnick, Wacholz and other past Savatage members is being planned with Paul O'Neill as a final send off to the band. Zachary Stevens {{has made it clear}} that he will participate in a 25th anniversary festivities with the band. Jon Oliva then said about the band [...] "Well, it's over but it's not over, you know what I mean? It's over right now because no one's doing anything. We haven't disbanded or anything. We have plans to do something in the future." [...] Jon also announced that he is doing [...] "some video compilation stuff, and editing old <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bonus DVD to go with it, that has a ton of live Criss stuff in concert, a lot of backstage frolicking about, and going to castles in Europe".|$|E

2500|$|In the Southern Netherlands (now Belgium and Luxembourg), {{developments}} were different. Under subsequent Spanish, Austrian and French rule, the standardisation of Dutch language {{came to a}} standstill. The state, law, {{and increasingly}} education used French, yet {{more than half the}} Belgian population were speaking a variety of Dutch. In the course of the nineteenth century the Flemish Movement stood up for the rights of Dutch speakers, mostly which were referred to as [...] "Flemish". However, the dialect variation was a serious disadvantage {{in the face of the}} standardised francophonie. Since standardisation is a lengthy process, Dutch-speaking Belgium associated itself with the standard language that had already developed in the Netherlands over the centuries. Therefore, the situation in Belgium is essentially no different from that in the Netherlands, although there are recognisable differences in pronunciation, comparable to the pronunciation differences between standard British and standard American English. In 1980 the Netherlands and Belgium concluded the Language Union Treaty. This treaty lays down the principle that the two countries must gear their language policy to each other, among other <b>things,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> common system of spelling.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} for the West by Atlus USA, {{who had previously}} handled many of the company's earlier titles. Main localization staff included editors Mike Meeker and Clayton S. Chan; and quality assurance staff Scott Williams, Jonathon Reinhold, Kourtnie McKenzie, Allie Doyon and Charles Chaikaew. Compared to previous Atlus titles, which had focused on Japanese culture, Atlus USA had comparatively little work adjusting <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Western audience as the game was set within a North American city environment. Their main issue was with the dialogue, which {{was meant to be}} naturalistic despite some tongue in cheek dialogue, alongside jokes and references that needed adjusting so they would make sense to a Western audience. According to the localizers, the problem [...] " [...] translating the definition, it's translating the intent". A major issue the team faced was with the quotes used in loading screens. While they were apparently all famous quotes, they had been taken from a Japanese book of quotes without any authors being mentioned, in addition to their translation into Japanese sometimes being poor. In the event, Atlus USA went with new quotes to put in their place rather than trying to identify and translate the existing quotes. The quotes used were from multiple sources, including Douglas Adams, George Carlin and Rodney Dangerfield. According to Chan, the main advantage of Catherine compared to other projects was that the situations and characters were ones he and other team members could understand rather than typical fantasy scenarios.|$|E
