500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.|$|E
2500|$|A third helper, a porter, {{had joined}} the two guides, solely to lead the party of five mountaineers down onto the Glacier de Bionnassay in darkness, {{well away from the}} normal route taken by others to reach the Aiguilles de Gouter. This task the porter utterly failed to do, and it was left to Cachat, the guide, to find a {{suitable}} track onto the ice in total darkness. Sunrise found them {{at the edge of the}} glacier, and their useless porter soon departed. Crossing the glacier, they climbed a prominent rock ridge to gain a better view and to ascertain their best route. At first <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> hopelessly at the glaciated slopes towering above them, realising a direct ascent to the summit was impossible. Grove later described it thus: [...] "The ice in all its gaunt blue nakedness [...] raked by showers of grape from overhanging rock". Eventually they determined a sinuous route up through the billowing ice fields and avalanche debris to reach the crest of the ridge running from the Aiguille de Tricot to the summit of their mountain. Cachat led the way, hacking innumerable footholds in the steep ice until, some five hours after leaving the rock promontory, they finally attained the ridge, and found the day well-advanced and the weather deteriorating. Here they rested a while before continuing along the crest with a sheer ice slope dropping to one side and treacherous rocks on the other. By now the weather had changed and a heavy snowfall had begun. The ridge had become more exposed and a strong wind had developed. As each step was cut in the ice, their axes buzzed in the electrically charged air and they were forced to straddle the exposed, razor-sharp ridge as it was now completely impossible to stand. Grove later wrote that their [...] "steel axe-heads gave out something musical in tone, but nevertheless evil to hear, for it told us we were now in the very heart of the thunderstorm".|$|E

50|$|Fiore and DeBlanc wait in {{the motel}} room. The phone contraption begins to ring. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> {{motionless}} at the phone as it rings and rings.|$|R

60|$|For {{the moment}} <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> at the speaker {{as if they}} had not heard aright.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at {{each other}} through a pause, and both faces were flushed and obstinate.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at {{one another}} again. They took things for granted in the most amazing way.|$|E
6000|$|... "But if <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> {{straight}} {{the other}} way?" [...] Mrs. Medwin continued to object. [...] "You can't simply {{go up to}} them and twist their heads about." ...|$|R

60|$|Bentley comes back, {{with his}} {{shoulders}} hanging {{as if he}} too had been exercised to the last pitch of fatigue. He is very sad. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> {{at him as he}} gropes to Percival's chair.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> at him, {{these two}} white-faced brothers, like tiger-cats about to spring. Mr. von Tassen was getting impatient.|$|E
60|$|And yet, and yet <b>they</b> <b>stared,</b> for she {{had spoken}} with a strange {{certainty}} like one who knew the god, and was she not named Star of Amen, and were there not wondrous tales as to her birth, and had not a lotus-bloom seemed to turn to gold and jewels in the hand of this young, anointed Queen who bore the Cross of Life upon her breast? No, nothing would happen, but still <b>they</b> <b>stared.</b>|$|E
60|$|But we {{were all}} of us quite silent now. The {{children}} did not even cry; <b>they</b> <b>stared,</b> wide-eyed, paralysed with fear.|$|E
6000|$|He rises; {{she rises}} too. [...] "Where," [...] she asks him, darkening her large eyes until their {{drooping}} lids almost conceal them--and yet <b>they</b> <b>stare,</b> [...] "where is your false, your treacherous, and cursed wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Jeekie," [...] said Alan with {{a little}} laugh, [...] "but I can't eat off living tables, {{especially}} when <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at one like that. You tell them that to-morrow we will breakfast alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! But I can't {{go about}} alone. I hate these men, <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at me so! I wish I was a man. It's awful to be a woman, don't you think so? Please don't laugh." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the space}} of perhaps two seconds <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> at each other, eye to eye. Then she {{vanished}} into the room.|$|E

6000|$|... (Miss Bailey {{goes down}} off the scales. Her eyes are full of [...] despondency {{although}} she tries to make a brave face of it, [...] forcing a laugh as she joins the women. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> at her with [...] pitying looks and murmur consoling phrases.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Williams is one {{of several}} female Jewish comedians (along with Belle Barth, Patsy Abbott, Rusty Warren and Totie Fields) who traced their [...] "bawdy" [...] {{performance}} style back to Sophie Tucker. The back cover of A Trip around The World is Not a Cruise repeats the anecdote that when they met, Tucker told Williams that [...] "You're me at your age, only better." [...] An echo of Tucker can be discerned when Williams says in her act, [...] "I get broads come in here, they sit {{in front of me and}} <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at me. Everything I do, <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at me. Then they walk out saying, 'She's so dirrr-ty!' If they're so refined how come they understand what I'm saying?" ...|$|R

60|$|A wave {{of panic}} {{passed over the}} vessel, and these rough and hardy men who feared no mortal foe shook with terror at the shadows of their own minds. <b>They</b> <b>stared</b> into the cloud with blanched faces and fixed eyes, as though each instant some fearsome shape might break in upon them. And as <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> there came a gust of wind. For a moment the fog-bank rose and a circle of ocean lay before them.|$|E
50|$|Mellencamp's {{paintings}} from the 1990s—of {{family and friends}} and many of himself—show lone figures isolated frontally against simple, shadowy backgrounds. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> at the viewer or off into space with eyes both tough and vulnerable, projecting intensity akin to Beckmann's self-portraits with his sad, glowering eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is you <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> at and envy," [...] said Margaret, glancing at the splendid woman at her side, whose beauty she knew well over-shadowed her own rarer loveliness, at any rate in a street pageant, as in the {{sunshine}} the rose overshadows the lily.|$|R
60|$|For a {{while there}} was silence. There <b>they</b> stood and <b>stared</b> at the smitten man waiting the end, {{whatever}} it might be. <b>They</b> all <b>stared</b> save Murgh, who fixed his stony eyes upon the sky.|$|R
