40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted gear drives, the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of the gear}} drives can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur gear drives with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the gear drive can be achieved by changing the <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> of basic racks on the pitch lines from the standard <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> coefficient and finally the optimum value of <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> coefficient are suggested for the given spur gear drive that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|R

The flow {{is assumed to be}} isothermal, laminar and incompressible with constant thermo-physical properties. The velocity field, mass flow rate, and entropy generation are investigated for several <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> in combination with several values of pressure drops.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} trans-dental photo-curing {{on the degree of}} conversion (DC) of a resin composite irradiated by a light curing unit operating in different curing modes. Methods: A curing lamp having six different curing modes was used for indirect photo-activation of a Nanocomposite through different <b>thicknesses</b> of <b>tooth</b> tissues. Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to determine DC. Three main experimental groups were formed in accordance with the 0. 5 mm, 1 mm and 1. 3 mm, <b>tooth</b> <b>thicknesses</b> which were further subdivided into six minor groups formed according to irradiation modes. Control groups employed direct irradiation. Results: For each of the six light curing modes, the average DC decreased with increase in intervening <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness.</b> Among the groups, 0. 5 mm had the highest DC mean values, 21. 5 mm group had the lowest mean values (P< 0. 05). The composite resin showed lower DC mean values when irradiated indirectly compared to control direct curing (P< 0. 05). DC mean values for turbo and high light modes were statistically significantly higher compared to Normal, Soft Start, Pulse and Pulse Soft light modes. Conclusions: A Nano-composite resin cured through different <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> has lower DC compared to direct curing. DC decreases with increasing intervening <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness.</b> DC mean values for turbo and high light modes were statistically higher compared to normal, soft start, pulse and pulse soft light modes...|$|R

40|$|Examining three {{bleaching}} systems, this in vivo {{clinical trial}} evaluated {{the relationship among}} tooth sensitivity, light activation, and agent concentration, and it correlated dental sensitivity with <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness.</b> Materials and Methods: Eighty-seven volunteer patients were included. Inclusion criteria were the presence of anterior teeth without restorations {{as well as the}} absence of a previous bleaching experience and absence of non-carious cervical lesions or dental pain. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breastfeeding, a maximum of TF 3 hypoplasia, tetracycline-fluorosis stains, malpositioned teeth, orthodontic treatment, periodontal disease, and/or analgesic/anti-inflammatory intake. Patients were randomly assigned to three bleaching groups: Group A (n= 25) was treated with 15 % H 2 O 2 and nitrogenous-titanium-dioxide and was light activated (Lase Peroxide Lite, DMC, SaoCarlos, Sao Paulo, Brazil); Group B (n= 27) was treated with 35 % H 2 O 2 and was light activated (Lase Peroxide Sensy, DMC); and Group C (n= 35) was treated with 35 % H 2 O 2 (White Gold Office, Dentsply, 38 West Clark Ave., Milford, USA) without light activation. Tooth sensitivity (TS) was self-reported by the patients using the visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline (TSO), immediately after treatment (TSI), and at seven days after treatment (TS 7). In 46 patients, <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> was determined by computed tomography. TSO, TSI, and TS 7 were compared between the A and B groups to determine the effect of concentration and between the B and C groups to determine the effect of light using analysis of covariance. The correlation between <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> and TSI was determined by Spearman Rho test (SPSS 15). Results: Eighty-seven patients were evaluated at baseline, and 61 were evaluated at seven days. Separated by groups, tooth sensitivity, expressed as VAS value at the time points TS 0, TS 1, and TS 7, respectively, were as follows: Group A: 13. 76 +/- 13. 53, 24. 40 +/- 25. 24, and 5. 94 +/- 5. 5; Group B: 15. 07 +/- 18. 14, 42. 4 +/- 31. 78, and 8. 68 +/- 17. 99; and Group C: 10. 80 +/- 14. 83, 31. 51 +/- 29. 34, and 7. 24 +/- 9. 2. Group A showed significantly lower tooth sensitivity than group B at TSI (p= 0. 032). No differences were observed in the tooth sensitivities between groups B and C. No correlation was encountered between <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> and <b>tooth</b> sensitivity immediately after treatment (Rho=- 0. 088,p= 0. 563). The median <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> was 2. 78 +/- 0. 21 mm.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} the impact of optimization of magnification on performance parameters of the variable resolution X-ray (VRX) CT scanner. MethodsA realistic model based on an actual VRX CT scanner was implemented in the GATE Monte Carlo simulation platform. To evaluate the influence of system magnification, spatial resolution, field-of-view (FOV) and scatter-to-primary ratio of the scanner were estimated for both fixed and optimum object magnification at each detector rotation angle. Comparison and inference between these performance parameters were performed angle by angle to determine appropriate object position at each opening <b>half</b> <b>angle.</b> Results: Optimization of magnification resulted in a trade-off between spatial resolution and FOV of the scanner at opening <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> of 90 degrees- 12 degrees, where the spatial resolution increased up to 50 % and the scatter-to-primary ratio decreased from 4. 8 % to 3. 8 % at a detector angle of about 90 degrees for the same FOV and X-ray energy spectrum. The disadvantage of magnification optimization at these angles is the significant reduction of the FOV (up to 50 %). Moreover, magnification optimization was definitely beneficial for opening <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> below 12 degrees improving the spatial resolution from 7. 5 cy/mm to 20 cy/mm. Meanwhile, the FOV {{increased by more than}} 50 % at these angles. Conclusion: It can be concluded that optimization of magnification is essential for opening <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> below 12 degrees. For opening <b>half</b> <b>angles</b> between 90 degrees and 12 degrees, the VRX CT scanner magnification should be set according to the desired spatial resolution and FOV.
