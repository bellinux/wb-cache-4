5|$|On 2 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 {{landed at}} Kuwait International Airport four hours after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 G-AWND, was destroyed, and all {{passengers}} and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|No {{military}} operations {{were conducted by}} NATO during the Cold War. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{also became}} {{involved}} in Operation Granby following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time, and deployed that year in December. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station {{for the families of}} service personnel serving during the Gulf War. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited one of these groups in February 1991.|$|E
50|$|The {{school was}} closed during <b>the</b> 1990-91 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait {{and for two}} months during the 2003 Iraq War..|$|R
5000|$|The Kuwait Fund {{remained}} operational during <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait, and {{was instrumental}} in swaying global opinion to Kuwait's side. While the headquarters were completely ransacked, the Fund regained its operational momentum shortly after the liberation of Kuwait.|$|R
50|$|The Armenian {{population}} {{reached its}} peak of 12,000. But after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasions,</b> <b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500 {{as they left the}} country.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing {{prepared}} to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia {{joined the}} anti-Iraq Coalition. King Fahd, fearing an attack from Iraq, invited American and Coalition {{soldiers}} to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi troops and aircraft {{took part in}} the subsequent military operations.|$|E
50|$|Ferranti Defence Systems started {{development}} of the TIALD pod in the late 1980s. <b>The</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait and <b>the</b> resulting Gulf War saw the TIALD pod rushed into service. In the Gulf War several modified Panavia Tornados and some Blackburn Buccaneers laser designated for unmodified Tornados which carried LGBs. The Buccaneers carried the U.S. Pave Spike designator, which was limited to daylight use.|$|R
50|$|The Iran-Iraq War from 1980 to 1988, <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait, <b>the</b> first Gulf War and {{subsequent}} conflicts all generated {{hundreds of thousands}} if not millions of refugees. Iran also provided asylum for 1,400,000 Iraqi refugees who had been uprooted {{as a result of}} the 1991 uprisings in Iraq (1990-91). At least one million Iraqi Kurds were displaced during the Al-Anfal Campaign (1986-1989).|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} was formed {{as part of}} the buildup of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army after <b>the</b> Yom Kippur War. It appears to have seen its first action in <b>the</b> initial <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Khuzestan, which began the Iran-Iraq War. It fought in several battles in 1980-81, but then was so badly beaten in the First Battle of al-Basrah (Operation Ramadan), in July 1982, that it was disbanded. The 9th Division was <b>the</b> only <b>Iraqi</b> division to be disbanded without being reformed during the war.|$|R
25|$|As of 1983 {{the branch}} {{was led by}} Faisal al-Sani. The Kuwaiti Ba'ath Party branch {{collapsed}} during Gulf War because of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. Saleh al-Mutlaq, {{the leader of the}} Iraqi National Dialogue Front, has been accused of trying to rebuild the party.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{year after}} the 37th TFW saw combat in Panama, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the 415th TFS of the 37th TFW was deployed to King Khalid International Airport, Saudi Arabia on 19 August to provide air defense over the Saudi capital of Riyadh.|$|E
25|$|One of Brandt's last public {{appearances}} was in flying to Baghdad, Iraq, to free Western hostages held by Saddam Hussein, following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in 1990. Brandt secured {{the release of}} a large number of them, and on 9 November 1990, his airplane landed with 174 freed hostages on board at the Frankfurt Airport.|$|E
50|$|Kuwait had 143 Chieftains {{on the eve}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. Thirty-seven Chieftains of the Kuwaiti 35th Armored Brigade fought at the Battle of the Bridges against {{elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Hammurabi and Medina divisions before withdrawing over the Saudi border. None of the brigade's tanks {{were lost in the}} battle, and the 35th Armored Brigade (known as Al-Fatah) became part of Joint Command Forces East during the 1991 Gulf War and was able to return into Kuwait undefeated.|$|R
50|$|Iraqi Airways {{was founded}} in 1945 {{and is a member}} of the Arab Air Carriers Organization. They {{operated}} the first flight on 29 January 1946, ever since they expanded into a global airline covering a wide network of destinations in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America prior to the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war as well as <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait, ensuing sanctions brought the airline's services to a halt, random charters for Hajj were operated in defiance during the 90s.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Kuwait {{allegedly}} put off {{a planned}} visit by Mahmoud Abbas, then {{the number two}} PLO official after Arafat. Palestinian officials denied reports that this was because he would not apologize for Arafat's support for <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. However, on December 12, 2004, Abbas, now the Palestinian leader, apologized for the PLO's support of Saddam Hussein during the invasion. On the first visit to Kuwait by a top Palestinian official since the invasion by Iraq, Abbas said: [...] "I say we yes, we apologize over our stand towards Kuwait." ...|$|R
25|$|Khuzestan is ethnically diverse, {{home to many}} {{different}} ethnic groups. This has a bearing on Khuzestan's electoral politics, with ethnic minority rights playing {{a significant role in}} the province's political culture. The province's geographical location bordering Iraq and its oil resources also make it a politically sensitive region, particularly given its history of foreign intervention, notably <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> 1980.|$|E
25|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in August 1990 {{had put the}} Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.|$|E
25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was {{the focus}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, leading to the flight of {{thousands}} of the province's residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling the Iraqi military's advance, and ultimately opening a window of opportunity for an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|E
50|$|The Armenians in Kuwait {{are people}} of Armenian descent living in Kuwait. As of 2013, {{there has been}} a large {{population}} increase and now the Armenians number 6,000. Before the Gulf War, the Armenian population reached its peak of 12,000. But after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasions,</b> <b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> the Armenians resident in Kuwait greatly diminished to just 500 as they left the country.|$|R
5000|$|Following <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait, SF teams {{worked with}} the Kuwaiti resistance. When they can direct, using long-distance secure communications, air and missile strikes on targets, the guerrillas need not risk their limited {{resources}} in raids and ambushes. While U.S. special operations doctrine had conceived of guiding strikes, that was seen as being done directly by SF specialists. The evolving model would have SF UW trainers teach the guerrillas how to guide strikes against targets. Separating the means of destruction from the guerrillas not only makes them safer, but avoids the problem of [...] "blowback" [...] if the guerrillas later turn against the U.S.|$|R
2500|$|The {{capture of}} al-Yaarubiyah {{was hailed as}} great success by the PYD, but was also welcomed by the Kurdish National Council, a local {{political}} opponent of the PYD. Similarly, Syrian pro-government media reported {{the defeat of the}} Islamist rebel forces at al-Yaarubiyah with satisfaction. The Syrian National Coalition, however, another Syrian opposition group and rival of the PYD, condemned the YPG for expelling the [...] "Free Syrian Army" [...] from the town, even though no FSA forces had been present during the battle. In contrast, the Ahrar al-Jazeera Brigade took an intermediate stance, and officially denounced <b>the</b> purported <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> al-Yaarubiyah, {{while at the same time}} trying to negotiate a power-sharing deal with the YPG.|$|R
25|$|Between {{the autumn}} of 1980 and the summer of 1990, the number of {{aircraft}} in the IQAF went from 332 to over 1000. Before <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, the IQAF had expected 16 modern Dassault Mirage F.1EQs from France and were also {{in the middle of}} receiving a total of 240 new aircraft and helicopters from their Eastern European allies. When Iraq invaded Iran in late September 1980, the Soviets and the French stopped delivery of additional aircraft to Iraq but resumed deliveries a few months later.|$|E
25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait, on August 2, 1990 an Iraqi Air Force Sukhoi Su-22 {{from the}} No.109 Squadron (based at as-Shoibiyah AB) fired a single Kh-25MP anti-radar variant against a Kuwaiti MIM-23B I-HAWK SAM site at Bubiyan Island that had earlier downed another Su-22 {{from the same}} unit and a MiG-23BN from the 49th Squadron. This forced a radar {{shutdown}} on the HAWK. The HAWK battery (which was operated by some American contractors) was later captured by Iraqi special forces and found out to be in automatic mode of operation, after the contractors fled.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 {{billion in}} support of Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq War. However, Saudi Arabia {{condemned}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in 1990 and asked the US to intervene. King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government {{and many of its}} citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments' support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the company {{encountered}} financial problems. The Shuttle's core passengers chose it for its convenience, not its costly luxury features, {{and during the}} prolonged labor strike at Eastern Shuttle many defected to the competing Pan Am Shuttle or to Amtrak's Metroliner service. In late 1989 the U.S. Northeast entered an economic recession which depressed demand, while <b>the</b> August 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait caused jet fuel prices to double.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and {{occupation}} <b>of</b> Kuwait was unanimously condemned by all major world powers. Even countries traditionally {{considered to be}} close Iraqi allies, such as France and India, called for immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Several countries, including the USSR and China, placed arms embargoes on Iraq. NATO members were particularly critical of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> occupation of Kuwait and by late 1990, the United States had issued an ultimatum to Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait by 15 January 1991 or face war.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1989, Midway Airlines {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} a hub operation at Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for $100 million along with $100 million worth of DC-9 jets from the bankrupt Eastern Air Lines. [...] The company began hub operations in Philadelphia in November 1989. [...] However, {{less than a year}} later, competition with the US Airways Philadelphia hub, coupled with rising jet fuel prices following <b>the</b> August 1990 <b>IraqI</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait, caused <b>the</b> company to quit its Philadelphia hub. In October 1990 it sold its Philadelphia assets to USAir for $67.5 million.|$|R
25|$|Ze'evi later {{advocated}} the population transfer by agreement of 3.3 million {{residents of the}} West Bank and Gaza to Arab nations. He believed this could be accomplished by making life difficult, so they would relocate on their own, through {{use of military force}} during wartime, or by agreement with Arab nations. In July 1987, Ze'evi presented his ideas at a forum in Tel Aviv, describing the plan as a voluntary transfer {{and the only way to}} make peace with the Arabs. After <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait in 1990, Ze'evi proposed transferring Palestinians to the east side of the Jordan River to serve as a buffer zone against any Iraqi attempt to attack Israel.|$|E
25|$|A {{detachment}} of three Nimrod MR2s was deployed to Seeb in Oman in August 1990 {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait, carrying out patrols over the Gulf of Oman and Persian Gulf. Due to the level of threats present in the Gulf theatre, operational Nimrods were quickly retrofitted with a Marconi-towed active decoy. Once hostilities commenced, the Nimrod detachment, by now increased to five aircraft, concentrated on night patrols, with daylight patrols carried out by US Navy Lockheed P-3 Orions. Nimrods were used to guide Westland Lynx helicopters and Grumman A-6 Intruder attack aircraft against Iraqi patrol vessels, being credited with assisting in sinking or damaging 16 Iraqi vessels.|$|E
25|$|In August 1990, Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet was {{deployed}} to Bahrain {{in order to}} serve as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (ComUSNAVCENT) following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. Since ComUSNAVCENT operated from onboard ship, he established NAVCENT-Riyadh as a staff organization to provide continuous Navy representation at United States Central Command headquarters. This mission was assigned initially to Commander, Carrier Group Three. During succeeding months, the NAVCENT-Riyadh staff was augmented substantially but remained small, relative to the United States Army Central and CENTAF staffs. In November, the NAVCENT-Riyadh command was transferred from COMCARGRU 3 to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5. This change resulted in the Navy flag officer at NAVCENT Riyadh's remaining relatively junior to other Service representatives, particularly the Air Force.|$|E
5000|$|Al-Ameeri opposes {{forgiving}} Iraq's debt. The debt, {{estimated at}} $16 billion, represents loans Kuwait made to Baghdad in the Saddam Hussein era, mostly during the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war. Al-Ameeri argues that, [...] "The debt owed by Iraq to Kuwait {{is the right}} of the Kuwaiti people and no one has the right to negotiate over them." [...] Al-Ameeri believes that the Kuwaiti voices calling to forgive the debt and compensation [...] "should not be heeded and they do not represent the Kuwaiti people." [...] He further opposes the debt forgiveness because Iraq has considerable oil wealth and because the, [...] "Kuwaiti people shed their blood" [...] during <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. [...] "The issue is a red line for Kuwait and no Kuwaiti will ever concede these loans," [...] Al-Ameeri has been quoted as saying.|$|R
50|$|Haberman {{began his}} {{association}} with The New York Times as a copy boy in 1964 and then as City College of New York correspondent. He then worked at the New York Post, returning to the Times in 1977. His assignments included staff editor of the Week in Review section; Metro reporter; City Hall bureau chief; and, from 1982 to 1995, foreign correspondent in Tokyo, Rome, and Jerusalem.Over the years, he covered such major events as the Attica prison rebellion in 1971, the fall of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in 1986, South Korea's pro-democracy uprising in 1987, the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait and 1991 Persian Gulf War, the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians, the rise of Islamic terrorism in the Middle East and {{the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks in 2001.|$|R
25|$|In 1990, Frank Lorenzo {{was forced}} to retire after 18 years {{at the helm of}} Texas International and later Texas Air and Continental Airlines, selling the {{majority}} of his Jet Capital Corporation to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). According to William F. Buckley, in his September 17, 1990 article on National Review, the sale to SAS was conditioned on Lorenzo leaving the company. On December 3, 1990, Continental filed for its second bankruptcy, due to Lorenzo dedicating himself almost full-time to Eastern Air Lines acquisition and labor relations issues, <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait and <b>the</b> resultant Gulf War had prompted a dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel, and People Express had been highly leveraged {{at the time of its}} merger with Continental. In addition to Lorenzo embarking on deals which saddled the airline with other carriers' debts, he also began consolidating the different airlines into one system. That resulted in a fleet comprising numerous aircraft types and liveries.|$|R
