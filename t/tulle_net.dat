40|$|Purpose: This garment was {{inspired}} initially by rolls of dust-covered fabric found in closets as I was cleaning out the sewing lab on campus. I {{was inspired}} by the array of colors and immediately thought of the CWU Pride Week and the beautiful colors seen during the week’s events. Process: Once I found the fabric and knew what to create, I thought of a student who had presented a project on drag in a class and knew immediately he would be my model and muse for the design. Focusing on the scale and proportion of the garment in relation to the body was essential for a successful final product. Scale is the relationship of sizes {{to each other and to}} the whole regardless of shapes, whereas proportion is the comparative relationship of not only sizes but also distances, amounts and parts. The array of colors used in the garment are very busy, therefore a simple design was used to balance the color intensity. Techniques: This garment was created with the draping method. The garment was draped, trued and transferred to a paper pattern. Three samples were made and several changes were made. Working with the thin fabric and all the panels posed a new challenge to assure that they were all even and balanced. Twenty yards of net and tulle was used to create the full under layer of skirting. Materials: Woven exterior, acetate plain weave lining, <b>tulle,</b> <b>net,</b> thread, grommets, ribbon...|$|E
50|$|Decorative {{ornaments}} {{can also}} be made from <b>tulle</b> <b>netting.</b> It is frequently used to wrap up party favors and gifts, especially for weddings and baby showers. Scraps of <b>tulle</b> <b>netting</b> are sometimes used in quilting and crafts as well, to add texture to a project. Multicolored <b>tulle</b> <b>netting</b> is often used for this purpose, to create tulle flowers and other ornamental accents.|$|R
50|$|The {{name comes}} from Tulle, a city in the {{southern}} central region of France. Tulle was well known as a center of lace and silk production in the 18th century, and early <b>tulle</b> <b>netting</b> probably originated in this French city. <b>Tulle</b> <b>netting</b> certainly appeared earlier in Parisian ballet costume than in most other nations, suggesting that <b>tulle</b> <b>netting</b> {{may have been more}} readily available there than elsewhere.|$|R

40|$|In this study, it {{was aimed}} to {{determine}} the adaptation capability to controlled conditions, reproductive behaviors, and production of Aphanius mento caught from Kirkgoz Springs, Antalya. Fish material for broodstock were caught using fine mesh <b>tulle</b> <b>net</b> and bag net with 2. 5 mm mesh size. Twenty five female and 10 male breeding fish acclimated to experimental conditions in Aquarium Department Unit of Ministryof Food, Agriculture and Livestock Mediterranean Fisheries Research Production and Training Institute were spawned by providing egg collectorsto the tank. Aphanius mento eggs were spherical, transparent and sticky. Examination with the microscope revealed that the eggs were fullof pale yellow egg yolk with 7 - 8 lipid droplets and had fibrous sticking filaments on the surface. The average egg diameter was 1. 59 ± 0. 50 mm(n= 8). Hatching were observed at 11 th day at 22. 5 ± 1. 0 ºC water temperature whereas at 8 th day at 27. 0 ± 0. 45 ºC. Total length of newly hatchedlarvae was 5. 1 ± 0. 07 mm, and swimming were competed at 4 th day. Average size of one-week larvae was 5. 6 ± 0. 2 mm. At this stage fins werefully developed, the larvae were able to swim freely and take exogenous food. Mean length of the fish was 2. 7 ± 0. 2 cm on 7 th month and a juvenilefish had an appearance of morphologically mature fish...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between landscape intensification, the abundance {{and diversity of}} pollinating insects, and their contributions to crop yield, quality, and market value are poorly studied, despite observed declines in wild and domesticated pollinators. Abundance and species richness of pollinating insects were estimated in ten fields of spring oilseed rape, Brassica napus var. SW Stratos (TM), located along a gradient of landscape compositions ranging from simple landscapes dominated by arable land to heterogeneous landscapes with extensive cover of semi-natural habitats. In each field, we assessed the contribution of wind and insect pollination to seed yield, seed quality (individual seed weight and oil and chlorophyll contents), and market value in a block experiment with four replicates and two treatments: (1) all flowers were accessible to insects, self and wind pollination, and (2) flowers enclosed in <b>tulle</b> <b>net</b> bags (mesh: 1 x 1 mm) were accessible only to wind and self pollination. Complex landscapes enhanced the overall abundance of wild insects {{as well as the}} abundance and species richness of hoverflies. This did not translate to a higher yield, probably due to consistent pollination by honey bees across all fields. However, the pollination experiment showed that insects increased seed weight per plant by 18 % and market value by 20 %. Seed quality was enhanced by insect pollination, rendering heavier seeds as well as higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents, clearly showing that insect pollination is required to reach high seed yield and quality in oilseed rape. Our study demonstrates considerable and previously underestimated contributions from pollinating insects to both the yield and the market value of oilseed rape...|$|E
40|$|Black silk {{mourning}} ensemble {{consisting of}} bodice and skirt. The bodice of black silk is fitted and boned, with a high, standing black silk band collar with appliqued black lace medallions. It has full-length, modified bishop sleeves that gather into the armseye. Below the gathered cap, in the portion {{corresponding to the}} upper arm, the fullness of the sleeve is controlled with top-stitched vertical tucks. From the elbow to the cuff the fullness is again released in a bishop sleeve silhouette. The sleeves gather again into wide black silk cuffs with appliqued black lace medallions and four narrow bands of black velvet ribbon. The bodice front is constructed on {{the lines of a}} bolero jacket, with a deep V-shaped opening and wide ruffled collar which is constructed of horizontally tucked black crepe-patterned silk. The released fullness of the tucking creates the ruffled finish. The ruffled portion is edged with two narrow bands of black velvet ribbon. The bodice front has a bib fill of gathered black silk and <b>tulle</b> <b>net</b> that is secured with hook-and-eyes beneath the left collar overlay. The fill area disguises the true front opening which is secured with thirteen hook-and-eyes. The main body of the bodice, front and back, is constructed of vertically tucked black silk that finishes in a wide black silk waistband which is appliqued with black lace medallions and edged in narrow black velvet ribbon. The waistband laps slightly left of center and secures with three hook-and-eyes. The bodice is fully lined with heavily boned glazed black cotton and has figure enhancing pads sewn over the bust and underarm areas and has a black cotton petersham that hooks at center front. There are two hooks at back waist-level to connect the bodice to the skirt. The matching seven-panel gored skirt is of black silk and has a narrow waistband with center back placket opening secured with three hook-and-eyes. The rear fullness pleats into the waistband and disguises the opening. Two rear hooks at the waistline connect the skirt to the bodice. The full hem is embellished with seven horizontal rows of narrow black velvet ribbon. The hem is faced with black velvet, and there is a built-in bustle pad. There are no labels in the garment. The mourning dress originally belonged to Margaret Louise Walker (b. 1840 -d. 1903), who lived on the Walker Plantation outside of Aberdeen. Mississippi...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common uses for <b>tulle</b> <b>netting</b> is in garments. Tulle is often used as an accent, to create a lacy, {{floating}} look. Tulle may also be used in underskirts or petticoats to create a stiff belled shape. Gowns are often puffed out with the use of several layers of stiff <b>tulle.</b> <b>Tulle</b> <b>netting</b> is also used to make veils, since it obscures the features of the face while allowing the wearer to see out.|$|R

50|$|Agricultural {{products}} include coffee, sugar cane, tobacco, maize, beans, cacao, annatto, tomatoes, vanilla, cotton, and {{a variety}} of other fruits. Tomato production is especially important in El Progreso, representing 6% of the national total. Local craft production includes basketwork, ropemaking, leatherwork, items fashioned from palm, and <b>tulle</b> <b>netting.</b> Sanarate has the greatest economic production in the department, followed by Guastatoya, then San Agustín Acasaguastlán.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of tulle is actually bobbinet, invented in Britain {{in the early}} 19th century. Bobbinet is made by wrapping the weft thread around the warp thread, creating a strong hexagonal design which tends not to twist or fall out of shape, because the wrapped threads maintain a state of tension. The result is <b>tulle</b> <b>netting</b> which is lightweight and surprisingly strong and durable for its weight.|$|R

2500|$|For {{the first}} section, {{inspired}} by the album cover art and Joan of Arc, Phillips created a series of costumes referencing liturgical fabrics and a contemporary exhibition of samurai armor at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The dancing nuns on stripper poles appeared during this section only. Miuccia Prada developed the costumes for the second section, based on rock-n-roll and taking influences from Japanese street fashion. During the Latin influenced third section, Puglisi and Jebran crafted the matador inspired costumes portrayed in the music video of the album's first single, [...] "Living for Love". They used black <b>tulle</b> <b>netting</b> on the pants and paired the dress with a transparent side-paneling and coupled it with a black and fuchsia colored jacket, which had the letter 'M' in Swarovski crystals. Michele's final design had the singer wearing a shawl, flamenco hat, lace, skirts and jacquard bodysuit. Phillips {{was impressed with the}} dress saying that she was [...] "completely blown away. I love [...] hand. His clothes are lyrical and feminine and they tell stories." [...] For the final section, Madonna worked with Scott for party inspired costumes.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and <b>tulle</b> <b>netting</b> on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{resistance}} of Anopheles gambiae s. l. to pyrethroids from spreading too quickly and to lengthen the effectiveness of insecticide impregnated mosquito nets, it has recently been suggested to use mixtures of insecticides that have different modes of action. This study presents the results obtained with <b>tulle</b> mosquito <b>nets</b> treated with bifenthrin (a pyrethroid] and chlorpyrifos-methyl (an organophosphorous) both separately and in mixture on two strains of An. gambiae, one sensitive to all insecticides, and the other resistant to pyrethroids. The values of KDt 50 and KDt 95 and the mortality induced with the mixture of bifenthrin (25 mg/m 2) and chlorpyrifos-methyl (4. 5 mg/m 2) show a significant synergistic effect on the strain of An. gambiae susceptible to insecticides. However, the tested combination does not induce any synergistic effect on the VKPR strain selected with permethrin, but only enhances {{the effectiveness of the}} two insecticides taken separately...|$|R
2500|$|The bridal dress, {{designed}} by the London-based designer Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen, was made of satin and featured an overlaid lace bodice and appliqued skirt. The lace bodice incorporated machine-made lace, sourced from manufacturers in France and Britain. Floral motifs were cut from lengths of these and then appliquéd by hand onto silk <b>net</b> (<b>tulle)</b> by workers from the Royal School of Needlework. The veil was {{held in place by}} a Cartier Scroll Tiara, made in 1936 and lent to her by the Queen. It was purchased by the Queen's father, the future King George VI, for his wife Elizabeth three weeks before his accession. Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II) received the tiara from her mother on her 18th birthday. In order to avoid her tiara falling off, as had happened for Lady Diana Spencer while wearing a Spencer family tiara during her 1981 wedding to the Prince of Wales, Catherine's stylists [...] "backcombed the top [...] to create a foundation for the tiara to sit around, then did a tiny plait in the middle and sewed it on." ...|$|R
2500|$|Kennedy was {{presented}} to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during her father's service as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Her father presented his daughters instead of, more customarily, choosing about thirty young American debutantes, a decision which earned him favor in the press. Kennedy's [...] "slowness" [...] was also unconventional and daring for a debut (two of the queen's nieces remained in a mental hospital because they were mentally ill). Young women would practice the rather complicated royal curtsey, sometimes learning the performance at the Vacani School of Dancing near Harrods. She practiced for hours. She wore a gown made of white <b>tulle</b> with a <b>net</b> train and carried a bouquet of lilies of the valley. Her sister Kathleen was described as [...] "stunning, but {{she was only a}} shadow of Rosemary's beauty." [...] Just as Rosemary was about to [...] "glide off" [...] by stepping to the right, she tripped and nearly fell. Rose Kennedy never discussed the incident and treated the debut as a triumph. The crowd made no sign, the King and the Queen smiled as if nothing had happened, and it is unknown whether Rosemary was aware of her own stumble.|$|R
50|$|The ivory satin bodice was padded {{slightly}} at the hips and narrowed at the waist, and {{was inspired by}} the Victorian tradition of corsetry that is a particular Alexander McQueen hallmark. The bodice incorporated floral motifs cut from machine-made lace, which were then appliquéd on to silk <b>net</b> (<b>tulle)</b> by workers from the Royal School of Needlework, based at Hampton Court Palace. On the back were 58 buttons of gazar and organza, which fasten by means of rouleau loops. The skirt, underskirt trim and bridal train (which measured 270 cm — 110in) also incorporated lace appliquéd in a similar manner. The main body of the dress was made in ivory and white satin gazar, using UK fabrics which had been specially sourced by Sarah Burton, with a long, full skirt designed to echo an opening flower, with soft pleats which unfolded to the floor, forming a Victorian-style semi-bustle at the back, and finishing in a short train measuring just under three metres in length. To partially fulfill the ‘something blue’ portion of the British wedding tradition, a blue ribbon was sewn inside the dress. The design for the bodice of the dress featuring lace {{in the style of the}} 19th Century was the ‘something old’.|$|R
