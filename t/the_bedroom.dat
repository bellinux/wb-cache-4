5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> window.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{situation}} arose outside the apartment. A crowd {{gathered by the}} front door of 5A, including next to the children's bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|E
5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door and called to her brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E

5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. <b>The</b> <b>bedroom</b> had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the video is shot in black-and-white, and shows Derulo sitting {{on the hood of}} a corvette outside a Malibu mansion dressed in 1920s attire. In another scene, Derulo is seen dancing at an area of the mansion which is surrounded by trees. The video then shows intercut scenes in full color of Derulo at the beach, on the mansion's balcony, and in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> with his love interest (played by Tika Sumpter). More scenes in full color, show Derulo on the balcony interacting with her, and also shows him singing to her in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> using a microphone. During another scene, Derulo is seen dressed in all white. The video ends with a kissing scene between the two which then fades away.|$|E
5|$|A man, Cutter (Pablo Coffey), visits an {{open house}} viewing, where he is given a tour by the estate agent, and seems to take an {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> of a young girl. That night, the owners have returned home, and are settling down for the evening when their daughter, Patricia, begins screaming. Later, a security guard for the family's alarm company finds the bodies of the parents hacked to death on the first floor, but Patricia is nowhere to be seen.|$|E
40|$|Field {{testing was}} {{performed}} in a retrofit unoccupied test house in Fresno, California. Three air-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) distribution systems - a typical airflow ducted system to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> a low airflow ducted system to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> and a system with no ductwork to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> - were evaluated during heating, cooling, and midseason conditions. The relative ability {{of each of the}} three systems was assessed with respect to relevant Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) and ASHRAE standards for house temperature uniformity and stability, respectively. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling also was performed and refined based on comparison to field test results to determine the air flow rate into <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> of over-door and bottom-of-door air transfer grilles...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bedrooms</b> {{are named}} mainly after the type or colour of the {{original}} drapery. All <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> except <b>the</b> Lemon Room, have adjoining dressing rooms.

5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side.

He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
5|$|Brynn {{drove to}} the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing, but {{initially}} he did not believe her. The pair drove back to the house in separate cars, and Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called 911 at 6:20a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and committed suicide by shooting herself in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|He {{had shot}} June in her bed, but {{she managed to}} get up and walk a few steps before {{collapsing}} and dying.

50|$|Reached by a {{staircase}} of oak treads, newels, balusters, and handrail with pine risers, {{the second floor}} consisted in 1880 of six bedrooms, two dressing rooms, a bath room, a toilet, and a storage closet. Two of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> were connected by large sliding doors, as with the library and breakfast room beneath; during large parties, these doors would be pulled back and <b>the</b> combined <b>bedrooms</b> {{would be used for}} expanded entertainment space. Over time, the spaces on this level were altered and some of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> were divided into private en suite bathrooms. <b>The</b> royal <b>bedroom</b> is reserved for use by the sovereign and other Royal Family members when they are in Winnipeg, and the gold room accommodates royal support staff or other royals if the monarch is occupying <b>the</b> royal <b>bedroom.</b> Also on this floor is the viceregal suite, consisting of a master <b>bedroom,</b> <b>the</b> lieutenant governor's private office, and a library and living room.|$|R
5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep {{that can be}} addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|Khwabgah was <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> of Shah Jahan. It {{was built}} by Shah Jahan under the {{supervision}} of Wazir Khan in 1634 during his first visit to the city. Five sleeping chambers are aligned in a single row. The chambers feature carved marble screens, and are decorated with inlaid white marble and frescoes, It is the first building built by Shah Jahan in the fort. At present its decorations have vanished except for a trace of the marble which once might have beautified the façade.|$|E
5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{middle section}} (Acehnese: rumah inong, [...] "parental house") {{consists}} of a corridor (Acehnese: rambat) connecting the front section and the rear section {{through the center of}} <b>the</b> house, and <b>bedrooms.</b> Bedrooms are located on both side of this corridor, to the east and west, toward the gables. <b>The</b> east-side <b>bedroom,</b> used for <b>the</b> daughter, is known as anjong. <b>The</b> west-side <b>bedroom,</b> <b>the</b> main <b>bedroom</b> of <b>the</b> household, is known as jurei. <b>The</b> <b>bedrooms</b> can be accessed from the back section via doorways. The entire middle section is built about half a meter higher than the front section and back section, the difference in elevation is clearly visible from the outside of the house. One of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> functions as a ceremonial nuptial chamber, where daughters and their husbands will reside during the first years of their marriage. One can see the middle section as {{the most important part of}} the house, in relation to the lower sections of the male front section and the female rear section, a place for a bedroom where procreation may takes place.|$|R

The bath was placed on a raised platform and stairs were constructed so that the servants could poor water over the bather.|$|R
5|$|Later {{extensions}} {{were installed}} to both 10 Downing Street and the specially constructed Transatlantic Telephone Room within the Cabinet War Rooms. Churchill's office-bedroom included BBC broadcasting equipment; Churchill made four wartime broadcasts from the Cabinet War Rooms. Although the office room was also fitted {{out as a}} bedroom, Churchill rarely slept underground, preferring to sleep at 10 Downing Street or the No.10 Annexe, a flat in the New Public Offices directly above the Cabinet War Rooms. His daughter Mary Soames often slept in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> allocated to Mrs Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 EP Instant 0 in the Universe was {{recorded}} in France, and was Stereolab's first release following Hansen's death. According to music journalist Jim DeRogatis, the EP marked a return to their earlier, harder sound—"free from the pseudo-funk moves and avant-garde tinkering that had been inspired by Chicago producer Jim O'Rourke". That year, Sadier's side-project, Monade, released its debut album Socialisme Ou Barbarie: <b>The</b> <b>Bedroom</b> Recordings. Both {{the name of the}} group and the title of the album are references to the work of Greek-French intellectual Cornelius Castoriadis.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{moved into}} Magomero {{in the early}} evening, while Livingstone {{and his wife were}} {{entertaining}} some dinner guests. The estate official, Duncan MacCormick, was in another house nearby. A third building, occupied by Emily Stanton, Alyce Roach and five children, contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to the local rifle club. The insurgents quietly broke into the Livingstone's house and injured him during hand-to-hand fighting, prompting him to take refuge in <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where his wife attempted to treat his wounds. The rebels forced their way into <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and after capturing his wife, decapitated Livingstone. MacCormick, who had been alerted, was killed by a rebel spear. The attackers took the women and children of the village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt, having reportedly treated them well. It has been suggested that Chilembwe may have hoped to use the women and children as hostages, but this remains unclear. The attack on Magomero, and in particular the killing of Livingstone, had great symbolic significance for Chilembwe's men. The two Mauser rifles captured from the plantation formed the basis of the rebel armoury {{for the rest of the}} uprising.|$|E

50|$|The brass {{double bed}} {{is now in}} <b>the</b> {{northwest}} <b>bedroom</b> and also belonged to the Warkentins. Much of the furniture in <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> is not original to the house. The trunk {{at the foot of}} the bed was used by the Warkentins in their travels.|$|R
50|$|A broad {{flight of}} stairs led to the {{entrance}} of the mansion. There was a large and very lofty hall, which was similar to Leinster House in Dublin. The hall contained plaques and oil portraits. To the right on entering was the library. The drawing room had a southern aspect, and contained several portraits of the Rowley family. The state dining room was detached from the main block and had beautifully covered ceilings. The grand stairs led to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> <b>The</b> handsome mantle in one of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> was formally in a Dublin mansion.|$|R
