Use of precast concrete systems provide various advantages, including minimizing traffic disruption, increasing the quality of the final product, and lowering life-cycle costs. Both the Federal Highway Administration and the Iowa Department of Transportation have recognized the benefits of using precast concrete elements in bridge construction to help reduce the duration of construction projects. This thesis focuses on the laboratory testing of full-depth precast, prestressed concrete deck panels used in the construction of a continuous four-girder, three span bridge over Squaw Creek on 120 th Street in Boone County, Iowa. Various laboratory tests were conducted on a single panel and on two panels connected by a closure pour. These tests ranged from determining physical properties of the panel (compressive strength and <b>prestressing</b> force), <b>to</b> determining the panel 2 ̆ 7 s response in various circumstances (moving with a crane, during field leveling, and under loading).
