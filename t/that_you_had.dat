5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

25|$|It dispelled so many {{myths about}} the {{coaching}} business -- <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to be a yeller and a screamer to win. You {{can be your}} own person, treat people with respect, be very demanding but demanding {{in a way that}} doesn't trample on people. And you don't have to give up your faith to win in the NFL. It confirmed and re-affirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching....|$|E

25|$|Sørvágur {{has always}} been a place where fishery has been very dominant. In older times it was said, that the only thing {{necessary}} for survival in Sørvágur was <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a fishing rod and a pot to cook the fish. The fishing industry also plays a vital role in the industrial environment in Sørvágur today (2005). Today there is a modern fish factory producing mainly salt fish; a fish farm raising salmon; one fish market; one major fish factory ship, which produces fish directly to the British market; 6 smaller fishing trawlers and 50+ small fishing boats.|$|E
25|$|The Gila Trail {{going along}} the Gila River in Arizona, across the Colorado River and then across the Sonora Desert in California was scouted by Stephen Kearny's troops {{and later by}} Captain Philip St. George Cooke's Mormon Battalion in 1846 who {{were the first to}} take a wagon the whole way. This route was used by many gold hungry miners in 1849 and later but {{suffered}} from the disadvantage <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to find a way across the very wide and very dry Sonora Desert. It was used by many in 1849 and later as a winter crossing to California, despite its many disadvantages.|$|E
25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public {{health care and education}} services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|E

25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

Therefore I had Mr. Barber make me a proof of this change, and as this left so much blank space over the top we concluded {{that it would be better}} to put on the motto, [...] "In God We Trust". [...] This change has made a marked improvement in the appearance of the coin.|$|E
500|$|Weeks after {{accepting}} the appointment, Emanuel participated {{on a panel}} of corporate chief executive officers sponsored by the Wall Street Journal and said, [...] "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste." [...] The quote {{was taken out of}} context by some commentators as evidence [...] "...that the left supposedly wants to exploit circumstances to ram its agenda through." [...] Emanuel explained later, [...] "...what I said was, never allow a good crisis to go to waste when it's an opportunity to do things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never considered, or that you didn't think were possible." ...|$|E

[...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a chance to play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E

How would you react to that?" [...] He imagined the character Jigsaw having been given one or two years to live and combined that with the idea of Jigsaw putting others in a literal version of the situation, but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate.|$|E
500|$|With Rhodes {{insisting that}} the band not perform live again until they were much tighter, the Clash rehearsed {{intensely}} over the following month. Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: [...] "We were almost Stalinist in the way <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to shed all your friends, or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before." [...] Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties—"Joe would give me the words and I would make a song out of them", Jones later said. Sometimes they would meet in the office over their Camden rehearsal studio to collaborate directly. According to a later description of Strummer's, [...] "Bernie [...] would say, 'An issue, an issue. Don't write about love, write about what's affecting you, what's important." ...|$|E

Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' At that time, we didn't realize <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|Ponsford was a shy person, on {{the field}} and off. Robinson wrote that Ponsford [...] "was so {{reserved}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to know him for three years or the duration of a Test tour before his reticence relaxed." [...] Similarly, when photographed Ponsford would hang his head so his cap would cover most of his face. This shyness intensified after his retirement. He would often walk along laneways to his work at the MCC, rather than be recognised {{on the way to the}} train station. While on the train, he would cover his face with the newspaper. At work, he disliked interaction with the public and would direct staff to advise visitors that he was not in, despite often being clearly in view. Bill O'Reilly said of Ponsford, [...] "He spoke rarely and even then only if he could improve on silence." [...] Nonetheless he was popular with his teammates and was said to have a droll sense of humour.|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 1976, {{childhood}} friends Sumner and Hook separately {{attended a}} Sex Pistols {{show at the}} Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy his first bass guitar. Sumner later said that {{he felt that the}} Pistols [...] "destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to worship". Inspired by the performance, Sumner and Hook formed a band with their friend Terry Mason, who had also attended the show. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he [...] "knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in".|$|E

500|$|In August 2008, The Straits Times {{said that}} Thumboo's [...] "most {{powerful}} legacy" [...] was [...] "spearheading {{the creation of}} a Singapore literature in English", although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting: [...] "There were not that many people writing in 1965, so you had the feeling <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to create something. But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E

[...] "I got a fortune cookie that said 'Art is your fate, don't debate.' That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco." [...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it in my mind <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to be skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do whatever you want, be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E

After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. Those are my maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and third}} rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, eat. That is my food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, eat. That is the wine that I drink.” “How can I eat after I saw <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> taken your head off and were delousing it, having fixed a horse’s head on yourself?” The ala, after hearing that, ate both the woman and her child.|$|E
