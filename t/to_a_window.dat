Meanwhile, scenes of all the places featured on the video are interpolated. Just as the song begins, Arjona is shown leaving the Tikal ruins on an orange Jeep, as well as images of Moreno singing {{in front of a}} piano. Then, as Arjona abandons the Jeep and goes as a passenger on another vehicle, Moreno is shown singing inside a house, close to another Jeep similar to that of Arjona's. Finally, Arjona reaches the town on which Moreno has been waiting for him, just to find that she is gone to where he has been before, on the Tikal ruins. As of October 2017, the video has received over 520 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|Usually, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of debugging is finding the bug. Once it is found, correcting it is usually relatively easy.

25|$|In the Rhineland, May 1 is also {{celebrated by}} the {{delivery}} of a maypole, a tree covered in streamers {{to the house of}} a girl the night before.

Women usually place roses or rice {{in the form of a}} heart at the house of their beloved one. It is common to stick the heart <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> or place it in front of the doormat. In leap years, it is the responsibility of the women to place the maypole. All the action is usually done secretly and it is an individual's choice whether to give a hint of their identity or stay anonymous.|$|E

500|$|Steve Helling of People {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} Lovato shows her mature {{side in the}} video, saying that [...] "it's hard not to notice that the 16-year-old Camp Rock star is growing up."

As the song progresses, she walks out of the bus in the rain, holding an umbrella. She walks out of the parking lot and into an amusement park, where she stands in front of a carousel in the rain as she continues to sing. After the second chorus, Lovato and her band perform in the rain with the water altering colors in the background. As the last verse approaches, she is back on the tour bus. A single tear rolls down her cheek and the video ends.|$|E

500|$|The {{placement}} of carrel spaces at the periphery {{was the product}} of thinking that began years earlier when Kahn submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. There he dispensed with the traditional arrangement of completely separate library spaces for books and readers, usually with book stacks {{on the periphery of the}} library and reading rooms toward the center. [...] Instead he felt that reading spaces should be near the books and also to natural light. For Kahn, the essence of a library was the act of taking a book from a shelf and walking a few steps <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> for a closer look: [...] "A man with a book goes to the light. [...] A library begins that way. [...] He will not go fifty feet away to an electric light." [...] Each carrel area is associated with two levels of book stacks, with the upper level structured as a mezzanine that overlooks the carrels. [...] The book stacks also look out into the atrium.|$|E
500|$|Coke {{was born}} on 6 May 1754 in London, to Wenman Coke ({{originally}} Wenman Roberts) and Elizabeth Chamberlayne. The Cokes were a landowning family of Derbyshire, originally from Norfolk, Wenman representing Derby {{as one of its}} two Members of Parliament, and as such Coke was born into a wealthy, estate-owning family; one of his first memories was [...] "being held up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> to watch a fox being cornered and killed by hounds". Little is known of Coke's father; Wenman is described as a shy person who [...] "saw little company and lived much out of the world; his habits were those of a country gentleman, bending his mind to agriculture, moderately addicted to field sports and more than either, to reading in which he passed many hours; firm in his principles which were those of the old Whig; amiable in his disposition mild in his manners, he was beloved of his friends". The family's prospects improved significantly when Coke was five, when his uncle, Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, died. The cause of Thomas's death is not certain, although there are chances it was a duel, but the result was that upon the death of Thomas's wife Margaret, Wenman would inherit substantial Norfolk estate, including Holkham Hall, a [...] "Palladian masterpiece". Margaret studiously avoided the rest of the family, vowing to outlive Wenman simply to ensure that he did not inherit the estate.|$|E
500|$|Seemingly broken, {{and again}} {{working on the}} chain gang, Luke stops working to give water to a prisoner. Watched by the {{disappointed}} prisoners, he runs {{to one of the}} trucks to take Boss Godfrey's rifle to him. After Boss Godfrey shoots a snapping turtle, Luke retrieves it from a slough for him, complimenting the boss for his shot. Luke takes one last stab at freedom when he is ordered to take the turtle to the truck. He steals the dump truck, as well as the keys to the other trucks. [...] In the excitement of the moment, Dragline jumps in the dump truck and joins Luke in his escape. Later, after abandoning the truck, Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God and blames Him for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. Dragline walks in and tells Luke that the police and bosses have promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully. But Luke, feeling that his life is no longer worth living, walks <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> facing the police and mocks the Captain by repeating the first part of his speech ("What we've got here is a failure to communicate."). He is immediately shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. Dragline carries Luke outside, then charges at Boss Godfrey and attempts to strangle him until he is beaten and subdued by the other guards. In tears, Dragline implores Luke to live. The local police want to take Luke to a nearby hospital, but the Captain tells them {{to take him to the}} prison hospital instead, a long enough distance that Luke's chances of survival are slim. As the captain's car drives away, it crushes Boss Godfrey's glasses. After Luke's implied death, Dragline and the other prisoners reminisce about him. In the final scene, the prison crew is seen working near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot. Dragline is now wearing leg irons, and there is a new Walking Boss. As the camera zooms out, the torn photograph of Luke grinning with the two women is superimposed on a bird's eye view of the cross-shaped road junction.|$|E
