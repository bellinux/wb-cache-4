5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, <b>toasting</b> friendship and a job well done.|$|E
5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part, along with graffiti and breakdancing. The music is composed of two parts, rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals, and DJing, the production of instrumentation either through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism or beatboxing. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc {{is widely regarded as}} the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him the practice of <b>toasting</b> over the rhythms of popular songs. In New York, DJs like Kool Herc played records of popular funk, disco and rock songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the songs and keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion breaks (the rhythmic climax of songs), thus producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E

5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these spirits are honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially <b>toasting</b> the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E
5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa <b>toasting</b> champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture that the old man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Toasts</b> may be solemn, sentimental, humorous, even bawdy or insulting. The {{practice}} of announcing one's intention {{to make a}} <b>toast</b> and signalling for quiet by rapping on the wineglass, while common, is nonetheless regarded by some authorities as rude. Except in very small and informal gatherings, a <b>toast</b> is offered standing. At a gathering, none should offer a <b>toast</b> to {{the guest of honor}} until the host has had the opportunity to do so. In English-speaking countries, guests may signal their approval of the <b>toast</b> by saying [...] "hear hear." [...] The person honored should neither stand nor drink, but after the <b>toast</b> should rise to thank the one who has offered the <b>toast,</b> perhaps but not necessarily offering a <b>toast</b> in turn.

50|$|When the <b>toast</b> was done, as {{determined}} by a small bimetallic sensor actuated by the heat passing through the <b>toast,</b> the heaters were shut off and the pull-down mechanism returned to its room-temperature position, slowly raising the finished <b>toast.</b> This sensing of the heat passing through the <b>toast,</b> meant that regardless {{of the color of}} the bread (white or wholemeal) and the initial temperature of the bread (even frozen), the bread would always be <b>toasted</b> to the same degree. If a piece of <b>toast</b> was re-inserted into the toaster, it would be only reheated.|$|R
25|$|The Scots Greys, {{along with}} certain other regiments of the British Army, handled the loyal <b>toast</b> differently.

The Scots Greys, however, did not stand for the <b>toast.</b> It is said that this tradition of giving the loyal <b>toast</b> while seated started during the reign of George III.
