40|$|This paper investigates a {{solution}} to an existing federal policy which prohibits the District of Columbia (DC) from imposing commuter <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-residents,</b> a tool which other cities in the US use to address revenue problems associated with high numbers of non-resident workers. DC, which has higher local governance costs per capita than its surrounding suburbs, must impose higher income tax rates to balance its budgets. However, because DC cannot legally levy a commuter tax under existing federal policy, many workers in the region currently “escape ” taxation: as residents of the surrounding suburbs, they pay substantially lower income taxes. Non-residents {{account for more than}} 70 % of DC’s workforce. These workers enjoy costly city services without any substantial remuneration to DC. This scenario has resulted not only in a structural fiscal imbalance for DC, but also one of the highest levels of congestion of any region in the US. A per-vehicle cordon charge may be the answer, internalizing the costs to DC for providing services to non-residents visitors by collecting revenues for the services it provides, while reducing congestion. Here, it is estimated that DC spends $ 3. 50 per visitor per day on city services for nonresidents. Thus, this amount is proposed as the approximate cordon charge per vehicle, to help cover services DC provides such visitors. Electronic toll collection (ETC) technologies allow DC to impose a cordon charge without significant impacts on existing traffic flows. An estimate of ETC costs suggests that implementation could easily be supported by the region, while economically viable for DC...|$|R
40|$|In Razin, Sadka and Yuen (1998, 1999 a), we {{explored}} the policy {{implications of the}} home-bias in international portfolio investment {{as a result of}} asymmetric information problems in which domestic savers, being 'close' to the domestic market, have an informational advantage over foreign portfolio investors, who are 'far away' from the domestic market. However, FDI is different from foreign portfolio investment, concerning relevant information about domestic firms. Through the stationing of managers from the headquarters of multinational firms in the foreign direct establishments in the destination countries under their control, FDIors can monitor closely the operation of such establishments, thus circumventing these informational problems. Futhermore, FDI investors not only have an informational advantage over foreign portfolio investors, but they are also more informed than domestic savers. Because FDI entails direct control on the acquired domestic firm, which the typical domestic savers with ownership position in the firm do not have. Being 'insiders' the FDIers can 'overcharge' the uninformed domestic savers, the 'outsiders', when multinational subsidiaries shares are traded in the domestic stock market. Anticipating future domestic stock market trade opportunities, in advance, foreign investment becomes excessive. However, unlike the home-bias informational problem, which leads to inadequate foreign portfolio capital inflows, but may be correctable by Pigouvian taxes such as <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-resident</b> income, <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> interest income and corporate tax (see Razin, Sadka, and Yuen (1998, 1999 a)), excessive FDI flows under the insider-outsider informational problem call for a non-tax corrective policy. First, because they are governed by unobservable variables (such as the productivity level which triggers default, according to the firm contract with its lender). Second, because there exist self- fulfilling expectations equilibria which cannot be efficiently corrected by taxation. The corrective policy tool that is left available is then simply quantity restrictions on FDI. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} indirect tax harmonization process, {{undertaken by}} the European Court of Justice, and partly fueled by the European Commission, is giving place to a radical transformation of non-resident taxation. The traditional principle derived from international taxation, namely, that residents and non-residents deserve a different treatment as {{they are not in}} the same position, is increasingly being challenged by the Court and the Commission. The reasoning logic of the Court is not always easy to follow. However, it is slowly becoming clear that, {{as a consequence of the}} interaction and common influence of European tax law and International tax law, a “Statute of the EU-based non-resident” is being created. This means, growingly, that non-residents in a given Member State, that are resident in another, have a distinct regime that profoundly shapes their tax liability. This paper intends to assess the functioning of the said regime, in order to help shed some light in what is increasingly becoming a “tax jungle”, where Member States reform their Tax Codes in order to align them with the latest ECJ resolution, while the little coherence left creates ever new loopholes that have then to be closed, such increasing the complexity of the tax systems.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{non-resident}} sports persons competing in South Africa increases so does the need to tax them more effectively. It was {{for this reason that}} the South African legislature decided to insert Part IlIA into the Income Tax Act which regulates the taxation of non-resident sports persons in South Africa. The new <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> foreign sports persons, which came into effect during August 2006, is a withholding tax placing the onus upon the organizer of the event to withhold the tax portion of the payment to the non-resident sportsperson and pay it over to the revenue services. The rate of taxation has been set at 15 percent on all amounts received by or accruing to a foreign sportsperson. The question which the research addressed is whether this new tax will prove to be an effective tax, both {{from the point of view}} of its equity and the administration of the tax. In order to determine the impact of the new tax, it was compared to similar taxes implemented in the United Kingdom and Australia and also to other withholding taxes levied in South Africa. The new tax was also measured against a theoretical model for effectiveness, compared to the pre-August 2006 situation and to the taxation of resident sportsmen and women, using hypothetical examples. The major shortcomings of the new withholding tax are the uncertainty with regard to the intention of the legislature on matters such as the taxation of capital income versus revenue income, the question whether payments to support staff are included in the ambit of the new tax, the taxation of the award of assets in lieu of cash payments and the definition of a resident. A further area of concern is that the rate of taxation of 15 percent appears to be too low and creates horizontal inequity between the taxation of resident and non-resident sports persons. The new <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-resident</b> sports persons may have its shortcomings but, depending upon the administrative and support structures put in place to deal with it, will be an effective tax. The rate at which the tax is levied could result in a less tax being collected than before but, with the reduced administrative cost of tax collection, the effective/statutory ratio of the tax could well be much higher than it was. This is a new tax in South Africa and certain initial problems are inevitable and will undoubtedly be solved as the administrators gain experience and as the case law governing this tax develops.

40|$|The authors examine to {{what extent}} {{features}} of the international tax system and indicators of transaction costs affect the required rates of return on emerging stock markets. They show that the capital gains withholding <b>tax</b> levied <b>on</b> foreign portfolio investors increases required pre-tax rates of return. As countries generally do not index their capital gains taxes, it follows that inflation increases {{the capital gains tax}} base, as well as the required rate of return on equity. Dividend withholding taxes instead appear not to increase the required pre-tax equity returns significantly. The differing results for capital gains and dividend taxes reflect the fact that foreign investors generally can receive domestic tax credits only for foreign withholding <b>taxes</b> paid <b>on</b> dividends. The return on equity is part of the issuing firm's cost of capital. So, capital gains withholding <b>taxes</b> imposed <b>on</b> nonresidents increase the cost of capital for domestic firms and discourage physical investment. Private investment levels have tended to be low in developing countries in the 1980 's. The cost of equity finance in developing countries has gained in importance inthe last decade, as these countries'access to international lending capital has been limited during most of the decade. What do these findings imply for the design of tax policy in relation to foreign portfolio investment in developing countries? The existence of foreign tax credits for dividend taxes paid suggest that a country should tax capital gains more lightly than repatriated dividends - as do Greece, Pakistan, Portugal, and Venezuela. Each of these countries has positive-dividend withholding taxes but no capital gains <b>taxes</b> imposed <b>on</b> <b>non-residents.</b> Colombia and India do the exact opposite: they tax capital gains far more heavily than dividends. Despite what appears optimal, the trend in developing countries is toward lower dividend withholding taxes, with little change in the average level of capital gains taxation. It appears desirable for developing countries to index their capital gains taxes to prevent them from being higher than anticipated.

Furthermore, {{it is difficult to}} imagine that tax administrations, which in many countries are rather poor at performing the simplest everyday tasks, could be transformed into well-organised, efficiently run, Big Brother-like organisations. Professor Slemrod expects Oceania to be with us with a decade or two. However, in the long run, globalisation will constrain the modelling of tax systems to a far greater degree than it already does. Several forces are going to shape tax designs consisting of simple, barely progressive taxes, largely applied in a shedular way in the source countries,,while global income tax will be abandoned. all together. There is going to be an increase in the proportion of <b>taxes</b> based <b>on</b> the benefit principle. The restoration of the residence principle, and the rebuilding of a global, personalised income tax, could result from a rapid rise in the sharing of information among countries concerning revenue earned and taxes paid in different countries by the same tax payers.
