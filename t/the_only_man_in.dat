5|$|All {{players who}} have made at least 100 {{appearances}} in senior first-team matches for Lincoln City, in league or cup competition, are listed below. Grant Brown holds the record for Lincoln City appearances, having played 491 matches between 1989 and 2002, of which 407 were in the Football League. Tony Emery is the only other Lincoln player with more than 400 Football League appearances, and he and Dave Smith the only other two with 400 competitive appearances in total. The goalscoring record is held by Andy Graver, with 143 league goals, and 150 in total, scored over three spells with the club between 1950 and 1961. Johnny Campbell is the only other Lincoln player to have scored 100 Football League goals. Goalkeeper David Felgate is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> this appearance range to have played senior international football while with Lincoln City; he received his only cap for Wales as a half-time substitute for Neville Southall in a friendly against Romania in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Raonic again {{achieved}} {{success at}} ATP 250 and ATP 500 events. In February, Raonic earned his third consecutive title at the Pacific Coast Championships, defeating Tommy Haas in the final. Over three years, he achieved a perfect 12–0 match record, {{and did not}} drop a single set. He is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the Open Era to win three consecutive titles at this event. In September, he won the Thailand Open tournament, defeating No. 9 Gasquet in the semifinals and No. 6 Berdych in the final. The titles were Raonic's fourth and fifth, both coming in ATP 250 events like previous titles. In October, Raonic reached the Japan Open final {{for the second consecutive}} year, but lost a close match to No. 7 Juan Martin del Potro. It marked his fourth consecutive loss in the final of an ATP 500 event.|$|E
5|$|Devers was an {{articulate}} {{proponent of}} the Army's now-emerging tactical doctrine of combined arms: infantry-artillery-armor-close air support. He carried a translation of a German manual on {{the components of the}} panzer division. Devers was neither the first nor the only general to embrace combined arms as the doctrinal {{solution to the problem of}} how best to employ tanks, but he was well-placed to act upon it. At his direction an updated, comprehensive (460 pages) Armed Force Field Manual: Tactics and Technique FM 17–10 was written, published and distributed in March 1942. A German manual on tank platoon tactics, with a foreword by Heinz Guderian, was translated into English and issued as an Armored Force publication. March 1942 saw a reorganization of the armored divisions in the wake of the 1941 maneuvers. Devers added an artillery headquarters to the armored division, and reorganized the artillery component into three battalions, each of three batteries of six M7 Priest self-propelled guns. A division trains headquarters was added to coordinate logistical activities. In a first, at Devers' insistence, a flight of light aircraft to be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance were included in the new Table of Organization and Equipment (TO) for each division. He was a strong and early supporter of the development of the DUKW, an amphibious truck. Vannevar Bush later recalled that in the early stages of its development, Devers was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the Army who fully appreciated its possibilities. Its value would be demonstrated during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.|$|E

25|$|Bird {{resigned}} as Pacers coach {{shortly after the}} end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years. In 2003, he returned as the Pacers' president of basketball operations, overseeing team personnel and coaching moves, as well as the team's draft selections. Bird promoted David Morway to general manager in 2008, but Bird still had the final say in basketball matters. After the 2011–2012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after graduating}} from Yale College in 1765, he married, as his first wife, Martha Welles (1744 - April 1786) {{with whom he had}} twelve children. She was a {{daughter}} of Gideon Welles and Eunice Walker and a great-great granddaughter of Governor Thomas Welles who along with his wife Alice and six children settled in the late summer 1636 probably in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> Connecticut's history to hold all four top offices: governor, deputy governor, treasurer, and secretary. Following the death of his first wife, he married Deborah Wells of Long Island in 1788. There were two children born from this second marriage.|$|E

Lydia arrived penniless in Seattle to testify on Maynard's behalf; he and Catherine let her stay in their mansion on friendly terms.

Infantry leadership, however, fell to the kèlè -koun ("war-head"). [...] A kèlè-koun {{commanded}} a unit of infantry known as a kèlè -bolo ("war-arm"). The men under a kèlè-koun’s command were all horon ("freemen"), like the ton-tigi and kèlè-koun. At least initially, jonow ("slaves") were barred from military service except as military equipment carriers for the ton-tigi. It was not until after Mali's zenith that jonow battalions were utilized.|$|R
25|$|The Celtics {{employed}} Bird as {{a special}} assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997. In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers {{and said he would}} be on the job for no more than three years. Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58–24 record—the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time—in the 1997–98 season, and pushed the Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals. He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts, becoming <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> NBA history to have won both the MVP and Coach of the Year awards. He then led the Pacers to two consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000, and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fifth}} morning, Croatia's Sandra Perković {{became the only}} woman to defend an {{individual}} Olympic athletics title that year, topping the discus podium. Christian Taylor became <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the field events to defend his 2012 Olympic title, repeating his American 1–2 finish with teammate Will Claye. The United States was less successful in the men's 110 metres hurdles: its athletes failed to gain a medal {{for the first time}} ever (bar the 1980 boycott) while Jamaican Omar McLeod won by over a tenth of a second. Faith Kipyegon was a clear winner in the women's 1500 metres ahead of Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba. Derek Drouin won Canada's first Olympic gold in athletics in twenty years in the men's high jump. In the women's 5000m heats American Abbey D'Agostino and Nikki Hamblin of New Zealand fell during the race. D'Agostino stopped to help Hamblin to her feet, but then struggled herself with what would be diagnosed as a torn ACL, which led Hamblin to help in turn so the pair could finish. The pair were later given the Fair Play award by the International Fair Play Committee for their show of sportsmanship.|$|E
25|$|A catcher {{nearly always}} throws {{with his right}} hand. Since most hitters are {{right-handed}} and stand {{to the left side}} of the plate when batting, a catcher who throws left-handed is forced to take some time to sidestep (or otherwise avoid) the right-handed hitter when he throws from behind the plate. In addition, a lefty's throw would tend to come in on the shortstop side of the bag, while a righty's throw would be on the second base side of the bag, which is where the runner is coming in. Consequently, players who are left-handed rarely play catcher. Left-handed catchers have only caught eleven big-league games since 1902, and Jack Clements, who played for 17 years at the end of the nineteenth century, is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the history of baseball to play more than three hundred games as a left-handed catcher. However, some observers, including the famed statistician Bill James and ESPN writer Rob Neyer, have suggested that the real reason that there are no left-handed catchers is because left-handed players with strong throwing arms are almost always encouraged, at an early age, to become pitchers. Benny Distefano, the last lefty thrower to catch a big-league game (in 1989), noted that lefty catchers have difficulty on bunts up the third base line and on fielding throws home for plays at the plate.|$|E

25|$|Nine years later, in 1832, Paris is in {{upheaval}} {{because of}} the impending death of General Lamarque, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries Marius Pontmercy and Enjolras, who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death {{will have on the}} poor and desperate in Paris; the Thénardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang; their daughter Éponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin Gavroche, who knows everything that happens in the slums ("Look Down"). The Thénardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Thénardier suddenly recognizes Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed here in Paris, comes to the rescue ("The Robbery"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Thénardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars (which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin) that he will find Valjean and recapture him ("Stars"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades Éponine to help him find Cosette ("Éponine's Errand").|$|E
