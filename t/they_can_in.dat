25|$|ZombiU {{has three}} {{multiplayer}} modes. In Time Attack mode, players must kill as many zombies as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> a limited time. In survival mode, players stay alive {{as long as}} possible with a limited supply of resources. The results of these two modes will be posted on the game's online leaderboard. The third mode, King of Zombies, is an offline asymmetrical multiplayer mode. A player, using the Wii U Pro Controller, plays a human survivor who must navigate a map to obtain all capture points. Another player, known as King Boris and using the Wii U GamePad with a top-down perspective, must deploy a maximum of 10 zombies to halt the players' progress and capture a flag. A progression system is present, in which the Pro Controller player and the GamePad player unlock more-powerful weapons and different types of zombies.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{franchise}} differs between individual voters, various markers may be placed next to voters' names to identify in which elections {{they are entitled}} to vote. European Union citizens who are not Commonwealth or Irish citizens have their entry prefixed either with G (meaning <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only vote <b>in</b> local government elections) or K (meaning <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only vote <b>in</b> European Parliamentary and local government elections). Overseas electors are prefixed with the letter F, meaning <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only vote <b>in</b> European and UK Parliamentary elections. Members of the House of Lords residing in the UK are prefixed with the letter L, meaning <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only vote <b>in</b> European Parliamentary and local government elections, whilst peers who are overseas electors are prefixed with the letter E, indicating that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only vote <b>in</b> European Parliamentary elections.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not {{take you back to}} area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles for the sake of puzzles' and that <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> <b>in</b> the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E
25|$|Because offsets {{provide a}} revenue stream for the {{reduction}} of some types of emissions, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> some cases provide incentives to emit more, so that emitting entities can later get credit for reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline. This is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin. For example, one Chinese company generated $500 million in carbon offsets by installing a $5million incinerator to burn the HFCs produced by the manufacture of refrigerants. The huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely {{for the purpose of}} increasing production of HFCs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets. Not only is this outcome environmentally undesirable, it undermines other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse. The practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy HFC-23.|$|E

[...] Reverend Hugh Peter spoke out in favor of the [...] "non-addresses" [...] (i.e. no longer negotiating with the king), as did the Levellers. [...] John Lilburne was particularly critical, saying [...] "I clearly see Cromwell's and Vane's designs, which is to keep the poor people everlastingly (if <b>they</b> <b>can)</b> <b>in</b> bondage and slavery."

[...] There he was recaptured and imprisoned in Carisbrook Castle. [...] Offered proposals by the Scots and the Independents, he chose alliance with the Scots.

500|$|Bougainville, {{tasked with}} the defence {{of the large}} area between Cap Diamant and Cap Rouge, was {{upstream}} with his troops at Cap Rouge {{on the night of}} 12 September, and missed seeing numerous British ships moving downstream. [...] A camp of approximately 100 militia led by Captain Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor, who had unsuccessfully faced the British four years previously at Fort Beauséjour, had been assigned to watch the narrow road at L'Anse-au-Foulon which followed a streambank, the Coulée Saint-Denis. On the night of 12 September and morning of 13 September, however, the camp may have contained as few as 40 men, as others were off harvesting. Vaudreuil and others had expressed their concern at the possibility of L'Anse-au-Foulon being vulnerable, but Montcalm dismissed them, saying 100 men would hold off the army until daylight, remarking, [...] "It is not to be supposed that the enemies have wings so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> the same night cross the river, disembark, climb the obstructed acclivity, and scale the walls, for which last operation they would have to carry ladders." ...|$|E

2500|$|A 2013 {{modification}} of the norms governing personal ordinariates {{made it clear that}} membership of an ordinariate is open to those who are Catholics by baptism but have not received both of the other two sacraments of initiation, if evangelising by an ordinariate brings them back to the faith and practice of the Catholic Church. Although they lack an Anglican background, they acquire membership of an ordinariate by receiving within it some of the sacraments of initiation. Other Catholics cannot [...] "for purely subjective motives or personal preference" [...] be enrolled in an ordinariate.

2500|$|Understanding one's own {{emotions}} can be {{a crucial}} piece of learning {{how to deal with}} anger. [...] Children who wrote down their negative emotions in an [...] "anger diary" [...] actually ended up improving their emotional understanding, which in turn led to less aggression. [...] When it comes to dealing with their emotions, children show the ability to learn best by seeing direct examples of instances that led to certain levels of anger.

Those who {{commit themselves to}} evangelize for 50 hours for one month are called auxiliary pioneers, which they may do for consecutive months. Some Witnesses volunteer for missionary service, and may be invited to receive specialized training at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

2500|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Circassian {{diaspora}} abroad has begun experiencing a cultural reawakening. Contacts are being established with their homeland, but also, more importantly, there are now many institutions being founded to strengthen the Circassian identity within the diaspora. For example, in 2005, the Circassian Education Foundation (website here: [...] ), a scholarship fund for Circassians, was founded in Wayne, New Jersey, USA. It is, in fact, a creation of a mother-organization, the Circassian Benevolent Organization. It has since given scholarship funds to Circassians across the US. The organization (Circassian Education Foundation) has also worked on a project of making a free online Circassian-American English dictionary (available here: [...] which will then, it hopes, be used by Circassians for their language so <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> <b>in</b> turn pass it on to their children as well as revitalize it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{what would}} become the United States, the {{gridiron}} now predominates. In areas that were under Spanish control, the 1753 Laws of the Indies specified the use of the gridiron, and the results can be seen in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Albuquerque, New Mexico; San Diego; San Francisco; and Los Angeles, just as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>in</b> Buenos Aires and Mexico City. By the time of the passage of the federal Land Ordinance of 1785, the grid plan was firmly established. The Ordinance proscribed that newly created states were to have rectilinear boundaries, rather than boundaries shaped by natural features, and within the new areas, beginning in the Northwest Territory, everything was to be divided into rectangles: townships were six miles square (9.66km), [...] "sections" [...] were one mile square (1.61km), and individual lots were 60x125 feet (18.29x38.1m). Cities such as Anchorage, Alaska; Erie, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; and Sacramento, California, all show the American preference for the grid.|$|E
