Shinoda's mother {{encouraged}} him to take classical piano lessons when he was six. By 13, he expressed the desire <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> playing jazz, blues, and even hip-hop. He later added the guitar and rap-style vocals to his repertoire during his {{middle school and high}} school years.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} middle szlachta movement {{came up with}} {{a constructive}} reform program during the Kraków sejm of 1538/1539. Among the movement's demands were termination of the kings' practice of alienation of royal domain, giving or selling land estates to great lords at the monarch' discretion, and a ban on concurrent holding of multiple state offices by the same person, both legislated initially in 1504. Sigismund I's unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the implementation of the reformers' goals negatively affected the country's financial and defensive capabilities.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that he could smell smoke in his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E

5|$|In early September 1862, Colonel Lightburn {{became aware}} of rebel cavalry led by Colonel Albert G. Jenkins, which invaded Ohio. After a brief {{incursion}} into Ohio, Jenkins positioned his cavalry at Barboursville, which blocked one of Lightburn's possible routes {{to the safety of}} the Ohio River. Jenkins also prepared <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the Kanawha River and Charleston—which could block all of Lightburn's retreat routes to Ohio. Lightburn also received news that the Confederate General William W. Loring was advancing from the south with a force rumored to be between 8,000 and 10,000 men. (The actual number was 5,000 plus new recruits.) Lightburn faced the possibility of confronting an army (Loring) that he thought was much larger than his while having no easy way to retreat because of Jenkins.|$|E
5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E
5|$|Operation Tractable {{began at}} 12:00 on 14 August, when 800 Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers of RAF Bomber Command struck German {{positions}} along the front. As with Totalize, {{many of the}} bombers mistakenly dropped their bombs short of their targets, causing 400 Polish and Canadian casualties. Covered by a smoke screen laid down by their artillery, two Canadian divisions moved forwards. Although their line of sight was reduced, German units still managed to inflict severe casualties on the Canadian 4th Armoured Division, which included its Armoured Brigade commander Brigadier Leslie Booth, as the division moved south toward Falaise. Throughout the day, continual attacks by the Canadian 4th and Polish 1st Armoured Divisions managed to force a crossing of the Laison River. Limited access to the crossing points over the Dives River allowed counterattacks by the German 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. The town of Potigny fell to Polish forces in the late afternoon. By {{the end of the}} first day, elements of the Canadian 3rd and 4th Divisions had reached Point 159, directly north of Falaise, although they had been unable to break into the town. To bolster his offensive, Simonds ordered the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the front, with the hope that this reinforcement would be sufficient to enable his divisions to capture the town.|$|E

25|$|The {{controversy}} over {{blame for the}} disaster at Little Bighorn continues to this day. Major Marcus Reno's failure to press his attack on {{the south end of}} the Lakota/Cheyenne village and his flight to the timber along the river after a single casualty have been cited as a factor in the destruction of Custer's battalion, as has Captain Frederick Benteen's allegedly tardy arrival on the field, and the failure of the two officers' combined forces <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the relief of Custer.|$|E
25|$|A {{little after}} noon the Union {{soldiers}} began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the Confederate lines, and {{at about the}} same time the rains began. The road was soon turned into mud, and the mere act of walking required great exertion. The gunners with the howitzers accompanying the infantry soon were exhausted trying to move their pieces, so a regiment of infantry (51st Pennsylvania) were detailed to help them. Many of those foot soldiers long remembered this as the most arduous part of the battle.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic homing is {{a system}} which uses the {{acoustic}} signature (sound) of a target to guide a moving object, such as a torpedo. Acoustic homing can be either Passive or Active in nature. Using Passive, the system is designed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> either <b>toward</b> or away from a sound, and may also be designed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> only <b>toward</b> certain types of sounds {{to the exclusion of}} others, while Active is a true Sonar. The system emits a sound pulse that reflects off objects and then back to the system, where the system processes the echos to determine the proper response.|$|R

25|$|Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett of Griffin's {{division}} rode to {{the left}} when he heard increased firing and saw the Confederate left flank {{on the opposite side}} of Sydnor's field. Griffin also rode to Sydnor's field and saw the Confederate movement along White Oak Road. Major Cope then rode up and told Griffin that Warren wanted him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> White Oak Road by the left flank. Meanwhile, all of Griffin's men except three regiments of Bartlett's brigade had moved off and joined Crawford's division.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people then}} started {{moving away from}} the car park towards the jetty. But someone shouted that Bryant was heading that way, so they tried to double back around the coaches to where Brigid Cook had been shot. Bryant doubled back to where Janet and Neville Quin, who owned a {{wildlife}} park on the east coast of Tasmania, were beginning <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> Mason Cove and away from the buses. Bryant shot Janet Quin in the back, where she fell, unable to move, near Royce Thompson.|$|E

25|$|The Tropical waltz was {{performed}} {{in a slower tempo}} and frequently included a sung melody with a text. Those texts usually referred to the beauties of the Cuban countryside, the longing of the Siboneyes (Cuban aboriginee) and other creole themes. With accents on its three beats, its melody was fluid and composed of equal value notes. It was similar to many other songs in which the melody was treated in a syllabic way, where the first beat was not stressed by a brief anacrusis but had a tendency <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the second beat like in the peasant (guajiro) song.|$|E
25|$|Early successes such {{as these}} {{paved the way for}} {{dynamical}} systems research into linguistic acquisition, answering many questions about early linguistic development but leaving many others unanswered, such as how these statistically acquired lexemes are represented. Of particular importance in recent research has been the effort to understand the dynamic interaction of learning (e.g. language-based) and learner (e.g. speaker-based) variables in lexical organization and competition in bilinguals. In the ceaseless effort <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> more psychologically realistic models, many researchers have turned to a subset of associative models, self-organizing maps (SOMs), as established, cognitively plausible models of language development.|$|E
