5|$|By 1952, Kulikovsky {{had shrunk}} more than 4inches (10cm) from his peak height of 6ft 2inches (188cm). He distrusted {{conventional}} medicine and tried homeopathy instead. By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty sleeping. At {{the end of}} his life he was sleeping on <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>in</b> the living room of the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958. His estate was valued at 12,123.47Canadian dollars, about 98,000Canadian dollars as of 2012. The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto.|$|E
5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red {{microphone}} {{in front of}} a pastel blue wall. She is sometimes flanked by backup dancers and television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the video to the poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings and sunglasses in the video, and is seen reclining on a lip-shaped sofa. Parker compared <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>in</b> the video to the sofas used in the American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2004, after a 19-month trial, Brown {{was convicted}} by a Japanese court of {{attempted}} indecent assault {{and destruction of}} private property and received a one-year suspended prison sentence. As {{a result of this}} incident and others involving crimes committed by U.S. military personnel in Japan, both countries entered into negotiations aimed at modifying <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> <b>in</b> July 2003; ultimately, no changes were made to the agreement.

He was demoted and involuntarily retired from the military in 2006 and at his trial in 2009 entered an Alford plea, receiving probation on the felony conviction.|$|E

5|$|The Forensic Science Service email was {{translated}} into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, {{if she were to}} admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>in</b> 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E
5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>in</b> the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E
25|$|The role of <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>in</b> Malian warfare changed {{dramatically}} after {{the reign of}} Sundjata from mere baggage handler to full-fledged warriors. A sofa was equipped by the state, whereas the horon brought their weapons. Sofa armies {{could be used to}} intimidate unfaithful governors, and they formed a majority of the infantry by the 15th century. So though imperial Mali was initially a horon-run army, its reliance on jonow as administrators (farimba) and officers (dùùkùnàsi) gradually transformed the character of its military.|$|E
