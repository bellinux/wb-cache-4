500|$|An {{anonymous}} reviewer in The Topographer of April 1789 {{wrote that}} [...] "A more delightful, or more original work <b>than</b> <b>Mr.</b> White's History of Selborne has seldom been published... Natural History has evidently been the author's principal study, and, of that, ornithology is evidently the favourite. The {{book is not}} a compilation from former publications, but the result of many years' attentive observations to nature itself, which are told {{not only with the}} precision of a philosopher, but with that happy selection of circumstances, which mark the poet." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics, however—including Edgar Allan Poe—felt {{that while}} Irving {{should be given}} credit for being an innovator, the writing itself was often unsophisticated. [...] "Irving is much over-rated", Poe wrote in 1838, [...] "and a nice {{distinction}} might be drawn between his just and his surreptitious and adventitious reputation—between what {{is due to the}} pioneer solely, and what to the writer". A critic for the New-York Mirror wrote: [...] "No man in the Republic of Letters has been more overrated <b>than</b> <b>Mr.</b> Washington Irving". Some critics noted especially that Irving, despite being an American, catered to British sensibilities and, as one critic noted, wrote [...] "of and for England, rather than his own country".|$|E
500|$|State press censorship, {{introduced}} by the Smith administration on UDI, was lifted in early April 1968, though according to the Glasgow Herald the government retained [...] "considerable powers to control information. It may reflect no more <b>than</b> <b>Mr</b> Smith's growing confidence that nothing—short of a sell-out to Britain—can undermine his position in Rhodesia". The series of Rhodesian High Court cases debating the legality of UDI {{came to a close}} five months later on 13 September. A panel of judges headed by Sir Hugh Beadle ruled UDI, the 1965 constitution and Smith's government to be de jure, prompting the UK Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson to accuse them of breaching [...] "the fundamental laws of the land".|$|E

500|$|During {{his later}} years Borchgrevink lived quietly. In 1929, the Parliament of Norway awarded him a pension of 3,000 Norwegian kroner. In 1930 came belated {{recognition}} from London—the Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Patron's Medal, proclaiming that {{the magnitude of the}} difficulties overcome by Borchgrevink had initially been underestimated: [...] "It was only after the work of Scott's Northern Party... {{that we were able to}} realise the improbability that any explorer could do more in the Cape Adare district <b>than</b> <b>Mr</b> Borchgrevink had accomplished. It appeared, then, that justice had not been done at the time to the pioneer work of the Southern Cross expedition, which had been carried out under the British flag and at the expense of a British benefactor." ...|$|E
500|$|Actors {{associated}} with Wallack's Theatre {{announced to the}} public that beginning in February 1888 a final series of old comedies would be revived, after which the company would be disbanded. Edwards served as stage manager for the run, and reprised several of his earlier roles including those of Max Harkaway in London Assurance and Colonel Rockett in Old Heads and Young Hearts. Taking part once again in The School for Scandal, the sixth and final play of the nostalgic series, Edwards received high praise for his depiction of a wealthy Englishman recently returned from India: [...] "there is probably no better Sir Oliver on our stage <b>than</b> <b>Mr.</b> Edwards." [...] "Justly esteemed" [...] in the role, he was called a [...] "sterling player", representative [...] "of a school which is fast disappearing".|$|E

500|$|Melinda Houston, {{writing for}} The Age, called Sense and Sensibility [...] "a {{gorgeous}} adaptation {{of her most}} frivolous work" [...] and added, [...] "It's all beautifully made, beautifully cast, and the script snaps and crackles. Maybe Eleanor isn't quite as flawed as originally drawn but that's unlikely to detract from your enjoyment." [...] Lenny Ann Low from The Sydney Morning Herald stated, [...] "The locations, costumes and acting are excellent, with a particularly striking use of light – cold and grey skies foretelling doom through to rich candlelight signalling new passions." [...] The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante said, [...] "There's nothing glaringly wrong with this new Sense and Sensibility, the last in Masterpiece's winter-long homage to Austen; it is both lush and tidy. But it alters the emotional chemistry, {{and the result is}} an adaptation that feels more arid <b>than</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lee's effort." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of Crow, Kneale moved to work for another of the ITV companies, Thames Television, who in 1977 commissioned {{the production of the}} scripts of Kneale's previously abandoned fourth Quatermass serial, to be produced by their Euston Films subsidiary film company. The production was structured to work both as a four-episode serial for transmission in the UK, and a 100-minute film version for cinema release overseas—something Kneale later regretted agreeing to. Starring John Mills as Quatermass and with a budget of over £1 million—more than fifty times the budget of Quatermass and the Pit in 1958—the serial was not as critically successful as its predecessors. [...] "Thematically no less awesome <b>than</b> <b>Mr</b> Kneale's earlier science-fiction essays for BBC Television, his ITV debut has proved only a so-so affair," [...] was the verdict of The Times when previewing the final episode. Tying in with the series, Kneale returned to prose fiction when he wrote his only full-length novel, Quatermass, a novelisation of the serial.|$|E

500|$|Justice Harlan {{advocated}} a broad {{interpretation of the}} Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. He subscribed to the doctrine that the clause not only provided procedural guarantees, but also protected {{a wide range of}} fundamental rights, including those that were not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution. (See substantive due process.) However, as Justice Byron White noted in his dissenting opinion in Moore v. East Cleveland, [...] "no one was more sensitive <b>than</b> <b>Mr.</b> Justice Harlan to any suggestion that his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges 'roaming at large in the constitutional field'." [...] Under Harlan's approach, judges would be limited in the Due Process area by [...] "respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms".|$|E
500|$|By the 1950s Hordern {{had come}} to the notice of many {{influential}} directors. In his autobiography, the actor recognised the decade as being an important era of his career. It started with a major role in Anton Chekhov's Ivanov in 1950. The production took place at the Arts Theatre in Cambridge and excited audiences because of its 25-year absence from the English stage. The writer T. C. Worsley was impressed by Hordern's performance and wrote: [...] "Perhaps an actor with star quality might have imposed on us more successfully <b>than</b> <b>Mr</b> Michael Hordern, and won our sympathy for Ivanov by his own personality. But such a performance would have raised the level of expectation all round. As it is, Mr Hordern is rich in intelligence, sensitivity and grasp, and with very few exceptions, the company give his impressive playing the right kind of support." [...] The title character in Macbeth, directed by Alec Clunes, was Hordern's next engagement. Critics wrote of their dislike of Clunes's version, but the theatre reviewer Audrey Williamson singled out Hordern's performance as being [...] "deeply moving".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{suggested}} that the piece {{may have been too}} sophisticated for its audience—or at least, the audience that greeted its first performance on Boxing Night. The Times wrote: [...] "The dialogue throughout is superior in ability and point to that with which ordinary burlesque and extravaganza have familiarized us; so much so, in fact, that it was a daring experiment to produce such a piece on such a night. It met, however, with an excellent reception, and on any other occasion than Boxing Night the numerous merits of the piece cannot fail to secure for it in the public estimation a high place among the novelties of the season." [...] Other reviews of the first night took up a similar theme: Sporting Life {{suggested that}} [...] "It may be that they looked for something less polished <b>than</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gilbert's verse, and went for something broader and coarser than that delightful author's humour. It may be, too, that Thespis was a little—I only say, just a little—'over their heads'." [...] The Orchestra carried a similar sentiment: [...] "In fact, both music and idea were somewhat {{over the heads of the}} audience." ...|$|E
