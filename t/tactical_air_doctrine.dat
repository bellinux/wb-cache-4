50|$|The lack of {{protective}} air cover {{and the resulting}} loss of large capital ships to hostile aircraft action, were seen as a vindication of authorities on airpower, such as Air Commodore Charles Rumney Samson CMG DSO & BAR AFC, founder of the Royal Naval Air Service, whose papers {{on the need for}} air defence at home and in Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong had not been implemented and US General Billy Mitchell's <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> combat <b>doctrine.</b> Both men had resigned their commissions due to a failure to adopt a modern policy towards air defence.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> {{power in the}} battle of Normandy has been fraught with both {{misunderstanding}} and contradiction. Largely ignored by the army-centric historians who have written the histories of the campaign, it has been asserted on the one hand that Allied air power was overwhelming and on the other that the system for controlling it was cumbersome and ineffective. On the face of it, at least, there would appear to be some tension between those two schools of thought. Which is more accurate? In order to examine that question, it is important to begin with an understanding of the <b>doctrine</b> for <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> power—the contemporary <b>doctrine</b> of the time—and disputes about both that doctrine and the role of air power in the campaign. What emerges is that there is enough blame to go around for all parties—and enough credit. In truth, the doctrine of the time was under-developed, and this simply reflected some of the larger doctrinal weaknesses of the Western Allies’ militaries...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>doctrine</b> {{stated that}} the primary mission was to turn {{tactical}} superiority into complete air supremacy—to totally defeat the enemy air force and obtain control of its air space. This could be done directly through dogfights, and raids on airfields and radar stations, or indirectly by destroying aircraft factories and fuel supplies. Anti-aircraft artillery (called [...] "ack-ack" [...] by the British, [...] "flak" [...] by the Germans, and [...] "Archie" [...] by the World War I USAAS) could also play a role, but it was downgraded by most airmen. The Allies won air supremacy in the Pacific in 1943, and in Europe in 1944. That meant that Allied supplies and reinforcements would get through to the battlefront, but not the enemy's. It meant the Allies could concentrate their strike forces wherever they pleased, and overwhelm the enemy with a preponderance of firepower. This was the basic Allied strategy, and it worked.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} origins of the British system of tactical air support which significantly contributed to the defeat of Germany during the Second World War. Poor relations between the Royal Air Force and Army early in the war hindered the success of operations. The RAF air campaign during Operation Compass demonstrated the fundamental tenets of the formal Allied <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>doctrine</b> that would emerge later in the war. The central figure was Air Commodore Raymond Collishaw who directed his small force to overwhelm the Italian air force and dislocate enemy logistics to make a substantial contribution to the first major British victory of the war. Collishawâs career prepared him well for this campaign. Known primarily as a Great War ace, he {{was also one of the}} first specialists in close air support during the Hundred Days campaign. After the war he fought campaigns in South Russia and Mesopotamia, served aboard the aircraft carrier HMS Courageous, policed riots in Palestine and deployed to Sudan during the Abyssinian crisis. This experience primed him for senior command and taught him much about the application of air power, especially how to work effectively with the Army and the Royal Navy. The failure of Operation Battleaxe in June 1941, fought according to Army doctrine, led Prime Minister Winston Churchill to consider the higher level direction of future air campaigns. He identified and codified the elements of a successful tactical air campaign in a directive which confirmed the RAF view of mission and target selection. The pattern of operations outlined by Churchill rejected the armyâs preference to use the RAF for the close defence of its troops. Rather, Churchillâs directive reflected the basic principles of Collishawâs air plan employed during Operation Compass. This study is based on a close reading of Collishawâs papers as well as the documentary records of the RAF, British Army and the British Cabinet. Operational Record Books, War Diaries and Cabinet minutes along with the personal letters and diaries of the main actors form the primary body of evidence for understanding the events in the Western Desert in 1940 - 1941...|$|E
