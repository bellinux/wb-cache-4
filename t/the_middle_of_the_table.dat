25|$|After World War II, City {{continued}} {{to play in the}} Third Division South. At first, City settled as a mid-table team, however, in the last seven years before the league reformation, City began to drift away from <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> finishing in the top 10 in 1953–54 (ninth), in the bottom four in 1951–52 (23rd), 1954–55 (22nd) and 1956–57 (21st), and bottom in 1957–58.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of each round each player is dealt ten cards, with the two remaining cards (the so-called Skat) being put face down in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Dealing follows this pattern: deal three cards each, then deal the Skat, then four cards each, then three cards again (“three–Skat–four–three”). In four-player rounds, the dealer does not receive any cards and skips actual play of the round. He or she may peek into the hand of one other player (if allowed to do so) but never into the Skat.|$|E

25|$|Then, in 2014, the Balearic club {{announced}} Miquel Soler as {{the coach}} {{at the beginning of}} the summer, only for new GM Dudu Aouate to remove Soler and bring in the Russian, Valeri Karpin. Under a Board led by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the Karpin-coached 2014-15 team struggled through to winter, and goalkeeper Dudu Aouate was dismissed. Then, after five consecutive victories, the Bermellone club catapulted up into <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> when Lorenzo Serra Ferrer sold his shares to German Utz Claassen, who then became the majority shareholder. As that shareholder, Claassen replaced Karpin with Miquel Soler, yet the team still struggled through the season and again had to salvage the season at the very end.|$|E

The Wallabies went on to defeat hosts Wales in the quarter finals at the new Millennium Stadium with Gregan scoring a try, putting Joe Roff into space and then taking the scoring pass, and enter the final after defeating defending champions South Africa in the semi-finals. The Wallabies became two-time World Champions after defeating France 35 to 12 in the final.|$|E

[...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and {{that it had to be}} darker and edgier.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
