This study is intended to find the leveling of reading <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English textbook entitled “Bahasa Inggris” for X grade of senior high school 2013 curriculum, published by “Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan” <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year of 2016 based on the Flesch Readability Formula (Reading Ease Formula) theory by Rudolf Flesch. The method of this study used descriptive qualitative approach. The data analysis are from <b>the</b> reading <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English textbook “Bahasa Inggris” for X grade of senior high school 2013 curriculum, published by “Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan” <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year of 2016. The data analyzed by counting the number and average of sentences, words and syllables of each text used Flesch Readability Formula (Reading Ease Formula). Finally, the researcher interpreted based on the result. The result showed that from 10 texts 1 narrative <b>text</b> is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very easy level, 2 narrative <b>texts</b> are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> easy level, 2 (1 descriptive and 1 recount) <b>texts</b> are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fairly easy, 3 (2 descriptive and 1 recount) <b>texts</b> are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fairly difficult, 1 recount <b>text</b> is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> difficult level, and 1 recount <b>text</b> is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very difficult. Since <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> fairly difficult level are higher than other texts, it means that according {{to the theory of}} Flesch Reading Ease <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> appropriate level for tenth grade students...|$|R

5|$|Burnett Hillman Streeter {{proposed}} Caesarea or Beirut {{for three}} reasons: it contains, after the New Testament, the two Epistles of Clement; it represents an eclectic <b>text</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Testament, Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles, it suggests some {{place where the}} influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; {{the text of the}} Old Testament appears to be a non-Alexandrian text heavily revised by the Hexapla, the Old Testament quotations in New Testament more often than not agree with Alexandrinus against Vaticanus.|$|E

5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the <b>text.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|Few {{documents}} {{written in}} either the Khitan large or small script survive to this day. Most surviving specimens of both Khitan scripts are epitaph inscriptions on stone tablets, {{as well as a}} number of inscriptions on coins, mirrors and seals. Only a single manuscript <b>text</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Khitan large script is known (Nova N 176), and no manuscripts in the Khitan small script are known. The Liao emperors could read Chinese, and while there were some Chinese works translated into Khitan during the Liao dynasty, the Confucian classics, which served as the core guide to the administration of government in China, are not known to have been translated into Khitan.|$|E
5|$|For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is {{generally}} considered among scholars as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is {{equal to that of}} Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is the most reliable witness of the <b>text.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Book of Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, Papyrus 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E

5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of <b>text.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{early stages of the}} development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, Either/Or received {{new life}} as a grand philosophical work {{with the publication of}} Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue (1981), where MacIntyre situates Either/Or as an attempt to capture the Enlightenment spirit set forth by David Hume and Immanuel Kant. After Virtue renewed Either/Or as an important ethical <b>text</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kantian vein, as mentioned previously. Although MacIntyre accuses Victor Eremita of failing to provide a criterion for one to adopt an ethical way of life, many scholars have since replied to MacIntyre's accusation in Kierkegaard After MacIntyre.|$|E
5|$|It is {{seen that}} Justinian regards {{this as a}} novel {{enactment}} of an old law, and that he includes not only the symbolic interpretations of the punishment as found in for example Cicero, but also Constantine's extension of the penalty to fathers who murder their own children. In Justinian, relative to Constantine, we see the inclusion in the sack of the dog, cock and monkey, not just the serpent(s) in Constantine. Some modern historians, such as O.F. Robinson, suspects that the precise wording of the <b>text</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Institutes 4.18.6 suggests that the claimed reference in Digest 48.9.9 from Modestinus is actually a sixth CE interpolation into the third century CE law text, rather than being a faithful citation of Modestinus.|$|E

Bach's Magnificat was performed several times in the last quarter of the 19th century, for instance in Germany and the Netherlands.|$|E

It is extremely unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E
