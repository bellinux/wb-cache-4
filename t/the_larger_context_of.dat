5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{simplified}} model, with key-variable {{the prices of}} two different possible scenarios of CAP reform after 2013 (moderate and radical), this paper present a comparison between the price effects of implementation of each reform scenario at 2015 horizon on Romanian agriculture.

Integrated in <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> Romanian development, it seems that the influence of CAP reform upon agriculture and rural areas will be most likely a gradual one: an interpenetration between the two scenarios is foreseeable, starting with the moderate reform that will dominate the period around 2013, the reform measures acquiring a more radical character afterwards.

40|$|Abstract The {{formation}} of educational policies is complex by nature. The complexity owes {{not only to}} the fact that education is a sector where it is difficult to identify the underpinnings and their effects to be foreseen, but also to the diversity of interests that education represents for the different actors in society. In the dynamics of educational management, within <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> a global quest for Education for All (EFA), the Nigerian UBE and the Swedish Grundskola programmes have a fundamental principle in common. Compared to other socio-economic sectors, educational development involves more difficult and multidimensional problems. Faced with financial constraints, governments in many countries are not able to meet the broad social demands without adopting restrictive measures within the education sector, while rationalising the use of allocated resources. Because there are too many actors, variables and the interrelations between these, the result of Education for All (EFA) with the Grundskola was successful perhaps, based on some of the issues discussed while that of the Nigerian Universal Basic Education (UBE) programme proved abortive...|$|R
