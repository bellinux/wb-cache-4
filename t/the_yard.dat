5|$|The Recreation Yard was <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> used by inmates of {{the prison}} between 1934 and 1963. It is located {{opposite}} the dining hall south {{of the end of}} D-Block, facing the mainland on a raised level surrounded by a high wall and fence above it. Guard Tower #3 lay just to the west of <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> The gun gallery was situated in <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> mounted on one of the dining hall's exterior walls.|$|E
5|$|The dock {{was used}} for fitting out vessels, and the crane would lift engines and boilers into ships. The lifting {{capacity}} of the Titan, {{and the location of}} <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> at the confluence of the River Clyde and River Cart, contributed to the success of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> as it could build extremely large ships.|$|E

50|$|As the Back of <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> {{demographics}} changed, <b>the</b> paper {{struggled to}} remain {{relevant to the}} neighborhood population.

50|$|In November 1984, an {{official}} {{announcement was made}} that the Newmarket Saleyards would be closed the following year. Although the closure had been discussed for almost a century, economic hardship and drought conditions, {{as well as the}} decentralisation of the livestock industry and urban development affected the viability of <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b> <b>The</b> <b>yards</b> operated until 1987, when an employment trust was formed to dismantle <b>the</b> <b>yards,</b> assisted by more than 100 long-term unemployed. <b>The</b> <b>yards</b> were redeveloped by the state government under the Lynch's Bridge project, which now has approximately 6,100 residents.|$|R
5|$|East of {{the station}} there is a flying {{junction}} that connects to the Jamaica Yard via a wye that curves east from <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> towards Briarwood.

5|$|Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops once {{daily in}} each {{direction}} at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Station. Ridership on the train is increasing, about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. Increased ridership has prompted southern Minnesota leaders to plan for an expansion of Amtrak's service in the area. Saint Paul {{is the site of}} the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> from the southern track, and trains from <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> may start service on the northern track.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War the {{basement}} was converted into an air-raid shelter and an extension built in <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{to provide more}} space in the control room. The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942.|$|E

50|$|The {{changes in}} traffic flows have meant {{changes in the}} way freight is handled by <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> at Toton, {{primarily}} because the great majority of the trains now originate from south of <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> and therefore have to be propelled into <b>the</b> North <b>Yard.</b> Following <b>the</b> remodelling of the 1970s and 1980s there is no connection directly into Toton <b>Yards</b> from <b>the</b> south.|$|R
50|$|During the {{recession}} years Hietalahti and Crichton-Vulcan yards got vital {{orders from the}} east - in 1932-1935 <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> delivered altogether 35 vessels to Soviet Union.

5|$|In 1936, the {{previously}} dirt-covered yard was paved. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> {{was part of}} the most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and use them as shields to reach the dock.|$|E

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} boats were built beside the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. Richard Dunston {{set up a}} boatyard at Thorne, on the north bank just below the lock, in 1858, after selling his {{previous}} boatyard at Torksey. He initially constructed clinker-built sailing barges, capable of carrying up to 80 tons. The boatyard was fairly self-contained, using timber which was grown locally and was sawn by hand at <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> It included a ropewalk, which made ropes for many industries in the locality, {{as well as for}} rigging of the boats, and supplied sails, masts and chandlery to much of the Humber region. Gradually, carvel-built barges with their smoother hulls replaced clinker-built ones, and boat sizes became more standard, with Sheffield-sized keels and larger sloops. Shortly after Richard's grandson took over <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> in 1910, it was remodelled to build iron and steel ships, and only one wooden boat was built subsequently.|$|E

50|$|One {{fundamental}} difference between <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> building for <b>the</b> Long Range Program as opposed to its larger brother, was that <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> of <b>the</b> Emergency Program were principally built with Federal funds only and that title to <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> resided with <b>the</b> Maritime Commission. Long Range Program yards had been from the beginning privately owned and although most received capital from the government {{during the course of}} the war to expand their shipbuilding capacity, the title to those <b>yards</b> remained in <b>the</b> hands of the corporations which owned them. Many of <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> which built for the Long Range Program continued to operate in the post war years. Not one of <b>the</b> Emergency <b>yards</b> continued to build or even to repair ships after the end of the war and most had been fully dismantled by the mid-1950s.|$|R

5|$|Matt's brigade {{began moving}} to Tasa at 4:30 PM on October 15, before turning eastwards on Akavish. Heavy {{congestion}} {{on the roads}} made the brigade's progress very slow.

5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house under cover of {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed.
