40|$|A failed <b>tachometer</b> <b>generator</b> bolt was analyzed. Fractographic {{features}} {{revealed that}} the bolt has fractured by overload at about 30 mm from the bolt head and at the last thread region. There were no evidences of delayed failure like fatigue. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities appear {{to be responsible for}} the failure. With the available information, {{it was not possible to}} establish the cause of excessive load on the bolt. This needs to be established and the corrective measures incorporated to prevent recurrence of similar failure...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} is to design a {{nonlinear}} feedforward neural network model of a laboratory model AMIRA DR 300 (made by AMIRA, Duisburg, Germany). This device consists of two direct-current engines, whose shafts are connected together by a fixed shaft coupling. An output value of the laboratory model is a rotation speed of this shaft coupling and it can be measured either by a <b>tachometer</b> <b>generator,</b> or an incremental position sensor. The first engine was modeling by neural network. The second one is used to apply as a generator of a faulty measured value...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} is to design a {{predictive}} control algorithm based on a GPC (Generalized Predictive Control) method with a constraint of manipulated variable for controling of the laboratory model AMIRA DR 300 (made by Amira, Duisburg, Germany) in a real time. This laboratory device consists of two main parts. The first part is a mechanism itself and the second part is a transmission housing. The mechanism consists of two direct-current engines, whose shafts are connected together by a fixed shaft coupling. Rotation speed of the shaft coupling is an output value of a control loop, which is measured by a <b>tachometer</b> <b>generator</b> and an incremental position sensor...|$|E
50|$|A heat-induced ferromagnetic-paramagnetic {{transition}} {{is used in}} magneto-optical storage media, for erasing and writing of new data. Famous examples include the Sony Minidisc format, {{as well as the}} now-obsolete CD-MO format. Other uses include temperature control in soldering irons, and stabilizing the magnetic field of <b>tachometer</b> <b>generators</b> against temperature variation.|$|R
40|$|Significant {{errors of}} train axle <b>generators</b> (<b>tachometers)</b> {{are due to}} wheel slip and slide. An {{algorithm}} is designed to compensate for these errors. The algorithm identifies the wheel slip and slide by examining the variation of the processed vehicle longitudinal acceleration. Whenever wheel slip/slide is identified, then the vehicle speed is adjusted if a certain condition is met. The adjustment is a simple linear interpolation between the two speed values recorded before and after wheel slip/slide detection. In addition, a speed and acceleration observer using a Kalman filter is implemented. Experimental results using three different axle encoders aboard a freight train are provided to illustrate {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithmPublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|A three-component anemometer, {{developed}} and refined {{during the past}} ten years, measures the three orthogonal wind-speed components directly along the instrument's three axes, X, Y, Z. The basic sensor {{for each of the}} three components is a light-weight helicoid propeller driving a tiny precision <b>tachometer</b> <b>generator,</b> which develops a D. C. voltage linearly proportional to the rate of turning of the propeller and reversing in polarity when the direction of rotation reverses. Each propeller turns at a rate almost linearly proportional to the instantaneous wind speed and the cosine of the angle subtended by the wind with the axis of the propeller. Propeller sensors have a starting speed of about 0. 2 m s − 1; a distance constant of about 1 m; and may be used in winds up to 30 m s − 1. Over 500 of these instruments are now in use at research stations throughout the world...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} meter that {{displays}} instantaneously to {{the tractor}} operator on a continuous basis the fuel efficiency of his tillage operation, would make possible the observation {{of the change in}} efficiency and the effect on the tillage operation when changes in field condition occur. The operator would be able to make adjustments and immediately observe the effect on efficiency {{in order to keep the}} efficiency as high as possible. The selection of a best size machine and adjusting the speed and depth to improve fuel efficiency should not affect the quality of tillage. Trying to maintain the efficiency as high as possible means higher power output at a lower fuel consumption. Therefore, cheaper operation can be achieved. Fuel efficiency is the drawbar horsepower of the tractor (constant x load x speed) divided by the power input (amount of fuel consumed). In view of this, an efficiency meter was constructed and tested. The meter electrically calculated the efficiency from the outputs of three transducers measuring draft, speed and fuel consumption. An electrical resistance strain gage dynamometer, a d. c. <b>tachometer</b> <b>generator</b> and a turbine meter were used to determine the load pulled by the tractor, the actual speed of the tractor and fuel consumed by the tractor engine respectively. The linear characteristics between the variable being measured and the output of each of the three devices listed above have the advantage in making a fuel efficiency meter simpler to design. A low cost vortex flowmeter that can be used on Agricultural tractors for the measurements of fuel consumption was built and tested. The meter showed a linear measuring characteristic and that the frequency of rotation of the contained ball depends mainly on the density of the ball and track radius. During a field test draft measurement compared favorably with another type of pull meter and the percent error in fuel efficiency measurement is probably small compared to the human error in attempting to estimate an average value of the reading being taken, mainly because of the instantaneous variation in draft...|$|E
