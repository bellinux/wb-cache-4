40|$|Abstract: Predictive control {{technique}} {{is applied to}} the <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> control of spacecraft. The principal idea of predictive control is to construct a priori reference trajectory and build control command so that the actual system follows the reference trajectory. In the case of this study, the controlled variables are the quaternion attitude parameters and angular rates of spacecraft body axes. The key objective {{of this paper is to}} design a predictive controller for the <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> control under external disturbances. Designing a predictive control law including disturbances and estimation of the disturbance are discussed. Conventional predictive controller design approach has been partially modified in conjunction with disturbance identification strategy. The results of this paper, attitude control simulation results, are presented to prove thi...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of {{satellite}} <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> using only one sensor data presents an interesting estimation problem. A flexible and mathematically effective filter for solving the satellite <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> estimation problem using two-axis magnetometer {{would be a}} challenging option for space missions which are suffering from other attitude sensors failure. Mostly, magnetometers are employed with other attitude sensors to resolve attitude estimation. However, by designing a computationally efficient discrete Kalman filter, full attitude estimation can profit by only two-axis magnetometer observations. The method suggested solves the problem {{of satellite}} attitude estimation using linear Kalman filter (LKF). Firstly, all models are generated and then the designed scenario is developed and evaluated with simulation results. The filter can achieve 10 e- 3 degree attitude accuracy or better on all three axes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Remote sensing {{satellites}} {{are required}} to meet stringent pointing and drift rate requirements for imaging operations. For achieving these pointing and stability requirements, continuous and accurate <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> informa-tion is required. Inertial sensors like gyros provide continuous attitude information with better short-term stability and less random errors. However, gyro measure-ments are affected by drifts. Hence over time, attitudes based on the gyro refer-ence slowly diverge from the true attitudes. On the other hand, line-of-sight (LOS) sensors like horizon sensors provide attitude information with long-term stability. Their measurements however {{are affected by the}} presence of random instrumen-tal errors and other systematic errors. The limitations of inertial and line-of-sight sensors are mutually exclusive. Hence, by optimal fusion of attitude information from both these sensors, it is possible to retain the advantages and overcome the limitations of both, thereby providing the precise attitude information required for control. This paper describes an improved earth-pointing scheme by fusion of the <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> information from gyros and horizon sensor roll and pitch measure-ments along with yaw updates from the digital sun sensor. A Kalman Filter is used to estimate the <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> by online estimation and corrections of various errors from the sensor measurements. Variations in orbit rate components are also accounted for using spacecraft position and velocity measurements from the satel-lite positioning system. Thus precise earth-pointing is achieved...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{adaptive}} control theory, a novel <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> control system for an axisymmetric spacecraft with uncertain dynamics moving in elliptic orbits, using solar radiation pressure, is derived. The nonaffine-in-control nonlinear spacecraft model includes the gravity gradient torque, the control torque produced by four solar flaps, and external time-varying disturbance moments. For the <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> control, an {{adaptive control system}} is designed, which includes a state predictor. A smooth projection algorithm is used to confine the estimated parameters within a desirable set. In the closed-loop system, the designed adaptive law accomplishes three-dimensional attitude control.

40|$|Traditionally, {{attitude}} estimation {{has been}} performed {{using a combination}} of external attitude sensors and internal three-axis gyroscopes. There are many studies of <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> estimation using gyros that read angular rates. Rate-integrating gyros measure integrated rates or angular displacements, but <b>three-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> estimation using these types of gyros has not been as fully investigated. This paper derives a Kalman filtering framework for attitude estimation using attitude sensors coupled with rate- integrating gyroscopes. In order to account for correlations introduced by using these gyros, the state vector must be augmented, compared with filters using traditional gyros that read angular rates. Two filters are derived in this paper. The first uses an augmented state-vector form that estimates attitude, gyro biases, and gyro angular displacements. The second ignores correlations, leading to a filter that estimates attitude and gyro biases only. Simulation comparisons are shown for both filters. The work presented in this paper focuses only on attitude estimation using rate-integrating gyros, but it can easily be extended to other applications such as inertial navigation, which estimates attitude and position...|$|R
