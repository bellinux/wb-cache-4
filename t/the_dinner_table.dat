25|$|Yasuna's unique affliction to {{be unable}} to see males is changed from the manga to the anime.

Additionally, in the eleventh anime episode, Yasuna becomes unable to see females as well, though this is later rectified in episode twelve when Yasuna is completely healed and is able to see both males and females. In the anime, Yasuna is shown to be terrified of males, even those in her own class, but in the manga she merely pays very little attention to males around her, even when spoken to directly, or otherwise ignores males completely. In the anime, Yasuna is shown at one time accidentally ignoring her father at <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table,</b> but the only time Yasuna is shown speaking to her father in the manga has her smiling to him.|$|E
