5|$|During {{construction}} of the Voss Line from Bergen to Voss, there was a proposal to extend the line from Voss to Granvin on the Hardangerfjord. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> were again taken up to consideration with the {{construction of}} the Bergen Line, but also this time <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> were scrapped. Some people wanted the line to be a tramway and when it was passed by the Parliament of Norway on 12 July 1919; <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> incorporated some elements of a tramway, giving the line a lower standard than the mainline. The railway was to be built electrified, and construction started in 1921. However, {{there was a lack of}} engineers, forcing a slow pace. On 5 November 1923, parliament passed the final plans for the railway, and the pace of construction was accelerated.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} two-tier {{stand to}} the north and east were {{presented}} next. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> had called for 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all-seater.|$|E
50|$|Three further Acts {{related to}} {{planning}} {{are associated with}} this primary act: <b>The</b> <b>Planning</b> (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> (Hazardous Substances) Act 1990, and <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> (Consequential Provisions) Act 1990. These four Acts {{are referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> Acts. Almost immediately after parliament passed these Acts, the government had further thoughts on the control of land development, which led to <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> and Compensation Act 1991, which made important alterations to many of <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> Acts provisions.|$|R
50|$|If {{the judge}} approves <b>the</b> {{reorganization}} <b>plan</b> and if <b>the</b> creditors all agree <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> can be confirmed. If {{at least one}} class of creditors votes against <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> and thus objects, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> may nonetheless be confirmed if the requirements of cramdown are met. In order to be confirmed over their objection <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> must not discriminate against that class of creditors, and <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> must be found fair and equitable to that class.|$|R

5|$|A new route was {{launched}} by Bømlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a pontoon bridge which would cross Stokksundet. He {{was inspired by}} <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> to build {{what would become the}} Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a pontoon bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic. Similar protests also came from the shipping industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not remedied by <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> including a suspension bridge across Foldrøysundet. To illustrate their point, one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldrøysundet. The shipping industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> were abandoned in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{brothers}} received initial {{support from the}} government, the Soviet Union officially protested the airport on 5 November 1958. They claimed {{it could be used}} as an air force base—and thus would be a violation of the Svalbard Treaty—and pointed out that planning was partially financed with American military funding and that Gunnar was a military officer. From then on the Norwegian government started actively opposing the airport. At first they asked the company to cease operations, then asked the American military to cut funding. They also instructed all government-owned companies to not allow an airport to be built on their ground. The government also used Gunnar's military rank to hinder him, to limited extent, from pursuing <b>the</b> <b>plans.</b> The Aviation Act, which required all airports to have a concession to operate, came into effect from 1961, effectively stopping <b>the</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around 80% of 16-year-olds stay in {{full-time}} {{academic or}} vocational education, or go on a government-financed training course. In {{a survey of}} 859 people, 9/10 supported <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> for the age increase.|$|E

For <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> to qualify for tax exemption, and for the employer to get a deduction, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> must meet minimum participation, vesting, funding, and operational standards.|$|R

As such, <b>the</b> <b>Plan</b> should be read in conjunction with the applicable PPS and relevant provincial <b>plans,</b> including <b>the</b> Greenbelt <b>Plan,</b> Niagara Escarpment Plan, and Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.|$|R
5|$|As first {{proposed}} in 1944, the western terminus of I-70 was Denver, {{along the corridor}} of US40. The portion across the Rocky Mountains was added to <b>the</b> <b>plans,</b> after lobbying by Colorado officials, following the US6 corridor. The origins of both the US40 and US6 pre-date the U.S. System of numbered highways, using established transcontinental trails.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there would}} be only one chance {{to carry out the}} test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a {{rehearsal}} should be carried out to allow <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical, but gave permission, and later agreed that it contributed {{to the success of the}} Trinity test.|$|E

5|$|Debts {{continued}} to increase, as the commissioners borrowed {{more money to}} fund the improvements. The new weir and lock at Pickerings failed in 1761 and both had to be rebuilt.

5|$|Detailed {{floor plans}} of the tower were posted on the New York City's Department of Finance website in May 2011.

50|$|Owing to <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> for <b>the</b> {{transformation}} of <b>the</b> Reichshauptstadt <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> for this curve was not realised. Instead, spurs for a junction to Anhalter Bahnhof were built with <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> {{for a further}} underground section to Görlitzer Bahnhof and, south of the Landwehr Canal, four tunnel spurs taking the North-South Line to <b>the</b> <b>planned</b> S-Bahn station Hornstraße.|$|R

5|$|During the Cold War, {{camouflage}} {{was partially}} abandoned; for example, glossy anti-flash white was used on aircraft as protection from nuclear flash, including high-flying Royal Air Force nuclear weapon-carrying V-bombers.

5|$|In 1972, {{discussion}} {{started with}} <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> to connect Meland, Flatøy and Lindøy with bridges. This {{was passed by}} the Parliament of Norway in May 1975, and consisted of the Krossnessundet Bridge between Flatøy and Meland, which opened in November 1978. The Hagelsund Bridge opened on 1 April 1982 and connected Flatøy to Lindås and Knarvik, thus also connecting Meland and Lindås. Both bridges were partially financed with tolls. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> for a pontoon bridge were presented to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications on 31 March 1981. They supported the choice of a pontoon bridge. The decision to construct the bridge was taken by parliament on 9 December 1987, but they demanded that a larger ship channel be constructed.|$|E
