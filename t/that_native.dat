Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, natives in {{intermarriage}} seem {{to specialize}} more than native couples, possibly indicating <b>that</b> <b>natives</b> view {{female labor force}} participation differently than immigrants, and <b>that</b> intermarried <b>natives</b> adapt to their partners’ views in order to mitigate conflict potential within the partnership. Hence, native couples may have more egalitarian views which may lead to less specialization compared to couples with more traditional role models.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given <b>that</b> <b>Native</b> Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, the New Zealand {{government}} {{set aside}} Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware <b>that</b> <b>native</b> birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and kiwi {{from the mainland}} to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kakapo population within 6 years.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} <b>that</b> <b>Native</b> Americans living along the Columbia River {{as early as}} 10,000years ago visited the Bull Run {{watershed}} in search of food. Within the past few thousand years they created trails over the Cascade Range and around Mount Hood, near {{the upper part of}} the Bull Run watershed. By the mid-19th century, pioneers used these trails to cross the mountains from east to west to reach the fertile Willamette Valley. In the 1890s, the City of Portland, searching for sources of clean drinking water, chose the Bull Run River. Dam-building, road construction, and legal action to protect the watershed began shortly thereafter, and Bull Run water began to flow through a large pipe to the city in 1895.|$|E

5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means <b>that</b> <b>native</b> species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the northern crested newt. Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E
5|$|The 400-year period {{following}} {{the collapse of}} Roman rule {{is the most difficult}} to interpret in the history of Wales. After the Roman departure from Britain in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples. Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades, some previously maintained <b>that</b> <b>native</b> Britons were displaced by the invaders. This idea has been discarded in the face of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic, or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas.|$|E

In 1784, at the Treaty at Fort Stanwick, much of Pennsylvania's Northern Tier, including the Kettle Creek watershed, was purchased from the Iroquois, Delaware, and Wyandott for $7000. The Indians retained hunting rights in the area until 1804.|$|E

Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption <b>that</b> <b>native</b> pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E

5|$|Roman {{influence}} beyond Hadrian's Wall {{does not}} appear to have had a major impact on settlement patterns, with Iron Age hill forts and promontory forts continuing to be occupied through the early Medieval period. These often had defences of dry stone or timber laced walls, sometimes with a palisade. The large numbers of these forts has been taken to suggest peripatetic monarchies and aristocracies, moving around their domains to control and administer them. In the Northern and Western Isles the sites of Iron Age Brochs and wheel houses continued to be occupied, but were gradually replaced with less imposing cellular houses. There are a handful of major timber halls in the south, comparable to those excavated in Anglo-Saxon England and dated to the 7th century. In the areas of Scandinavian settlement in the islands and along the coast a lack of timber meant <b>that</b> <b>native</b> materials had to be adopted for house building, often combining layers of stone with turf.|$|E
