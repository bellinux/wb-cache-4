5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E
5|$|Discovering <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> satraps and {{military}} governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed {{several of them}} as examples {{on his way to}} Susa. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois was bitterly {{disappointed}} <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid {{not support}} {{him during his}} 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary concern was world peace, and he railed against military actions, such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.|$|E

50|$|Machado {{was also}} a minor poet, writing mostly casual poetry of {{extraordinary}} correctness and beauty. His reputation as a novelist has kept his poetry in print, and recent criticism has regarded it better than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries.|$|R

5|$|Fielding was {{concerned}} with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in {{the actions of the}} character Merital in Love in Several Masques in controlling the behaviour of Helen and <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.|$|E
5|$|Expecting to die soon, Agârbiceanu {{worked on}} a {{definitive}} corpus of his writings, which began printing at the state-run Editura pentru Literatură {{under the care of}} G. Pienescu and Mihai Șora. When he was led to believe <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works would not be allowed for publishing, he retook possession of all the manuscripts he had sent in, including some previously unpublished writings. The volumes were already available by that time. The writer died in Cluj in 1963, and was buried in the city's Hajongard Cemetery in a grave topped by a white marble cross.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus vanquished a Cuman {{army that}} invaded Hungary in 1282. Hungary also survived a Mongol {{invasion}} in 1285. Ladislaus had, by that time, become so unpopular <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects {{accused him of}} inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary. After he imprisoned his wife in 1286, {{he lived with his}} Cuman mistresses. During the last years of his life, he wandered throughout the country with his Cuman allies, but he was unable to control the most powerful lords and bishops any more. Pope Nicholas IV planned to declare a crusade against him, but three Cuman assassins murdered Ladislaus.|$|E

Milton Friedman, the monetarist economist who was an intellectual architect of free-market policies, was a primary influence on Reagan.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} promotion, Curtis joined the small brig HMS Otter in Newfoundland and there {{spent several years}} {{operating}} off the Labrador coastline, becoming very familiar with the local geography and the Inuit peoples of the region. In a report he wrote for Lord Dartmouth, Curtis opined that although the inland regions of Labrador were barren, the coast was an ideal place for a seasonal cod fishery. He also formed a good opinion of the native people, applauding their healthy and peaceful lifestyle. Curtis made numerous exploratory voyages along the Labrador coast and formed close links with the Inuit tribes and Moravian missionaries in the region. His notes and despatches were presented to the Royal Academy by Daines Barrington in 1774, although accusations later surfaced <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> observations were plagiarised from the notes of a local officer, Captain George Cartwright.|$|E
5|$|The crisis showed Muhammad <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men {{had reached}} {{the limits of their}} endurance. He sent word to Ghatafan, trying to pay for their {{defection}} and offering them a third of Medina's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiating with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement, protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with Medina, and the Confederacy's internal dissension had thereby been increased.|$|E
5|$|Miller was {{discharged}} from the RAAF on 26 June 1946, {{and returned to his}} job at Vacuum Oil. Miller resented the fact <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colleagues had avoided the hazards of war and moved steadily up the ladder and regarded his job as demeaning. Under such circumstances, Miller contemplated quitting Australian cricket and accepting a professional contract with Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League, valued at £1,000 per year, for three seasons. With advertising and commercial commitments likely to triple this figure, playing in England would have been approximately ten times more lucrative than continuing in Australia. However, Miller was worried that his impulsive style would be curtailed by the pressures of professionalism. At that time, the Board of Control's policy stipulated that any player that signed with a professional league in England could not represent Australia. Miller's contract would see him in England until he was 30, effectively ending his career for Australia. Furthermore, it would have prevented him from playing Australian football during the winter. Miller weighed it up and opted to sign the contract that tied him to Rawtenstall, with his duties to start with the onset of the English season in April 1947.|$|E

5|$|During the 7th century CE, a settled {{community}} {{known as}} Vijayapura, a tributary to the Srivijaya empire, {{was thought to}} have existed in northwest Borneo. The earliest kingdom, supposed to have existed from the 9th century, was Po Ni, as recorded in the Chinese geographical treatise Taiping Huanyu Ji. It was believed that Po Ni existed {{at the mouth of}} Brunei River and was the predecessor to the Bruneian Empire. As China had been under the conquest of Mongol Empire, all Chinese vassal state subsequently controlled by the Mongol emperors of China. Early in 1292, Kublai Khan is said to have sending an expedition to northern Borneo, before departing for the invasion of Java in 1293. As a result of this campaign, it is believed <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> followers in addition to other Chinese traders eventually settled and established their own colony at Kinabatangan River. In the 14th century, Brunei became the vassal state of Majapahit but in 1370 transferred its allegiance to Ming dynasty of China. The Maharaja Karna of Borneo then paid a visit to Nanjing with his family until his death. He was succeeded by his son Hsia-wang who agreed to send tribute to China once every three years. Since then, Chinese junks came to northern Borneo with cargoes of spices, bird nests, shark fins, camphor, rattan and pearls. More Chinese traders eventually settled in Kinabatangan, as stated in both Brunei and Sulu records. A younger sister of Huang Senping (Ong Sum Ping), the Governor of the Chinese settlement then married Sultan Ahmad of Brunei. Perhaps due to this relationship, a burial place with 2,000 wooden coffins, some estimated to be 1,000 years old, were discovered in Agop Batu Tulug Caves and around the Kinabatangan Valley area. It is believed that this type of funeral culture was brought by traders from Mainland China and Indochina to northern Borneo as similar wooden coffins were also discovered in these countries. In addition with the discovery of Chinese ceramics from a shipwreck in Tanjung Simpang Mengayau which estimated to be from 960–1127 A.D. of Song dynasty and Vietnamese Đông Sơn drum in Bukit Timbang Dayang on Banggi Island that had existed between 2,000–2,500 years ago.|$|E
