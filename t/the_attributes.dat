5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attributes</b> of God must, Paley argues, be 'adequate to the magnitude, extent, and {{multiplicity}} of his operations'.|$|E
5|$|Beings having many of <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of European vampires {{appear in}} the {{folklore}} of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and India. Classified as vampires, all share the thirst for blood.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> {{values of}} one object {{may depend on}} <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> values of related objects, <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> {{generation}} process assigns values collectively.|$|R
5000|$|Attribute declarations, which define {{properties}} of <b>attributes.</b> Again <b>the</b> properties include <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> name and target namespace. <b>The</b> <b>attribute</b> type constrains <b>the</b> values that <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> may take. An attribute declaration may {{also include a}} default value or a fixed value (which is then the only value <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> may take.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Locked. A {{simulation}} controls <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> and may update <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> value. A simulation [...] "owns" [...] <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> if it {{has that}} attribute locked. A simulation [...] "owns" [...] the object {{if it has}} its id attribute locked.|$|R
5|$|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams are SEAL {{teams with}} an added {{underwater}} delivery capability {{who use the}} SDV MK VIII and the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS), submersibles that provides NSW with an unprecedented capability that combines <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of clandestine underwater mobility and the combat swimmer.|$|E
5|$|Stela 32 is a {{fragmented}} monument {{with a foreign}} Teotihuacan-style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of the central Mexican storm god Tlaloc, including his goggle eyes and tasselled headdress.|$|E
5|$|Stela 9 {{was erected}} {{on the west}} side of StructureA-3. It is badly damaged and one section is missing. The stela depicts Wat'ul Chatel with <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of the Maize God and {{describes}} him invoking the Vision Serpent.|$|E
30|$|When BF_a ∧ (BF_a-m∨ BF_i)=BF_a, {{it implies}} that <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> set denoted by the i-th row of Table  2 {{includes}} <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> set of <b>the</b> authorization conjunction denoted by BF_a. <b>The</b> <b>attribute</b> set denoted by the i-th row of Table  2 is written as b_i.|$|R
50|$|A {{closely related}} term is participation. If an {{attribute}} inheres in a subject, then {{the subject is}} said to participate in <b>the</b> <b>attribute.</b> For example, if <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> in Athens inheres in Socrates, then Socrates is said to participate in <b>the</b> <b>attribute,</b> in Athens.|$|R
5000|$|... is {{the total}} number of <b>attributes</b> where <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> of A is 0 and <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> of B is 1.|$|R
5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny <b>the</b> <b>attributes,</b> qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|Mallana (Mallikaarjuna) of Andhra Pradesh and Mailara of Karnataka are {{sometimes}} identified with Khandoba (Mallari, Malhari, Mairaj). Khandoba is {{also associated with}} Bhairava, who is connected with Brāhmanahatya (murder of a Brahmin). Devotees emphasize that Khandoba is a full avatar of Shiva, and not a partial avatar like Bhairava or Virabhadra. He accepts <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of the demon king— his horse, weapons and royal insignia.|$|E
5|$|Other {{deviations}} from the texts may appear in <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> held by the divine couple. Parvati may hold a mirror, instead of the lotus. Shiva may be shown holding the trishula (trident) and damaru (drum) in his back hands. Regional variations in iconography may also occur. In Bengal, Shiva holds a karttari (knife), the ceremonial weapon that a Hindu groom from Bengal is expected to carry in a wedding.|$|E

3000|$|... be {{the visual}} {{reliability}} of <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> a, {{extracted from the}} visual evidence observed at frame k. The visual reliability differs according to <b>the</b> <b>attribute.</b>|$|R
50|$|Attributes in ER {{diagrams}} {{are usually}} modeled as an oval {{with the name}} of <b>the</b> <b>attribute,</b> linked to <b>the</b> entity or relationship that contains <b>the</b> <b>attribute.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant {{that he is not}} actually God, but that he is speaking with <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of God.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter fleet endured several {{attempts}} to procure successor aircraft to the type; {{in the case}} of the Dassault Mirage III this had been due to excessive cost overruns and poor project management rather than <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of the Hunter itself. A second attempt to replace the Hunter resulted in a competition between the French Dassault Milan and the U.S. LTV A-7 Corsair II. Although the A-7 was eventually chosen as the winner, it would not be purchased and further 30 refurbished Hunters (22 F.58As and eight T.68 trainers) were purchased in 1974 instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
3000|$|Step 4 Since <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> VC is a {{beneficial}} <b>attribute,</b> <b>the</b> maximum loss occurs when <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> {{takes on a}} minimum value. Similarly, the maximum losses occur when CF and PI are at their minimum values.|$|R
30|$|Using {{the same}} logic for a non-beneficial <b>attribute,</b> <b>the</b> minimum loss is taken as zero when <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> value is at minimum and the maximum loss is taken as one when <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> {{possesses}} <b>the</b> maximum value.|$|R
30|$|The above {{measures}} {{can be easily}} transferred to cross-database situations in several aspects. With <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> provided database, <b>the</b> raw hypergraph model can be constructed directly. For those attribute unavailable or partly available databases, we can first use the classic feature extraction models to obtain signature s. Using the raw features as inputs to <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> learning models, we can obtain <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> vector a and <b>the</b> binary <b>attribute</b> value o as well.|$|R
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} God {{is too great}} for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E
5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E
50|$|To {{replace the}} value of an {{existing}} <b>attribute,</b> Use <b>the</b> replace keyword. If <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> is multi-valued, <b>the</b> client must specify {{the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> to delete.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{the loss}} {{equations}} for non-beneficial/beneficial attributes are derived for linear, quadratic and cubic functions. In case of linear function, the loss {{is assumed to}} be proportional to the deviation of <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> from <b>the</b> best value of <b>the</b> <b>attribute.</b> Similarly, in quadratic loss function the loss {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the square of the deviation of <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> from <b>the</b> best value of <b>the</b> <b>attribute.</b> Loss is assumed to be proportional to the cube of the deviations in case of cubic loss functions.|$|R
50|$|To store {{new types}} of information, the {{experimental}} RFC 1464 suggests a structured format in TXT data fields. The format consists of <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> name followed by the value of <b>the</b> <b>attribute.</b> <b>The</b> name and value are separated by an equals sign (=).|$|R
5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{to erect a}} further seven high-quality stelae until AD736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement. The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> {{of a variety of}} deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.|$|E
5|$|High Voltage Software {{spent over}} a year {{creating}} Lego Racers car building mechanics. The game's lead programmer, Dwight Luetscher, created a formula that {{was used by the}} game's artists to create individual Lego elements in the game. The pieces available to the player were selected from hundreds of Lego elements by the developers, chosen first by aesthetics, and then analysed to see if they would fit into Luetscher's formula. The developers chose to affect <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of the player's car, such as handling, acceleration and top speed, through how many bricks are placed on the chassis, as this is simpler to understand for the game's main age demographic.|$|E
50|$|To delete an {{attribute}} from an entry, use the keyword delete and the changetype designator modify. If <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> is multi-valued, <b>the</b> client must specify {{the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> to delete.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} how to mark up information about a movie and its director using the schema.org schemas and microdata. In order to mark up <b>the</b> data <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> [...] along with the URL of the schema is used. <b>The</b> <b>attribute</b> [...] defines <b>the</b> scope of the itemtype. The kind of the current item can be defined by using <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> [...]|$|R
