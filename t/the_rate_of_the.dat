5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{that tried to}} explain how prions replicate in a protein-only manner was the heterodimer model. This model assumed that a single PrPSc molecule binds to a single PrPC molecule and catalyzes its conversion into PrPSc. The two PrPSc molecules then come apart and can go on to convert more PrPC. However, a model of prion replication must explain both how prions propagate, and why their spontaneous appearance is so rare. Manfred Eigen showed that the heterodimer model requires PrPSc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst, increasing <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conversion reaction {{by a factor of}} around 1015. This problem does not arise if PrPSc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid, where cooperativity may act as a barrier to spontaneous conversion. What is more, despite considerable effort, infectious monomeric PrPSc has never been isolated.|$|E

25|$|The rate of a RAFT polymerization, that is, {{the rate}} of {{conversion}} of monomer into polymer, mainly depends on <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Propagation reaction (Figure 5) because {{the rate of}} initiation and termination are {{much higher than the}} rate of propagation.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} it is shown that for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{nonlinear}} power amplifier behavioural modelling, <b>the</b> sampling <b>rate</b> {{can be set}} to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal, rather than to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal by making use of Zhu’s generalized sampling theorem. This claim is supported by measurements on a basestation power amplifier. The findings are that the model error obtained when the output signal is sampled at <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal is approximately 1. 5 dB higher than when <b>the</b> sampling <b>rate</b> is set to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal. However, if a sampling <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> twice <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal is used, which is still typically, much lower than <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal, the degradation is only 0. 2 dB.
