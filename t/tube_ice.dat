40|$|Brinicles are hollow <b>tubes</b> of <b>ice</b> from centimeters to {{meters in}} length that form under {{floating}} sea {{ice in the}} polar oceans when dense, cold brine drains downward from sea ice to seawater close to its freezing point. When this extremely cold brine leaves the ice, it freezes the water it comes into contact with: a hollow <b>tube</b> of <b>ice</b> - a brinicle - growing downward around the plume of descending brine. We show that brinicles {{can be understood as}} a form of the self-assembled tubular precipitation structures termed chemical gardens, which are plantlike structures formed on placing together a soluble metal salt, often {{in the form of a}} seed crystal, and an aqueous solution of one of many anions, often silicate. On one hand, in the case of classical chemical gardens, an osmotic pressure difference across a semipermeable precipitation membrane that filters solutions by rejecting the solute leads to an inflow of water and to its rupture. The internal solution, generally being lighter than the external solution, flows up through the break, and as it does so, a tube grows upward by precipitation around the jet of internal solution. Such chemical-garden tubes can grow to many centimeters in length. In the case of brinicles, on the other hand, in floating sea ice we have porous ice in a mushy layer that filters out water, by freezing it, and allows concentrated brine through. Again there is an osmotic pressure difference leading to a continuing ingress of seawater in a siphon pump mechanism that is sustained as long as the ice continues to freeze. Because the brine that is pumped out is denser than the seawater and descends rather than rises, a brinicle is a downward-growing <b>tube</b> of <b>ice,</b> an inverse chemical garden. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

50|$|Heavy {{transportation}} airplanes may occasionally have {{to cross}} a thunderstorm line associated with a cold front or a squall. They {{may not be able}} to overfly the cumulonimbus, because at 36000 feet, the aircraft may be in or near what is known as the coffin corner (stall speed = Vne), thus making it structurally dangerous to climb higher. However, some cells can rise to 70000 feet. Another option would be to navigate around the cells. This is strongly discouraged, however, because in the opening, new cells can grow very rapidly and engulf the aircraft. Whenever an aircraft moves to the west and crosses a thunderstorm line, the pilot will first encounter a line of powerful and laminar updraughts (that are not thermal but dynamic). The pilot should refrain from pushing the stick to try to maintain a constant altitude (similar to mountain waves), because pushing the stick can cause his airspeed to increase to the point of hitting the yellow arc (on the airspeed indicator). An airspeed this high is not permissible in turbulent conditions and may lead to break-up of the aircraft. Indeed, when the pilot exits the updraught zone, he will encounter very strong turbulence due to the shear between rising and sinking air. If the airspeed is too high at this point, the airplane will break apart. The crash of Flight AF 447 is indirectly related to this situation: the pilot, being short on fuel, opted for the shortest path while crossing the thunderstorm line associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and the pitot <b>tubes</b> <b>iced</b> over. What followed is known.|$|R
