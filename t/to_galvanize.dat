The action was a key step in the plan to close the $38 billion shortfall in the 2003–2004 budget. The increase tripled the vehicle license fee for the average car owner, and began appearing in renewal notices starting August 1.

In fiscal year 2016, the first funding for the initiative was awarded, with $130 million allocated to NIH to build a national, large-scale research participant group, called a cohort, and $70 million allocated to NIH's National Cancer Institute as part of PMI for Oncology. The PMI Cohort Program will seek to extend precision medicine to all diseases by building a national research cohort of 1 million or more U.S. participants.

25|$|On 6 February 1943, Mussolini {{carried out}} the most wide-ranging {{government}} reshuffle in 21 years of Fascist power. Almost all the ministers were changed: the most important heads which fell were those of Galeazzo Ciano (the son-in-law of the duce), Dino Grandi, Giuseppe Bottai, Guido Buffarini Guidi and Alessandro Pavolini. The two most important goals of this operation (placating public opinion and vital segments of the Fascist Party itself) were not achieved, since the situation was too compromised. Among the new appointments, the new Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs (the Duce took over the department himself) Giuseppe Bastianini, a serious Umbrian, {{was well aware of}} the seriousness of the situation. Bastianini's strategy was twofold: on the one hand, like Mussolini, he tried to argue in favor of a peace between Germany and the USSR, and on the other he aimed to create a block of Balkan countries (the junior Axis partners Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria) led by Italy, who should act as a counterbalance to the excessive power of the German Reich in Europe. In April the Duce took two other important actions: on 14 April he substituted the chief of the police, Carmine Senise (a man of the King) with Lorenzo Chierici, while five days later he changed the young and inexperienced secretary of the Party, Aldo Vidussoni, with Carlo Scorza. While Senise was accused of inefficiency during the March strikes in northern Italy, with the appointment of Scorza, a hardliner, Mussolini wanted <b>to</b> <b>galvanize</b> the Party.|$|E

500|$|Historian Richard Middleton (2007) {{argues that}} Pontiac's vision, courage, persistence, and {{organizational}} abilities {{allowed him to}} activate a remarkable coalition of Indian nations prepared to fight successfully against the British. Though the idea to gain independence for all Native Americans west of the Allegheny Mountains did not originate with him but with two Seneca leaders, Tahaiadoris and Guyasuta, by February 1763 Pontiac appeared to embrace the idea. At an emergency council meeting, Pontiac clarified his military support of the broad Seneca plan and worked <b>to</b> <b>galvanize</b> other nations into the military operation that he helped lead, in direct contradiction to traditional Indian leadership and tribal structure. [...] He achieved this coordination through the distribution of war belts: first to the northern Ojibwa and Ottawa near Michilimackinac; and then after the failure to seize Detroit by stratagem, to the Mingo (Seneca) on the upper Allegheny River, the Ohio Delaware near Fort Pitt, and the more westerly Miami, Kickapoo, Piankashaw and Wea peoples.|$|E

50|$|Galvalume {{was invented}} by Bethlehem Steel in 1972.

Galvalume has a cousin, Galvalume Plus. The only difference is Plus has a thin, clear acrylic coating. Because Galvalume Plus can be roll-formed dry without vanishing oil, it is very easy to form and install safely.|$|R

500|$|Throughout September, Agnew {{was in the}} news, {{generally}} as {{a result}} of what one reporter called his [...] "offensive and sometimes dangerous banality".

[...] He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain's prewar prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message [...] "Spiro Agnew for Vice President" [...] against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter, before a final message: [...] "This would be funny if it weren't so serious." [...] Agnew's comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace.

500|$|Once there, Li Mi {{convened a}} council of war to {{determine}} his army's course of action. Li Mi himself advocated a passive and cautious stance, arguing that Wang's troops {{were not only}} experienced veterans, but that, as they were virtually cut off from retreat due to the Luo river, the canals, {{and the presence of}} his own army, they would fight with desperate courage—a situation already described and recommended as a strategy <b>to</b> <b>galvanize</b> one's troops by no lesser authority than Sun Tzu, and doubtlessly familiar to both opposing commanders. In addition, while lack of supplies constrained Wang to seek an early and decisive engagement, Li Mi's own forces had time on their side and could afford to sit out and wait until Wang's provisions were utterly exhausted. Most of Li's generals, however, vehemently disagreed, regarding Wang's army as an exhausted and demoralized force, and pointing to their own considerable numerical superiority. At this juncture, the heterogeneous nature of Li's army, cobbled together from bandit chieftains and Sui defectors, came into play: Li was well aware that his commanders were [...] "potentially autonomous warlords who commanded the personal loyalty of their own subordinates", and that he could not afford to antagonize them. Therefore, against his better judgement, he was forced to agree to an immediate confrontation. Nevertheless, Li Mi decided to await Wang's attack instead of attacking himself. The main host, under Li Mi, remained on the Mang hills, while a detachment under Shan Xiongxin moved down to the plain just north of Yanshi and established a camp there. The two camps, in the description of David Graff, formed [...] "an inverted letter 'L' running east along the mountain and then turning sharply south across the plain to Yanshi". Li Mi felt confident in his superior position, which gave him ample time to descend the hills and move against Wang, should he try to cross the canal for an attack. If Wang attacked either of his camps, the troops of the other would come to aid, flanking Wang's forces. Confident in the naturally defensive layout of his hilltop camp, however, he neglected fortifying it.|$|E

Aluminum cannot be directly embedded in concrete, since the metal reacts with the alkalis in cement. The conduit may be coated to prevent corrosion by incidental contact with concrete.
