5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants.

The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to <b>those</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E

He forced the surrender of Taunton to the King without engaging in battle, and established a garrison in Taunton Castle.|$|E
