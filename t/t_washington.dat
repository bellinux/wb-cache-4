History professor Timothy Gilfoyle wrote that Banks' talent for baseball was discovered by Bill Blair, a family friend who scouted for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League. Other sources say Banks was noticed by Cool Papa Bell of the Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, {{such as the}} ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited {{influential}} {{white men}} to sit on her school board of trustees, gaining participation by James Gamble (of Procter & Gamble) and Thomas H. White (of White Sewing Machines). When Booker <b>T.</b> <b>Washington</b> of Tuskegee Institute visited in 1912, he advised her {{of the importance of}} gaining support by white benefactors for funding. Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.|$|E
5|$|John Chilembwe, born locally {{in around}} 1871, {{received}} his early education at a Church of Scotland mission and later met Joseph Booth, a radical Baptist missionary {{who ran the}} Zambezi Industrial Mission. Booth preached a form of egalitarianism and his progressive attitude towards race attracted Chilembwe's attention. Under Booth's patronage, Chilembwe travelled to the United States to study at a theological college in Virginia. There he mixed in African-American circles and was influenced by stories of the abolitionist John Brown and the egalitarianist Booker <b>T.</b> <b>Washington.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The 3-4 nose tackle is {{considered}} the most physically demanding position in football. His primary responsibility is to control the [...] "A" [...] gaps, the two openings between the center and guards, and not get pushed back into his linebackers. If a running play comes through one of those gaps, he must make the tackle or control {{what is called the}} [...] "jump-through"—the guard or center who is trying to get out to the linebackers. The ideal nose tackle has to be much bigger than 4-3 DTs, weighing around 335 pounds or more. An AFC Personnel director used <b>Ted</b> <b>Washington</b> as an example of an ideal nose tackle: [...] "In his prime, <b>Ted</b> <b>Washington</b> was the ideal guy. He was huge, had long arms, and you couldn't budge him. He could hold off a 320-pound lineman with one hand and make the tackle with the other." ...|$|R
5|$|There {{are three}} primary public school {{district}}s in the city of Tulsa. Tulsa Public Schools, with nine high schools and over 41,000 students, is the second-largest school district in Oklahoma and includes Booker <b>T.</b> <b>Washington</b> High School, a magnet school judged to be the 65th best high school in the United States by Newsweek magazine in 2008. Each with one upper high school, Jenks and Union schools are the city's two other primary districts, covering the southern portion of the city near the towns of Jenks and Broken Arrow. In 2006, there were more than 90,000 students attending Tulsa County's public schools.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to football, Lockett {{also was a}} top competitor in basketball and track. In basketball, his team reached the state championship game in basketball, where Booker <b>T.</b> <b>Washington</b> defeated El Reno High School 72–59 to win the 2011 OSSA 5A Championship. He was voted to the all-tournament second team. In track & field, Lockett {{was one of the}} state's top sprinters. He captured a regional title in the 100-meter dash at the 2011 State 5A Regional, placing first with a time of 10.85 seconds. He earned third-place finishes in both the 100-meter dash (10.95 s) and the 200-meter dash (21.90 s) at the 5A state finals.|$|E
5|$|Information about Chilembwe’s Church {{before the}} {{rebellion}} is scant, but his ideology proved popular and {{he developed a}} strong local following. For {{at least the first}} 12 years of his ministry, he preached ideas of African self-respect and advancement through education, hard work and personal responsibility, as advocated by Booker <b>T.</b> <b>Washington,</b> and he encouraged his followers to adopt European-style dress and habits. His activities were initially supported by white protestant missionaries., although his relations with Catholic missions were less friendly. he Mission's schools meanwhile began teaching racial equality, based on Christian teaching and anti-colonialism. Many of his followers came from the local middle-class, who had similarly adopted European customs. Chilembwe's acceptance of European culture created an unorthodox anti-colonial ideology based around a form of nationalism, rather than a desire to restore the pre-colonial social order.|$|E

5|$|Letitia Woods Brown (née Letitia Christine Woods) {{was born}} on October24, 1915, to Evadne Clark Adam Woods and Matthew Woods in Tuskegee, Alabama, U.S. One of three daughters, Letitia was the second child. The Woodses were a middle-class family; both parents worked as {{teachers}} at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), an industrial college established by Booker <b>T.</b> <b>Washington.</b> Matthew Woods was educated at the Tuskegee Institute. Letitia's mother Evadne Woods was one of twelve children born to Lewis Adams and Theodosia Evadne Clark. Her father Lewis Adams was a former slave who became a Tuskegee Normal School trustee and a commissioner in 1881. They all served as educators throughout the southern USA.|$|E
5|$|When she died, Tubman {{was buried}} with semi-military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn. The city commemorated {{her life with}} a plaque on the courthouse. Although it showed pride for her many achievements, its use of dialect ("I nebber run my train off de track"), {{apparently}} chosen for its authenticity, {{has been criticized for}} undermining her stature as an American patriot and dedicated humanitarian. Still, the dedication ceremony was a powerful tribute to her memory, and Booker <b>T.</b> <b>Washington</b> delivered the keynote address. The Harriet Tubman home was abandoned after 1920, but was later renovated by the AME Zion Church. Today, it welcomes visitors as a museum and education center.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the new century, Du Bois emerged as a {{spokesperson}} for his race, second only to Booker <b>T.</b> <b>Washington.</b> Washington was the director of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and wielded tremendous influence within the African-American and white communities. Washington was the architect of the Atlanta Compromise, an unwritten deal he struck in 1895 with Southern white leaders who dominated state governments after Reconstruction. Essentially the agreement provided that Southern blacks, who overwhelmingly lived in rural communities, would submit to the current discrimination, segregation, disenfranchisement, and non-unionized employment; that Southern whites would permit blacks to receive a basic education, some economic opportunities, and justice within the legal system; and that Northern whites would invest in Southern enterprises and fund black educational charities.Lewis, pp. 180–181.Logan, Rayford Whittingham (1997), The Betrayal of the Negro, from Rutherford B.

5|$|Frequently drawing {{comparisons}} to <b>Ted</b> <b>Washington</b> and Shaun Rogers, Cody was {{considered one of}} the rare two-gap defensive tackles that NFL teams covet for their 3–4 type defenses.

One of the teams interested in Cody was rumored to be his near-hometown Miami Dolphins, who lost their veteran defensive tackle Jason Ferguson to injury during the 2009 season.|$|R
