25|$|Among {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems facing education reformers was the scarcity of qualified teachers, {{which has led to}} a serious stunting of educational development. In 1986 there were about 8 million primary- and middle-school teachers in China, but many lacked professional training. Estimates indicated that {{in order to meet the}} goals of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and realize compulsory 9-year education, the system needed 1 million new teachers for primary schools, 750,000 new teachers for junior middle schools, and 300,000 new teachers for senior middle schools. Estimates predict, however, that the demand for <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> drop in the late 1990s because of an anticipated decrease in primary-school enrollments.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of {{what needs to}} be accomplished {{by the end of the}} course. Students will understand what is expected of them and <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> know what they need to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of {{what needs to be}} accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} will be {{interactive}} Web-based portal called Learning Village {{that would be}} fully functioning by fall 2010. The Learning Village program will give DPS the ability to digitize its textbooks, curriculum and lesson plans. <b>Teachers</b> <b>will</b> have access to students' assessment results and prospective lesson plans to more quickly diagnosis struggling students. Parents can log into the system to track their students' progress, print additional worksheets and view cumulative test results for a teacher's entire class. The purpose of the Learning Village tool is {{to serve as a}} unified portal to connect students, teachers, parents and principals, and deliver real-time learning. DPS will also use $14.2 million in federal stimulus and Title I dollars for netbooks for all 36,000 students and 4,000 teachers in grades 6–12 for access to technology to support hands-on learning.

25|$|In a November 2010 white paper, Gove {{declared}} reforms {{would include}} the compulsory study of foreign languages up {{to the age of}} 16, and a shake-up of league tables in which schools are ranked higher for the number of pupils taking GCSEs in five core subjects: English; mathematics; science; a language; and one of the humanities. He also announced that experts such as historian Simon Schama will be brought in to review the curriculum, and that targets are to be introduced for primary schools for the first time. Additionally, trainee <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> spend more time in the classroom, there would be more assessment of teacher training applicants—including tests of character and emotional intelligence—and former troops will be offered sponsorship to retrain as teachers to improve discipline. Teachers are also expected to receive guidance on how to search pupils for more items, including mobile phones and pornography, and when they can use force.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for The New York Times Book Review, noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations. She wrote, [...] "Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise." [...] Helen Adams Masten of the Saturday Review called the book Geisel's tour de force and wrote, [...] "Parents and <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their {{children are going to}} have the exciting experience of learning that they can read after all." [...] Polly Goodwin of the Chicago Sunday Tribune predicted that The Cat in the Hat would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to [...] "look with distinct distaste on the drab adventures of standard primer characters".|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the voice}} student has {{become aware of}} the {{physical}} processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them.

2500|$|After {{referring}} to the bequest of the Outhwaite family and making placatory remarks about the Marist Brothers, Liston welcomed the Christian Brothers. He {{said that they were}} [...] "here at the invitation of the Bishop to take charge of St Peter's school and to have their part, along with the Marist Brothers and other religious communities, in our Catholic education system. They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their care will be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> not do for them what they should do for themselves. The thought of the years ahead and of the eternal life will be regarded as of first importance. <b>Teachers</b> <b>will</b> feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with unfaltering courage". At the conclusion of his speech, Bishop Liston said, [...] "This is a very happy day for me indeed for I owe much more than I can say to the training I received {{at the hands of the}} Christian Brothers in Dunedin long years ago".|$|E

2500|$|Most Protestant {{denominations}} require pastors, ministers, deacons, and elders to be formally ordained. The early Protestant reformer Martin Bucer, for instance, cited Ephesians 4 {{and other}} Pauline letters {{in support of}} this. While the process of ordination varies among the denominations and the specific church office to be held, it may require preparatory training such as seminary or Bible college, election by the congregation or appointment by a higher authority, and expectations of a lifestyle that requires a higher standard.

2500|$|Some <b>teachers</b> <b>will</b> use {{the phrase}} “culture of poverty” as a {{taxonomy}} of lower socioeconomic students and will use child poverty {{as an excuse for}} why they are not successful with certain students. The culture of poverty acknowledges the past factors of the initial condition of poverty were results of racial segregation and discrimination, and substandard housing and education, ignoring personal responsibility, yet puts the blame on the “behaviors and attitudes of the poor”, as the cause of present poverty. This idea ignores the very fact that the current housing and education in poverty is still substandard and plays a large role in the cause of present poverty,. [...] Some people point out that poverty is a choice; that single parent families are more often to be below the poverty line.|$|E
2500|$|One element {{which is}} crucial {{to the success of the}} GRR model is the notion related to 'instructional scaffolding', which is {{grounded}} in Vygotsky's concept of the [...] "zone of proximal development" [...] (ZPD). [...] This is described as the distance between the actual developmental level of a learner as determined by their independent problem solving abilities and the level of potential development through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. That is, the distance between what the children can do without assistance and what they can accomplish with the assistance of more capable peers. The zone of proximal development can be applied as an umbrella over the entire GRR model. Students are given support in the form of scaffolding and differentiate instruction throughout all four phases of the process. Teachers may offer more challenging material to high-achieving students, and assist lower-achieving students in needs-based groups. <b>Teachers</b> <b>will</b> support students as needed throughout all four steps finally allowing for the eventual independence of each student. The GRR model [...] "...assumes that [...] will need some guidance in reaching that stage of independence and that it is precisely the teacher's role to provide such guidance".|$|E
