5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also {{the notion that the}} net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E
25|$|About 70 {{percent of}} ECT {{patients}} are women. This {{may be due}} to the fact <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be diagnosed with depression. Older and more affluent patients are also more likely to receive ECT. The use of ECT is not as common in ethnic minorities.|$|E
25|$|Wife beating {{was made}} illegal nationally in the United States by 1920. Although the exact rates are disputed, {{there is a}} large body of {{cross-cultural}} evidence that women are subjected to domestic violence significantly more often than men. In addition, there is broad consensus <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> often subjected to severe forms of abuse {{and are more likely to}} be injured by an abusive partner, and this is exacerbated by economic or social dependence.|$|E
50|$|From his {{psychological}} work, Marston {{became convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> honest than men {{in certain situations}} and could work faster and more accurately. During his lifetime, Marston championed the latent abilities and causes of the women of his day.|$|R
50|$|Marston was {{the creator}} of a systolic-blood-pressure-measuring apparatus, which was crucial to the {{development}} of the polygraph (lie detector). Marston's experience with polygraphs convinced him <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> honest in situations different than men and could work more efficiently.|$|R
25|$|The {{study found}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> {{receptive}} {{to men who}} demanded the most social space, and <b>that</b> when a <b>woman</b> comes into a bar, men will move their drinks far apart to signal to her that they have space in their 'domain' for them.|$|R
25|$|Cultural factors, such as {{discrimination}} {{of various}} kinds, can negatively affect productivity {{such as age}} discrimination, stereotyping, discrimination against people with physical disability, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, and caste discrimination. Women are the group suffering from {{the highest rate of}} poverty after children; 14.5% of women and 22% of children are poor in the United States. In addition, the fact <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be caregivers, regardless of income level, to either the generations before or after them, exacerbates the burdens of their poverty.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{this model}} argue that it ignores {{research}} linking domestic violence to substance abuse and psychological problems. Some modern research into the patterns in DV has found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be physically abusive towards their partner in relationships in which only one partner is violent, which draws the effectiveness of using concepts like male privilege to treat domestic violence into question. Some modern research into predictors of injury from domestic violence suggests that the strongest predictor of injury by domestic violence is participation in reciprocal domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to be}} left hemisphere dominant, and {{men are more likely}} to be right hemisphere dominant. Because of this, women recover faster from left hemisphere damage, and men are more likely to recover faster from right hemisphere damage. Men who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke also have significantly better rehabilitation outcomes than men who suffer a left hemisphere stroke. Recovery of functional abilities is often greater in male stroke survivors than females, especially in the area of activities of daily living.|$|E
5000|$|Keashly and Jagatic {{found that}} {{males and females}} commit [...] "emotionally abusive behaviors" [...] in the {{workplace}} at roughly similar rates. In a web-based survey, Namie found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to engage in}} workplace bullying, such as name-calling, and that the average length of abuse was 16.5 months.|$|R
50|$|The {{gender of}} an {{observer}} can determine {{their perception of}} the difference in cuteness. In a study by Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) it <b>was</b> suggested <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> sensitive to small differences in cuteness than the same aged men. This suggests that reproductive hormones in <b>women</b> <b>are</b> important for determining cuteness.|$|R
50|$|Their {{first study}} {{indicated}} that only children who create imaginary companions actually engage in high levels of positive self-talk had more positive social development. They also found a gender difference within their study <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> {{likely than men to}} have an imaginary companion. Their findings were consistent with other research supporting that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common for females to have imaginary companions. One possible explanation the researchers suggested <b>that</b> <b>women</b> may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> likely to have imaginary companions is because they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to rely on feedback from other than themselves supporting the conclusions that men were found to have more self reinforcing self-talk.|$|R
25|$|Roughly {{one third}} of the {{population}} are highly susceptible to motion sickness and most of the rest may get motion sickness under extreme conditions. Several factors influence susceptibility to motion sickness. Statistics indicate <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be affected than men and that the risk decreases with advancing age. There is some evidence that people with Asian ancestry get motion sickness more frequently compared with people of European ancestry, and there are situational and behavioral factors, such as whether a passenger has a view of the road ahead, and diet and eating behavior.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of ECT, women have {{received}} it {{two to three times}} as often as men. Currently, about 70 percent of ECT patients are women. This {{may be due to the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be diagnosed with depression. A 1974 study of ECT in Massachusetts reported that women made up 69 percent of those given ECT. The Ministry of Health in Canada reported that from 1999 until 2000 in the province of Ontario, women were 71 percent of those given ECT in provincial psychiatric institutions, and 75 percent of the total ECT given was given to women.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company {{for a long period}} of time. Specific to women, since employers believe <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{literature}} and research surrounding TCKs has found that these individuals are more open to learning new languages, demonstrate more flexibility when interacting with a novel culture than their monoculture peers, and a greater interest in continuing a global nomad lifestyle, which includes an interest in international careers. It has been found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> inclined to seek out interpersonal relationships while men are more task-oriented in their relationships and choices. Such findings {{were used in the}} hypothesis of a study conducted by Gerner & Perry (2000) that predicted that gender differences would also be found in the cultural acceptance and experiences of TCKs.|$|E
25|$|Research {{conducted}} by the Kenexa Research Institute (KRI) evaluated how male and female workers perceive work–life balance and found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> positive than men in how they perceive their company’s efforts to help them balance work and life responsibilities. The report {{is based on the}} analysis of data drawn from a representative sample of 10,000 U.S. workers who were surveyed through WorkTrends, KRI’s annual survey of worker opinions. The results indicated a shift in women’s perceptions about work–life balance. In the past, women often found it more difficult to maintain balance due to the competing pressures at work and demands at home.|$|E
25|$|One common {{misconception}} of BDSM and kink is <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to}} take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not {{be interpreted as a}} connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{scholars}} have argued <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> inclined toward nurturing {{each other and}} that this might have posed an advantage to them. However, others have noted that men also created social support networks in the concentration camps.

5000|$|There was {{an example}} of gender bias in the {{psychiatric}} field as well, Hamburg notes that, [...] "psychiatrists would diagnose women with depression and then, eventually psychiatrists would begin to assume <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> depressed than men {{due to the fact that}} the patients that were examined by the psychiatrists <b>were</b> <b>women</b> and they had similar symptoms. As for the men, they were diagnosed with drug or alcohol problems and they were thrown out of the study.” ...|$|R
30|$|As for demographic characteristics, in our study, {{gender is}} not {{statistically}} significant, despite that this variable {{has been previously}} assumed important for predicting food consumption choices. Previous studies have found {{a significant relationship between}} gender and interest in natural foods. In particular, Dickson-Spillmann et al. (2011) and Dominick et al. (2018) revealed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> interested in natural products than men, since <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> sensitive to food hazards. However, our result may be ascribed to the relatively small prevalence of females (37 %) in the experiment.|$|R
25|$|Female {{resistance}} to mate guarding {{has also been}} researched {{in the context of}} the menstrual cycle. Pillsworth, Haselton and Buss (2004) found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to want to mate with males they are not currently pair bonded with during the ovulation period of their menstrual cycle. They also show higher mate guarding resistance in general during oestrus. This is supported by the finding that during ovulation women who are both single or in a monogamous partnership with a man are more likely to desire to go to social gatherings where they may meet alternative mates. This is said to support the female dual mating strategy theory, as during oestrus women may be seeking out mates with strong genes.|$|E
25|$|Bailenson, Blascovich, Beall, and Loomis {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} 2001, testing Argyle and Dean's (1965) equilibrium theory's speculation of an inverse relationship between mutual gaze, a nonverbal cue signaling intimacy, and interpersonal distance. Participants were immersed in a 3D virtual room in which a virtual human representation (that is, an embodied agent) stood. The focus {{of this study is}} on the subtle nonverbal exchanges that occur between a person and an embodied agent. Participants in the study clearly did not treat the agent as a mere animation. On the contrary, the results suggest that, in virtual environments, people were influenced by the 3D model and respected personal space of the humanoid representation. The result of the experiment also indicated <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> affected by the gaze behaviors of the agent and adjust their personal space more accordingly than do men. However, men do subjectively assign gaze behavior to the agent, and their proxemic behavior reflects this perception. Furthermore, both men and women demonstrate less variance in their proxemic behavior when the agent displays mutual gaze behavior than when the agent does not.|$|E
25|$|Gender is {{a factor}} that {{plays a role in}} both human and animal aggression. Males are {{historically}} believed to be generally more physically aggressive than females from an early age, and men commit the vast majority of murders (Buss 2005). This {{is one of the most}} robust and reliable behavioral sex differences, and it has been found across many different age groups and cultures. However, some empirical studies have found the discrepancy in male and female aggression to be more pronounced in childhood and the gender difference in adults to be modest when studied in an experimental context. Still, there is evidence that males are quicker to aggression (Frey et al. 2003) and more likely than females to express their aggression physically. When considering indirect forms of non-violent aggression, such as relational aggression and social rejection, some scientists argue that females can be quite aggressive, although female aggression is rarely expressed physically. An exception is intimate partner violence that occurs among couples who are engaged, married, or in some other form of intimate relationship. In such cases, some research suggests <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> physically aggressive than men, although differences are small and men are less likely to be injured than women are.|$|E
50|$|Scientific {{studies of}} belief in {{precognition}} have focused on psychological reasons for belief. A 1978 Gallup poll found that 37% of Americans surveyed believed in precognition. According to psychologists Tobacyk and Milford, belief was greater in college women than in men, and a 2007 Gallup poll found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> prone to superstitious beliefs in general. A 2013 study discovered that greater belief in precognition was held by those who feel low in control, and the belief {{can act as a}} psychological coping mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Gender-specific theory {{developed}} in Malleus Maleficarum laid {{the foundations for}} widespread consensus in early modern Germany on the evil nature of women as witches. Later works on witchcraft have not agreed entirely with Malleus {{but none of them}} challenged the view <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> inclined to <b>be</b> witches than men. It was perceived as intuitive and all-accepted so that very few authors saw the need to explain why <b>women</b> <b>are</b> witches. Those who did, attributed female witchery to the weakness of body and mind (old medieval explanation) and a few to female sexuality.|$|R
50|$|Important to note is {{that these}} limited {{representations}} {{are not limited to}} within the policing profession, but rather reflect a broader trend of narrow media images of women in general. A 1992 study analyzed 116 episodes of prime time television, and though they found specifically that twice as many men as <b>women</b> <b>were</b> represented in law enforcement, courts and other realms of public administration, they also found similar discrepancies in other industries. They also noted <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> displayed in jobs that fall lower on an organizational hierarchy.|$|R
2500|$|The {{treatise}} {{describes how}} {{women and men}} become inclined to practice witchcraft. The text argues <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to demonic temptations through the manifold weaknesses of their gender. It was {{believed that they were}} weaker in faith and more carnal than men. Michael Bailey claims that most of the women accused as witches had strong personalities and were known to defy convention by overstepping the lines of proper female decorum. After the publication of the Malleus, it seems as though about three quarters of those individuals prosecuted as witches were women.|$|E
2500|$|Some scholars, such as Kenneth Doo Young Lee, {{interpret}} the Lotus Sutra {{to imply that}} [...] "women were capable of gaining salvation", either after they first turned into a man, or being reborn in Pure Land realm after following the Path. Peter Harvey lists many Sutras that suggest [...] "having faded out the mind-set of a woman and developed the mind-set of a man, {{he was born in}} his present male form", and who then proceeds to follow the Path and became an Arahant. Among Mahayana texts, there is a sutra dedicated to the concept of how a person might be born as a woman. The traditional assertion is <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> prone to harboring feelings of greed, hatred and delusion than a man. The Buddha responds to this assumption by teaching the method of moral development through which a woman can achieve rebirth as a man.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rabbinic interpretation, Huldah {{said to the}} {{messengers}} of King Josiah, [...] "Tell the {{man that}} sent you to me," [...] etc. (...) , indicating by her unceremonious language that for her Josiah was like any other man. The king addressed her, and not Jeremiah, because he thought <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> easily stirred to pity than men, and that therefore the prophetess {{would be more likely}} than Jeremiah to intercede with God in his behalf (Meg. 14a, b; comp. Seder 'Olam R. xxi.). Huldah was a relative of Jeremiah, both being descendants of Rahab by her marriage with Joshua (Sifre, Num. 78; Meg. 14a, b). While Jeremiah admonished and preached repentance to the men, she did the same to the women (Pesiḳ. R. 26 [...] ). Huldah was not only a prophetess, but taught publicly in the school (Targ. to [...] ), according to some teaching especially the oral doctrine. It is doubtful whether [...] "the Gate of Huldah" [...] in the Second Temple (Mid. i. 3) has any connection with the prophetess Huldah; it may have meant [...] "Cat's Gate"; some scholars, however, associate the gate with Huldah's schoolhouse (Rashi to Kings l.c.).E.

30|$|The answers showed {{positive}} attitudes towards recurring vision test (94 % positive) and recurring medical assessments (93 % positive). A majority wanted to include tests of visual acuity, contrast vision, and visual field. The most common choice was {{a starting point}} of 70  years and an interval of 2 – 3  years. Gender effects showing <b>that</b> <b>woman</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> positive towards some assessment and shorter time intervals between them was revealed. No significant effect of hearing or vision decline was found. Better results on cognitive tests was associated with {{positive attitudes}} towards medical testing.|$|R
30|$|Along {{with the}} {{assessment}} of deficits, SST planning in crack users should consider the differences, such as gender. Women had higher social skills in the overall score than men when comparing the social skills of men and women. This finding provides evidence <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> skilled at social interaction than men in this population of crack users in a closed environment. In this perspective, it is understood that in the society, different repertoires are reinforced {{for men and women}} in behaviors considered skilled and unskilled (Caballo, 2003).|$|R
50|$|Anti-suffragism was {{not limited}} to {{conservative}} elements. The anarchist Emma Goldman opposed suffragism on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> inclined toward legal enforcement of morality (as in the Women's Christian Temperance Union), that it was a diversion from more important struggles, and that suffrage would ultimately not make a difference. She also said that activists ought to advocate revolution rather than seek greater privileges within an inherently unjust system. Progressives criticized suffrage in the Utah Territory as a cynical Mormon ploy, resulting in the passage of the Edmunds-Tucker Act.|$|R
