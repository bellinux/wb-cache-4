5|$|Pigments {{responsible}} for the orange to red colors of the mature fruit bodies {{have been identified as}} carotenes, predominantly lycopene and beta-carotene—the same compounds {{responsible for}} <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> orange colors of tomatoes and carrots, respectively.

5|$|The {{elliptical}} brown-colored flecks, {{which can}} be observed in both <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> pink zones of the thallus, are made of confluentic acid and calcium oxalate monohydrate.

5|$|The {{presence}} of the two opposing armed forces, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> White Guards, imposed a state of dual power and multiple sovereignty on Finnish society, typically the prelude to a civil war. The decisive cleavage between the guards broke out during the General strike; the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland, and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds broke out. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to a race for weapons and an escalation towards civil war.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> {{white variety}} of toy spaniel was first seen in {{paintings}} by Titian, including the Venus of Urbino (1538), {{where a small}} dog {{is used as a}} symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Red and White {{political}} violence: (i) a calculated {{part of the general}} warfare, (ii) local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the high staffs planned and organized the actions and gave orders to the lower level; at least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. At first <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> White governments officially opposed political violence, but the operational decisions were made at the military level.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} other broad-minded Finns, the new {{partnership}} constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered stable and broad parliamentary democracy.

After the foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> White lost their backup, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity, and the legacy of Fennomania, stood out among the Finns.|$|E
