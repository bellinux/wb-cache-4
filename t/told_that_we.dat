500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about {{it for the rest of}} the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Tabayoyon's {{account of}} the {{planting}} of the meadow was supported by another former Scientologist, Maureen Bolstad, who said {{that a couple of}} dozen Scientologists including herself were put to work on a rainy night through dawn on the project. [...] "We were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed to plant a field and that it was to help Tom impress Nicole...but for some mysterious reason it wasn't considered acceptable by Mr. Miscavige. So the project was rejected and they redid it".|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{expected}} to spend my two weeks' vacation here.|$|R
60|$|MRS. G. I've {{written to}} Mamma and <b>told</b> her <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall {{be back on}} the 17th.|$|R
60|$|To-day I <b>told</b> Otto <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must kill ourselves, {{that our}} love is so perfect <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{have no right}} to live.|$|R
2500|$|We are not negroes, we are {{the heirs}} of Ninagrit, and of the great chiefs and warriors of the Narragansetts. [...] Because, when your {{ancestors}} stole the negro from Africa and brought him amongst us and made a slave of him, we extended him the hand of friendship, and permitted his blood to be mingled with ours, are we to be called negroes? And to be <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may be made negro citizens? [...] We claim that while one drop of Indian blood remains in our veins, we are entitled to the rights and privileges guaranteed by your ancestors to ours by solemn treaty, which without a breach of faith you cannot violate.The Narragansett Indians {{had a vision of}} themselves as [...] "a nation rather than a race", and it was a multiracial nation. They insisted on their rights to Indian national status and its privileges by treaty.|$|E
60|$|ZOO. [severely] How often {{must you}} be <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot foresee the future? There {{is no such}} thing as the future until it is the present.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very happy}} to meet you, Mr. Greene," [...] he said. [...] "You {{represent}} an amazing development. I am <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall all {{have to work for}} you presently or find our occupation gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} {{some of our}} larger men, {{themselves}} financial experts, took hold. They said that our entertainments had been on too small a scale. They <b>told</b> us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had been [...] "undermined by overhead expenses." [...] The word [...] "overhead" [...] was soon on everybody's lips. <b>We</b> were <b>told</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> could [...] "distribute our overhead" [...] it would disappear. It was therefore planned to hold a great War Kermesse {{with a view to}} spreading out the overhead so thin that it would vanish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. March has <b>told</b> you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{have seen}} Mrs. Hasketh, {{and that you}} can find your {{daughter}} at her house to-morrow evening?" ...|$|R
60|$|Outside of the ladies' tent I {{came upon}} Miss Thorn, stowing a large basket. I <b>told</b> her <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had taken <b>that</b> {{precaution}} the night before.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will it be any {{comfort to}} tell you that most likely it would have been too late even if he would have {{accepted}} it? Come, Bertha, how often are we <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not to think so much of consequences as of actions, and there was nothing blameworthy in the whole business.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't wait ten months, nor, if I {{can have}} my own way, ten weeks." [...] What a pity that Mary could not have heard him. [...] "Half the fellows in the army are married without {{anything}} beyond their pay; and I'm to be <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can't get along with £300 a year? At any rate, we'll try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I, Señor Don Almirante, {{although}} they who sent me here fancy as much. It is natural {{for a man}} to wish to see his estates, once in his life, and I am <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are bound on a voyage {{to the other side of}} the world. God forbid that I should hold aloof, on such an occasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to}} do {{something}} special in shirts," [...] said Jones, as though the whole merit of the transaction were his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just because}} I <b>told</b> her <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ought {{to wait until}} you remembered us," [...] the slighter young woman, with the very obvious peroxidised hair, protested.|$|R
6000|$|... "I came to find you," [...] said Annie, holding {{tight to}} his sleeve. [...] "Oh, you big fool! Professor Cherubusco <b>told</b> us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might find you here." ...|$|R
60|$|I couldn't {{understand}} how the water had become so clear; but I was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had left the river proper and were now in a stream that flowed from Silver Spring, which {{was the end of}} our voyage into the cypress woods. The water in the spring and in this stream was almost transparent,--very different from the regular water of the river.|$|E
6000|$|Then she {{was asked}} why she had not gone when she had got the money, {{according}} to her promise. 'He defied us,' she said, 'and called us bad names,--liars and perjurers. He {{knew that we were}} not liars. And then we were watched and <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might not go. As {{he said that he was}} indifferent, I was willing enough to stay and see it out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{fear the}} {{majority}} in the Lords will be greater than was expected; I am <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must endeavour to put ministers in a minority two or three times before the bill gets to its second reading in the Lords, no matter upon what question. I hear there are many peers whose votes depend entirely upon their notions, whether or not Peel can, by hook or by crook, carry on.' ...|$|E
60|$|I did tell, {{and after}} we had each <b>told</b> all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> knew, we mentally hugged ourselves, and grew so facetious over it <b>that</b> <b>we</b> began to address Dumps personally, to that {{intelligent}} creature's intense satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But why, my dear? How {{are you to}} do better? Perhaps I, or your aunt, {{should have}} spoken to you first, and <b>told</b> you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> thought well of the match.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{would go}} out into the world {{together}}; empty-handed we would fare forth together and defy the world. I said that he should be my knight-errant, my paladin! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had no orders, general; but I was {{appointed}} to command the first company that entered, and was <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were to turn right and left along the ramparts. It struck me that as, when we had left, the enemy would be sure to turn their guns upon us, {{it would be as}} well to silence them, so I brought the nails and a hammer with me for the purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When is {{that going}} to be?" [...] Field asked innocently. [...] "We have been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall be in Ladysmith in a week many times since we first came up {{here in the middle of}} December, and we are no nearer now than when we arrived here. Do you think that you could {{guarantee}} that we should be there in another week? because, if so, we might put off going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Happy? What right had she {{to expect}} to be happy? Are we {{to believe that we}} should be happy here? Are we not <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are to look for {{happiness}} there, and to hope for none below?" [...] As he said this he stretched his left hand to the ceiling. [...] "But why shouldn't she have been happy? What did she want? Did she ever say anything against me, Mr. Finn?" ...|$|E
60|$|He told us many anecdotes of the Revolution, and {{was much}} pleased when <b>we</b> <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had read the}} same in history, and that his account agreed with the written.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I will, and, so {{far from}} {{thinking}} you a fool, I was much impressed with your learning tonight and <b>told</b> Steve <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ought {{to be proud of}} our philosopher." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} you," [...] she interrupted, {{speaking}} with a passionate earnestness {{that he had}} not known her to show--"I have already <b>told</b> you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot marry; is anything else worth saying?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{what would}} he have done had Bertram told him that Lady Harcourt was staying at Mr. Jones's, in the red brick house {{on the other side}} of the Green? What can any man do with a recusant wife? We have often been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should build a golden bridge for a flying enemy. And if any one can be {{regarded}} as a man's enemy, it is a wife who is not his friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but we did}} {{not bring}} off any {{ammunition}} with us. It was the men's idea to bring them as a trophy. However, I have plenty of powder and can load them with bullets; but I certainly won't use them if it can be possibly avoided. I have no grudge against the poor fellows who have been <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are desperate pirates, and who are only doing what they believe to be a meritorious action in trying to capture us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavy thunder with {{continuous}} lightning for two hours. Thereafter sleet- squalls, {{a confused}} sea, and cold, unfriendly weather till conclusion o' cruise," [...] said Pyecroft. [...] "It was only what we expected, {{but what we}} felt, an' I assure you, Mr. Hooper, even a sailor-man has a heart to break, was bein' <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> able seamen an' promisin' marines 'ad misled Boy Niven. Yes, we poor back-to-the-landers was supposed to 'ave misled him! He rounded on us, o' course, an' got off easy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have done}} wrong, said Violet, {{checking}} herself; 'I {{should not have}} said <b>that.</b> Mamma <b>told</b> us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ought never to chatter about his concerns. Will you, please, not remember that I said it?' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{returned}} to the others and <b>told</b> them everything <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had learned from Shadrach.|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{without waiting}} for permission, Hiram <b>told</b> all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had learned {{concerning}} Silas; explained why we left the encampment, and gave the details of our stay at the battery near Nook's hill, adding in conclusion: ...|$|R
