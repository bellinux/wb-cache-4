Williams describes the album as [...] "a treat {{from start to}} finish" [...] offering [...] "an innocent optimism that will always be worth a listen". New Zealand Herald critic Graham Reid considers [...] "Dream Scene" [...] to be [...] "by far the most psychedelic and out-there piece by any Beatle to that time", adding that [...] "towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>you</b> can almost anticipate Lennon's Revolution 9 coming in."

In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter Vince Gilligan intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by [...] "Subway", which he called an [...] "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: [...] "The brilliant thing they did in this episode, the thing that stuck with me, was this guy's an asshole, the guy really is unpleasant, and yet at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> (<b>you)</b> still feel his humanity." [...] The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series Breaking Bad.|$|E

Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{felt that the}} usage of bells and whistles as instrumentation, along with the disco sounds made the track connect to two of Madonna's inspirations, that of Chic, and Donna Summer.

In a similar review, Thomas Hauner of PopMatters wrote that the song [...] "continues the Donna Summer touch, this time opting for 'beep beep' vocals on a surprisingly sweet track." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine believed that compared to the demo, the final version had lost an individuality, but complimented the addition of West, feeling that it [...] "transports [...] from 2001 to 1979".

Second-place finisher Papis said his team were planning a new strategy after the race's distance was reduced and had been looking forward to further racing and congratulated Da Matta on winning the race. Tagliani, who finished in third, revealed that he lifted from his accelerator pedal and ran in fifth gear on the backstraight and stated it was about conserving fuel and avoiding being caught in any incidents.

500|$|The {{experience}} with King, despite only {{resulting in the}} completion of one track, [...] "Bad Boyfriend", gave the band perspective and direction. Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other, King could not get much work out of the band, so they realized {{that they needed to}} work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously. Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become [...] "burned out on each other", and that reuniting made them feel able to play [...] "...fast and furiousas if our lives depended on it". Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both [...] "Metal Heart" [...] and [...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves.

[...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, praised Carey's performance, describing it as having been [...] "an authentically deglammed compassion" [...] and praised the film for 'capturing' [...] "how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead" [...] and for Daniels' showing [...] "unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives."

[...] He identifies how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position Mo'Nique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final [...] "push" [...] needed by Sidibe: [...] "The more Precious tries to get away from her mother, the more she's pulled back".|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} lyrics to Lightning Bolt, Vedder tried to be less cryptic in expressing his {{feelings}} compared to the [...] "word games" [...] of previous Pearl Jam albums. The songs discuss lasting relationships, bad faith ("Getaway," [...] "Mind Your Manners"), {{the state of the}} world ("Infallible") and life's transience ("Pendulum"), which Vedder summed up as [...] "the same mysteries that I’ve been trying to unravel for a few decades now." [...] Gossard explained that the reflective tone was indicative of the bandmembers' age: [...] " [...] 40-something, almost 50-something, you're looking at life through your kids' eyes, through the filter of relationships that are 20 or 30 years long, through the filter of your parents getting older and the passing of friends and relatives-relationships and all that they encompass, the difficulties of them and the sacrifices you make in them and also the joy they bring you." [...] Vedder at first was afraid of writing songs about mortality, but relented given he felt that [...] "death is everywhere" [...] and writing about death would help [...] "getting through it", as [...] "living to the day you die, and being cognizant of <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>you</b> might lead a more appreciative life". One of the compositions about the theme was [...] "Future Days", which discusses the loss of Vedder's friend Dennis Flemion, who accidentally drowned in 2012. The concernment in the songs also owed to Vedder being a father, as the singer detailed that [...] "It’s going to be their world and what is their future? It feels like there is a lot that can be lost in the next 50 years if people don’t pay attention." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"

In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that you need me too... best you ever had. It could be so easy, for you to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>you</b> win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E

Activision further shuttered Neversoft's Guitar Hero division, pending the completion of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, with further development in the series to be created by some former Neversoft members and Vicarious Visions. Brian Bright, former Neversoft member and current project lead, noted that part of the poor sales of Guitar Hero in 2009 was a result of a loss of focus with Guitar Hero 5, stating that [...] "we were trying to please everyone out there and I think in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>you</b> end up not pleasing any one person a lot".

The songs are more guitar-centric, as proven to be the most popular instrument choice based on Guitar Hero 5. Bright noted they used player statistics from previous games to shape Warriors of Rock; for example, according to Bright, within a month of release, 40% of the players of Guitar Hero 5 were playing on Expert mode, and felt this was the audience they needed to cater to. Bright also stated that the aim of Warriors of Rock was to create a game with [...] "its own identity" [...] from both previous Guitar Hero titles and other rhythm games; [...] "Rather than go head-to-head with our own games and our competitors, we decided we wanted to make something different." ...|$|E
