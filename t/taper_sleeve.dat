40|$|Abstract Background There were {{at least}} 31, 171 metal-on-metal (MoM) hip {{implants}} in the UK between 2003 and 2011. Some of these were subject to failure and widescale recalls and revisions followed. Method This {{is a presentation of}} ten cases (mean age 600 years) where we evaluated neuropsychiatric morbidity following metal-on-metal hip implant failure and revision. Implants were ASR total hip replacement (acetabular implant, <b>taper</b> <b>sleeve</b> adaptor and unipolar femoral implants) performed between 2005 and 2009. This case series describes, for the first time, neuropsychiatric complications after revision where there has been cobalt and chromium toxicity. Results Pre-revision surgery, nine patients had toxic levels of chromium and cobalt (mean level chromium 3380 nmol/l, mean cobalt 669. 40 nmol/l). Depression assessment showed 9 of 9 respondents fulfilled the BDI criteria for depression and 3 of these were being treated. 7 of 9 patients showing short term memory deficit with mean mini mental state examination score of 24. 2. The normal population mean MMSE for this group would be expected to be 28 with < 25 indicating possible dementia. Conclusions We found neurocognitive and depressive deficits after cobalt and chromium metallosis following MoM implant failure. Larger studies of neurocognitive effects are indicated in this group. There may be implications for public health...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examine on {{the effectiveness}} of <b>tapered</b> <b>sleeve</b> connector in providing confinement effect to embedded reinforcement bar. The objectives of the investigation are to study the bond mechanism of grouted sleeve connector and to study the effects of confinement provided by the grouted sleeve connector. Two different configurations (welded bar <b>sleeve</b> and <b>tapered</b> <b>sleeve)</b> of sleeve connector were used in this study. Various sleeve diameters were used in this research to study their effects on the bond mechanism. The bond failure progression inside the grouted sleeve connector was observed visually as halved welded steel bar connector and tapered head connector were used. The experimental works consisted two phases where phase I was the testing of plain grouted sleeve. Phase II involved the testing steel fibre reinforced grout sleeve. Steel fibres of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 % and 1. 0 % were introduced to the connector in a way so the grout inside the connector will exhibit post-cracking behaviour. Pull-out tests were carried out and it was observed that the performance of <b>tapered</b> <b>sleeve</b> was better than welded bar sleeve due to higher confinement level. The provision of sufficient confinement stress able to delay the development of splitting cracks. The test result showed that welded bar sleeve was governed by splitting failure mode, whereas <b>tapered</b> <b>sleeve</b> failed in pull-out failure mode...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} experimental and theoretical study of subsynchronous rotordynamic instability in rotors caused by interference and shrink fit interfaces. The experimental studies show {{the presence of}} strong unstable subsynchronous vibrations in two different rotor setups with interference and shrink fit interfaces that were operated above their first critical speeds. The unstable vibrations occur at the first natural frequency of the rotor-bearing system. The instability caused complete wreckage of the test rig {{in one of the}} setups showing that these vibrations are potentially dangerous to the safe operation of rotating machines. The two different rotor setups that are studied are a single-disk rotor mounted on a uniform diameter shaft and a two-disk rotor with an aluminum sleeve shrink fitted to it at the outer surface of the two disks. In the single-disk rotor, an adjustable interference arrangement between the disk and the shaft is obtained through a <b>tapered</b> <b>sleeve</b> arrangement, which acts as the interference fit joint. The unstable sub-synchronous vibrations originate from slippage in the shrink fit and the interference fit interfaces that develop friction forces, which act as destabilizing cross-coupled moments when the rotor is operated above its first critical speed. The unique contribution offered through this work is the experimental validation of a physically correct model of internal friction which models the destabilizing mechanism as a system of cross-coupled internal moments at the shrink fit interface. The dissertation describes stability simulations of various test rotor setups using the correct internal moments model. A commercial finite-element based software called XLTRCTM is used to perform rotordynamic simulations for stability studies. The method of stability study is the computation of eigenvalues of the rotor-bearing system. A negative real part of the eigenvalue indicates instability. The simulations include the test rotors that were experimentally observed as stable and unstable with shrink and interference fit interfaces in their assemblies. The dissertation also describes the simulations of various imagined rotor configurations with shrink fit interfaces, and seeks to explain how configurations differ on rotordynamic stability depending upon several rotor-bearing parameters such as geometry and elastic properties, as well as upon the amount of internal friction parameters, which differ from configuration to configuration...|$|R

5000|$|Drape {{suits are}} a 1930s British {{variation}} of the three-piece suit, in which the cut is full and 'drapes'. It {{is also known as}} the blade cut or London cut. The design of the athletic aesthetic of the drape suit is attributed to the London tailor Frederick Scholte. The new suit cut was softer and more flexible in construction than the suits of the previous generation; extra fabric in the shoulder and armscye, light padding, a slightly nipped waist, and fuller <b>sleeves</b> <b>tapered</b> at the wrist resulted in a cut with folds, or [...] "drapes," [...] front and back that created the illusion of the broad-shoulders and tight-waist [...] "V" [...] figure of the very fit.|$|R
40|$|A {{recognized}} way {{of improving}} the fatigue resistance of a fastener hole is to introduce compressive tangential residual stress around it. This {{can be achieved by}} using a cold expansion method in which an oversized pin or ball is forced through the hole to produce a local plastic region surrounded by an elastic one. Once the pin or ball is removed allowing the elastic region to spring back it results in compressive tangential residual stress around the hole. In practise, however, it is found that such a cold expansion method creates a nonuniform residual stress distribution through the plate thickness and even tensile residual stress can be created at the entrance and exit faces. In this paper a new method of cold expansion is proposed. It uses a tapered pin with a mating <b>tapered</b> split <b>sleeve</b> and creates an almost uniform compressive residual stress around the hole as shown by FE method. Also, fatigue tests were carried out to verify that the method does significantly improve fatigue life. Finally the tangential residual stress distribution and fatigue life improvement of this new method were compared with those of a well-established cold expansion method and it was shown that the new method is more efficient in improving fatigue life...|$|R
40|$|This study tests grouted splices {{connected}} by {{two types of}} sleeves, namely Welded Bar <b>Sleeve</b> (WBS) and <b>Tapered</b> Head <b>Sleeve</b> (THS). These sleeves are made from non-proprietary pipe sections, where (a) WBS is fabricated by welding the deformed bars to the inner wall of the pipe, and (b) THS is made tapered with smaller openings at both ends. To study the behavior, the splice specimens were tested under incremental tensile load at various bar embedded lengths and sleeve diameters. The degree of confinement generated in the sleeve is found to increase with decreasing sleeve diameter. This improves the bond strength in sleeve, which subsequently increases the tensile capacity of the splice. THS gives a 30 % higher tensile capacity compared with WBS. With the active confinement, the required bar embedded length of the splice {{can be reduced to}} 8 times the bar diameter. An analytical model is formulated {{on the basis of the}} confinement stress as expressed in a function of sleeve dimensions. The model is used to predict the tensile capacities of the splices at a variation range of ± 10 % of the experimental results. This verifies the correlations among the sleeve dimensions, the confinement stress and bond strength of the grouted splice...|$|R
5000|$|Many lathes {{that run}} collet chucks have {{dedicated}} collet-closer setups whereby {{there is no}} backplate, and the spindle nose contains the female taper for either the collet's male outer <b>taper,</b> or a <b>sleeve</b> that will hold it. A hollow drawbar passes back through the headstock to its back side, where a closer mechanism is mounted. The latter allows easy, rapid opening and closing of the collet. The drawbar's inner diameter determines the through-the-spindle bar diameter capacity of the lathe. Some collet-closer systems even allow opening and closing without stopping the spindle rotation. The closer on a manual lathe is either lever-style or handwheel-style. The closer on a CNC lathe is powered (electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic), {{and it may be}} controlled by various means: a foot pedal that the operator steps on when desired; a line in the program (for opening and closing under program control); or a button on the control panel.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the [...] "drape cut" [...] or [...] "London Drape" [...] suit championed by Frederick Scholte, tailor to the Prince of Wales, {{was taking the}} world of men's fashion by storm. The new suit was softer and more {{flexible}} in construction than the suits of the previous generation; extra fabric in the shoulder and armscye, light padding, a slightly nipped waist, and fuller <b>sleeves</b> <b>tapered</b> at the wrist resulted in a cut with flattering folds or drapes front and back that enhanced a man's figure. The straight leg wide-trousers (the standard size was 23 inches at the cuff) that men had worn in the 1920s also became tapered at the bottom {{for the first time}} around 1935. The new suit was adopted enthusiastically by Hollywood stars including Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, and Gary Cooper, who became the new fashion trendsetters after the Prince's abdication and exile. By the early 1940s, Hollywood tailors had exaggerated the drape to the point of caricature, outfitting film noir mobsters and private eyes in suits with heavily padded chests, enormous shoulders, and wide flowing trousers. Musicians and other fashion experimenters adopted the most extreme form of the drape, the zoot suit, with very high waists, pegged trousers, and long coats.|$|R
50|$|Men’s {{clothing}} of the 14th {{century was}} much more form fitting than its 13th century counterparts. During this era, many of the standard pieces that had been worn by the Britons evolved into new garments and took on different names. P. Cunnington explains that loose garments, such as the tunic and super tunic, from previous centuries continued to be worn by the lower classes who were less concerned with fashion. These loose garments, as C. Cunnington states, were slit up the front, had sleeves, and were worn with a girdle. In addition, they could be shortened to the hip.The gipon, also called a pourpoint or doublet, emerged during the 14th century. It replaced the tunic and was knee length and close-fitting. The gipon was not designed with any folds or gathers as the tunic was. The sleeves were long and tight and the neck was low. The bodice was padded and the garment was either buttoned or laced down the front, but for the lower classes it was only buttoned to the waist. The gipon was traditionally worn over a shirt and if worn with an outer garment, a belt was not worn. At {{the end of the}} century, the gipon was shortened to above the mid thigh and was worn with a belt at hip level The outer garment of this era was known as the cote-hardie and replaced the super tunic of previous centuries. This new low necked, knee length piece was tight fitting and buttoned or laced down the front to waist level, where it then “flared into a full skirt which was open in the front” as C. Cunnington describes. The complex sleeves of the cote-hardie extended, in the front, to the elbow and, in back, hung in flaps which <b>tapered</b> and elongated. <b>Sleeves</b> during this era were decorated. A belt or girdle was worn with this new garment. The less fortunate wore looser core-hardies which did not fasten in the front. Instead they were one piece and were put on over the head. Cloaks and capes continued to be worn as outdoor wear and didn’t change from the previous century.|$|R
