30|$|Program {{analysis}} {{is also used}} to speed up transactions. Sloth [11] and Pyxis [10] are tools that use program analysis to reduce the network communication between the application and DBMS. QURO [42] tracks dependencies among <b>transaction</b> <b>statements</b> to reorder <b>transaction</b> execution for 2 PL. DORA [30] also partitions transaction codes to exploit intra-transaction parallelism provided by multi-core server for 2 PL. Majority of these techniques do not consider reordering transaction execution and thus cannot reduce delays for transaction pipeline. QURO seems the most related approach to PARE since both of them reorder transaction execution. However, two inappropriate design choices of QURO hinder transaction pipeline from boosting HFT applications: (1) QURO assumes fixed workloads and requires to sample the degrees of contention for each statement in advance. Unfortunately, workload sampling is prohibitive because each transaction is dynamically generated according to the timely business information in HFT market. (2) QURO estimates the degree of contention at statement level and by the delayed time. As discussed in Sect.  3.3, this underestimates the degree of contention and repeatedly obtains inconsistent degree of contention. In contrast, PARE estimates at physical operator level and counts the occurrence frequency of contention.|$|R
30|$|High-frequency trading (HFT) {{has always}} been welcomed because it {{benefits}} not only personal benefits but also the whole social welfare. While the recent advance of portfolio selection in HFT market enables to bring about more profit, it yields much contended OLTP workloads. Featuring exploiting the abundant parallelism, transaction pipeline, the state-of-the-art concurrency control (CC) mechanism, however, suffers from limited concurrency confronted with HFT workloads. Its variants that enable more parallel execution by leveraging fine-grained contention information also take little effect. To solve this problem, we {{for the first time}} observe and formulate the source of restricted concurrency as harmful ordering of <b>transaction</b> <b>statements.</b> To resolve harmful ordering, we propose PARE, a pipeline-aware reordered execution, to improve application performance by rearranging statements in order of their degrees of contention. In concrete, two mechanisms are devised to ensure the correctness of statement rearrangement and identify the degrees of contention of statements, respectively. We also study the off-line reordering problem. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and present an off-line reordering approach to approximate the optimal reordering strategy. Experiment results show that PARE can improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction latency on HFT applications by up to an order of magnitude than the state-of-the-art CC mechanism.|$|R

30|$|Variants of {{transaction}} pipeline are {{attracting the}} most attention in concurrency control research. These methods feature assuming that the workloads are available beforehand. In this way, {{they are able to}} chop transactions into pieces such that once each piece of transaction code begins to execute, it will not need to delay until the completion of the whole transaction. In the original transaction pipeline approach named IC 3 [36], whether two pieces conflict depends on whether they access the same table and one of them contains write. Fine-grained variants are further proposed by regarding two pieces as conflicting pieces if they perform conflicting accesses at runtime [13, 16, 41]. In particular, TheDB [41] captures the dependencies access operations and partially update the membership of read/write sets by uncommitted data from its dependent transactions. Both IC 3 and TheDB adopt an underlying single version storage. MV 3 C [13] adopts a multi-version storage. Because the only way to generate a conflict is that a transaction reads some data objects from the database that become stale by the time it tries to commit. In this way, uncommitted write should be applied to these reads. To this end, each read is associated with the blocks of code that depend on them. In this way, the portion of a transaction that should be re-executed in the case that uncommitted data are applied to the read is identified quickly. PWV [16] operates uncommitted data on deterministic database. It decomposes transactions into a set of sub-transactions or pieces such that each piece consists of one or more <b>transaction</b> <b>statements.</b> PWV makes a piece’s writes visible as soon as its host transaction guarantees to commit, even if there are still pieces of the same transaction not executed.|$|R

In this paper, we consider co-channel spectrum sharing between cellular systems and radars. We address the problem of target detection by radars that are subject to shape its waveform in a way that it does not cause interference to cellular systems. We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar and a MIMO cellular communication system with K base stations (BS). We propose a spectrum sharing algorithm which steers radar nulls, by projecting radar waveform onto the null space of interference channel, towards a `selected' BS, thus, protecting it from radar interference. This BS is selected, among K BSs, on the basis of guaranteeing minimum waveform degradation. We study target detection capabilities of this null-space projected (NSP) waveform and compare it with the orthogonal waveform. We derive the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for target detection and derive detector statistic for NSP and orthogonal waveform. The target detection performance for NSP and orthogonal waveform is studied theoretically and via Monte Carlo simulations.

Many novel MIMO radar waveforms have been developed by considering various performance metrics and constraints. In this paper, we show that finite alphabet constant-envelope (FACE) quadrature-pulse shift keying (QPSK) waveforms can be designed to realize a given covariance matrix by transforming a constrained nonlinear optimization problem into an unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem. In addition, we design QPSK waveforms {{in a way that they}} don't cause interference to a cellular system, by steering nulls towards a selected base station (BS). The BS is selected according to our algorithm which guarantees minimum degradation in radar performance due to null space projection (NSP) of radar waveforms. We design QPSK waveforms with spectrum sharing constraints for a stationary and moving radar platform. We show that the waveform designed for stationary MIMO radar matches the desired beampattern closely, when the number of BS antennas N^BS is considerably less than the number of radar antennas M, due to quasi-static interference channel. However, for moving radar the difference between designed and desired waveforms is larger than stationary radar, due to rapidly changing channel.
