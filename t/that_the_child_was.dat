5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that Sharp had fathered a stillborn {{illegitimate child}} with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, {{or whether it was}} a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|Münchhausen's wife Jacobine von Dunten died in 1790. In January 1794, Münchhausen married Bernardine von Brunn, fifty-seven {{years his}} junior. Von Brunn {{reportedly}} took ill {{soon after the}} marriage and spent the summer of 1794 in the spa town of Bad Pyrmont, although contemporary gossip claimed that she spent her time dancing and flirting. Von Brunn {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Maria Wilhemina, on 16 February 1795, nine months after her summer trip. Münchhausen filed an official complaint <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> not his, and spent the last years of his life in divorce proceedings and alimony litigation. Münchhausen died childless on 22 February 1797.|$|E
5|$|The Anti-Relief partisans {{nominated}} former Senator John J. Crittenden {{for one of}} the {{two seats}} apportioned to Franklin County in the state House. The Relief Party countered with Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent area lawyer. During the sharply contested campaign, both John U. Waring and Patrick Henry Darby, a land speculator, said that Sharp's life was at risk if he won. Opponents revived the charges of Sharp's illegitimate child. It was also alleged that Sharp had claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> mulatto and said he had a certificate from Cooke's midwife to that effect; whether Sharp made this claim may never be known for certain. Despite the controversy, Sharp netted the most votes in the election, winning by 69 {{out of a total of}} 1600 votes cast in the county.|$|E

5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Siegel, an {{attorney}} from Florida, {{learned of the}} case and felt that a hearing should be held about Eve's welfare. In January 2003, he initiated legal proceedings, seeking to bring the clone's parents to court so its health could be verified. Raël and Boisselier attacked the filing as an attempt to take a child from loving parents and announced that, in protest, they would not provide DNA for testing. An arraignment occurred on January 24 and was televised live on CNN; Boisselier and Clonaid's vice president, Thomas Kaenzig, were subpoenaed in lieu of the child's parents. In courtroom testimony, the vice president of Clonaid said he knew very little about the clone, and that Boisselier controlled all the information. She did not attend the hearing, and Kaenzig provided little information, angering the judge, who threatened contempt of court charges. Boisselier attended a second hearing on January 29, telling the court <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> in Israel. The judge then ruled that the court had no jurisdiction. In late January, the science editor announced that he suspected the cloning announcements were a hoax. Around that time, Boisselier held a press conference at which she announced that the cloned baby's parents had cut off contact with her and would never speak to the press.|$|E
5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> brought up and named Adonis.|$|E

Asking questions {{is seen by}} many European American parents as a sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> smart. Italian parents, who value social and emotional competence, believe that asking questions <b>is</b> a sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> has good interpersonal skills. Dutch parents, who value independence, view asking questions negatively, as a sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>is</b> not independent.

This convenient formula sometimes causes difficulties for lovers or subsequent spouses who wish to assert paternity over a child which may be biologically theirs. A 2006 case, in which a child born eight months and two weeks after a divorce, was declared the former husband's child rather than the child of the wife's subsequent husband, and this was reported as causing a dilemma for the subsequent couple.|$|E

Norton, realising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> near death, sent for Caroline. Unfortunately, William died before she arrived in Scotland. Caroline blamed Norton for the child's death, accusing him of neglect.

Steven was the result of a one-night stand (in the bar of The Queen Victoria public house) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven’s true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon’s mother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat would believe Cindy’s claim initially. Simon’s rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy pretend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> Ian’s.|$|E
25|$|After viewing Kohler's tape, Langdon, Vittoria and the {{cardinals}} confront the camerlengo. Shortly before the novel begins, the Pope met with Leonardo Vetra {{who believed that}} antimatter was capable of establishing a link between science and God. Vetra's beliefs caused great discomfort to the camerlengo. While discussing Vetra, the pope reveals that his support is due to science having given him a son. Without waiting to hear the explanation (<b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>was</b> the result of artificial insemination) and horrified that the Pope appeared to have broken his vow of chastity, the camerlengo plots to rectify the situation. He poisoned the pope and, {{under the guise of}} an Illuminati master (Janus), he recruited the assassin to kill Vetra, steal the antimatter and kidnap and murder the preferiti. The camerlengo planted the antimatter in St. Peter's basilica, feigned his last minute vision from God and retrieved the canister just in time to save the Vatican from the ensuing explosion. This was in hope to unite the struggling Catholic Church. The Illuminati involvement was merely a plot engineered by the camerlengo to cover his own involvement. Upon the discovery and the camerlengo's attempts to justify his murder of the Pope, Cardinal Saverio Mortati, Dean of the College of Cardinals, reveals that the camerlengo is in fact the late pope's biological son, conceived with a nun through artificial insemination. Overcome with guilt, Ventresca soaks himself in oil and sets himself on fire before a crowd of onlookers in St. Peter's Square. His ashes are recovered by Mortati, who places them in an urn which is placed inside his father's sarcophagus. It is revealed that {{the cardinals}}' endorsing of him would have made him Pope by acclamation. Mortati is unanimously elected pope by the cardinals and Langdon and Vittoria reunite at Hotel Berniniwhere they share an extensive meal before making love. The last brand, the Illuminati Diamond, is given to Langdon on indefinite loan, provided he return it to the Vatican in his will.|$|E

The family concluded that a faulty drainage system at the back of their house had caused their son's illness. Pankhurst blamed the poor conditions of the neighbourhood, and the family moved to a more affluent middle class district at Russell Square.
