5|$|As a sophomore, {{he was a}} first-team All-area {{selection}} {{after leading}} Lake Central in scoring. On September 14, 2010, Robinson became the first verbal commitment to the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball class of 2012. At the time, he had scholarship offers from Colorado, Valparaiso, Missouri State, IUPUI and Indiana State, and Rivals.com rated him as the 118th {{best player in the}} class of 2012. On February 5, 2011, Robinson posted his career-high 39 points against East Chicago Central High School on 14-for-19 shooting. This was his first high school game that his father attended. In the 2011 Indiana sectional against Munster High School, Robinson scored 31 points in an overtime 5453 loss, but missed a free <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final seconds.|$|E
5|$|As part of Strasburg's {{rehabilitation}} {{from his}} Tommy John surgery, {{and as a}} precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided {{to limit the number}} of innings Strasburg would <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2012 season. Although the number was never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not pitch in the playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total should be limited, although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season. Teammate Jordan Zimmermann underwent a similar process the year before.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Wrestle Kingdom 11, Omega looked for {{another shot at}} the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, but his plan of obtaining one through the 2017 New Japan Cup was derailed, when he was eliminated in his first round match by Tomohiro Ishii. After defeating Ishii in a rematch on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2017, Omega was nominated by Kazuchika Okada for an IWGP Heavyweight Championship rematch at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall. On June 11 at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall, The Young Bucks defeated Roppongi Vice to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship for the sixth time. Later that same event, Guerrillas of Destiny defeated War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship for the third time. In the main event of the show, Omega and Okada wrestled to a 60-minute time limit draw for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The match also started a storyline, where Omega and Cody began having problems with each other with Cody wanting to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> towel for Omega, insisting he was too badly injured. On June 23 at Best in the World, Cody defeated Christopher Daniels to bring the ROH World Championship back to Bullet Club. On July 1, during {{the first night of}} G1 Special in USA, Guerrillas of Destiny lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship back to War Machine in a no disqualification match. In the main event of the show, Cody unsuccessfully challenged Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Omega, playing off what had happened at Dominion, walked out, wanting to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> towel for Cody, which led to Cody confronting him after the show. The following day, Omega defeated Tomohiro Ishii in the finals of an eight-man tournament to become the inaugural IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion.|$|E

5|$|Tatum is paroled and {{the media}} begins hyping the fight. Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer is in any danger, he will <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> towel. The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, Cousy made further progress. Averaging 7.7 assists per game, {{he won the}} first of his eight consecutive assists titles. These numbers were made {{despite the fact that the}} NBA had not yet introduced the shot clock, making the game static and putting prolific assist givers at a disadvantage. Powered by Auerbach's quick fastbreak-dominated tactics, the Celtics won 46 games and beat the Syracuse Nationals 2–0 in the 1953 NBA Playoffs. Game 2 ended 111–105 in a 4-overtime thriller, in which Cousy had a much-lauded game. Despite having an injured leg, he scored 25 points after four quarters, scored 6 of his team's 9 points in the first overtime, hit a clutch free <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last seconds, and scored all 4 of Boston's points in the second overtime. He scored 8 more points in the third overtime, among them a 25-ft. buzzer beater. In the fourth overtime, he scored 9 of Boston's 12 points. Cousy played 66 minutes, and scored 50 points after making a still-standing record of 30 free throws in 32 attempts. This game is regarded by the NBA as one of the finest scoring feats ever, in line with Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game. However, for the third time in a row, the Knicks beat Boston in the next round.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> towel. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed the towel into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the towel over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.|$|E

25|$|Gradually, {{despite the}} early {{punishment}} he received, Thompson warmed up and {{worked his way}} into the fight whilst Haye seemed to tire and slow down. Thompson began to pressure Haye and knocked Haye down with a chopping right hand in round 5. With seven seconds left in the round, Thompson landed two jabs followed by a flush right hand which cleanly caught a fatigued Haye, and compelled Haye's corner to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> towel; Haye was leading on all 3 score cards before the stoppage.|$|E
25|$|Although being {{projected}} a {{first round}} selection for the 2012 NFL Draft by midseason of 2011, Barkley {{then decided to}} return to USC for his senior season. As early as April 2012, he was projected the No. 1 overall pick for the 2013 NFL Draft. However, one month prior to the draft, Barkley's draft stock had fallen with ESPN draft analysts Mel Kiper Jr. and Todd McShay projecting Barkley to fall out of the first round. Due to his shoulder injury, Barkley did not <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indianapolis NFL Scouting Combine and instead took medical tests on his shoulder.|$|E
25|$|As a sophomore, Hoppen {{became one}} of the top players in the Big Eight Conference. He was one of only two players in the league (with Oklahoma's Wayman Tisdale) to score double-figures in each of his team's games, and was named first-team all-conference. He {{averaged}} 19.9 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, again leading the Cornhuskers to the 1984 NIT. There, Hoppen propelled the Cornhuskers past in-state rival Creighton in the first round by scoring a game-high 25 points, including a basket and a technical free <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final seconds to seal the 56–54 victory. In the next round, Nebraska lost a close 58–57 contest to Xavier in Cincinnati, despite Hoppen's game-high 22 points.|$|E

25|$|The 2006 season saw Lauro {{establish}} {{himself in}} the shot put at the senior level {{as he began to}} make effective use of the spin technique. After a fourth-place finish at the 2006 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics he broke the Argentine record for the event with a throw of 19.46m. At the 2006 South American Championships in Athletics he had a no <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discus but excelled in the shot put, taking the gold medal with a mark of 18.97m. A South American under-23 record of 19.78m came at that year's South American U23 Championships, where he won both the shot put and discus titles. He also extended his personal best in the discus to 60.30m, clearing sixty metres for the first time.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} {{event at the}} 1976 French Athletics Championships, he was {{selected}} in the discus for the Canadian Olympic team for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. However, he fouled three times and ended his first major competition without a mark to his name. He won back-to-back national shot put titles in 1976–1977, but {{a year later he}} finished behind fellow Canadian Bruno Pauletto at both the Canadian championships and the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, where Dolegiewicz took the bronze medal with a throw of 18.45 m. That year he achieved his personal best <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shot, tossing the metal ball a distance of 20.83m – a Canadian record. Between 1976 and 1983, only he and Pauletto won the honour, with the pair dominating the Canadian national scene.|$|E
25|$|The Blackhand Edition uses {{both the}} Wii Remote and the Nunchuk; if an enemy {{is on their}} knees, the player can pull the {{controllers}} upwards to lift them off the ground. Similarly, swinging the controllers {{from side to side}} swings an enemy around. Melee combat is similar to Wii Sports Boxing - the player literally throws the type of punch they want Aldo to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Slamming enemies against walls is accomplished by shoving the controllers towards the screen, and head-butts, by quickly raising them upwards. The remote can also be used for executions, which require specific gestures, for opening doors, and for reloading weapons. For example, to reload a shotgun, the player must move the Nunchuk upwards and then quickly downwards to mimic the pump action of the weapon, and to reload a revolver, the player must flick the Nunchuk as if emptying the cylinder.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{reached the}} semi-finals of the 2015 World Championship without facing a top 16 player. His closest game {{came in the}} third round where he edged past Kim Huybrechts 4–3. Taylor {{maintained}} his unbeaten semi-final record in World Championships as he won his 20th by beating Raymond van Barneveld 6–2 and faced Gary Anderson in the final. From 3–1 down, Taylor won nine of the next ten legs to move 4–3 up and then missed three darts to lead 5–3. Instead he fell 6–4 behind, but again rallied to draw level missing one dart at double 12 for a nine darter in the process. However, more failed attempts at doubles proved costly as he could not take out double 16 with three darts to hold <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deciding set and was defeated 7–6. The 32 180s the pair threw during the game broke the PDC World Championship final record of 31 which was set in Taylor's match against Van Barneveld in the 2007 final.|$|E
25|$|Law again proved {{his ability}} to make plays that matter in the Aggies' second game against Texas on February 28, 2007. Playing all 50 minutes during the Aggies' double-overtime 98–96 loss, Law scored a season-high 33 points, with 5 assists and five turnovers. His three pointer {{at the end of}} {{regulation}} tied the game, sending the teams into overtime. Another three-pointer with 26 seconds left in the first overtime again tied the game, leading to a second overtime. Fouled {{at the end of the}} second overtime so that he would not be able to rescue the Aggies with another last-second three-pointer, Law deliberately missed his second free <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hopes that the Aggies could recover the ball and score again. Law's outstanding season earned him the honors of being on the AP 1st Team All American squad. He also made Dick Vitale's 1st Team All American squad as players such as Arron Afflalo of UCLA, Alando Tucker of Wisconsin, and Nick Fazekas of Nevada did.|$|E
25|$|Owen and Bret feuded {{throughout}} the summer of 1994, clashing many times both in singles and later in tag team matches (with Bret joined by the returning British Bulldog). Two prominent matches took place in this feud: first, their steel cage match in the co-main event of SummerSlam for Bret's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Bret won. This match later received a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer. The second was a lumberjack match on August 17 that Owen initially won and was announced as WWF World Heavyweight Champion; Bret won the match after it was ordered to continue due to interference. At the Survivor Series, Owen struck the most damaging blow against his brother as he conned his own mother Helen to <b>throw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> towel for Bret. The ploy cost Bret the world title to Bob Backlund. Owen also prevented Bret from regaining the title at the Royal Rumble in 1995 when he interfered in the match between Bret and new champion Diesel. In the weeks after the Rumble, Bret and Owen clashed again with Bret soundly defeating his brother, thus {{putting an end to}} their feud for the time being.|$|E
