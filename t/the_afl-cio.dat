5|$|After {{years of}} {{disagreement}} with Meany, Reuther resigned from <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> executive council in February 1967. In 1968, Reuther led the UAW out of <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO,</b> and the UAW did not re-affiliate with <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> until 1981, long after Reuther's {{death in a}} 1970 plane crash.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 AFL–CIO President Lane Kirkland {{appointed}} Kahn {{to organize}} the AFL–CIO's support of Solidarity. <b>The</b> <b>AFL–CIO</b> sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, <b>the</b> <b>AFL–CIO</b> supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, <b>the</b> <b>AFL–CIO</b> established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office supplies. <b>The</b> <b>AFL–CIO</b> donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{an assistant to}} the President of <b>the</b> <b>AFL–CIO</b> in 1972, a position he held until 1986, Kahn developed an expertise in international affairs.

In response, <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of a code of ethics, {{in the wake of the}} scandal.|$|E

5|$|William George Meany (August 16, 1894 – January 10, 1980) was an American {{labor union}} leader for 57 years. He {{was the key}} figure in the {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> and served as the AFL-CIO's first president, from 1955 to 1979.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. <b>The</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E

5|$|The AFL–CIO's {{autonomous}} {{support of}} Solidarity {{was so successful}} that by 1984 both Democrats and Republicans agreed that it deserved public support. The AFL–CIO's example of open support was deemed to be appropriate for a democracy, and much more suitable than the clandestine funding through the CIA that had occurred before 1970. Both parties and President Ronald Reagan supported a non-governmental organization, National Endowment for Democracy (NED), through which Congress would openly fund Solidarity through an allocation in the State Department's budget, beginning in 1984. The NED was designed with four core institutions, associated with {{the two major parties}} and with <b>the</b> <b>AFL-CIO</b> and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing business). The NED's first president was Carl Gershman, a former Director of Social Democrats, USA and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations committee on human rights.
