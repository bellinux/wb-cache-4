40|$|Incineration is a {{promising}} technique for {{the disposal of}} organic hazardous wastes. However, the waste destruction characteristics of turbulent spray flames have not been characterized. In the present research two reactors are used to simulate various aspects of liquid injection incinerator flame zones. The following questions are addressed: (1) Under what conditions do flames quantitatively destroy waste compounds, and (2) how must the flame be perturbed to cause it to fail to quantitatively destroy wastes. The two reactors operated on a simulated waste stream consisting of acrylonitrile, benzene, chlorobenzene, and chloroform. A microspray reactor was used to investigate destruction processes associated with individual droplets of waste compounds. A turbulent flame reactor used a heptane-fueled waste-doped turbulent spray flame to simulate incinerator flame-zone processes. The flames {{were found to be}} capable of quantitative waste destruction without the necessity of using common post-flame processes such as afterburners. Furthermore, the high waste destruction efficiency conditions corresponded to high combustion efficiency conditions (i. e., minimum CO and hydrocarbon emissions). Failure to achieve high destruction efficiency resulted from the perturbation of flame parameters. Failure conditions were identified with high and low <b>theoretical</b> <b>air,</b> low temperature, poor atomization quality, and flame impingement on a cold surface. Each failure condition also resulted in elevated CO and hydrocarbon emissions. Thus, the results suggest that CO and hydrocarbon measurements can be used as an indirect, continuous means of monitoring incinerator flame-zone performance. © 1985 Combustion Institute...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} the world is on the {{reduction}} of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which contribute to the global warming currently experienced. Because most of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere is from fossil fuel combustion, alternative energy sources were developed and others are currently under study to see whether they will be good alternatives. One of these alternative sources of energy is the combustion of wood instead of coal. The advantages of wood are that it is a neutral carbon fuel source and that currently installed infrastructure used to combust coal can be retrofitted to combust wood or a mixture of wood and coal in an attempt to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions. Spent nuclear fuel has to be cooled so that the decay heat generated does not melt the containment system, which could lead to the unintentional release of radioactive material to the surroundings. The heat transfer mechanisms involved in the cooling have historically been analysed by assuming that the fluid and solid phases are at local thermal equilibrium (LTE) in order to simplify the analysis. The exergy destruction of the combustion of pine wood in an adiabatic combustor was investigated in this thesis using analytical and computational methods. The exergy destruction of the combustion process was analysed by means of the second law efficiency, which is the ratio of the maximum work that can be achieved by a Carnot engine extracting heat from the combustor, and the optimum work of the combustor. This was done for <b>theoretical</b> <b>air</b> combustion and various excess air combustions, with varied inlet temperatures of the incoming air. It was found that the second law efficiency reached an expected maximum for <b>theoretical</b> <b>air</b> combustion, and this held true for all varying air inlet temperatures. However, it was found that as the air inlet temperature was increased more and more, the maximum second law efficiency was the same for all excess air combustions, including the <b>theoretical</b> <b>air</b> combustion. It was also found that the results of the analytical and commercial computational fluid dynamics code compared well. Another analysis was conducted of irreversibilities generated due to combustion in an adiabatic combustor burning wood. This was done for a reactant mixture varying from a rich to a lean mixture. A non-adiabatic non-premixed combustion model of a numerical code was used to simulate the combustion process where the solid fuel was modelled by using the ultimate analysis data. The entropy generation rates due to the combustion and frictional pressure drop processes were computed to eventually arrive at the irreversibilities generated. It was found that the entropy generation rate due to frictional pressure drop was negligible when compared with that due to combustion. It was also found that a minimum in irreversibilities generated was achieved when the air-fuel mass ratio was 4. 9, which corresponded to an equivalent ratio of 1. 64, which was lower than the respective air-fuel mass ratio and equivalent ratio for complete combustion with theoretical amount of air of 8. 02 and 1. Studieswere conducted to numerically analyse irreversibilities generated due to combustion in an adiabatic combustor burning wood. The first study analysed the effect of changing the incoming air temperature from 298 K to 400 K. The second study analysed the effect of changing the wall condition of the combustor from adiabatic to negative heat flux (that is heat leaving the system) for an incoming air temperature of 400 K. The irreversibilities generated in the combustor were calculated by computing the entropy generation rates due to the combustion, heat transfer and frictional pressure drop processes. For {{the first part of the}} study, it was found that for the minimum irreversibilities generated in the adiabatic combustor, the optimal air-fuel ratio (AF) corresponding to minimum irreversibilities slightly reduced from 4. 9 to 4. 8. In the second part of the study, it was found that by changing the wall condition from adiabatic to heat flux on the combustor, the AF corresponding to the minimum irreversibilities increased from 4. 8 to 6. For the third part of the study, the combustor with a heat flux wall condition and a wall thickness simulated at an AF of 6, the sum of twice the wall thickness and the optimum diameter always added up to 0. 32 m, resulting in the minimum irreversibilities. An analytical model was developed to minimise the thermal resistance of an air-cooled porous matrix made up of solid spheres with internal heat generation. This was done under the assumption of LTE. It was found that the predicted optimum sphere diameter and the minimum thermal resistance were both robust in that they were independent of the heat generation rate of the solid spheres. Results from the analytical model were compared with those from a commercial numerical porous model using liquid water and air for the fluid phase, and wood and silica for the solid phase. The magnitudes of the minima of both the temperature difference and the thermal resistance seemed to be due to equal contribution from the thermal conduction heat transfer inside the solid spheres and heat transfer in the porous medium. Because the commercial numerical porous model modelled only the heat transfer occurring in the porous medium, it expectedly predicted half of the magnitudes of the minima of the temperature difference and thermal resistance of those by the analytical model.

40|$|Purpose: A {{theoretical}} model is {{developed for the}} air-bending process and V-die bending experiments are conducted. Based on comparisons between springback ratios predicted using the developed <b>theoretical</b> <b>air</b> bending model and the V-die bending experiments, a semi-empirical formula for predicting springback ratio in V-die bending process is suggested. The validity of this formula is verified using finite element simulations as well as comparisons {{with the results of}} two other independent sets of experiments. Design/methodology/approach: A {{theoretical model}} for air bending is developed and compared with published models. Experimental work on V-die bending is conducted. The experimental results are used in a correlation analysis to develop a mathematical expression for predicting springback ratio of V-die bending as a correction of the spring back ratio of air bending. These results are verified by comparisons with finite element simulations as well as with other independent sets of experiments. Findings: Springback ratios for V-die bending could be predicted using the developed semi-empirical formula. For a given limit of the striking (coining) force, springback ratios are affected by sheet thickness, bend radius, and material parameters. Research limitations/implications: This work suggests a methodology for the prediction of springback ratio in V-die bending. This work can be extended by studying the effect of anisotropy on the developed springback ratio. Practical implications: The developed semi-empirical formula could be practically used in determining the springback ratio for V-die bending. The selection of the sheet thickness and bend radius are critical parameters that affect springback ratios. Originality/value: A semi-empirical formula is suggested for the prediction of springback ratio in V-die bending. This is viewed as a correction of the theoretically predicted air bending springback ratios. This formula could be of help to those working in sheet metal forming industries...|$|E

The completed {{test facility}} consisted of two systems: 1) the feed-air system, which simulated the inlet-air conditions and performed the feed-air dehumidification and sensible cooling and 2) the vacuum system, which enabled the feed-air dehumidification by evacuating the membrane permeate side. The feed-air system as constructed was able to supply membrane-inlet flow rates up to 10 scfm over a range of temperature and relative humidity conditions, including 90 ?F and 90 %RH, which was specified by the project sponsor. In addition, the feed-air system components included a membrane module installation site for dehumidification as well as a sensible cooling system to cool the membrane-outlet air to the 55 ?F and 50 %RH conditions again specified by the sponsor. Measurement stations were placed at the membrane-inlet, membrane-outlet, and the sensible cooler outlet to measure the temperature and relative humidity at these critical locations. The vacuum system as built used a Pfeiffer DUO 10 Vacuum Pump with a 7 cfm pumping capacity, which was preceded by a 60 plate heat exchanger with an effective area of 2. 05 m^(2) and an Oerlikon-Leybold WA 250 roots blower. The air leakage in the vacuum system was calculated to be less than 1 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>air</b> permeation through the membrane module.

40|$|Transport {{of animals}} is {{of a big}} concern and {{different}} means to improve welfare and decrease transport mortality or dead on arrival, DOA, must be looked for. In a previous/former project,”Chicktrans”,it was concluded {{that the incidence of}} DOA of broiler chickens, was not affected by transportation time or by the outer climate during transport to the processing plant. Although, it was found that DOA between farms, delivering to the same processing plant, differed significantly. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine differences in the condition/health status of the broiler chickens, influenced by climate management of the chicken house, during their last week and the day for catch. The litter quality was also a factor examined for influencing broiler chickens and contributes to chickens being “fit for transport”. One of many animal welfare and health status measures, affected by stable climate management, is foot score, which we also have chosen to study. The aim of the study was therefore to analyze if there are differences among measurable variables, which could explain why some breeders always managed to end up with low and some with a high incidence of DOA, when delivering to the processing plant, during the period from year 2001 to 2008. The study was collaboration with a processing plant of Kronfågel in Kristianstad, Sweden. We selected breeders who consequently had produced broiler chickens with low incidence of DOA, A-farms, and those who had produced at a higher incidence of DOA, B-farms. Nine A-farms and six B-farms from region Skåne and Blekinge, were involved in this study. During the period from year 2001 and 2008, the incidence of DOA was in average 0, 085 % +/- 0, 038 at the A-farms, which was significantly lower (p< 0, 0001) compared to 0, 187 % +/- 0, 060 at the B-farms. The breeders also answered a survey to get basic data from the farms. Kronfågel contributed with slaughter data from the selected farms. The investigation was divided in two periods for each farm, the last week before catch and the day of catch. Measurements were performed during midst of the summer until late autumn, during year 2008. A total of 473 776 broiler chickens (Ross 308) were slaughtered. Loading staff, feed supplier and straw material were the same at all A- and B-farms. Transportation time never exceeded 3 hours. During the last week before catch, temperature and relative humidity was measured with loggers at two different points on the litter, 15 cm above surface and one logger was placed outdoors. At the day of catch, CO 2 -levels were also measured at floor level, at the front where the birds were picked up by the machine. Nine of the farms had their catching during daytime, while six of the farms had their catching during nighttimes. In connection with loading, samples were taken at 9 different points to evaluate the moisture content in the litter. More than half of the farms were build in the beginning of the year of 2000, large buldings at a total of around 4 000 m 2, divided into two sections. The smallest farms were built in the beginning of the year of 1970 /the seventies, with an area of around 660 to 2 112 m 2 per section. The ventilation was in overall exhaust (under pressure) ventilation systems from different manufacturers. Table A summarize the results from our research. Both the level and the difference between A- and B-farms regarding DOA, were the same during our project as during the period of year 2001 - 2008. The analyzes showed no correlations between DOA and the parameters measured which could give any expla-nation regarding climate in the broiler house, and why the A-farms had a lower incidence of DOA. Despite a low foot score at the A-farms compared to B-farms, there was higher moisture content in the litter at A-farms, although no signinficant differences. Table A.

No signs of “puncturing” of the ventilation were seen. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>air</b> flow rates in the houses was generally only 50 % of the recommended and the controls of the venti-lation (fans) was in many cases not working satisfactory. This should be controlled and improved. For future research it is suggested that systematically investigation of how to establish and maintain the litter in good shape i. e. moisture content should not exceed 37 % to increase the presumption to reach a low foot score...|$|E
40|$|<b>Theoretical</b> {{analyses}} of <b>air</b> traffic complexity {{were carried out}} using the Method for the Analysis of Relational Complexity. Twenty-two air traffic controllers examined static air traffic displays and were required to detect and resolve conflicts. Objective measures of performance included conflict detection time and accuracy. Subjective perceptions of mental workload were assessed by a complexity-sorting task and subjective ratings {{of the difficulty of}} different aspects of the task. A metric quantifying the complexity of pair-wise relations among aircraft was able to account for {{a substantial portion of the}} variance in the perceived complexity and difficulty of conflict detection problems, as well as reaction time. Other variables that influenced performance included the mean minimum separation between aircraft pairs and the amount of time that aircraft spent in conflict. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the <b>theoretical</b> potential of <b>air,</b> winds, and atmosphere as they place ux, transience, and motion {{at the center}} of the human predicament. Based on ethnographic eldwork conducted among urban Zulu Zionists, it is argued that the winds blowing across the landscape of KwaZulu-Natal also blew through bodies and in the process restructured subjectivities. Through a general discussion of the phenomenal aspects of air, I argue that we need to approach our sen- sory relations to weather and atmosphere with a diachronic focus on changing local body-worlds. This is, I argue, a leap of the imagination that is needed in order to challenge the material and visual that implic- itly underpin much social theory. Such a theoretical move is needed in order to properly approach weather-worlds...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} {{experimental}} and <b>theoretical</b> study of <b>air</b> dehydration kinetics of Daucus carota var. Nantes in laboratory scale drying chamber. Steam blanching as a pretreatment was applied prior to dehydration of shreds {{and the results}} indicated a gradual decrease in drying time from 2. 9 to 5. 5 % in temperature range of 50 – 70 °C, for steam blanched samples in comparison to untreated carrots. Four different mathematical drying models (Newton, Page, Modified Page and Henderson and Pabis) were evaluated for goodness of fit by comparing their respective R 2, χ 2, and RMSE parameters. Comparison of the statistical parameters led to conclusion that Page model showed {{a better quality of}} fit and presents dehydration characteristics in better way to obtain drying curves than any other model...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and <b>theoretical</b> study of <b>air</b> exchange through porous screens and window openings in greenhouses {{was conducted in}} order to characterize {{the influence of the}} resistance of porous screens and window openings on airlow and to characterize wind velocities and air temperature differences which derive these flows. Fluctuations in wind velocity were related to the mean wind velocity through a parameter which is evaluated based on a power spectrum analysis. In turn, wind pressure was related to this mean wind velocity such that the turbulence was taken into account. The relationship between air exchange through porous screens or window openings and the driving potential was studied based on an approach derived from fluid mechanics. The predictions made of airflow versus wind pressure and temperature differences agree reasonably well with experimental data, differences between them being less than 20 %, in general...|$|R
