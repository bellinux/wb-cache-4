5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E
5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|When Dean Solomon {{suffered}} a season-ending knee injury in late March, Hall {{was one of}} three players in contention to be promoted to the senior list in place of Solomon. After approximately one month of assessment Hall was deemed the most impressive of Essendon's three rookies and was elevated to the senior list. In early June, Hall played particularly well in defence for the reserves against the Murray Kangaroos, and was subsequently in consideration to play for Essendon's senior team. Essendon had been plagued by injury throughout 2002 and this, coupled with Hall's good form in the VFL, resulted in him making his AFL debut in round 12 against Hawthorn. After a poor performance in his debut match, in which he did not record a statistic and spent most of the match on the bench, Hall was dropped backed to the VFL side the following round. Despite showing good form in the VFL for the remainder of 2002, Hall was unable to break back into the senior Bombers line-up. Although Hall failed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> at AFL level, he played well at VFL level and was third in the reserves' best and fairest award.|$|E

25|$|Although {{educated at}} Prince Alfred College in Adelaide, Bateman played his two {{first-class}} matches for Western Australia, debuting against his former {{state at the}} Adelaide Oval in March 1893. He dismissed opener Alfred Wilkinson for 12 and bowled future Test player Clem Hill for a duck with the ball and was then his team's second top run scorer in their first innings with 20 before Ernie Jones trapped him leg before wicket. Western Australia followed on and Bateman was dismissed for just one in the second innings. A few days later he appeared again in a match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He struggled <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> as he failed to take a wicket and scored a duck in his only innings. Bateman didn't get an opportunity in the second innings as he was absent hurt.|$|E
25|$|The evangelical revelation {{contains}} the truth on the violence, available for two thousand years, Girard tells us. Has it {{put an end}} to the sacrificial order based on violence in the society that has claimed the gospel text as its own religious text? No, he replies, since in order for a truth <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> it must find a receptive listener, and people do not change that quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very well how to despise and ignore its victims, nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing, in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{the ambitious}} Andronikos Komnenos, cousin of Emperor Manuel, watched {{affairs in the}} capital from the Pontus, {{where he had been}} {{appointed}} governor. His sons Manuel and John had participated in the revolt, and the leaders of the conspiracy were in contact with him. Andronikos sent many letters of his own to his nephew, the young Alexios II, to the Patriarch Theodosios, and others, bemoaning the usurpation of the young emperor's rights by the prōtosebastos, and the impropriety of the latter's alleged relationship with the Empress-regent. Relying on his oath to Emperor Manuel to uphold the rule of both Manuel and Alexios II—an oath occasioned more by his own, well-known ambitions—he even claimed to have been charged by the late Manuel to safeguard the rule of his son. Following the suppression of the uprising, his daughter Maria hastened to him at Sinope, bearing news; and soon more letters came from the capital urging him to intervene. In autumn 1181, Andronikos began his march against Constantinople, proceeding slowly so as to give the impression of a large and cumbersome force, and giving time for his propaganda <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact.</b> Only the city of Nicaea under John Doukas and the Theme of Thrace, under the megas domestikos John Komnenos Vatatzes, rejected his claims and resisted his advance. Choniates accuses the prōtosebastos of lethargy and neglect ("he was unmanly and not only spent the early morning in sound sleep but also wasted most of the day sleeping") in dealing with Andronikos, but these accusations are not repeated by Skoutariotes and are dismissed by modern scholars.|$|E
