5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E

25|$|A strong {{magnetic}} field {{is applied to}} the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> insulated, and the {{magnetic field}} is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, all ESC {{manufacturers}} emphasize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> not {{a performance}} enhancement nor {{a replacement for}} safe driving practices, but rather a safety technology to assist the driver in recovering from dangerous situations. ESC does not increase traction, so it does not enable faster cornering (although it can facilitate better-controlled cornering). More generally, ESC works within inherent limits of the vehicle's handling and available traction between the tyres and road. A reckless maneuver can still exceed these limits, resulting in loss of control. For example, in a severe hydroplaning scenario, the wheels that ESC would use to correct a skid may not even initially be {{in contact with the}} road, reducing its effectiveness.|$|E

25|$|This {{definition}} remains meaningful {{even when}} the system is far away from equilibrium. Other definitions assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> in thermal equilibrium, either as an isolated system, or as a system in exchange with its surroundings. The set of microstates (with probability distribution) on which the sum is done is called a statistical ensemble. Each type of statistical ensemble (micro-canonical, canonical, grand-canonical, etc.) describes a different configuration of the system's exchanges with the outside, varying from a completely isolated system to a system that can exchange one or more quantities with a reservoir, like energy, volume or molecules. In every ensemble, the equilibrium configuration {{of the system is}} dictated by the maximization of the entropy of the union of the system and its reservoir, according to the second law of thermodynamics (see the statistical mechanics article).|$|E
25|$|The 100th accident, {{as defined}} by METRO, {{occurred}} on August 10, 2005. In the judgement of METRO police only two of these were {{the fault of the}} train operator. Most crashes resulted from drivers turning into the trains or running red lights. Following the Texas A report METRO implemented four-way red lights at some crossings and other safety measures which led to a 75% reduction in incidents per train mile even as service ramped up. Critics have also noted the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> at-grade, while supporters contend that lack of federal funding due to political opposition made construction of a grade separated rail line unfeasible. Sociology and urban studies professor Stephen Klineberg argues that the high rate of crashes in Houston is attributable to the high rate of automobile driving and low rate of walking in Houston.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the driving}} {{requirements}} for the new trainer will be to help prepare pilots for the increased complexity in some areas, particularly information management, that {{are a part of}} fifth generation jet fighters like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II. The Air Force first viewed this as unnecessary and costly, but industry analysis showed it to be cheaper in the long run. The aircraft and simulation system will have to fulfill several basic training roles; basic aircraft control, airmanship, formation, instrument and navigation, advanced air-to-air, advanced air-to-ground, and advanced crew/cockpit resource management. Furthermore, there are five advanced training roles <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> expected to fulfill; sustained high-G operations at 6.5–7.5g, aerial refueling, night vision imaging systems operations, air-to-air intercepts, and data-link operations. The 2009 Request For Information (RFI) mentions that some tasks, such as aerial refueling, may be performed in the simulator and not on the aircraft itself. Aircraft availability is to be 80%, but not higher, as that would drive cost too high. Program requirements focus on life-cycle costs rather than just purchase price.|$|E
