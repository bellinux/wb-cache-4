A man stood ready at a wheel, which, by a few rapid turns, could bring the whole affair to a standstill should anything go wrong. In the fore-tank eight men guided each coil to prevent entanglement, and on deck men were stationed a few feet apart all along to the stern, to watch every foot as it passed out.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore TechnologyThe light well {{intervention}} for subsea wells using riserless method {{has been carried}} out extensively over the last 10 years to increase the oil and gas recovery from depleted wells. Riserless Light Well Intervention (RLWI) is a relatively new technology {{that can be used to}} replace the majority of the well interventions previously done from semisubmersible rigs. RLWI performs subsea well intervention without using a drilling riser package and a subsea BOP. Alternatively, the Well Control Package (WCP) will be installed on top of subsea Xmas Tree as a barrier replacing BOP and then downhole tools can be deployed into the subsea well utilizing wireline from intervention vessel. The RLWI method is expected to reduce the cost and time in performing well intervention compared to conventional method. But when it comes to lowering down the downhole tool, it has a major issue regarding the accuracy in determining the operational well depth for “in well” work. During RLWI operation in deep water, the environmental conditions will have much influence to the wireline part that is suspended in open water. It is found very difficult to measure part of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> length that has been submerged into the well since it depends on the “deflection shape” of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> after it get exposed to the varying sea current from surface to sea bottom. The environmental load from sea current acting along <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> length will be transformed into uplift force on the other end of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> inside <b>the</b> well. The combination of vertical displacement in upward direction due to uplift force and in downward direction due to cable stretch will affect the accuracy of the well depth measurement and position control of the downhole tool. Depth accuracy is very crucial in performing work inside the well. This project will study <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> behavior under prevailing dynamic sea environment for RLWI wireline operation in North Sea and will present one approach to correct inaccuracy in determining the exact location of the downhole tool inside the well from marine perspective. The study case was taken from Aasta Hansteen field with 1300 meters water depth in particular. OrcaFlex software will be utilized to perform static and dynamic analysis of <b>the</b> wireline <b>cable</b> under <b>sea</b> current and wave effect. OrcaFlex was developed by Orcina to support a wide range of hydrodynamic and marine structural analysis, including modeling <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> under <b>sea</b> current. During the analysis, the wireline behavior under currents will be observed for different operational well depth cases. The analysis results obtained from OrcaFlex simulations are vertical displacements and forces acting upon the wireline. Then recommended measures are discussed in this thesis to maximize the accuracy during “in well” work with different types of downhole tool weight. In addition, this thesis will also discuss the latest technologies of light well intervention, such as well control equipments used nowadays in RLWI operations...|$|R

40|$|Underwater cables {{have been}} {{connecting}} continents since the 1860 s. Over time, {{the process of}} laying <b>cables</b> at <b>sea</b> has developed into a state-of-the-art operation. Now these operations are becoming more technologically advanced {{and it is possible}} to lay large diameter electric cables over large distances. One method is to lay cables in two or more lengths to have them jointed together mid-sea. A particular challenge will occur in case an unplanned splicing will be necessary. In this thesis, we will explore the design criteria for such <b>cables</b> and <b>the</b> procedures and challenges of installation. Furthermore, the effects of how dynamic motions of the vessel and sea influence the situation in deep water will be explored. The OrcaFlex software will be used to simulate and analyze the effects of waves on vessel motion, and how this may affect <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> during a jointing operation of two cables at different water depths. The effects of current forces on <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> are to be analyzed and how <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> reacts to both current and wave forces. This analysis method can assist in determining the weather criteria for a jointing operation to prevent excessive bending, compression or fatigue damage in <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> When installing a cable in an area with currents, one needs {{to take into account the}} direction of the currents relative to <b>the</b> <b>cable,</b> as tension and bending of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> are highly affected by the direction and strength of the current. From the OrcaFlex analysis, one can see that vessel motion due to waves are more critical to <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> with respect to fatigue damage in shallow water (100 m) than in deep water (1200 m). The residual bottom tension in <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> at <b>the</b> touch down point is, however, more sensitive to the vessel motion at deep water than in shallow water. In areas with waves and currents, a current approaching <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> at 0 degrees will decrease the critical parameters. The bottom tension is less affected by the vessel motion and <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> will experience less bending cycles over the laying wheel. With a large current approaching at 180 degrees (i. e. toward the vessel), the bending of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> increases and hence <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> may experience fatigue damage sooner. The bottom tension in <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> will become more sensitive to vessel motions in this situation and the risk of loops developing will increase as tension decreases. By changing the location of the laying wheel, one can improve the situation. Placing the wheel closer to the center of the stern will reduce the effect of vessel motion on <b>cable</b> tension. <b>The</b> cyclic bending of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> is, however, less affected by changing the laying wheel location. A HAZID carried out for cable installation, shows that there are many risks and hazardous events that may occur during the operation in connection to <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> integrity. Handling these risks early may reduce both their probability of occurring and the related consequences. One finding in the analysis is that there are different requirements for laying cable and jointing operations. The suitable sea states for jointing are more limited than for laying. When vessel and cable are standing still, all bending occurs at the same place in <b>the</b> <b>cable,</b> resulting in increased risk of fatigue damage, hence it is necessary with a calmer sea state for this kind of operation. Future work might emphasis on developing quick connectors to quickly join cable ends offshore. Reference is here made to the offshore oil and gas industry’s underwater connectors...|$|R
