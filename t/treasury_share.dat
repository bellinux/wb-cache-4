40|$|Background/Objectives: This study {{explores the}} {{incidence}} of cancelling treasury shares events in Malaysia and examines the financial characteristics of companies that {{are more likely to}} cancel their shares. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The study utilizes descriptive analysis to assess {{the incidence of}} cancelling <b>treasury</b> <b>share</b> events among non-financial and non utility Malaysian companies. Tobit regression analysis is used to gauge the relationship between firm financial characteristics and the incidence of cancelling <b>treasury</b> <b>share</b> events. Findings: There were a total of 175 events of cancelling treasury shares occurred between the years 2001 and 2012. This study finds that profitability positively and significantly affects the decision to cancel treasury shares, while excess cash flows negatively influence a firm’s decision to cancel treasury shares. Furthermore, smaller size companies are {{more likely to engage in}} cancelling their shares. Application/Improvements: The study finds that smaller firms are more likely to cancel their treasury shares as these companies may have severe information asymmetry problems...|$|E

40|$|One of the paradoxes {{in company}} {{law is the}} {{phenomenon}} of <b>treasury</b> <b>shares.</b> Their complex nature coupled with the risks attached to their use has rendered them problematic and unnecessary in modern company law. Refuting arguments stated {{against the use of}} <b>treasury</b> <b>shares,</b> this paper aims to build a case for the introduction of <b>treasury</b> <b>shares</b> into South African company law. In order to achieve this, the paper will firstly examine the nature and complexity of <b>treasury</b> <b>shares.</b> Thereafter, it will discuss their importance in modern company law by highlighting their commercial value. A study of their incorporation into a few jurisdictions will also be discussed in an attempt to propose a manner in which South Africa can introduce <b>treasury</b> <b>shares</b> into its law.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at 2016 FMA Annual Meeting, October 19 - 22, 2016, Las Vegas, NevadaWe study how dilutive board-level stock options impact anti-dilutive daily buybacks in the UK. We show that buyback behaviour and stock option holdings positively influence cumulative post-buyback returns. Buybacks, however, have anti-dilutive implications {{and are thus}} linked to the level and nature of dilutive stock options outstanding. We find increases in aggregate stock options to escalate buyback implementation. This is driven largely by unvested stock options that significantly enhance anti-dilutive benefits. Robustness tests using “overconfident” board classification and <b>treasury</b> <b>share</b> regulation confirm the anti-dilutive motive behind buybacks when stock options are unvested...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} settlement-date {{accounting}} for equity share options {{can be seen}} as an accounting method which implements a shareholder focused residually rewarded partners’ equity view. This equity view represents a simple, natural extension of the shareholder proprietary view. It implicates an equity and income sharing model for accounting which is characterized by specification of both shareholders’ and non-shareholders’ parts of total equity and income. When using this equity and income sharing model, the remeasurements of equity share option obligations made by settlement-date accounting are fully conceptually valid. They represent measurements of one partner group’s share of total equity with effect for another group’s share of total equity and income: the shareholders’ part. Partially, this equity and income sharing model is already the basis for existing accounting standards. It is shown that an intriguing implication of the equity and income sharing model is the fact that treasury shares can hedge present shareholders’ share price risk from the obligation to holders of equity share options. A special hedge accounting construct is needed to account for this hedge effect, and the construct of this model is shown. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the long run expense effects for shareholders from equity share options by settlement-date accounting both when the expense effects are unhedged and when they are hedged with <b>treasury</b> <b>share</b> holdings. The results demonstrate that the expenses resulting from settlement-date accounting for equity share option awards are significantly higher on average than the expenses resulting from grant-date accounting. And they show that the cost of equity, the share price volatility and the lifetime of the equity share options are important determinants for the size of the differences in total expenses, which in a long run perspective is to be expected from the use of these two alternative accounting models for equity share options. The simulation results demonstrate that hedging with <b>treasury</b> <b>share</b> holdings is very effective to stabilize expenses resulting from options granted to employeesNo keywords;...|$|E

Employers were required {{to comply with the}} law for coverage that began on or after October 3, 2009. The Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of the <b>Treasury</b> <b>share</b> oversight for MHPAEA.

This report describes (1) the extent to which employers cover MH/SU through private health insurance plans, and how this coverage has changed since 2008; and (2) what is known about the effect of health insurance coverage for MH/SU on enrollees' health care expenditures; access to, or use of, MH/SU services; and health status. GAO surveyed a random sample of employers about their MH/SU coverage for the most current plan year and for 2008. GAO received usable responses from 168 employers [...] a 24 percent response rate. The survey results are not generalizable; rather, they provide information limited to responding employers' MH/SU coverage.

40|$|In April 2002 the International Monetary Fund {{introduced}} a sovereign bankruptcy proposal {{only to be}} rebuffed by the United States Treasury. Where the IMF wanted a mandatory bankruptcy regime, the Treasury wanted to solve distress problems with contractual devices. Sovereign bondholders and sovereign issuers themselves flatly rejected both proposals, {{even though they were}} nominally the beneficiaries of both proponents. This Article addresses and explains this bondholder reaction. In so doing, it takes a highly skeptical view of the IMF 2 ̆ 7 s proposal even as it shows that the incentive structure surrounding sovereign lending renders untenable the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s contractarian proposal. The Article 2 ̆ 7 s analysis follows from a review and restatement of the economic learning on sovereign debt relationships. The IMF and the <b>Treasury</b> <b>share</b> the objective facilitating restructuring by substituting a regime of collective action for the prevailing practice of requiring unanimous bondholder consent to significant amendments of bond contracts. In so doing they follow a conventional wisdom respecting bond contracts under which standard unanimity provisions are inefficient and irrational. The Article shows that this dismissal of the unanimity requirement comes too quickly. Under our analysis of the problem the debtor distress, bondholders rationally may prefer to make compositions harder to conclude. There is no first best equilibrium bond contract; instead bondholders select from a menu of second best forms, making trade offs between unanimous action and collective action provisions in an imperfect world. One factor leading lenders to favor unanimous action is the need to self protect. In a world without a good faith backstop, creditors motivated by side deals can take advantage of majority rule to impose suboptimal compositions. Holding out is the only weapon available to the minority creditor. The Article argues that, given such side deals, a stable majoritarian regime cannot be achieved as a matter of free contract. Mandate will be necessary. It follows that the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s contractarian approach is implausible absent a backstop regime of intercreditor good faith duties. The Article draws on the history of corporate reorganization prior to the enactment of the section 77 B of the Bankruptcy Act of 1934 to show that courts have grappled with these questions before, intervening aggressively on equitable principles...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Market {{capitalisation}} is {{a measure}} of size and prestige for various JSE listed companies. Changes in the Companies Act in relation to the capital maintenance provided companies the opportunity to repurchase their own shares. South Africa’s legislation is different to those of its international peers which resulted in a different interpretation of how to deal with <b>treasury</b> <b>shares</b> and resultantly impacted on the valuation of market capitalisation. This study was undertaken with the aim of establishing if there are differences in the reporting of closing balances of the number of shares of the company and group as provided by the share analysis section of the annual financial reports which is required by the JSE Listing Requirements. Thirty-four companies were selected specifically, analysed and compared to information as per the University of Stellenbosch Business School share program to determine whether differences arise and to determine the impact that this has on the market capitalisation valuation and explanations for deviations. The results reflected that the non reconciliation of closing balances of the group was primarily due to the non consolidation of trusts, subsidiaries and <b>treasury</b> <b>shares</b> and companies not adhering to the listing requirements as per section 3. 3 of the shareholders’ spread to adequately disclose treasury related transactions. The study also found ambiguity in accounting standards IAS 1 in that they did not provide conclusive guidance in terms of the disclosure of share movements in rand value and units to reconcile between opening and closing balances of all <b>treasury</b> <b>shares.</b> Changes in the tax legislation will in future negate the reason for share repurchases through the subsidiaries or trusts which {{will have an impact on}} the reconciliation process going forward. Ultimately the accounting profession and JSE will have to implement standardised guidelines to ensure that the reporting of <b>treasury</b> <b>shares</b> is simplified to ensure that market users’ understanding of treasury activities and market capitalisation valuation can be improved...|$|R
