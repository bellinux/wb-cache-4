When she heard the gunfire, she grabbed the children and pushed them to the floor beneath the bench, where she shielded them with her body. When the shooting stopped, Shabazz ran toward her husband and tried to perform CPR.

5|$|To {{the south}} of the tower is a range of {{buildings}} built against the thick, buttressed, 14th-century curtain wall. The great hall occupied the central part of this range, with the lord's private apartments of great chamber and solar in <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>to</b> the north, and kitchens to the south. The foundations of a rectangular building stand on a rocky mound within the Nether Bailey, tentatively identified as a chapel.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>to</b> the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> <b>to</b> {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} consternation {{when it was}} {{demolished}} in 1989, after Mayor Richard M. Daley approved its demolition to erect a multi-use skyscraper with retail, hotel, office, and residential spaces. The McCarthy Building, a Chicago Landmark, was even stripped of landmark status over the objection of preservationists and public interest groups in order for <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>to</b> be cleared. Due to Block 37's central location in the Loop, between the State Street retail district, the city/county government complex, and the Randolph Street theater district, its history {{is a microcosm of}} the city's history. Block 37 was a nearly vacant city block from 1989 until 2005 after several attempts at redevelopment failed due to Chicago politics and insufficient funding of several past developers. The single remaining building from the pre-1989 Block 37 architecture is an active Commonwealth Edison transformer building that distributes power to a great portion of the Loop.|$|E

25|$|Monmouth House was {{originally}} planned by the rebellious Duke of Monmouth in 1681–2, but lengthy delays {{meant that it}} wasn't completely finished (to designs by Robert Archer) until March 1719. The original grounds occupied the block between Soho Square and Queen Street (now Bateman Street), and the final plans for finishing Monmouth House allocated space for five new houses {{on the east side}} of Frith Street starting in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> <b>to</b> replace the old stables. These new properties (the current Nos. 6–10) were numbered 1–5. The first two of these, Nos. 1 & 2, (currently 6 & 7) were completed in 1718 and the numbering continued on the south side of Queen Street (now Bateman Street) with 6 (presently No. 11).|$|E
25|$|Observers {{watching}} {{the progress of}} plots, tried to determine which of these represented one group of aircraft. When they were confident {{that a group of}} markers was a formation, a wooden block was placed on the map {{in the middle of the}} plots and numbers and letters placed on <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> <b>to</b> indicate the aircraft type, number and altitude and each block was given a track number. The block would be periodically moved or revised as further plot markers were placed on the board and as it moved, plotters left small arrow-shaped pointers to illustrate where it had been. Once created, the entire network used the same track numbers, from the radar operators who could be asked to revise information for a given track, to the pilots intercepting them.|$|E
25|$|The {{script is}} an {{integrated}} series of evolutions and formations. The band first forms a triple Block O formation, then slowly unwinds {{to form the}} letters while playing Robert Planquette's Le Régiment de Sambre et Meuse. The drum major leads the outside O into a peel-off movement around the curves of the script, every musician in continual motion. Slowly the three blocks unfold into a long singular line which loops around, creating the OSUMB's trademark. Unlike a typical follow-the-leader drill, the Script Ohio is a very specifically measured and charted maneuver. Each band member is required to memorize the counts for each portion of the formation. Squad Leaders, {{as part of their}} tryout drills, are required to march a Script Ohio, individually, from their spot in <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>to</b> their final charted position to ensure they are counting and not just following the person in front of them. This is also required in the event that the drum major is incapacitated for some reason (injury, sudden illness).|$|E

25|$|Thomas Nevins, Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Fire Department, {{arrived at}} the theatre around 11:26pm; he decided {{immediately}} that the building was lost and his job was one of confinement. Dieter Hotel, {{on the corner of}} Washington and Johnson streets, was lower than the theatre, its broad flat roof was an inviting target for flaming debris. The First Police Precinct station house, south of the theatre, was an old brick building with dry wooden support beams. Ramshackle wooden frame buildings stretched down the block on Flood's Alley opposite the burning theatre. At that point, the prevailing wind was from the west, carrying smoke and cinders east, dropping firebrands onto these old structures. The Post Office, south of the police station house, was filled with paper mail. Nevins had called {{in the second and third}} alarms while on the way to the fire; when the additional equipment arrived, he deployed the engines around <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>to</b> keep adjoining buildings free of sparks and burning debris.|$|E
25|$|One {{limitation}} of flash memory is that, {{although it can}} be read or programmed a byte or a word {{at a time in}} a random access fashion, it can be erased only a block at a time. This generally sets all bits in <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>to</b> 1. Starting with a freshly erased block, any location within that block can be programmed. However, once a bit has been set to 0, only by erasing the entire block can it be changed back to 1. In other words, flash memory (specifically NORflash) offers random-access read and programming operations, but does not offer arbitrary random-access rewrite or erase operations. A location can, however, be rewritten as long as the new value's 0 bits are a superset of the over-written values. For example, a nibble value may be erased to 1111, then written as 1110. Successive writes to that nibble can change it to 1010, then 0010, and finally 0000. Essentially, erasure sets all bits to 1, and programming can only clear bits to 0. File systems designed for flash devices can make use of this capability, for example, to represent sector metadata.|$|E

5000|$|When {{properly}} aligned, {{the disks}} allow <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> fit into <b>the</b> hole. When the meteor pile is heavy enough, it descends {{to the lower}} disks. When a stack hits the wrong shaped slot, the player loses meteor blocks until all of <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> are gone or the player manages to save some of them by properly aligning them before they are all gone. The object is {{to get as many}} meteors into the bottom rung as possible. Obstacles include [...] "Meemoos", enemies who impede the blocks' movement. To get rid of the enemies, the player must quick drop a la Tetris <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>to</b> knock them out of the way; doing so causes <b>the</b> meteor <b>block</b> <b>to</b> bounce in <b>the</b> air, so it is possible to eliminate Meemoos on other slots, so long as the final location for the stack is the current slot. Butterflies will sometimes grab a falling stack and lift it to an upper rung, and the player must rotate the disc so that it goes through the proper slot.|$|R
