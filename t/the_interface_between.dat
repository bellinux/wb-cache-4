5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. <b>The</b> <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> {{wheel and axle}} (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|M64 (NGC 4826) {{is known}} as the Black Eye Galaxy because of the {{prominent}} dark dust lane in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus. Also known as the Sleeping Beauty and Evil Eye galaxy, it is about 24 million light-years away. Recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated. At <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and young stars.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E

5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the change in regional stress from the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on <b>the</b> <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E

In the case of the CrAl terminated Co 2 CrAl(001) surfaces the large enhancement of the Cr spin moment at the surface was responsible for a very high degree of spin polarization.
