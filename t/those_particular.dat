25|$|Incompatibilism {{requires}} {{a distinction between}} the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, metaphysical libertarian free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).|$|E

25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, KKR {{opted to}} put WTVJ and the Storer {{stations}} on the market. The firm {{had plans to}} sell channel 4 for a record price of close to $500 million (as part of a $1.85 billion group deal with six of the Storer stations), although the station was actually worth far less. CBS saw a chance to acquire an owned-and-operated station in the fast-growing Miami market. However, it lost a bidding war to television syndication company Lorimar-Telepictures. CBS, however, tried to block the deal; Lorimar produced Dallas, Knots Landing, Falcon Crest, and other shows for the network {{and did not want}} them controlling the clearance rights of <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> programs. Thus, CBS threatened to yank its affiliation with WTVJ if the Lorimar deal went through, which would force the station to become an independent. Lorimar then walked away from the group deal in May 1986, CBS then made an offer to buy WTVJ for $170 million, which was far below KKR's asking price of at least $270 million.|$|E

Harry Jannerone (Chris Bauer), an angry employee from the Syracuse branch of Dunder Mifflin arrives in Scranton to berate Jim and Dwight for taking New York clients even though <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> clients {{are closer to}} Scranton than Syracuse.

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kier McFarlane, and its plot was inspired by 1968 film Barbarella. According to Minogue, {{she had been a}} [...] "massive" [...] fan of the film, and wanted to pay tribute to the film's lead actress Jane Fonda, who played the titular character. The video was shot in two days, where Minogue had been strapped with harnesses and wires; the majority of the shooting included wires pulling off her clothes during <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> sequences. The singer commented in her 2002 book [...] {{that it was one of}} her [...] "most painful shoots", and complained that she felt [...] "rigged" [...] into all sorts of [...] "contraptions". Minogue further complained about the 19 hours spent on both filming days, and revealed she cried during some of the shooting; she jokingly concluded in the book that she would never do another visual that required harnesses and water. Minogue's characteristics in the video were loosely inspired by the titular character of Barbarella, for which a large staff that helped with styling, hair styling and make-up was required.|$|E
500|$|Hart {{and nine}} others were {{teachers}} at Malvern College, where from 1983 to 1986 they {{took advantage of}} a [...] "concessionary fee" [...] scheme, which allowed their children to be educated at rates one fifth of those paid by other pupils. They disputed the amount of tax they had to pay under the 1976 Finance Act, Section 63 of which said that: [...] The Inland Revenue, attempting to tax this benefit, argued that the [...] "cost" [...] of the benefit meant an average {{of the cost of}} providing it; if there were 100 pupils at a school that cost £1,000,000 a year to run, the [...] "cost" [...] per pupil was £10,000. Hart and his fellow teachers disputed this and argued that it was instead marginal cost, saying that other than food, stationery, laundry and similar there was no cost to the school due to the children's presence that would not be there already. The Special Commissioners (an appellate body for income tax claims), ruling in favour of Hart, noted that not only was the school not full to capacity, with the teachers' children having no impact on waiting lists, but that the [...] "concessionary fee" [...] covered all costs incurred by the school in the course of educating <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> pupils. It was found, however, that during debate on the Finance Act, ministers had made statements in the House of Commons which supported the idea that such [...] "benefits" [...] should be excluded from tax.|$|E

500|$|In November 1988, Guns N' Roses {{released}} the stopgap album G N' R Lies, which {{sold more than}} five million copies in the U.S. alone.

During the controversy, Rose defended {{his use of the}} racial slur by claiming that [...] "it's a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn't necessarily mean black." [...] In 1992, however, he conceded that he had used the word as an insult towards black people, stating, [...] "I was pissed off about some black people that were trying to rob me. I wanted to insult <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> black people. I didn't want to support racism." [...] In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself [...] "pro-heterosexual" [...] and blamed this attitude on [...] "bad experiences" [...] with gay men, citing an attempted rape in his late teens and the alleged molestation by his biological father. The controversy led to Guns N' Roses being dropped from the roster of an AIDS benefit show in New York organized by the Gay Men's Health Crisis.|$|E
500|$|Before {{construction}} of the new tower began, Silverstein was involved in an insurance dispute regarding the tower. The terms of the lease agreement signed in 2001, for which Silverstein paid $14 million, gave Silverstein, as leaseholder, the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed. After the September 11 attacks, there were a series of disputes between Silverstein and insurance companies concerning the insurance policies that covered the original towers; this resulted in the {{construction of}} One World Trade Center being delayed. After a trial resulted, a verdict was given on April 29, 2004. The verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the [...] "one occurrence" [...] interpretation, so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies. Three insurers were added to the second trial group. At that time, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer, Swiss Reinsurance, but it did so several days later on May 3, 2004, finding that this company was also subject to the [...] "one occurrence" [...] interpretation. Silverstein appealed the Swiss Reinsurance decision, but the appeal failed on October 19, 2006. The second trial resulted in a verdict on December 6, 2004. The jury determined that nine insurers were subject to the [...] "two occurrences" [...] interpretation, referring to the fact that two different planes had destroyed the towers during the September 11 attacks. They were therefore liable for a maximum of double the face value of <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> policies ($2.2 billion). The highest potential payout was $4.577 billion, for buildings 1, 2, 4, and 5.|$|E

[...] He also attempted to improve camp conditions for the workers by banning card games and requiring the loggers to take showers, but <b>those</b> <b>particular</b> reform efforts [...] "were not well received." [...] The Brown family took considerable interest in the city of Berlin. Various family members started a public kindergarten, built a community club with a gym, swimming pool, and bowling alley, provided soup to the sick, and gave Christmas presents to local children. [...] Brown himself helped found a number of civic and business self-help organizations including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, established in 1901; the New Hampshire Timberlands Owners Association, a fire-protection group established in 1910; and similar fire-protection groups in Maine and Vermont. He set up a series of effective forest-fire lookout towers, possibly the first in the nation, and by 1917 had helped establish a forest-fire insurance company. [...] In 1909, after helping draft the legislation creating New Hampshire's State Forestry Department, [...] he {{became a member of the}} New Hampshire Forestry Commission; and its chair from 1910 until 1952, playing a significant role in shaping the forestry practices and laws of the state.
