5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that {{the facts of the case}} did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the old Conservative {{government}} Cave left office on 23 January 1924. He was replaced by Lord Haldane, who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January. Haldane was in favour of <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Ministry of Justice, and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would have accepted the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under his control as the Lord Chancellor's Office was. Haldane was ill, however, and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter, and no large-scale reforms such as <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through.|$|E

5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance {{of war and the}} pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
