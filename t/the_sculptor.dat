5|$|The {{mathematics}} of topology {{has inspired}} several artists in modern times. <b>The</b> <b>sculptor</b> John Robinson (1935–2007) created {{works such as}} Gordian Knot and Bands of Friendship, displaying knot theory in polished bronze. Other works by Robinson explore the topology of toruses. Genesis is based on Borromean rings – a set of three circles, no two of which link but in which the whole structure cannot be taken apart without breaking. <b>The</b> <b>sculptor</b> Helaman Ferguson creates complex surfaces and other topological objects. His works are visual representations of mathematical objects; The Eightfold Way {{is based on the}} projective special linear group PSL(2,7), a finite group of 168 elements. <b>The</b> <b>sculptor</b> Bathsheba Grossman similarly bases her work on mathematical structures.|$|E

5|$|Instead of copying {{traditional}} academic postures, Rodin preferred his {{models to}} move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). <b>The</b> <b>sculptor</b> often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin's {{focus was on}} the handling of clay.|$|E
5|$|On Mother's Day of 1992, a Mother’s Altar {{to commemorate}} Estonian mothers {{killed during the}} Soviet {{occupation}} was consecrated. The statue of the Virgin and the Child was made by <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Hille Palm.|$|E
5|$|The Saint-Gaudens {{double eagle}} is a twenty-dollar gold coin, or double eagle, {{produced}} by the United States Mint from 1907 to 1933. The coin is named after its designer, <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who designed the obverse and reverse. It {{is considered by many}} to be the most beautiful of U.S. coins.|$|E

5|$|The bust of Nefertiti is {{believed}} to have been crafted about 1345BC by <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Thutmose. The bust does not have any inscriptions, but can be certainly identified as Nefertiti by the characteristic crown, which she wears in other surviving (and clearly labelled) depictions, for example the 'house altar'.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from {{the fact that he was}} a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.|$|E
5|$|An {{assortment}} of unusual sculptures are {{scattered around the}} park, including: Still Water, a massive horse head lapping up water; Jelly Baby Family, a family of giant Jelly Babies standing {{on top of a}} large black cube; and Vroom Vroom, which resembles a giant human hand pushing a toy car along the ground. <b>The</b> <b>sculptor</b> Jacob Epstein constructed several works in Hyde Park. His memorial to the author William Henry Hudson, featuring his character Rima caused public outrage when it was unveiled in 1925.|$|E

5|$|An ossuary and a {{mausoleum}} were erected on {{the site}} of the massacre in 1955, as was a monument by <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Vojin Bakić. In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence during the Croatian War of Independence, the monument and the mausoleum were destroyed by Croatian nationalists, as was another one of Bakić's works, Bjelovarac (The Man From Bjelovar). The ruins of the ossuary were removed by the local authorities in 2002. That same year, residents signed a petition to have the Bjelovarac monument erected once again. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|As an {{introductory}} {{part of the}} collection, a nearly 3meter high statue of Baden-Powell has been erected in front of Baden-Powell House, the only granite statue in London. <b>The</b> <b>sculptor</b> was Baden-Powell's personal friend Don Potter. It was unveiled on 12 July 1961 by the Duke of Gloucester, {{as part of the}} official opening of the house.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{there was}} a burst in {{overlapping}} commitments and commission, both public and ecclesiastical, {{many of which were}} more important than his debut work at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Indeed, work in that church stopped around the same time. <b>The</b> <b>sculptor</b> returned to it only for occasional work over the following years {{to the end of the}} century; overall, however, work ceased until the mid-sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal frames often {{featured}} in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings. The motif {{may have been}} borrowed from <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Alberto Giacometti, who Bacon greatly admired and often corresponded with. Giacometti had employed the device in The Nose (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in Fragment, Zweite mentions that the diagonal lines transform the cross into a guillotine.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995 Hordern {{was invited}} {{back to his}} old college in Brighton, where a room was named in his honour. Inside, the college had {{commissioned}} <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Peter Webster to create a bronze bust of the actor which is displayed with a plaque. Hordern's last physical acting role came shortly afterwards as Lord Langland in the comedy film A Very Open Prison. This was followed by two narration performances, firstly in Spode A History of Excellence, {{and then in the}} five-part film Dinosaurs and Their Living Relatives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1960s, Cameron and her {{daughter}} moved to the pueblos of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she developed a friendship with <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> John Chamberlain and appeared in his art movie, Thumb Suck, which was never released. It was also while in New Mexico that she suffered a collapsed lung and required hospitalization. Her wider health was poor, as she suffered from chronic bronchitis and emphysema—which were both exacerbated by her chain smoking—while hand tremors prevented her from being able to paint for four years.|$|E

5|$|Israel granted Wallenberg honorary {{citizenship}} in 1986 and honored {{him at the}} Yad Vashem memorial {{as one of the}} Righteous Among the Nations. Other tributes to Wallenberg in Israel include at least five streets named after him.

5|$|Matthias {{commissioned}} the leading Italian artists {{of his age}} to embellish his palaces: for instance, <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Benedetto da Majano and the painters Filippino Lippi and Andrea Mantegna worked for him. A copy of Mantegna's portrait of Matthias survived. Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer Aristotele Fioravanti to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier. He had new monasteries built in Late Gothic style for the Franciscans in Kolozsvár, Szeged and Hunyad, and for the Paulines in Fejéregyháza.|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism which {{relied on}} {{inspiration}} from ancient Greece and Rome, {{was brought to}} Denmark by the French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin. His countryman, <b>the</b> <b>sculptor</b> Jacques Saly, who was already well established in Denmark, persuaded Frederick V that Jardin could complete Frederik's Church after Eigtved's death. Although Jardin {{did not succeed in}} this, he was successful in designing several prestige Neoclassical buildings such as Bernstorff Palace (1759–65) in Gentofte and Marienlyst Palace near Helsingør.|$|E
