When {{he found the}} wigs <b>too</b> <b>full</b> he untied one hair {{at a time to}} alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{and mixing}} {{took place at}} Tico-Tico Studios in Kemi, Finland. The studio's {{schedule}} was <b>too</b> <b>full</b> for a single recording session, so Kalmah had to book time to record the album in three separate sessions, between the months of May and August, 2009. The majority of tracks were recorded in May, beginning with Janne Kusmin's drums, which were completed by May 12. Kusmin {{was not able to}} play as well as he had hoped because he had not been practicing. As a result, several of his drum parts were changed.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp was {{the last}} {{surviving}} Earp brother and the last surviving participant of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral when he died {{at home in the}} Earps' small rented bungalow at 4004 W 17th Street, in Los Angeles, of chronic cystitis on January 13, 1929, at the age of 80. His brother Newton died almost a month prior on December 18, 1928. Charlie Welsh's daughter Grace Spolidora and his daughter-in-law, Alma, were the only witnesses to Wyatt's cremation. Josephine was apparently <b>too</b> <b>full</b> of grief to assist. Wyatt was survived by Josephine and sister Adelia. He had no children.|$|E

25|$|The first graves {{were some}} of the city's early settlers, moved from another {{graveyard}} that had become <b>too</b> <b>full.</b> Originally it was run by nearby St. James' Episcopal Church, but when the cemetery became too big an independent Batavia Cemetery Association was formed. It has operated the cemetery ever since.|$|E
25|$|Anal gland {{problems}} {{are a very}} common issue with dogs. Disease of the anal glands or anal sacs may include impaction, infection, or abscessation. The dog will periodically discharge a fishy-smelling substance from its anus when they get <b>too</b> <b>full.</b> These glands are normally expressed when the dog defecates.|$|E
25|$|England had to {{negotiate}} the seventeen overs remaining in the evening. After a reasonably solid start, England lost Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook in consecutive balls to Glenn McGrath. Strauss was lambasted for his dismissal, top-edging a pull on a ball <b>too</b> <b>full</b> to be suitable for the shot. Stuart Clark removed Paul Collingwood, edging an off-cutter to Adam Gilchrist. This dismissal left England on 3/53 at the close, leaving England in a perilous position, Australia having reached a total more than 200 runs higher in any Test of the 2005 Ashes series before taking three cheap wickets before the close. Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen were the not out batsmen, with scores of 13 and 6 respectively.|$|E

25|$|Water: The water {{signs are}} Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. A native with mainly water signs {{will be very}} {{emotional}} and {{find it hard to}} look at anything dispassionately. They tend to respond slowly to questions and need time to grasp a new concept. Water subjects can find it difficult to explain their feelings, and so can be difficult to live with, but they are also kind and sympathetic to those they love. They need to give and receive a lot of affection and will direct it towards family, close friends and animals. A subject lacking water may lack intuition and be unable to see the needs of others. They may be <b>too</b> <b>full</b> of ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of other people. Planets in the 4th, 8th and 12th houses in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Cooper felt Creelman's {{final draft}} was slow-paced, <b>too</b> <b>full</b> of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition, and {{written on a}} scale that would have been prohibitively {{expensive}} to film. Writer Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled Kong for production. Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.|$|E
500|$|While King's Day {{celebrations}} {{take place}} throughout the Netherlands, Amsterdam {{is a popular}} destination for many revelers. [...] Often the city's 750.000 residents are joined by up to 1 million visitors.

500|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) {{is another}} risk {{that may not}} display the usual symptoms (pain, urgency and frequency); it may instead be associated with worsened spasticity. The risk of UTI, likely the most common complication in the long term, is heightened by use of indwelling urinary catheters. Catheterization may be necessary because SCI interferes with the bladder's ability to empty when it gets <b>too</b> <b>full,</b> which could trigger autonomic dysreflexia or damage the bladder permanently. [...] The use of intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder at regular intervals throughout the day has decreased the mortality due to kidney failure from UTI in the first world, {{but it is still}} a serious problem in developing countries.|$|E
500|$|One concern {{addressed}} by Hazlitt is the assertion by previous critics that Macbeth {{is little more}} than a crude and violent amalgam of extremes filled with [...] "Gothic" [...] barbarisms. Hazlitt notes, however, that should anyone think Macbeth's character is so composed of contradictory extremes as to be implausible, it is, rather, the circumstances and the passions in conflict that provide the extremes, while Macbeth's character retains a strong underlying unity throughout. [...] "Macbeth in Shakespear no more loses his identity of character in the fluctuations of fortune or the storm of passions than Macbeth in himself would have lost the identity of his person." [...] Kinnaird notes that here, as if anticipating it by a century, Hazlitt argues against the view advanced by Elmer Edgar Stoll in 1933, that Macbeth's character is <b>too</b> <b>full</b> of contradictions to be plausible.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{grandeur}} of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5October that [...] "I feel so lonely, {{it is impossible for}} me to be happy" [...] and complaining of [...] "the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth" [...] which he considered [...] "such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26October 1816. In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio <b>too</b> <b>full</b> of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.|$|E

500|$|During {{the final}} years of the Clinton administration, Moran was {{critical}} of the President: In 1998, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. He told Time magazine that [...] "This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It's like a novel that just became <b>too</b> <b>full</b> of juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters." [...] Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment, explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country's security, and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of [...] "dishonest and illegal conduct" [...] surrounding his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.|$|E
500|$|Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} C+, {{describing}} the film as a long cutscene for fans of the game rather than something equivalent to the recent Warcraft movie adaptation: {{he said that the}} visuals [...] "offer a deep dive into the Uncanny Valley", and praised the lead actors' efforts with a script he found weak. Meghan Sullivan, writing for IGN, gave the movie a score of 6/10: she called the movie [...] "gorgeous", and praised the character design despite some issues with realistic facial expressions, and found the story was bogged down by the political elements when the action side and the plot focusing on the Kingsglaive worked. In contrast, she called the voicework [...] "solid", saying that the leads brought their characters to life and prevented the script from sounding too ridiculous while the supporting cast was weaker overall. She summed up Kingsglaive as [...] "a very beautiful and very confusing movie". Andrew Barker for Variety frequently questioned whether Kingsglaive could count as a movie, as he often felt like he was watching a recorded gameplay video, praising the visuals while generally faulting the plot as rushed and <b>too</b> <b>full</b> of throwaway characters. Wired's Matt Kamen gave the film a score of 5/10. He greatly praised the movie's visuals, and was positive about the lead actors' performances and the action scenes. His criticism was leveled at its poor portrayal of the female characters, called the narrative confusing, and felt that it focused too much on setting up the events of Final Fantasy XV. His main feeling was that, while it held promise, it relied too much on character stereotypes and world building, calling it [...] "a gorgeous but over-stuffed slice of fanservice".|$|E
2500|$|The {{thesis of}} The Journalist and the Murderer is {{contained}} in its first sentence: [...] "Every journalist who is not too stupid or <b>too</b> <b>full</b> of himself to notice {{what is going on}} knows that what he does is morally indefensible." ...|$|E
50|$|After the Doubters Club dissolved, Heiskell seriously {{considered}} quitting the music industry. Reed Pendleton (Doubters Club, Immortal Chorus) encouraged Jeff {{to stay the}} course. Reed's effect layered guitar riffs lent well to Heiskell's lyrics.
