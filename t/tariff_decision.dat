Consequently, if the value of tariff is positive, it works as a profit element for government and a cost element for GSC members; on the other hand, if the value of tariff is negative, {{it would be a}} cost element for government and a profit element for GSC members.|$|E

40|$|While {{a number}} of studies have {{examined}} the politics of <b>tariff</b> <b>decision</b> making in the United States, little work has examined the subsequent political effects of tariff policy. We help to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing—both theoretically and empirically—the electoral implications of tariff revision. Specifically, we investigate the veracity of the Cannon Thesis – the proposition advanced by Speaker Joe Cannon in 1910 that the majority party in the U. S. House was punished when it made major revisions to the tariff. We find that from 1877 to 1934, major tariff revisions enacted in non-lame-duck-sessions were, on average, associated with a significant loss of votes for majority-party members – both regionally and nationally – that translated into a loss of House seats. We find support for the notion that major tariff revisions generated inordinate uncertainty among various business interests, which the opposition party could then use (by leveraging fear and market instability) to mobilize its base and gain ground in the following election. A detailed analysis of the Wilson-Gorman Tariff of 1894 supports the broader findings...|$|E

30|$|The {{modeling}} in {{this study}} focused on Stackelberg game between the government as a leader and the GSC members (supplier and manufacturer) as followers. To solve the bi-level game-theoretic model, a GA was designed to resolve the single-level model obtained from KKT conditions for the lower level. Feasibility {{and validity of the}} proposed method were evaluated by solving several test problems using enumerative method and comparing them with results of the proposed GA. In addition, the results indicated that the computational time in the proposed GA is considerably lesser than that in enumerative method. The proposed method for bi-level GSC has attained its objectives including the maximization of government net income considering the environmental pollution cost, as well as the maximization of supplier and manufacturer income in the second level of the bi-level plan. Implementing the proposed GA approach for bi-level Stackelberg game-based GSC model, we determined the values of green taxes and subsides (using <b>tariff</b> <b>decision</b> variable) by which government financial and environmental intervention could be planned and also GSC members could decide about procurement and production values for green and non-green products.|$|E

In comparison to a protocol based on the additive homomorphic Paillier cryptosystem, the proposed protocol reduces the communication need for smart meters by several orders of magnitude, albeit at the cost of non-perfect matching. We achieve a matching accuracy of 93.5 % with negligible outliers, which may be enough to make it a viable, more lightweight alternative to homomorphic encryption for load profile matching in smart grids.|$|R
30|$|The {{papers that}} are most related to ours, but do not address the cost cap tariff, are Lambrecht et al. (2007) and Iyengar et al. (2008). More specifically, Lambrecht et al. (2007) develop an {{empirical}} model for uncertainty under three-part tariffs (consisting of a fixed fee, a usage allowance, and pay-per-use price for the usage that exceeds the allowance) by incorporating future usage shocks occurring prior to the consumption <b>decision</b> in the <b>tariff</b> choice stage. Within their model, uncertainty is a key driver for three-part tariff choice. Iyengar et al. (2008) derive the optimal consumption level for three-part tariffs under certainty first, and then allow for small variations of this level ex post. Thereby, both papers propose a similar consumer surplus model with the intention in mind to explain observed tariff choice by estimating the models’ underlying parameters. Schlereth and Skiera (2012) demonstrated that such models can be also used to predict tariff choice of innovative tariffs. The predictions of these models are, therefore, {{the result of a}} choice model that has been calibrated by actual <b>tariff</b> <b>decisions,</b> including consumers’ biases and irrationalities.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine how}} British American Tobacco (BAT) used sports {{sponsorship}} to circumvent restrictions on tobacco promotion in Thailand, both a key emerging market {{and a world}} leader in tobacco control. Method: Analysis of previously confidential BAT company documents. Results: Since its inception in 1987, BAT's sports sponsorship programme in Thailand has been politically sensitive and legally ambiguous. Given Thailand's ban on imported cigarettes, early events provided promotional support to smuggled brands. BAT's funding of local badminton, snooker, football and cricket tournaments generated substantial media coverage for its brands. After the General Agreement on Trade and <b>Tariffs</b> <b>decision</b> that obliged Thailand to open its cigarette market to imports, Thailand's 1992 tobacco control legislation established one of the world's most restrictive marketing environments. BAT's sponsorship strategy shifted to rallying and motorbike racing, using broadcasts of regional competitions to undermine national regulations. BAT sought to dominate individual sports and to shape media coverage to maximise brand awareness. An adversarial approach was adopted, testing the limits of legality and requiring active enforcement to secure compliance with legislation. Conclusions: The documents show the opportunities offered by sports sponsorship to tobacco companies amid increasi ng advertising restrictions. Before the 1992 tobacco control legislation, sponsored events in Thailand promoted international brands by combining global and local imagery. The subsequent strategy of "regionalisation as defensibility" reflected the capacity of international sport to transcend domestic restrictions. These transnational effects may be effectively dealt with via the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, but will require the negotiation of a specific protocol. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s, Chile planned to privatize Santiago's {{sanitary}} works enterprise (EMOS) but instead reformed it under public ownership. It did so through a regulatory framework that mimicked {{the design of}} a concession with a private utility, setting tariffs that ensured at least a seven percent return on assets, creating a neutral regulator independent of ministry intervention, and giving EMOS the right to appeal the regulator's <b>tariff</b> <b>decisions.</b> This reform of Santiago's water system is often cited as a case of successful reform under public management. Comparing a comprehensive measure of welfare with a counterfactual example, the authors show surprisingly large gains from Santiago's reform, given the relatively good initial conditions. (The gains accrued largely to government and employees, but consumers benefited from improved service and coverage). Why did reform in Santiago improve water system performance, when similar reform attempts under public management in other countries failed? 1) Chile has a long tradition of private water rights, shaped by early recognition that water is a scarce and tradable private good. 2) The reformed regulatory framework was designed to attract private investors to the water system and to motivate them to operate efficiently and expand the system. 3) Chile's unique electoral institutions sustained this framework under state operation after democracy was restored. 4) Chile's strong bureaucratic norms and institutions (permitting little corruption), combined with Santiago's relatively low-cost water system, permitted prices that effectively increased quasi-rents for investing in the system while minimizing the risk of inefficiency or monopoly rents. The authors also address the question of why EMOS was reformed but not privatized, and what the costs of not privatizing were. The system was privatized in 1999, but the changes from privatization are likely to be less significant than those introduced in 1989 - 90.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} analyses {{the use of}} anti-dumping {{regulation in}} the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) with specific reference to Botswana. Dumping takes place where products are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value, if the export price of the product exported {{from one country to}} another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country. Anti-dumping duties are an internationally-recognised exception to three core WTO principles namely, bound tariff commitments, most-favoured-nation MFN) and national treatment. The use of anti-dumping in SACU has always been in accordance with existing WTO rules. The new SACU Agreement has important implications for the anti-dumping regime within the customs union. It changed the way in which <b>tariff</b> <b>decisions,</b> including anti-dumping <b>tariffs,</b> are made and it also requires member states to develop legislation on contingency trade remedies such as anti-dumping for the region and to establish national bodies to administer these remedies within different countries. The SACU council has given mandate to the International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa (ITAC) to undertake all trade remedies investigations and imposition of the necessary duties. From the inception of ITAC till now ninety-five percent (95 %) of all anti-dumping applications filed at ITAC alleging dumping are instituted by South Africa industries. Thus, only five percent (5 %) of all anti-dumping applications are from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS countries). The findings in this paper reveal that Botswana has never filed an application seeking protection of any of its industries. In terms of Article 14 of the SACU Agreement Botswana {{is in the process of}} establishing its national body like ITAC. The argument is that, since Botswana has never filed for any trade remedy how effective will this national body going to be? Therefore, critically analyzing the use of anti-dumping regulation is very crucial for Botswana as a SACU member. Such analysis will help assess the effectiveness of SACU institutions such as the tariff board and the Botswana national body to be established. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

We identify and evaluate three sets of reasons as to why governments may prefer tariff uniformity {{as a means of}} alleviating political motives for excessive protection. First, a free-rider effect may be conducive to less lobbying under a uniform tariff regime than under a regime in which tariffs are allowed to differ. Second, an input-price effect may dampen the enthusiasm of final-goods producers for import protection. Third, a precommitment effect may increase the cost to a future government of protecting favored sectors. None of these arguments provides an unambiguous, airtight case for <b>tariff</b> uniformity.

40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on the pricing of seaport infrastructure which includes port charges {{on the use of}} access channels and berth facilities. A closer examination of published port tariffs reveals that the port entry and berth use-related port tariffs, often referred to as channel dues and berth occupancy charges, are differentiated based on vessel volume (Gross Tonnage, Gross Registered Tonnage and Length Over All), ship type (container ship, general cargo ship, tanker) and traffic type (foreign-going vessels and coastal vessels). These two charges are one of the main revenue sources for a port authority; however knowledge of the design and imposition of these charges is currently opaque, but nevertheless very useful to port users. This thesis explores the determinants of port infrastructure charges that underpin port pricing policies in world ports. The main objectives of the study are: (a) Identify and conduct an econometric analysis of the effect of various factors on seaport infrastructure charges. (b) To assess the applicability of competing pricing models (pricing approaches) currently used by seaports in different countries and regions in the world. (c) To assess the determinants of port infrastructure tariff design and practices in world seaports and discuss their implications for port management. This thesis brings to notice that, despite the discussion on port pricing theories such as cost-based, market based and cost-benefit theories, the empirical research on this topic remains very limited. Thus, with identified research gaps such as the determination of the level of knowledge that port authorities have in tariff design and their applicability, the thesis investigates the underlying factors influential to the design and practice of port infrastructure tariffs using both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. First, the determinants of port infrastructure charges are studied empirically using data from 159 ports worldwide by employing the ordinary least square and simultaneous equation system method with channel dues and berth occupancy charges as the dependent variables. The result indicates that the pricing of seaport infrastructure is primarily cost-based but other factors are also relevant to the port pricing models currently used by seaports. Among those factors in particular, demand and the type of port management and governance model have been found to significantly impact the level of port infrastructure charges. Second, to complement and triangulate some of the results found in the quantitative model, this thesis examines the primary data collected through an online survey of 67 international seaports to focus on the practical processes and strategic issues in infrastructure tariff design and practice. The questionnaire was sent to higher level seaport managers working in the areas of port tariffs. The contact details of port managers were obtained from the official port websites of respective port organisations. SPSS and AMOS statistical software were employed to analyse the data. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to identify the factors influential to the selection of infrastructure tariff models, the tariff level and the tariff revision process. The results showed that the influential factors in infrastructure tariff design are: a) demand, b) knowledge of pricing theories, c) pricing objectives, d) port cost considerations, and e) dynamics of port and shipping sectors (competition and ship size). Further, an analysis into the factors influential in infrastructure tariff practices of seaports suggested that tariff policies, transparency in tariff setting, tariff regulation and stakeholder participation in tariff affairs are highly significant. Third, the content analysis of two open-ended questions included in the questionnaire to seaport authorities revealed that tariff revision practices vary substantially across ports and regions in the world. Some ports revise tariffs regularly while others seldom do so. Furthermore tariff revision procedures and the parties involved in the process also vary across ports; some ports have highly bureaucratic procedures for tariff revision and others determine their <b>tariff</b> revision <b>decisions</b> independently. Many seaport authorities are not aware of all the basic pricing approaches and their applications, and expressed a wish to receive training and support in tariff design and revision. Based on the results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the implications for port management and governments are discussed and, given the exploratory nature of the study, the implications for future research and its limitations are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Although various {{pieces of}} European {{secondary}} law law use the terms "mise en concurrence" ("calling for competition" or "competitive tendering procedure") they provide no {{definition of the}} expression "obligation de mise en concurrence" ("obligation to call for competition"). At the very beginning, the author therefore defines what is meant thereby in his thesis, i. e. "a more or less formalized action which a public or a private person has to follow in order to provoke a competition or a contest between potentially interested persons that perform an economic activity, in order to grant an individual advantage to one or several of them". The {{first part of the}} work deals with the regime of competitive tendering of the public procurement directives which the Court of Justice has considered "as a whole" to be the "core" of European law on public contracts. First, this part examins the development of the public procurement directives from 1971 on. The author shows that the puzzling evolution of the personal scope of the public procurement directives is guided by the personal scope of European primary law. While considering the remedies directives, the author examines to what extent they introduce requirements beyond the principle of effective judicial protection. While some of their requirements obviously do so, the remedies directives however remain very far from standardizing the means of redress at national level. Due to the member States' judicial autonomy, the compelling force of EU primary law differs from one member State to another. The same applies within the scope of the remedies directives as they let the member States a large degree of autonomy. The author then turns to examine the contribution of the procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE, 2004 / 18 /CE and 2009 / 81 /CE, their scope of application, as well as the concepts of public works concession and service concession. Various other questions are dealt with in the first part, {{such as the use of}} functional interpretation, the power of the European legislator to adopt regulations on public procurement and the impact of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the Revised GPA and other international agreements. At last the author explores the issue of electronic procurement and the Commission's proposals for replacing the public procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE and 2004 / 18 /CE and its proposal concerning the award of concession contracts. The second part of of the thesis focuses on primary public procurement law. After having described the origin of the obligation to call for competition under EU primary law which the Court of Justice derives from articles 49 and 56 TFEU as well as from the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, the author strives to determine whether this obligation is well-founded. This examination brings to light that the rationale behind the requirement to call for competition under EU primary law is rather fragile. Amongst others, the author comes to the conclusion that the condition of a certain cross-border interest of each public contract individually as a condition for the application of the primary law obligation to call for competition lacks relevance The author then reviews and examines other possible bases for an obligation to call for competition under EU primary law such as the right to good administration, the freedom of enterprise and the right to property, which are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it seems that only article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position) could to a limited extent give rise to an obligation to call for competition. However, once a situation is governed by EU secondary law, it enters the scope of European law. Hence, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality apply even if a situation involves no cross-border interest. If the Court of justice's case law were followed consistently, these principes should lead to require calls for competition in a number of purely internal situations. According to the author, deducing as precise consequences as does the Court of justice from the principal of equal treatment and other fundemental principles can hardly be justified. After that examination, the material rules of public procurement primary law stated by the Court of Justice and the General Court are successively reviewed. The pages that follow are about the exceptions to the obligation to call for competition under the public procurement directives and under primary law, as for instance articles 51 and 52 TFEU, overriding reasons of general interest and article 106, paragraph 2, TFEU. The author thereafter addresses the question whether primary law applies within the scope of secondary law. He comes to the conclusion that it does even when secondary law represents an exhaustive body of rules. Notwithstanding some ambiguous judgements of the Court of justice there is no support for the doctrine of priority of application of secondary law in the Court's case law. In what follows, the author tries to answer the question whether, in order to stay consistent with the case law developed in the wake of Telaustria, the obligation to call for competition which the case law of the Court of Justice requires for public works, service and supply contracts ought to be extended to other operations (sale or lease of real estate, design contests outside the scope of the public procurement directives, employment contracts, subsidised contracts awarded by private entities outside the scope of the public procurement directives, grants, …). The end of the second part deals with the personal scope of the primary law of public procurement which corresponds to that of EU primary law. The rules concerning State aid are addressed in detail in the third part of the thesis. The examination in that part shows that the public procurement directives, the primary law of public procurement and the EU state aid rules apply cumulatively. The EU State aid rules require efficency when awarding public contracts. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the categorization as State aid, a call for competition is never formally required. The Commission however insists on calls for competition in order to declare certain aids compatible with the internal market. Aids include by definition an advantage for their recipients. This remains true even though an aid has been authorised by the Commission pursuant to article 107, paragraphe 3, TFEU. Given the very broad scope the Court of Justice gives to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, aid measures give generally rise to obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. At the risk of rendering article 107, paragraph 3, TFEU unnecessary, the fact that an aid measure impedes the fundamental freedoms of the internal market should therefore not prevent the Commission to declare it compatible with the internal market. This applies in particular to aids consisting in the award of a public contract that is covered only by EU primary law. That solution seems however excluded for public contracts within the scope of the public procurement directives. The Commission has adopted a broad concept of what is an "advantage" in the sense of the State aid rules. This leads the Commission to consider certain grants for environmental protection as State aid measures even though it may be difficult to dectect any kind of advantage. The Commission claims to control these measures in accordance with the rules of State aid control. On that occasion the Commission tends to make its consent subject to a call for competition in order to identify the projects that will be subsidized. A broad approach of the concept of undertaking leads to class as State aid various public infrastructure investments insofar they do not satisfy the private investor test. The Commission tends to make its consent to these investments subject to calls for competition. Such is notably the case regarding public investments in broadband network facilities. In the fourth part, the author examines a variety of secondary legislation imposing calls for competition other than the public procurement directives. These texts cover a wide range of areas and provide for competitive awards of various form and diverse content. Sometimes a requirement for competitive tendering is overtly expressed. At other times, it is implicit, indirect or just inchoate. Some advantages are awarded without a genuine competition or without any competition at all. Directive 2012 / 34 /CE establishing a single European railway area for instance sets principles for the allocation of "infrastructure capacity" (i. e the right to use a railway network). It does not employ such terms as "calling for competition". Where the infrastructure capacity is insufficient it has to be allocated in a fair and non discriminatory manner. The fee for using the railway network cannot be used as an award criterion. In some areas, competition in terms of price is the very basis of the system. This is true for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. It happens that competitive assignment occurs incidentally and in a non compulsory way as in the case of the milk quota regime. In other cases, e. g. certain situations covered by the internal electricity market regime, the system excludes calls for competition whereas they should be required according to primary procurement law principles. Under still other circumstances, i. e. the award of public service contracts for public passenger transport services, competitive tendering only needs to be strictly complied with after a transitional period. This can hardly be reconciled with the principles of primary procurement law. In some cases the rules in place are such, for example when awarding the universal postal service, that it seems doubtful that a competitive bidding following objective and transparent criteria is really possible. The European greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme relies on auctions for the allocation of gaz emission authorisations. At first, it does so to a limited extent. Such authorisations, called "allowances", are freely transferable. Thus a reallocation of allowances according to market mechanismes is made possible. The author sheds light on some major inconsistencies of the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The late deadline for surrendering allowances gives rise for several years to a surplus of allowances over the greenhouse gas emissions considered in the scheme. On the other hand, the costs for same amounts of greenhouse gas emitted at the same time may vary. This gives rise to a problem of equality. The author comes to the conclusion that the scheme has little capacity to reach the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy. The designation of the universal postal service providers implies to lay down rules as to how the net cost of the universal service is to be calculated, as well as to define appropriate award criteria. These steps face considerable difficulties. A similar situation can be found in other areas such as electronic communications and electricity or natural gas transmission or distribution systems. In the latter case, the risk of a change of transmission or distribution <b>tariffs</b> due to <b>decisions</b> of national regulatory authorities leaves the competitors in the dark on a crucial point. The legislation regarding the internal electricity market and the internal gaz market puts the transmission and distribution system operators in a position very similar to that of service or public works concession holders. In some cases the principles which underlie these schemes exclude competitive tendering as required by primary procurement law. The networks being freely transferable, ownership of networks and hence, in principle, their operators are determined by private market mechanismes mainly through the level of the proposed sales price. This is not consistent with the principles of primary procurement law stated by the Court of Justice (advertising requirements, award criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract, [...] .). Neither does it seem compatible with these principles that the development of the networks belongs automatically to the transmission and distribution system operators. The assessment of conformity of secondary legislation with primary law is less strict than the conformity assessment of national law. The Court of Justice has allowed the European legislator a wide margin of discretion when establishing the internal market and seems to have tacitely acknowledged a form of conformity presumption of secondary law. Save in exceptional cases, it seems unlikely that the Court will put into question secondary law regimes differing from primary law procurement rules. Thus, the European legislator may adopt such solutions without incurring major legal risks...|$|R
