Certain lead exposed dogs following chelation therapy were noted to have normal blood lead levels but elevated urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid suggesting that blood lead does not always correlate with metabolic effects of lead in the body.

The evolution of tHcy plasma concentration was also compared in two different populations: healthy individuals (controls) and patients with end-stage renal failure, known to have increased plasma tHcy concentrations. Plasma was separated from erythrocytes at 0, 2, 6 and 24 hours, tHcy was measured with a competitive immunoassay on Immulite 2000 ® (Diagnostic Products Corporation). Plasma tHcy concentration started to rise significantly on EDTA after two hours of storage in patients and controls in comparison to baseline (defined as time: 0 hour). It remained stable on NaF during the first two hours and started to rise significantly after six hours of storage for both populations.

This paper is a report of our investigations into whether similar mechanisms for cell cohesion and desquamation can be found in non-palmoplantar stratum corneum. Biopsies of non-palmo-plantar human skin were incubated at 37 °C, pH 8, in a buffer with and without additions of detergents (a mixture of N,N,-dimethyidodecylamine oxide and sodium dodecyl sulphate), <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> <b>tetraacetate</b> (EDTA), and the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin. Released cells were examined by phase contrast microscopy and counted. The incubated biopsies were examined by light microscopy.

This dissociation was stimulated by EDTA and inhibited by aprotinin. After 36 h of incubation the entire stratum corneum and, on some parts of the biopsies, the stratum granulosum had dissociated. There was no evidence of cell dissociation in the spinous or basal epidermal layers.

The association between hepcidin- 25 concentration and other biological parameters was studied using multivariable analysis and the coefficient of renal excretion of hepcidin- 25 was calculated. Preanalytical variables were also investigated. The LC-MS/MS method was validated using a recent validation strategy based on accuracy profiles. Good results were obtained in terms of trueness, precision, and linearity in the following dosing ranges: from 0. 77 to 200 nmol/L for urine and from 0. 48 to 100 nmol/L for serum. The 95 % reference range of serum hepcidin- 25 concentration established after excluding known conditions that affect hepcidin- 25 expression was 1. 5 to 15. 2 nmol/L.

40|$|During an {{investigation}} of the role of ions in growth regulation, it was found that <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> <b>tetraacetate</b> (EDTA) inhibits DNA synthesis about 10 -fold in cultures of chick embryo cells, while ethylene glycol bis(β-amino ethyl ether) -N,N′-tetraacetate has no effect. RNA synthesis is only slightly inhibited by EDTA, and protein synthesis is unaffected. EDTA is inhibitory to DNA synthesis at a concentration much lower than that of either Ca++ or Mg++ present in the growth medium. The inhibition is prevented by the addition of Zn++ at a much lower concentration than that of the EDTA. Other metal ions are ineffective. The inhibition of DNA synthesis only becomes apparent after more than 6 hr of incubation with EDTA, and descends to its final level by 15 hr. Complete restoration of the original rate of DNA synthesis is achieved within 8 - 10 hr by the addition of Zn++. The low rate of DNA synthesis that occurs in a density-inhibited culture, is refractory to further inhibition by EDTA. Rous sarcoma cells are less sensitive to inhibition by EDTA than normal cells, but the sensitivity of both is increased by reducing the concentration of Ca++ in the medium. DNA synthesis in mouse 3 T 3 cells is also inhibited by EDTA. It is concluded that Zn++ is a continuing requirement for DNA synthesis in cultured vertebrate cells, and it is suggested that the availability of Zn++ within the cell {{may play a role in}} the regulation of cell multiplication...|$|R
40|$|Phytoextraction {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an alternative remediation technology for soils polluted with heavy metals or radionuclides, but is generally conceived as too slow working. Enhancing the accumulation of trace pollutants in harvestable plant tissues {{is a prerequisite for}} the technology to be practically applicable. The chelating aminopolycarboxylic acid, <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> <b>tetraacetate</b> (EDTA), has been found to enhance shoot accumulation of heavy metals. However, the use of EDTA in phytoextraction may not be suitable due to its high environmental persistence, which may lead to groundwater contamination. This paper aims to assess whether <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> disuccinate (EDDS), a biodegradable chelator, can be used for enhanced phytoextraction purposes. A laboratory experiment was conducted to examine mobilisation of Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn into the soil solution upon application of EDTA or EDDS. The longevity of the induced mobilisation was monitored for a period of 40 days after application. Estimated effect half lives ranged between 3. 8 and 7. 5 days for EDDS, depending on the applied dose. The minimum observed effect half life of EDTA was 36 days, while for the highest applied dose no decrease was observed throughout the 40 day period of the mobilisation experiment. Performance of EDTA and EDDS for phytoextraction was evaluated by application to Helianthus annuus. Two other potential chelators, known for their biodegradability in comparison to EDTA, were tested in the plant experiment: nitrilo acetic acid (NTA) and citric acid. Uptake of heavy metals was higher in EDDS-treated pots than in EDTA-treated pots. The effects were still considered insufficiently high to consider efficient remediation. This may be partly due to the choice of timing for application of the soil amendment. Fixing the time of application at an earlier point before harvest may yield better results. NTA and citric acid induced no significant effects on heavy metal uptake. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Solubilisation of heavy metals (Cu and Zn) was observed for both EDTA and HS in the extraction kinetic experiments: 58 % of the total Cu and 50 % of the total Zn in the sediment were mobilised from the solid matrix using EDTA (480 mg/l) and 32 % of the total Cu and 5 % of the total Zn, using HS (1, 000 mg/l). It was observed that solubilized metal levels were positively related to the chelating agent concentration. HS performance in the heavy metals mobilisation and phyto-toxicity tests was considered promising. HS represent an innovation in enhanced phytoextraction techniques: they can be considered an environmentally non-impacting bio-agronomic amendment. CA induced no significant effects on heavy metal mobilisation and it also negatively affects seed germination (Germination Index < 40 %). Laboratory experiments with plants showed that none of the treatments significantly affected the biomass production and a trend could only be detected for the heavy metal uptake into shoots of Paspalum vaginatum sp. Transplantation of seashore paspalum is useful as a pre-treatment of contaminated dredged sediments, since it is a salt-tolerant species and it can be easily adaptable on a nutrient poor and fine textured medium...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Acute {{and chronic}} use of non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs can increase intestinal permeability. Rofecoxib, which selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase 2  (COX- 2), {{is a novel}} anti-inflammatory drug {{with the potential to}} produce minimal gastrointestinal toxic effects while retaining clinical efficacy.  AIMS—To assess the potential for rofecoxib to affect the intestine adversely, in comparison with placebo and indomethacin.  SUBJECTS—Thirty nine healthy subjects (aged 24 - 30 years).  METHOD—We performed a four period crossover trial to assess intestinal permeability before and after seven days of treatment. Permeability was measured by the urinary ratio of chromium- 51 labelled <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> <b>tetraacetate</b> (51 CrEDTA) /L-rhamnose (five hour collection).  RESULTS—Indomethacin 50  mg three times daily produced greater increases in intestinal permeability compared with placebo or rofecoxib (25  or 50  mg) (p⩽ 0. 001); rofecoxib was not significantly different from placebo. Mean day 7  to baseline ratios (95 % confidence intervals) for 51 CrEDTA/L-rhamnose were 0. 97  (0. 82,  1. 16), 0. 80  (0. 68,  0. 95), 0. 98  (0. 82,  1. 17), and 1. 53  (1. 27,  1. 85) for placebo, rofecoxib 25  mg, rofecoxib 50  mg, and indomethacin groups, respectively. Rofecoxib was generally well tolerated.  CONCLUSION—In this study, treatment for one week with indomethacin 50  mg three times daily significantly increased intestinal permeability compared with placebo, while treatment with rofecoxib 25  mg or 50  mg daily did not. The absence of a significant effect of rofecoxib on intestinal permeability at doses at least twice those recommended to treat osteoarthritis was consistent with other studies that have demonstrated little or no injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa associated with rofecoxib therapy.    Keywords: rofecoxib; COX- 2 inhibitor; indomethacin; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; intestinal permeability; osteoarthriti...|$|R

30|$|There {{are some}} {{vascular}} plants which store crystal metal and are called metallophytes, for instance, Brassica juncea, Medicago sativa, etc. They accumulate metal up to 13.6 % weight in 72  h {{when it is}} available for absorption {{in the form of}} salt, like AgNO 3 [72]. It is quite obvious that reduction of AgNO 3 is followed by absorption which means that the plant contains some compounds which reduce Ag+ to Ag nanoparticles of approximately 50  nm size. It has been demonstrated that the metals thus stored in the plants as nanocrystals are analytically pure to the lowest limit of detection by any instrument like AAS. The sequestering of metal by plant from a large heap of sand, sediments and non-essential non-metals is a process that saves time and manpower. If bacteria and small plants are grown in such mining areas where a large heap of nanocrystal of metal ions is available, they can be easily taken up by them and harvested. The extraction of metal by conventional method is a tedious task as it takes a long span of time; even then, it is not as pure as sequestered by plants. It has been reported by Blaylock et al. [73] that the addition of a chelating agent like <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> <b>tetraacetate</b> (EDTA) to the soil increases the bioavailability of the metal. It is true that EDTA forms a soluble complex with metal ions available but not the metal. The EDTA therefore acts as a carrier, not as a reductant. Since EDTA is not a selective chelating agent, it may hook up all metal ions regardless of their useful/harmful effect. If the metal remains bound to a chelating agent, it is not available even to the plants and hence may cause a deficiency of certain essential trace metals in them.|$|R
40|$|Metal ion {{production}} by minerals alone and in pairs was studied by solution analysis, extraction with <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> <b>tetraacetate</b> (EDTA) and laser ion mass spectroscopy (LIMS) for combinations of pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, and sphalerite. The effect of grinding, pH, {{and the presence}} of xanthate was studied. Metal ion transfer between sulphide minerals was determined. Metal ion production with minerals in pairs was different from that for single minerals. The amount of metal ion in solution followed a galvanic interaction model, increasing for the anodic mineral and decreasing for the cathodic mineral. However, from the EDTA extraction technique, the concentration of metal ions on the mineral surface increased for both minerals. The mechanism of additional metal ion production on the cathodic mineral is unclear, but may be related to reaction between the mineral and OH ions formed on the surface as a result of galvanic interaction. Metal ions transferred between two minerals in contact. In the case of pairing with pyrite, the larger proportion of Fe remained on pyrite, while 50 % or more of Zn (from sphalerite) and Pb (from galena) transferred to pyrite. The effect of Pb ions on pyrite in the presence of xanthate, and diethylene triamine (DETA) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, ex situ spectroelectrochemical analysis and zeta potential measurements. Once pyrite was contaminated by Pb ions, uptake of xanthate was promoted at pHs 9. 2 and 10. 5 with lime as pH modifier. The source of Pb [...] from solution or from contact with galena [...] was not a factor, and the effect was evident at Pb concentrations as low as 1 ppm. With soda ash as pH modifier, the effect of Pb was suppressed, perhaps due to formation of lead carbonate. The only xanthate product detected was dixanthogen, unless an initial potential less than $-$ 800 mV/SCE was imposed (when Pb$ sp{ 2 +}$ is reduced to Pb$ sp 0) $ and lead xanthate formed. Xanthate adsorption on Pb-contaminated pyrite was suppressed by DETA, but relatively large concentrations were required. DETA decreased the potential at the mineral/solution interface, which retarded oxidation of xanthate to dixanthogen. A mechanism of Pb "activation" of pyrite was proposed: adsorption of Pb(OH) $ sp+$ on pyrite provided sites for xanthate adsorption forming Pb(OH) X, on which xanthate ions were attached by hydrophobic interaction and oxidised to dixanthogen...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of studies into the effectiveness of biodegradable alkaline organic salts as alternatives to traditional nonbiodegradable inorganic electrolytes and alkalis used in pad-steam dyeing of cotton with reactive dyes. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} develop improved environmentally sustainable dyeing systems. A difluorochloropyrimidine and a bis(sulphatoethylsulphone) dye were used in this study. After early encouraging results using alkaline polycarboxylic sodium salts, it became clear that current literature and dyeing theories on the role of the electrolyte cations and anions needed further explanation for pad dyeing methods. Accordingly, studies were carried out on a range of electrolytes of different cations and anions. These studies have resulted in a new theory for dyeing of cotton with anionic dyes using electrolytes. Traditionally, industry and dye research laboratories have determined the optimum concentration for an electrolyte, in grams per litre, via laboratory tests. This research has shown that for a given cation the required concentration of an alternative electrolyte can be determined by its ionic strength, i. e. µ = ½ ∑ [molar concentration of the salt x (ionic charge) 2]. In other words, having determined the optimum concentration for, say, sodium chloride, the optimum concentration of any other sodium salt is the concentration required to give the same ionic strength. These findings also lead to an improved understanding of the use of electrolytes. The driving force for dye diffusion and also dye exhaustion (exhaust dyeings) is the dyebath ionic strength; i. e. it is independent of the type of electrolyte and alkali. In pad dyeing of cotton, dye fixation and ultimate colour yield significantly depend on the dye diffusion and the subsequent uniformity of distribution of dye molecules throughout the fibre. A hypothesis for a new and simple method of determining the extent of dye diffusion in pad dyeing of cotton with reactive dyes was proven. The new method is based on reflectance measurements for quantifying the dye diffusion. The new theory on the role of electrolyte cations and anions and the new method for determining the extent of dye diffusion were then used in the study on a range of biodegradable alkaline organic salts as alternatives to traditional nonbiodegradable inorganic electrolytes and alkalis for pad-steam of dyeing of cotton with reactive dyes. The research presents results where any of the three biodegradable alkaline polycarboxylic sodium salts, <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> tetra-acetate, trisodium nitrilo triacetate and tetrasodium N,N-bis(carboxylatomethyl) -L-glutamate can be used as alternatives to traditionally used inorganic electrolyte and alkali in the pad liquor. The optimum concentrations of the organic salts were determined for dye diffusion, dye fixation and colour yield. The dye fixation, colour yield and ultimate colourfastness achieved by using alkaline polycarboxylic salts were closely comparable to those obtained by using inorganic electrolyte and alkali. More interestingly, the dyeing effluent showed considerable reductions in total dissolved solids content with the organic salts. In order to examine the applicability of the alkaline polycarboxylic salt, an industrial trial was carried out using sodium edate which gave similar encouraging results...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the use of}} an intact parathyroid hormone two-site immunoradiometric assay compared with a mid region parathyroid hormone radioimmunoassay in <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> tetraacetic acid-infusion test in 15 patients with hyperparathyroidism. During the test, plasma intact parathyroid hormone levels increased by 240 +/- 43 %, whereas the plasma levels of mid molecule parathyroid hormone increased by only 65 +/- 17 %, which is significantly lower (P less than 0. 01). Four patients had no increase in plasma mid molecule parathyroid hormone level but still a large increase in plasma intact parathyroid hormone level (P less than 0. 01). Thus, plasma measurement of intact parathyroid hormone is superior to that of mid molecule parathyroid hormone in the <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> tetraacetic acid-infusion test in patients with hyperparathyroidism...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{in an attempt}} to prepare an explosive with certain satisfactory plastic and adhesive properties. It seemed most likely that these properties would be obtained in a nitrated polymeric compound. The polyamides of succinic, malic, and tartaric acids were prepared, and the products of their nitration were investigated. It was found that a satisfactory succinic acid - <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> polymer could be prepared, and could easily be nitrated. The product, though possessive of detonating qualities, was not adequately stable for use as a military explosive. DiffiCulties were encountered in the preparation of satisfactory polymers from maliC and tartaric acids with <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine,</b> due to the presence of the substituent hydroxy groups. However, an interesting and original study of the relative behaviour of these compounds was made...|$|R

40|$|To {{suppress}} the reactivity of nanoscaled non-oxidic powders such as titanium nitride and silicon carbonitride against hydrolysis and oxidation, chemical surface modification with nitrogen containing surfactants was investigated. Among these surfactants long chain primary amines, <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamines</b> and isocyanates were examined. Thermogravimetry, elemental analysis and the behaviour against water vapour adsorption of the modified particles {{were used as}} methods to estimate the protective capacity of the organic coating material. Best results were obtained by using a long chain <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine,</b> which was indicated by a significant reduction of the powder oxidation {{and an increase in}} particle hydrophobicity. Preparation of a stable aqueous dispersion without significant changes in the elemental composition of the powder was achieved by application of water soluble surfactants to the surface modified particles. Very good results were obtained by application of an emulsion technique...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> diperchlorate (EDDP) {{has been studied}} by differential-thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), isothermal weight-loss measurements and mass-spectrometric analysis of the decomposition products. It has been observed that EDDP decomposes in two temperature regions. The low-temperature decomposition stops at about 35 to 40 percent weight loss below 250 °C. The reason for the low-temperature cessation may be the adsorption of excess <b>ethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> on the crystal surface of EDDP. An overall activation energy of 54 kcal per mole has been calculated for the thermal {{decomposition of}} EDDP. Mass-spectrometric analysis shows that the decomposition products are mainly CO 2, H 2 O, HCl and N 2. The following stoichiometry has been proposed for the thermal decomposition of EDDP: (−CH 2 NH 3 CIO 4) 2 → 2 CO 2 O+ 2 HCl+N 2...|$|R
