5|$|M-17 is an {{original}} state trunkline {{dating back to}} the 1919 signing of the system. On July 1, 1919, the highway started at M-11 in Berrien County in the southwestern Lower Peninsula and ran east <b>to</b> <b>Detroit.</b> The debut of the U.S. Highway System replaced most of M-17 with two different highways. From Watervliet to Ann Arbor, US12 replaced M-17; east of Ypsilanti <b>to</b> <b>Detroit,</b> US112 replaced M-17. The M-17 designation also replaced M-23 on Ecorse Road between Ypsilanti and Lincoln Park and then ran concurrently with US25 into Detroit. The Ann Arbor segment was rerouted along Boulevard Drive (now Stadium Boulevard) between US12 and US23.|$|E

5|$|After the 2009 season, the Tigers began {{shopping}} Granderson {{to other}} franchises {{in an effort}} to reduce their payroll.

5|$|Just {{before the}} 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth {{the manager of}} the Yankees' top minor-league team, the Newark Bears, but he was talked out of it by his wife, Claire, and his {{business}} manager, Christy Walsh. Shortly afterward, Tigers owner Frank Navin made a proposal to Ruppert and Barrow—if the Yankees traded Ruth <b>to</b> <b>Detroit,</b> Navin would name Ruth player-manager. Navin believed Ruth would not only bring a winning attitude to a team that had not finished higher than third since 1923, but would also revive the Tigers' sagging attendance figures. Navin asked Ruth to come <b>to</b> <b>Detroit</b> for an interview. However, Ruth balked, since Walsh had already arranged for him {{to take part in a}} celebrity golf tournament in Hawaii. Ruth and Navin negotiated over the phone while Ruth was in Hawaii, but those talks foundered when Navin refused to give Ruth a portion of the Tigers' box office proceeds.|$|E

López said that his reasons were personal, and he cited his family, the education of his children and the Mexican economy as motivating factors for the decision. He came out of retirement and returned <b>to</b> <b>Detroit</b> {{in time for the}} 1983 season. In February 1983, López became the first player in MLB history to receive a pay cut through salary arbitration. López had earned $285,000 in 1982, asked for $315,000 for 1983 and was awarded $250,000. He finished 1983 with a 98 record, 2.81 ERA and 18 saves.|$|E

5|$|US Highway 16 (US16), {{also called}} Grand River Avenue {{for much of}} its length in the state, {{was one of the}} {{principal}} pre-Interstate roads in the state of Michigan. Before the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926, the highway had been designated M-16. The modern route of Grand River Avenue cuts across the Lower Peninsula in a northwest–southeast fashion from near Grand Rapids <b>to</b> <b>Detroit.</b> Before the late 1950s and early 1960s, US16 followed other roads between Muskegon and Grand Rapids, and then Grand River Avenue through Lansing <b>to</b> <b>Detroit.</b> In the years immediately preceding the creation of the Interstate Highway System, US16 was shifted from older roads to newer freeways. Later, it was co-designated as an Interstate. When the gap in the freeway was filled in around Lansing, the US16 designation was decommissioned in the state. The freeway was then solely designated Interstate 96 (I-96) east of Grand Rapids and I-196 west of that city.|$|E
