40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} trial was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of three commercial repellents in decreasing corn intake by captive wild boar and if {{it should be a}} strategy to reduce wild boar damage to seeded corn. Three adult wild boars were simultaneously offered untreated corn (control) and corn treated with one of the following repellents:- Morkit®, an antraquinone based repellent used to control bird damage on sprouting cereals;- <b>Tree</b> <b>guard</b> ® a denatonim benzoate repellent used to protect trees by deer browsing;- Hot Sauce ® a capsaicine based repellent. Five tests were carried out, each lasting 6 - 7 days and 3 - 7 days apart from each other. Results showed that: Hot sauce failed to reduce corn consumption when added at 10 g/kg of corn, but when added at 25 g/kg reduced daily consumption by 80. 5 %; Morkit (5 g/kg) reduced daily consumption by 86. 5 %. <b>Tree</b> <b>guard</b> (sold ready to use) reduced consumption by 86. 5 %. In the last test, with only treated corn offered to the animals, Morkit and Hot Sauce-treated corn were consumed less then Tree Guard- treated corn (40 % and 41 % respectively).

40|$|Ecological {{restoration}} using seedling tubestock {{is challenging}} under a Mediterranean-type climate of hot, dry summers. We investigated the ecophysiological effects of plastic tree guards and shadecloth tree guards during seedling establishment of four co-occurring tree species that differ in leaf morphology. Average temperature was 6. 7 °C higher in plastic guards than controls over a summer, {{with a maximum}} of 53. 5 °C compared to 47. 9 °C in controls. Light levels were 2 -fold lower in both <b>tree</b> <b>guard</b> treatments relative to control. In spring, photosynthesis and specific leaf area were significantly elevated in shadecloth tree guards relative to other treatments. In summer, photosynthetic rate was significantly lower, and midday photochemical efficiency was significantly higher, in both <b>tree</b> <b>guard</b> treatments relative to controls. The effect of elevated temperature in plastic tree guards may partially explain our results of higher mortality of seedling in plastic tree guards. The relatively elevated spring photosynthesis of seedlings in shadecloth tree guards may partially explain the result of reduced mortality and increased growth in this treatment. We conclude that shadecloth tree guards create a microclimate more favorable for seedling establishment in a Mediterranean-type environment than plastic tree guards and control treatments. Our results may have wide applicability to the range of restoration settings where seedling tubestock is planted, except in environments where low temperature is limiting to plant growth...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{potential}} {{problems that can}} limit the success of revegetation efforts (Close & Davidson 2002; Close et al. 2007), many products available for revegetation, and little independent research on the efficacy of those products. For example tree guards are commonly used to establish native woody plants in ecological restoration projects yet the effectiveness of tree guards in promoting seedling establishment is uncertain (Lai & Wong 2005; Close et al. 2007). Tree guards may protect seedlings from vertebrate herbivores, and/or protect seedlings from desiccating hot wind and/or frost (Corr 2003; Gould 2005). In Aldinga, South Australia the summers are hot and dry {{and it is possible}} that tree guards could aggravate this heat stress (Close et al. 2007). However, due to the Mediterranean climate, winters are cold and tree guards may be beneficial because they limit seedling exposure to cold stress during the early establishment phase.

40|$|Browsing by {{mammalian}} herbivores is a {{major problem}} in plantation forestry worldwide. This has traditionally been controlled through a reduction in herbivore numbers achieved by lethal means, namely shooting and poisoning. In recent years, however, there has been increasing social and political pressure to reduce reliance on such lethal controls, and consequently research into non-lethal controls is becoming increasingly important. In order for non-lethal methods to be efficiently incorporated into management, however, we must first identify those that are most effective under operational conditions. Different methods are rarely tested concurrently, and many have only been proven effective with captive animals or in small scale field trials. This study therefore sought to consolidate past research by combining non-lethal methods, which were known to significantly reduce browsing damage, into a single trial to enable their relative effectiveness to be compared under operational conditions. Eucalypt seedlings with combinations of browsing resistance, nursery fertilizer, chemical repellent (Sen-Tree) and <b>tree</b> <b>guard</b> treatments were planted in replicated blocks spread around the perimeter of eight operational plantations across Tasmania, Australia. Seedlings were monitored regularly for browsing damage, with seedling height and characteristics of the surrounding vegetation being assessed periodically. Wefound that themost effective treatments at reducing the severity of browsing damage in the short-term (< 6 months) were tree guards and a combination of chemical repellent and low nursery fertilizer; there was no effect of the latter after 12 months. These treatments are easily incorporated into existing regimes and, while unlikely to be effective in isolation in areas with high browsing pressure, can be incorporated into management plans to reduce the reliance on lethal controls. While initially less effective than the other treatments, the effects of genetic resistance were more persistent and showed promise for long-lasting protection from browsing...|$|E

40|$|Essential oils crops offer high value, low volume end {{products}} for export. Tasmannia lanceolata is currently commercially utilised for its plant extract {{on a small}} scale, but the consistency of yield and quality potentially offered by plantation production of the species {{has the capacity to}} significantly increase the size of the industry. Early attempts at small scale plantation production highlighted the need to understand the ecophysiology of the species. Climatic and nutritional effects on the growth and plant extract yield and quality of the species were investigated in both glasshouse and field trial conditions. Experiments were conducted on growth responses to manipulated levels of light, temperature, wind and nutrients (with separate experiments focusing specifically on the macronutrients N, P and K and fertiliser rate respectively). Further investigations described the pollen structure of T. lanceolata, as well as vectors that may aid in pollination. Temperature and light levels were manipulated in growth cabinets to determine optimal rates of photosynthesis, and stomatal effects. High light levels and temperatures up to 25 °C, positively affected photosynthetic rate. At 25 °C, photosynthetic rate significantly declined and stomatal conductance significantly increased. A wind tunnel was used to test plant photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and plant water potential over three different wind speed treatments (16, 28 and 43 km/h). Photosynthetic rate declined at higher wind speeds, while stomatal conductance and plant water potential increased at higher wind speeds, while plants were kept at a constant temperature (20 °C). Two field trials with three mulch treatments (bare soil, organic mulch and plastic mulch) and two shelter treatments (with and without <b>tree</b> <b>guards)</b> were applied at two sites. <b>Tree</b> <b>guards</b> increased height and stem circumference after 12 months at both sites on all mulch treatments. Plastic matting and organic mulching increased plant height at one site, while organic mulch significantly increased height of plants over bare soil at the other site. Photosynthetic rates of plants were increased by <b>tree</b> <b>guards</b> under both low and high ambient light conditions. Yield of the most important plant extract component, polygodial, was unaffected by <b>tree</b> <b>guards.</b> Three levels of N, P and K were applied to potted plants in a glasshouse over a 10 month period. The highest application level of N (20 mM) achieved the most growth, with considerably increased plant height, leaf number and stem circumference, along with greater yields of polygodial as a percentage of dry matter. Higher rates of N together with lower rates of P produced particularly strong growth. No advances in growth were achieved above the medium level applications of K (6 mM) and P (1 mM), and oil yield was significantly lowered at the highest treatment levels of both K (12 mM) and P (2 mM). Five levels of Osmocote Plus Trace Elements were applied to glasshouse grown plants to better understand the effects of total nutrient levels, including nutrients other than N, P and K. Plant height, leaf number and stem width were all affected by fertiliser treatments, with greatest plant height at the highest fertiliser rate but not greatest leaf number or stem width. The lowest fertiliser rate produced a significantly higher extract yield than higher fertiliser treatments, but significantly lower plant growth. Polygodial yield as a proportion of oil yield was unaffected by fertiliser rate. Plant pollen was analysed and pollination was examined in the species. Although a single pollen grain was identified on the leg of a muscoid fly, no positive identification was made that this represented the main pollination vector. Gas chromatography of male and female flower samples indicated very strong similarities between the two, however no compounds were identified that could lead to positive determination of suitable pollination vectors based on known pheromone preferences. Insect traps were laid out in the field to look specifically at the role of native bees in the pollination of T. lanceolata, however no positive identification was made of their role in pollination. The research conducted for this thesis showed that understanding the ecophysiological implications and managing for high winds and temperature will be key to site selection and the implementation of successful commercial production systems, and that adequate and carefully targeted nutrition will be essential for optimising growth and plant extract yield. Critical nutrient values identified in this study will aid in calibrating fertiliser rates for commercial production...|$|R
