On September 24, 1992, the committee voted (32 votes in favour, one vote against, one abstention) to approve a report accepting the impeachment petition and recommending that the full Chamber of Deputies should accept the charges of impeachment. Under the Constitution of Brazil, the impeachment process would only proceed if two thirds of the Chamber of Deputies voted to allow the charges of impeachment to be presented to the Senate. On September 29, 1992, Collor was impeached by the Chamber of Deputies, with more than two thirds of its members concurring.

40|$|When President Obama {{came to the}} White House and put his appointees in place, {{they faced}} a long to-do list. For the {{preceding}} eight years, the dominant view within the Executive Branch had been that health, safety, and environmental regulation was a nuisance to business, cutting into industry profits in service of objectives {{that had never been}} part of President George W. Bush’s agenda. By the time Bush II left office on January 20, 2009, little had been done and a lot of important safeguards had been rolled back. Crucial rules mandated by Congress were delayed or derailed, and enforcement was a shadow of its former self. The Obama Administration came to power promising to reinvigorate protections for public health, worker and consumer safety, and the environment; and, indeed, the Administration has made important progress on several fronts. But the President’s first term in office is more than half over, and too much remains to be done. To fulfill the promises he made to the American people, prevent further catastrophes, and save American industry from its own short-sighted opportunism, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>needs</b> to exhort his Cabinet, his political appointees, and the White House staff to get crucial things done. This report identifies 12 such regulatory safeguards, a collection that {{in the view of the}} authors represents the 12 most critical environmental, health, and safety regulations still in the pipeline. Too many of them are in serious danger of being stuck in the pipeline long after January 20, 2013. In particular, for nine of these 12 most critical rules, the Administration is currently on a trajectory that makes it possible, even likely, that it will not complete work on the regulation by the end of the President’s first term. Such an outcome would be particularly distressing because it would not be the consequence of congressional interference or other political opposition, but a flat out failure of the Administration to get its work done in a timely manner – a straightforward unforced error with potentially huge consequences. The report says that three factors will play an outsized role in whether the Administration finishes in time: delays from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, needlessly protracted deliberations by the agencies themselves, and pressure from anti-regulatory interests...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} success and failures of international technology transfer projects of Ministry of Agriculture. An international technology transfer concepts, supporting factors and how transfer is taking place has been reviewed comprehensively. An international technology transfer projects implemented {{in the past have}} not been very successful due to selection of inappropriate technology, selection of incorrect technology supplier and lack of commitment by the transferee. The author of this dissertation uses a combined conceptual model, which is a combination of the concepts of technology capability enhancement, polytrophic components of technology, stage- gate model and seven factors, and a model of technology diffusion to analyze the success and failures of the projects in detail and found that the application is successful. The transferor's dominant role in grant aid projects has prevented the opportunities of transferee to enhance the technological capabilities up to the required level. On the other hand, transferee has performed a very poor role in the acquisition process of the technology. Other main contributory factors for not reaching the required level had been lack of knowledge and capabilities in modern technologies, and low level of commitment and poor performance of the transferee. Inadequate technology transfer has made this situation further serious, as transferee is a dependent on the transferor for various components and they are very costly. It was also noted that the transferor is selling technologies belonging to other companies and acting as a "technology broker" rather than playing the role of committed transferor. Therefore, identification of a transferor, whose motivation and role in the foreign assisted international technology transfer projects, is much more important than simply making use of the funds offered. Present guidelines and regulations enforced for the procurement of goods and services do not focus on the technological aspects to guide for successful technological transfer. As such, National Procurement Agency, which is currently under <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> <b>needs</b> to prepare a "comprehensive check list" for the evaluation and selection of technology suppliers and a "Steering Committee" to implement international technology transfer projects. This steering committee is in addition to the technical evaluation committee and the tender board. This concept would bring more successful and justifiable results for the investment. Any successful TT project does not necessarily produce effective knowledge transfer, unless it is effectively disseminate to stake holders, as they are independent processes. The data of Sri Lanka Integrated Survey confirms that by 1999 - 2000, only about 13 % of agricultural households received technical assistance from a government extension agent, and landless and marginal farmers appeared even more handicapped in accessing extension services. The conceptual model of technology transfer has three broad categories surrounding the core technology. Needs assessment {{is the first step in}} determining the needs and requirements of a new or modified technology to be transferred. Secondly, the implementation process elements are vehicles that facilitate technology transfer and is noted that many international technology transfers fail at the implementation stage. The diffusion process is the final stage where individuals or groups of people decide whether or not to adopt and use the new technology. In most developing nations, given their traditional and cultural orientations, the role of the government and opinion leaders is paramount to successful diffusion of any new technology. It is concluded that the linkages and interactions between technology developers, implementation process, and diffusion activity plan, mere producing an effective transfer of new technologies to grass root levels. Dissemination is a collaborative activity, which involves set of actors, activities, organizations and institutions. The end users are varied in terms of their age, gender, ethnicity, education level, income level, and farming activity, hence diffusion of knowledge is very critical. Therefore, technologies which are very close to the end users needs and wants are quickly diffused. Agricultural extension is a systematic process which transferring knowledge from researches to farmers on numerous matters...|$|E

To improve the financial condition of the university after arriving, the selling of the areas of excellent to the local people – citizens of Ohio, board of trustees, the governor, legislators, and business leaders was a high priority. As a member of some business and community boards, the president not only learns of concerns but can stress that the University is interested in community issues. Dr. Jennings considered a strong faculty senate, a staff council, and a student council essential to “solve” problems and for communication. 	Dr. Jennings compared the University to a large corporation. The major difference is that research and teaching are long run activities. Industry has many short run goals. As the state decreased the percentage of support, the University needed a fundraising operation. The evaluation of a successful operation involved changing the philosophies of many persons. 	The roles of the various members of the Board of Trustees and of the cabinet in improving the University are given. The interaction of the athletic program with the academic programs is discussed. The personnel in athletics created many challenges, both athletic directors and coaches. Another challenge was the development of a medical practice plan with the College of Medicine. Other challenges came from desired changes; use of computers in place of card catalog in the Library, semesters instead of quarters in the College of Law, dealing with the gay community, and class prejudice. Coaches and faculty need to be active in the academic family. 	The procedures for establishing the Ohio’s Selective Excellence Program and its effect on higher education in the state described. Having students (particularly graduate students) from other countries not only improves educational experiences but also provides financial support. 	The president of a large university cannot run the place; he or she must make policy and set the tone. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>needs</b> an outstanding financial officer, a person respected by the politicians and business leaders, and a person respected by the university staff. Three faculty issues were briefly described. One issue was the tenure procedure for faculty at the regional campuses. The second one was {{the pros and cons of}} making librarians faculty members. The third issue was similar, should agricultural extension persons be faculty members? 	A new president is initially inundated with requests for special treatment. A staff member must follow up on the request and provide an answer, either a mistake was made or not. This procedure also was followed with faculty complaints. The president’s financial policies should support his or her educational philosophy. 	The president’s policy for hiring persons is very important. The persons hired for top-level positions should have outstanding leadership skills instead of administrative skills. For other employees, “This is what I want you to do and I’m going to turn you loose and you do it. ” 	The factors that led to his retirement are summarized. 	Dr. Jennings discusses the changes in the land grant mission due to financial restraints.

The Air Force Reserve 77th Troop Carrier Squadron received its first C-124A at Donaldson AFB, South Carolina, about <b>the</b> time that <b>president</b> Kennedy took office in January 1961. Its five C-124 squadrons were organized on 8 May not a month before <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> meeting with Khrushchev in Vienna.
