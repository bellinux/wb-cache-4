5|$|The {{last show}} on 15 September 2001 saw {{many of the}} old {{features}} and presenters return including leprechauns Mr Sage and Mr Onion who acknowledged in the final few minutes of the show that they were the longest serving presenters of the show. The show then ended with Mr Onion pulling the 'Off' switch plunging the studio into darkness. A match was then struck revealing Cawood, Suttie, Farley and Deley standing in the darkness. After saying Missed It? Missed Out!', a reference to the show's former catchphrase, <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> the match out sending the studio back into darkness symbolising {{the end of the show}} and the end of an era.|$|E

25|$|Having {{seen the}} disaster, Henry Charles ran to Rocky Point, {{where there was}} a {{telephone}} link to the quarantine station at William Head. The quarantine station received the call at 7:56 p.m. <b>They</b> <b>blew</b> the emergency whistle, and five minutes later Captain Thomas Riley took out the government steamer Madge to go to the scene (Madge as the quarantine vessel always had steam up, because they never knew when a ship might arrive.) When they got there, they cruised around in the dark for about two hours looking for bodies or wreckage, but found none.|$|E
25|$|At Skyros, Achilles had {{an affair}} with the king's {{daughter}} Deidamia, resulting in a child, Neoptolemus. Odysseus, Telamonian Ajax, and Achilles' tutor Phoenix went to retrieve Achilles. Achilles' mother disguised him as a woman so that he would not have to go to war, but, according to one story, <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> a horn, and Achilles revealed himself by seizing a spear to fight intruders, rather than fleeing. According to another story, they disguised themselves as merchants bearing trinkets and weaponry, and Achilles was marked out from the other women for admiring weaponry instead of clothes and jewelry.|$|E

25|$|On 10 April, the {{remaining}} mutineers fired on Valletta, though they caused no injury. Villettes then ordered that the fort be stormed. A party of 40 men under Lieutenant de Clermont, who was himself {{part of the}} Froberg Regiment, scaled the fort and took control of it, taking no losses in the process. The fort fell but six rebels retreated into the gunpowder magazine, threatening to blow it up. After two days, <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> up the magazine's 600 barrels of gunpowder, and killed three British sentries. In the ensuing confusion the six rebels managed to escape to the countryside.|$|E
25|$|A preseason left orbital bone {{fracture}} saw Rose begin {{the regular season}} wearing a face mask. On November 5, 2015, Rose scored a then season-high 29 points on 12-of-25 shooting in a 104–98 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. He showed signs of his old MVP self as he scored 10 points over the final {{three and a half}} minutes to lift the Bulls after <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter. On December 18, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 147–144 quadruple overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons. On February 5, 2016, he had a season-best game with 30 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists in a 115–110 loss to the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
25|$|On 30 December 1971, Communist forces {{attacked}} Sala Phou Khoun, {{a strategic}} intersection in the Royalist rear; the counter for this would become Operation Maharat. The next day, the first Communist 130mm shells fell on Long Tieng. <b>They</b> <b>blew</b> up the main ammo dump, including its RLAF facilities. Vang Pao unexpectedly left his headquarters at the vital guerrilla base. His CIA advisers {{followed him to}} a smoky hut in Ban Song Sai, 21 kilometers to the southwest. There they found him ill, depressed, weeping, and cursing the lack of air support. He returned to Long Tieng with them.

25|$|On {{the night}} of his murder, Normand left Taylor's {{bungalow}} at 7:45pm in a happy mood, carrying a book he had lent her. <b>They</b> <b>blew</b> kisses {{to each other as}} her limousine drove away. Normand was the last person known to have seen Taylor alive, and the Los Angeles Police Department subjected her to a grueling interrogation but ruled her out as a suspect. Most subsequent writers have done the same. However, Normand's career had already slowed, and her reputation was tarnished by revelations of her addiction, which was seen as a moral failing. According to George Hopkins, who sat next to her at Taylor's funeral, Normand wept inconsolably throughout the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|After {{just ten}} days imprisonment, he was freed {{in a mass}} escape of 100 men from Dundalk prison on 28 July. Then, on 14 August, he led a {{surprise}} attack of between 300 and 400 anti-treaty IRA men on Dundalk. <b>They</b> <b>blew</b> holes in the army barracks there and rapidly {{took control of the}} town at a cost of just two of his men killed. The operation freed 240 republican prisoners and seized 400 rifles. While in possession of the town, Aiken publicly {{called for an end to}} the civil war. For the remainder of the conflict he remained at large with his unit, carrying out guerrilla attacks on Free State forces; however, Aiken was never enthusiastic or nuanced about the internecine struggle.|$|E
25|$|Most reactor designs rely on liquid {{hydrogen}} {{as both a}} coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into tritium, which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Hydrogen is highly flammable, {{and in the case}} of a fire it is possible that the hydrogen stored on-site could be burned up and escape. In this case, the tritium contents of the hydrogen would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that at about , the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power station would be so small that they would have diluted to legally acceptable limits by the time <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> as far as the station's perimeter fence.|$|E

25|$|Kong Le {{continued}} his northward withdrawal on Route 13 with his forces; <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> up the {{bridge over the}} Nam Lik (Lik River) to cover their retirement. His Pathet Lao allies sent 1,000 men southward on Route 13 to Moung Kassy, some 40 kilometers north of his position at Vang Vieng. However, Kong Le drove his convoy of vehicles past them to capture the Route 13/7 intersection at Sala Phou Khoun, leaving the Pathet Lao at Vang Vieng as a rear guard. Faking a feint up Route 13 north to assault Luang Prabang, Kong Le instead led FAN eastwards onto the Plain of Jars, surmounting the obstacles of fallen trees blocking Route 7. As FAN approached the all-weather airfield at Muang Soui, the Hmong guerrilla company that had felled the trees dispersed into the countryside. Their commanding officer radioed that two battalions of paratroopers were drifting down upon the airfield; then he also fled.|$|E
25|$|But {{when the}} series shifted to Oakland {{for the next}} two games, a new X-factor emerged for the Warriors: their home crowd at the Oracle Arena. The {{electric}} crowd, which was the highest paid attendance crowd for an NBA game in the history of that arena, gave the Warriors a huge lift as <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> out Dallas in Game 3, and edged out a close victory in Game 4. As the series shifted back to Dallas, the top-ranked Mavericks found themselves one game from seeing their record breaking season end prematurely. The Mavericks gave their all and staved off elimination in Game 5, but had nothing left in Game 6 in Oakland. The Warriors used a third-quarter 18–0 run, sparked by Stephen Jackson's 13 straight points en route to a franchise playoff record seven 3-pointers, and an unexpected collapse from MVP candidate Dirk Nowitzki (2–13 from the field with 8 points) to finish Dallas and become the first #8 seed to win a best-of-7 series in the first round, and just the third overall in NBA history, following the Denver Nuggets in 1994 and the New York Knicks en route to the 1999 NBA Finals. The Warriors also won their first playoff series since 1991. The Mavericks also became the second team who had a 65+ winning record not to win a championship, the first being the 1972–73 Boston Celtics. To date, they {{are the only ones who}} were eliminated in the first round.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{played into}} their {{traditional}} Thanksgiving home game, this time against division rival Philadelphia. Both teams were vying {{for first place}} in the division with identical 8–3 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33–10. They would rebound the next week where on the road Thursday night game they defeated Chicago 41–28 for their 9th win of the year to clinch their first winning season since 2009. This {{was the first time that}} Dallas played on back to back Thursdays. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21–0. Then the Eagles put up 24 answered points but Dallas came back to win 38–27 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10–4. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts thanks to the Eagles losing that week to the Redskins. They would not disappoint as <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> out the Colts 42–7 to become the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas would end the regular season with a 12–4 record and an 8–0 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44–17. They would also finish December 4–0 which was huge for the Cowboys since they had struggled in the recent years in the month of December.|$|E

25|$|In {{governing}} his own lands Leopold {{found his}} chief difficulties in Hungary, where unrest was caused partly by {{his desire to}} crush Protestantism and partly by the so-called Magnate conspiracy. A rising was suppressed in 1671 and for some years Hungary was treated with great severity. In 1681, after another rising, some grievances were removed and a less repressive policy was adopted, but this did not deter the Hungarians from revolting again. Espousing {{the cause of the}} rebels the sultan sent an enormous army into Austria early in 1683; this advanced almost unchecked to Vienna, which was besieged from July to September, while Leopold took refuge at Passau. Realizing the gravity of the situation somewhat tardily, some of the German princes, among them the electors of Saxony and Bavaria, led their contingents to the Imperial Army, which was commanded by the emperor's brother-in-law, Charles, duke of Lorraine, but the most redoubtable of Leopold's allies was the king of Poland, John III Sobieski, who was already dreaded by the Turks. Austrian forces occupied the castle of Trebišov in 1675, but in 1682 Imre Thököly captured it and then fled from continuous Austrian attacks, so <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> the castle up, since then it is in ruins. They fled as supposedly Hungarian rebel troops under the command of Imre Thököly, cooperating with the Turks, and sacked the city of Bielsko-Biała in 1682. In 1692, Leopold gave up his rights to the property and he gave his rights to the property by a donation to Theresia Keglević.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{withdraw}} from Canton, the British relocated the expeditionary force to Hong Kong. Just {{as with the}} Chinese commanders, the British leaders debated how the war should be continued. Elliot wanted to cease military operations and reopen trade, while Major General Gough wanted to capture the city of Amoy and blockade the Yangtze River. In July a typhoon struck Hong Kong, damaging British ships in the harbor and destroying some of the facilities the expedition was building on the island. The situation changed when on 29 July Elliot was informed {{that he had been}} replaced as Superintendent by Henry Pottinger, who arrived in Hong Kong on 10 August to begin his administration. Pottinger wanted to negotiate terms with the Qing for the entire country of China, rather than just the Pearl River, and so he turned away Chinese envoys from Canton and gave permission for the expeditionary force to proceed with their war plans. Admiral Sir William Parker also arrived in Hong Kong to replace Humphrey Fleming Senhouse (who had died of a fever on 29 June) as the commander of the British naval forces in China. Admiral Parker was a proponent of combined operations between the navy and army, and believed that these tactics could be implemented against the Chinese. It was agreed by the British commanders that combat operations should be moved north to put pressure on Beijing, and on 21 August the fleet sailed for Amoy. On 25 August the British fleet entered the Jiulong River estuary and arrived at Amoy. The city was prepared for a naval assault, as Qing military engineers had built several artillery batteries into the granite cliffs overlooking the river. A purely naval assault was considered too risky by Parker, prompting Gough to order a combined naval and ground attack on the defenses. On 26 August British marines and regular infantry (under the covering fire of the Royal Navy) flanked and destroyed the Chinese defenses guarding the river. Several large British ships failed to destroy the largest of the Chinese batteries (which withstood over 12,000 cannonballs fired at it), so the position was scaled and captured by the British infantry. The city of Amoy was abandoned on 27 August, and British soldiers entered the inner town where <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> up the citadel's powder magazine. 26 Chinese junks and 128 cannons were captured, with the captured guns being thrown into the river by the British. As Lord Palmerston wanted Amoy to become an international trade port {{at the end of the}} war, Gough ordered that no looting be tolerated and had officers enforce the death penalty for anyone found to be plundering. However, many Chinese merchants refused to ask for British protection out of fear of being branded as traitors to the Qing dynasty. The British withdrew to an island on the river, where they established a small garrison and blockaded the Jiulong River. With the city empty of any army, peasants, criminals, and deserters looted the town. The Qing army retook the city and restored order several days later, after which the city governor declared that a victory had been won and 5 British ships sunk.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at 02:00 on 20 September, the 5th Light Horse Brigade, less one {{squadron}} guarding prisoners, advanced from Tulkarm towards 'Ajee to cut {{the railway}} from Messudieh to Jenin. Two squadrons reached the railway [...] north of 'Ajee where <b>they</b> <b>blew</b> up the line. The brigade was then ordered to move north to Jenin, but instead the brigade concentrated back at Tulkarm at 19:00, having captured 140 prisoners and two machine guns.|$|E
