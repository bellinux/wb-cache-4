In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|The film's ending {{was changed}} shortly before its {{theatrical}} release. Originally, Burrows's character would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the test audience, {{who saw the}} film {{less than a month}} before its release, disapproved of the ending because she was behind the shark experiments and was seen as the film's villain. As a result, the production team did a one-day reshoot in the Universal Studios tank and did some computer generated work on the sharks to change it. In 2009, Harlin explained that Deep Blue Sea was the hardest film he had ever made because most of the shooting days involved the team standing in water or being under water for long periods. According to him, [...] "Just the practicality of putting a wet suit on in the morning, being in the water all day. Your script, all your paperwork has to be made of plastic paper. And <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't think would ever float, they float. [...] Or then <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hope would float actually sink and you can't find them anywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Harrison sings {{of how he}} values Dylan's friendship, {{together}} with [...] "the tales you have told me / From the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> saw". For much of his career, Harrison repeatedly identified Dylan {{as one of his}} biggest musical influences, along with Ravi Shankar. To Inglis, these verse-two lines reflect the level of Harrison's respect for his work, since [...] "while millions of others may look to the Beatles for guidance, he looks to Dylan".|$|E
500|$|Quenya nouns {{can have}} up to four numbers: {{singular}}, general plural ("plural 1"), particular/partitive plural ("plural 2"), and dual. However, not all Quenya nouns can have all four numbers since {{some of them are}} pluralia tantum (plural only) having no singular variant for referring to a single object, such as armar [...] "goods (things for sale, or the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> own)"; some other nouns, especially monosyllabic ones, use only one of the two plurals judged the most aesthetic by Elves (i. e. Tolkien).|$|E
500|$|Beginning in February 2007, Nielsen {{began playing}} a small {{role as a}} doctor in the humorous yet {{educational}} television show Doctor*Ology. The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said: [...] "There {{are any number of}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think about when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. I have such admiration for doctors. I just don't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} Frith had {{a passion for}} tape {{manipulation}} and [...] "sound malfunctions". In a 1982 interview with Down Beat magazine Frith said that so much more {{can be done with}} tape: [...] "I'm interested in using the studio for <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> couldn't possibly do in a performance, to use the medium of tape {{in a way that is}} intrinsic to it." [...] He added that hardware malfunctions often result in more interesting sounds than was originally intended: [...] " [...] lot of the sounds that I get in the studio have been specifically the result of overloading or causing to malfunction various pieces of technology, like harmonizers or digital delays." ...|$|E
500|$|Nagarjuna {{added that}} the film's {{characters}} would reborn with no special purpose unlike other reincarnation films like Janaki Ramudu (1988), Arundhati (2009) and Magadheera (2009). Saran {{said in an interview}} that the film basically has a family-oriented theme and is about falling in love with [...] "small, little <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> sort of don't see every day, but are really, really important". Unlike other reincarnation based films, the film's story develops two separate themes— the relationship between reborn lovers, but also the relationship between reborn parents and their children. Naga Chaitanya acknowledged in an interview with The Hindu that the film's script might seem to have a few overly-convenient coincidences, but felt that Kumar's detailing in every scene made the script believable.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot noted, in {{its initial}} review of Portal, that many {{solutions}} exist for completing each puzzle, {{and that the}} gameplay [...] "gets even crazier, and the diagrams shown in the trailer showed some incredibly crazy <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can attempt." [...] Two additional modes are unlocked upon {{the completion of the}} game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber. Challenge maps are unlocked near the halfway point and Advanced Chambers are unlocked when the game is completed. In Challenge mode, levels are revisited with the added goal of completing the test chamber either with as little time, with the least number of portals, or with the fewest footsteps possible. In Advanced mode, certain levels are made more complex with the addition of more obstacles and hazards.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the album}} {{received}} one vote in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critics poll. Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's so interesting, {{part of the reason why}} I think this is so good, it's a juxtaposition of two <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really don't think are meant to be together." [...] Oakland, California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B [...] "was an influence on me. I was starting to listen to his music and hanging out with him a lot when he was working on Rain in England." [...] Cloud rap duo Main Attrakionz has been compared to the style of Rain in England.|$|E
500|$|Stewart served {{not only}} as host {{but also as a}} writer and {{executive}} producer of the series. [...] He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show's voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of The Onion Ben Karlin who, along with fellow Onion contributor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things [...] " [...] to take shape". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, [...] "The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know they don't believe." ...|$|E

500|$|They met up in January 2001 in London {{to record}} the song. He went into a studio with only three tracks for the mix, and was {{impressed}} {{that there were many}} technicians and programmers that probably had been using a hundred. However, the singer was protecting the idea of the raw version, and said: [...] "This is how we wanted to be". They added two changes to the song and then {{spent the rest of the}} day recording Björk's vocals. They wanted to have only one take that really worked so that they did not have to edit different takes. They recorded 20 takes, and used the fifth or sixth, and because of that, the producer thought that [...] "this track is very intimate and personal because of the way the vocals were recorded". The way the song was recorded was [...] "kind of rough" [...] according to Knak; [...] "It's also very close to the mic; all these <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't normally keep. In that sense, it is very kind of, almost naked. In the structure and in the feeling because of the lyrics".|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want and I can give them to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E
