5|$|Before Little's purchase, the punchbowl {{had been}} the {{property}} of Sir Timothy Augustine Coghlan, New South Wales Agent-General in London, who bought <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> for ₤40 in 1923 from one Miss Hall for his own collection. <b>The</b> <b>bowl</b> was subsequently {{in the possession of}} Francis Edwards Ltd before Coghlan's unexpected death in London on 30April 1926. Coghlan had personally collected <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> from a Miss Hall at 'Highfield', 63 Seabrook Rd, Hythe (Kent), England, a few months after she had decided to offer <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> to the New South Wales Government for ₤50. Earlier, a visit to Miss Hall by a Sydney schoolteacher, Jessie Stead, on 6August 1923, resulted in the proposal that <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> ought to be the property of the City of Sydney. Jessie Stead later indicated that she was informed by Miss Hall that her father had acquired <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> in the late 1840s – the earliest dating for the punchbowls' provenance – and that Miss Hall believed <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> was commissioned for William Bligh, New South Wales's fourth Governor (in office 1806–1808). In 2002, the State Library of New South Wales digitised the punchbowl images {{with the support of the}} Nelson Meers Foundation, a philanthropic foundation supporting Australian arts, and <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> became one of the 100 extraordinary library objects to be exhibited as part of Mitchell Library's centenary celebrations in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 college {{football}} season, teams {{were selected for}} the Sugar Bowl under the new Bowl Alliance system. <b>The</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance matched up the conference champions of the Big East, Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and two at-large teams in games to determine an official national champion. Prior {{to the introduction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance and its predecessor, <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Coalition, national champions were determined by various {{college football}} polls that sometimes named different teams as champion.|$|E

5|$|The fenjaan {{was a big}} pot full {{of water}} and a bowl with small hole in the center. When <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot.

5|$|At {{the end of}} chapter 51 of Gylfaginning, High {{describes}} how the gods caught and bound Loki. Skaði is described as having taken a venomous snake and fastening it above the bound Loki, so that the venom may drip on to Loki's face.

5|$|Maryland {{achieved}} bowl eligibility {{through its}} sixth win against NC State. The Terrapins finished {{the regular season}} with a 7–5overall record and 4–4record against ACC opponents. Maryland's conference record was identical to four other ACC teams, and the league fielded an NCAA record of ten bowl-eligible teams. For the 2008 season, there were eight non-Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl games with ACC tie-ins: <b>the</b> Gator <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Chick-fil-A <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Champs Sports <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Music City <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Humanitarian <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Emerald <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Meineke Car Care <b>Bowl,</b> and <b>the</b> EagleBank <b>Bowl.</b>|$|R

5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|During the 1996 season, the Orange Bowl was {{a member}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance, a {{precursor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series. <b>The</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance was formed prior to the 1995 college football season in an effort to match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams {{at the conclusion of the}} regular season while also ensuring other high-ranking teams were allowed to participate in high-profile bowl games. The Alliance included the Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and Big East Conference. As agreed, the champions of each conference would play in one of three Bowl Alliance games: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. The Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences, which had a separate agreement with the Rose Bowl, were not included in <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance until 1998, when the Alliance became <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. Just as in the ACC, the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. <b>The</b> <b>bowl</b> earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which guarantees {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third.|$|E
50|$|Three other <b>bowls,</b> <b>the</b> International <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Bluebonnet <b>Bowl,</b> and <b>the</b> Chick-fil-A <b>Bowl,</b> {{were also}} played in {{baseball}} stadiums, but Toronto's Rogers Centre (the home of <b>the</b> defunct International <b>Bowl),</b> Houston's Astrodome (home of <b>the</b> Bluebonnet <b>Bowl)</b> and Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium (home of <b>the</b> then-Peach <b>Bowl)</b> were purposely built to house both baseball and football.|$|R
50|$|The at-large spot in <b>the</b> Fiesta <b>Bowl</b> {{was filled}} via a {{round-robin}} selection procedure defined by <b>the</b> other <b>Bowl</b> Championship series {{games and the}} automatic bids. The order of at-large selections rotates annually among <b>the</b> BCS <b>bowls.</b> In 2011, <b>the</b> Sugar <b>Bowl</b> picked first, followed by <b>the</b> Orange <b>Bowl,</b> then <b>the</b> Fiesta <b>Bowl.</b> Uniquely in 2011, <b>the</b> Rose <b>Bowl</b> was obligated to choose a non-automatic qualifier {{in place of the}} Pac-10 Champion, Oregon. <b>The</b> Sugar <b>Bowl</b> picked Ohio State, while <b>the</b> Orange <b>Bowl</b> selected Stanford. <b>The</b> Fiesta <b>Bowl</b> was thus left to select Big East Conference champion Connecticut.|$|R

5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> which changes for each level. When the right amount of ingredients has been put in <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E
50|$|Under USBC regulations, one can drill {{up to five}} {{holes on}} <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> ball. Since most bowlers use three holes (thumb and two fingers,) one could drill {{additional}} holes on other parts of <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> ball, to take additional weight off of a portion of <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> ball, such as an axis hole that allows <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> ball's hook to stabilize during its roll to the pins. Doctoring <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> ball by adding additional holes is not recommended unless the bowler is experienced enough {{to know where to}} place these holes, such as studying the track area of the ball and knowing where to place the axis hole.|$|R
50|$|The Pride of the South is {{the name}} of the marching band at The University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi.

5|$|The second Sydney punchbowl had a {{much more}} {{circuitous}} journey to the present. <b>The</b> <b>bowl</b> first appeared in May 1932, when Sir Robert Witt, chairman of the British National Art Collections Fund, wrote to James MacDonald, Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, inquiring if a Sydney museum {{would be interested in}} acquiring the second punchbowl. The Gallery Director referred the offer to William Herbert Ifould, Principal Librarian of the Public Library of New South Wales, in August 1932. Ifould wrote directly to Sir Robert Witt indicating that <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> was not required by the Library as a very similar one was already held. Ifould received a reply dated 31October 1932, stating that during the intervening months the owner of <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> in England – whose name was undisclosed – had since sold <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> to another undisclosed buyer. The bowl's subsequent whereabouts was unknown until 1988. In the original offer by Sir Robert – who had also co-founded the Courtauld Institute of Art in London – a suggestion was made that this bowl had been made to the order of Arthur Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales (in office 1788–1795) who established the settlement at Sydney Cove. However, no evidence to support this view was given in Witt's letter.|$|E
5|$|The {{students}} then visited {{the home of}} Ralph Cooper Hutchison, the president of Lafayette College. Upon their arrival, President Hutchison told the students that David Showell was not invited to play in <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game because he was an African American. Hutchison further explained that the Sun Bowl Committee's decision to exclude Showell ultimately led to the faculty's rejection of <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game bid. The student protestors asked that a conditional acceptance {{be made to the}} bid as long as they allowed David Showell to play.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} moved for {{the first}} time on 3 February 1957: by an inch. It was first moved azimuthally under power on 12 June 1957; <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> was tilted under power {{for the first}} time on 20 June 1957. By the end of July the dish surface was completed, and first light was on 2 August 1957; the telescope did a drift scan across the Milky Way at 160MHz, with <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> at the zenith. The telescope was first controlled from the control room on 9 October 1957, by a purpose-built analogue computer.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, the {{football}} team's 10–0 season {{culminated in a}} 28–13 victory over first-ranked Tennessee in the 1952 Sugar Bowl. Maryland's participation, however, was in violation of a Southern Conference resolution passed mid-season that banned participation in postseason bowl games. Byrd had Maryland accept <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> invitation, despite Tatum's objections. The coach thought the threatened sanctions, which prevented Maryland from playing any Southern Conference games the following season, would severely disadvantage his team. In 1952, Maryland and Clemson, which had also violated <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game ban, were sanctioned, and the incident hastened the break-up of the Southern Conference and formation of the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which both schools were founding members.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Sugar Bowl {{was held}} {{under the rules}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance. The Alliance, {{predecessor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series, was intended to match the champions of the Southeastern Conference, Big East Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12, Southwest Conference, and one at-large team {{against each other in}} the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. Each year, the two highest-ranked teams would play in a National Championship Game held in place of one of <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> games. The site of the national championship game rotated among the three bowl games, as did the date of each game. Following the 1995 college football season, the Sugar Bowl was designated for December 31, marking the first time two Sugar Bowls would be held in the same calendar year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (MACOC) took over the Peach Bowl. <b>The</b> <b>bowl</b> {{executive}} director {{at the time was}} Dick Bestwick, and he encouraged the Chamber to step up its support of the game over what had been provided by the Lions Club. In 1986, the Peach Bowl had no contractual obligations with college football conferences, as its successor, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, does today. Team selections were made by the Peach Bowl committee, a board of Atlanta community members, business leaders, and organizers of the Peach Bowl. To form one half of the matchup, the committee selected second-place Atlantic Coast Conference team NC State, which accepted <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> bid on November 22, 1986, the day of their final regular-season game. The other half of the matchup was Virginia Tech, a football independent that had finished with nine wins, one loss, and one tie during the regular season and received its invitation one week after the regular season concluded.|$|E
50|$|The Vanier Cup {{was played}} between the champions of <b>the</b> Mitchell <b>Bowl</b> and <b>the</b> Uteck <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} semi-final games.
