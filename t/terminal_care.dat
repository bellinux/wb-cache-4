500|$|In several Buddhist countries, it {{has been}} common to record merits done. In China, it was common for many centuries to keep record of someone's meritorious deeds in 'merit ledgers' (...) [...] Although a belief in merit and {{retribution}} had preceded the merit ledgers by many centuries, the ledgers established a practice of systematic merit accumulation for the first time. [...] The merit ledgers were lists of good deeds and bad deeds, organized {{in the form of}} a calendar for users to calculate to what extent they had been practicing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds every day. The ledgers also listed the exact retributions of every number of deeds done, to the detail. Through these ledgers it was believed someone could offset bad karma. In the fourth century CE, the Baopuzi, and in the twelfth century the Treatise On the Response of the Tao and the Ledger of Merit and Demerit of the Taiwei Immortal introduced the basics of the system of merit ledgers. In the fourteenth century CE, the Tao master Zhao Yizhen recommended the use of the ledgers to examine oneself, to bring emotion in harmony with reason. From the fourth to the sixteenth centuries, many types of ledgers were produced by Buddhist and Tao schools, and the usage of the ledgers grew widespread. The practice of recording merits has survived in China and Japan until the present day. In Theravāda countries, for example in Burma and Sri Lanka, similar customs have been observed. In Sri Lanka, a [...] ( [...] , [...] ) was sometimes kept by someone for years and read in the last moments of life. This practice was based on the story of King Duṭṭhagāmaṇi, and was mostly practiced by the royalty and rich during the period of the Mahāvaṁsa chronicle. More recent practice has also been observed, for example, as a form of <b>terminal</b> <b>care.</b> or as part of the activities of lay merit-making associations.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the infrastructure of home medical care services in Niigata, a survey was conducted on the number of registrations submitted for homecare support clinic, homecare general management fees, and homecare <b>terminal</b> medical <b>care</b> general medical fees introduced with the revision of medical service fees in 2006. The results showed that no registrations were made in 17 municipals for homecare support clinic, and none in 18 municipals for homecare <b>terminal</b> medical <b>care</b> general medical fees. As for the breakdown of the submissions for homecare general management fees, registrations were submitted from 83 homecare support clinics, 184 clinics that were not homecare support clinic, and three hospitals. It was therefore concluded that the homecare support clinic in Niigata differs according to region, and currently, medical facilities providing home medical care are mainly clinics that are not homecare support clinic今回，新潟県内の在宅医療のサービス基盤の状況を把握するために， 2006 年の診療報酬改定で導入された「在宅療養支援診療所」，「在宅時医学総合管理料」，「在宅末期医療総合診療料」の開設（届出）状況の調査を行った．結果，「在宅療養支援診療所」では，全体の 48 ％に当たる 17 市町村で開設（届出）数がゼロであった．また，「在宅療養支援診療所」にのみ認められている「在宅末期医療総合診療料」においても，全体の 51 ％に当たる 18 市町村で開設（届出）数がゼロであった．次に，「在宅時医学総合管理料」開設（届出）の内訳では，「在宅療養支援診療所」 83 ヶ所，「在宅療養支援診療所」ではない診療所 184 ヶ所，病院（ 200 床未満） 3 ヶ所となっていた．結論，新潟県内の「在宅療養支援診療所」は開設数も少なく地域に偏りがあった．現状では，在宅医療を提供する医療機関としては，「在宅療養支援診療所」ではない診療所が中心となっていると考えられる...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Medical {{systems in}} the USA such as EBM., DRG., Informed Consent and Second Opinion have already been {{introduced}} into the Japanese medical system. However, some of these systems have met resistance from {{a part of the}} population due to the differences of social structures, morals and customs between the two countries. Briefly, I described the medical education and licensure, the private practice and “open hospital system ” of the USA. The following 4 topics which drew great interest in Japan will be discussed. 1) Cerebral death and Bioethics: Cerebral death has been restrictively accepted as human death since the 1980 ’s only in terms of <b>terminal</b> <b>cares</b> in clinical medicine. The rather simplified current neurological criteria for death are approved in the USA. In order for an organ transplant to take place, a potential doner must be diagnosed as brain dead. However, Japanese society has not accepted the concept of cerebral death completely because of an accident in the 1960 ’s where an organ was improperly removed when the donor who was not in the state of brain death. Recently, more people in Japan are show-ing interest in Dignity and Euthanasia {{from the point of view}} of “Right to die”. 2) Malpractice and Litigation: “To err is human ” was introduced by the Institute of Medi...|$|R

Interviewed by telephone 1 year and 2 weeks after bereavement, relatives of PCU patients report significantly fewer psychological symptoms and less lasting grief and anger than relatives of patients who had died elsewhere. Factors thought to have contributed to good outcomes were successful relief of pain, awareness by relatives of the coming death of the patient and support given to relatives after bereavement.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{palliative care}} being an {{accepted}} role of community hospitals, {{there is little}} quantitative evidence {{of the type of}} care provided. AIM: To obtain quantitative data comparing palliative cancer care provided in 12 community hospitals in 10 towns (approximately 350 medical beds) and in a consultant-led purpose-built hospice (12 beds). METHOD: Retrospective medical and nursing case note analysis over one year of cancer deaths in the former Exeter Health District. RESULTS: A total of 171 community hospital and 116 hospice casenotes were analysed. Hospice patients had significantly different reasons for admission compared with community hospital patients (P < 0. 001), with pain and symptom control being more frequent and <b>terminal</b> nursing <b>care</b> less frequent reasons for admission to the hospice. Community hospital length of stay was significantly longer than hospice length of stay (P = 0. 002; mean community hospital stay 16 days, mean hospice stay eight days). Symptoms on admission differed significantly. Drug prescribing on admission and at death and indications of active treatment of symptoms were broadly similar. Community hospital patients received more investigations than hospice patients, linked to the observation that around one in ten community hospital patients were admitted for investigation and active treatment. Community hospital medical notes were significantly less likely to meet minimum quality standards than were hospice notes (81 / 171 vs. 18 / 116; P < 0. 001), with major deficiencies in the areas of examination, progress reporting, and absence of confirmation of death. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the role of community hospitals in palliative <b>terminal</b> cancer <b>care.</b> Differences in care between community hospitals and a hospice have been demonstrated that may reflect either different admission populations to each setting or differences in the way care was delivered...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{paper is to}} offer an {{understanding}} of home hospice from a perspective of political geography. Informed by critical political theories of care, and recent work on the geographies {{of public and private}} spheres, I explore one set of consequences of the spatial shift towards home death in metropolitan Seattle, Washington. <b>Terminal</b> hospice <b>care</b> done in the home creates an especially paradoxical home space. By blurring public - private boundaries, hospice care produces a political geography of home interpretable through four spatial paradoxes: a normative paradox of home being a good and bad place to die, a territorial paradox of control itself changing the home, a constitutive paradox between heart and welfare politics, and a relational paradox between autonomy and dependency. The implications for political and health geography, as well as political theory and hospice work itself are discussed as a consequence of recognizing these spatial paradoxes. ...|$|R

People with severe dementia have complex physical and psychological needs, yet, the disease is not always recognised as <b>terminal.</b> Advance <b>care</b> planning involving people with dementia and their families can provide opportunities to discuss and later, initiate timely palliative care. We conducted a scoping review of studies exploring decisions associated with the EoLC of people with dementia. Eligible studies had to report on decision making {{at the end of life}} and by whom (the dying person, clinician/health professional or relative/family member). Twenty five eligible studies reported on advance care planning and end of life care decisions for individuals with dementia.

40|$|Background: Extensive debate {{surrounds}} {{the practice of}} continuous sedation until death to control refractory symptoms in <b>terminal</b> cancer <b>care.</b> We examined reported practice of United Kingdom, Belgian and Dutch physicians and nurses. Methods: Qualitative case studies using interviews. Setting: Hospitals, the domestic home and hospices or palliative care units. Participants: In all, 57 Physicians and 73 nurses involved {{in the care of}} 84 cancer patients. Results: UK respondents reported a continuum of practice from the provision of low doses of sedatives to control terminal restlessness to rarely encountered deep sedation. In contrast, Belgian respondents predominantly described the use of deep sedation, emphasizing the importance of responding to the patient’s request. Dutch respondents emphasized making an official medical decision informed by the patient’s wish and establishing that a refractory symptom was present. Respondents employed rationales that showed different stances towards four key issues: the preservation of consciousness, concerns about the potential hastening of death, whether they perceived continuous sedation until death as an ‘alternative’ to euthanasia and whether they sought to follow guidelines or frameworks for practice. Conclusion: This qualitative analysis suggests that there is systematic variation in end-of-life care sedation practice and its conceptualization in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{inception}} in the 1960 s, hospice care has been primarily focused on the care of terminally ill cancer patients. The lack of effective remedies for pain and other symptoms, poor communication with healthcare professionals, and inadequate practical and emotional support resulted in considerable distress for patients and families, and provided much of {{the impetus for the}} original development and rapid spread of what has become the hospice movement. This initial focus on cancer, together with rapid advances in science and management of pain, allowed swift progress to be made in both the science and the practice of palliative care. As the principles and practice of hospice care have been disseminated across the world, they have been adapted to fit local circumstances. In some settings there has been historically greater emphasis on, and provision for, people with conditions other than cancer, particularly in those countries where pioneers and champions of hospice care have come from backgrounds outside oncology. Nevertheless, in many settings, hospice and palliative care have been (and remain) synonymous with <b>terminal</b> cancer <b>care.</b> This situation is increasingly challenged, especially in those countries where hospice care has the longest history. In this paper, I will review the reasons for this and consider the obstacles to extending the borders of palliative care beyond cancer...|$|R
5000|$|Third {{generation}} {{advance directives}} {{were designed to}} contain enriched content to assist individuals and their appointed agents, families, and physicians to better understand and honor their wishes. The first of the third-generation advance directives was the Values History by Doukas and McCullough, created at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, first published in 1988, and then more widely cited {{in an article in}} 1991. The Values History is a [...] "two-part advance directive instrument that elicits patient values about <b>terminal</b> medical <b>care</b> and therapy-specific directives." [...] The goal of this advance directive is to move away from a focus on specific treatments and medical procedures to a focus on patient values and personal goals. Another values-based project was later published by Lambert, Gibson, and Nathanson at the Institute of Public Law, University of New Mexico School of Law in 1990. It continues to be made available via the Hospice and Palliative Care Federation. [...] One persistent challenge of third generation-based values documents is to show a linkage between the elicited values and goals with medical care wishes, although studies have demonstrated that values regarding financial and psychological burden are strong motivators in not wanting a broad array of end-of-life therapies.|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{know the}} {{experiences}} of the nursing students regarding the care to the person in a terminal process. Methods: a qualitative study with data collected through semi-structured interviews held with ten nursing students. Results: from the data analysis, two theme categories emerged: Feelings expressed facing the first contact with the patients in a <b>terminal</b> process and <b>care</b> to the patient in a terminal process: dichotomy between theory and practice. When experiencing the care to the person in the dying process, students have shown that the feeling of helplessness was the most striking, among others such as sadness, anguish and insecurity. Conclusion: the practices of care of the nursing team disagree with the academic discussions, denying the discourse that the nurse should be present with the patient, regardless of his clinical condition. ...|$|R
