25|$|Emmy Werner {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{scientists}} to use the term resilience in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from Kauai, Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many {{of the children in the}} study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work. Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-wedlock births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of <b>these</b> <b>youngsters</b> did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'. Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.|$|E
500|$|Seekers has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly praised the suspenseful {{ending of the}} first book and thought readers would find great interest in the bears' struggle to survive. Booklist found {{the plot of the}} first book to have an [...] "interesting balance of cute anthropomorphic characterization and realistic attention to bear behaviors." [...] School Library Journal wrote [...] "from the first page, this story is exciting and refreshing" [...] and [...] "he plot is fast paced, and the author is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of <b>these</b> <b>youngsters</b> on their own." [...] Kirkus Review found that [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery." [...] However, the reviewer also felt that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot. In a review for the second and third books, Horn Book Review felt that readers might experience some confusion about the mountain, but they would still enjoy the fantasy adventure and the descriptions of the animals.|$|E

He made his debut on 6 August 2005 in a 0–0 draw at home to Notts County, although he only lasted 26 minutes before being replaced by substitute Tony Bedeau. His return from an injury after nearly a month out came in a 2–1 victory over Shrewsbury Town in September, which was Torquay's first win of the season. He picked up another injury in November 2005, and made his return {{after three months of}} not playing by starting in a 1–0 victory over Bristol Rovers on 17 December 2005. He scored an own goal after 86 minutes against Wycombe Wanderers on 26 December 2005, which resulted in Torquay drawing 2–2.

500|$|Reception to {{the novel}} was {{positive}} and many reviewers praised the realistic setting and behaviours of the main characters. Koelling [...] noted how the novel has a balance of cute anthropomorphic characterisation and also gives a realistic view of {{how hard it is}} for the bears to survive on their own. Koelling also recommended the novel to Warriors fans. Kirkus Reviews praised how [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery", but felt that there is little advancement of the plot due to the time introducing and developing the characters. Still, the reviewer felt that the novel would appeal the animal fantasy lovers for the its extreme detail. Publishers Weekly found the novel written more loosely than the Warriors series, but still appealing to readers as they follow the bears survival. Draper praised the fast pace and how Erin Hunter [...] "is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of <b>these</b> <b>youngsters</b> on their own". Matt Berman, writing for Half Moon Bay Review, praised the cliffhanger ending which would invite in more readers for the second novel, but felt that Warriors fans would be disappointed while [...] "animal lovers will find this story’s mix of anthropomorphism and realism appealing, and Hunter may find an entirely new audience".|$|E

The complex has an outdoor basketball court, a hike and bicycle trail, a playground, a lighted athletics field, and a water park. No recreation centers existed in Gulfton {{prior to the}} opening of Burnett Bayland. In 1995 Mike McMahon, executive director of Gulfton Area Neighborhood Association (GANO), criticized the city for not establishing any libraries, multi-service centers, parks, or recreation centers in Gulfton. However, through the collaborative effort of Gulfton Weed & Seed and Gulfton Youth Development, members of the Gulfton Youth Leadership Council attended Superneighborhoood meetings to lobby for an enclosed area at Burnett Bayland Park, where many of the youth attended Campo del Sol or soccer games; they also lobbied for a multi-purpose center to be established to assist all members of the Gulfton area. [...] Through their efforts, money was allocated for Burnett Bayland to be rebuilt with an enclosed community center as well as money being allocated for a multipurpose center to be built.

500|$|The first {{long-range}} American fighter was the twin-engined P-38 Lightning {{but none}} reached the South West Pacific Area until October 1942 and, beset {{with a host}} of mechanical difficulties, it was not until December 1942 that they flew their first major combat mission over New Guinea. Deliveries were suspended in January 1943 owing to the requirements of the North African Campaign, forcing Kenney to accept the P-47 Thunderbolt, the first of which arrived in Australia in July 1943. Early model P-47s had less range than P-40 Kittyhawks until [...] fuel tanks could be manufactured for them in Australia. These enabled the 348th Fighter Group to become operational in August 1943. While the tanks were very successful on the P-38s and P-40s, overloading the P-47s caused numerous crashes, and the pilots were reluctant to fly with more than [...] of fuel. In 1945, the P-47s were replaced by P-51 Mustangs. By September 1943, Wurtsmith's five fighter groups had 598 aircraft but this included 70 P-39s, 30 P-400s and 118 P-40s, half of which were in the depots. The technical representative of Bell Aircraft reported that the P-39s and P-40s averaged 300 combat hours. That of Curtiss-Wright similarly reported that the P-40s had from 300 to 500 combat hours, which was equivalent to about 2,000 normal hours. General Kenney wrote to General Henry H.

2500|$|In the 1970s, Raymond and Dorothy Moore {{conducted}} four {{federally funded}} analyses {{of more than}} 8,000 early childhood studies, from which they published their original findings in Better Late Than Early, 1975. This was followed by School Can Wait, a repackaging of these same findings designed specifically for educational professionals. They concluded that, [...] "where possible, children should be withheld from formal schooling until at least ages eight to ten." [...] Their reason was that children [...] "are not mature enough for formal school programs until their senses, coordination, neurological development and cognition are ready". They concluded that the outcome of forcing children into formal schooling is a sequence of [...] "1) uncertainty as the child leaves the family nest early for a less secure environment, 2) puzzlement at the new pressures and restrictions of the classroom, 3) frustration because unready learning tools – senses, cognition, brain hemispheres, coordination – cannot handle the regimentation of formal lessons and the pressures they bring, 4) hyperactivity growing out of nerves and jitter, from frustration, 5) [...] failure which quite naturally flows from the four experiences above, and 6) delinquency which is failure's twin and apparently for the same reason." [...] According to the Moores, [...] "early formal schooling is burning out our children. Teachers who attempt to cope with <b>these</b> <b>youngsters</b> also are burning out." [...] Aside from academic performance, they think early formal schooling also destroys [...] "positive sociability", encourages peer dependence, and discourages self-worth, optimism, respect for parents, and trust in peers. They believe this situation is particularly acute for boys because of their delay in maturity. The Moores cited a Smithsonian Report {{on the development of}} genius, indicating a requirement for [...] "1) much time spent with warm, responsive parents and other adults, 2) very little time spent with peers, and 3) a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance." [...] Their analysis suggested that children need [...] "more of home and less of formal school", [...] "more free exploration with... parents, and fewer limits of classroom and books", and [...] "more old fashioned chores – children working with parents – and less attention to rivalry sports and amusements." ...|$|E
