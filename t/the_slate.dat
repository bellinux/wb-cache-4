5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. <b>The</b> <b>slate</b> cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> behind if they want to climb a ladder.|$|E

5|$|The First World War hit <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> {{industry}} badly, {{particularly in}} Blaenau Ffestiniog where exports to Germany {{had been an}} important source of income. Cilgwyn, the oldest quarry in Wales, closed in 1914, though it later reopened. In 1917, slate quarrying was declared a non-essential industry and a number of quarries were closed {{for the remainder of the}} war. The demand for new houses after the end of the war brought back a measure of prosperity; in <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> mines of Blaenau Ffestiniog production was almost back to 1913 levels by 1927, but in the quarries the output was still well below the pre-war level. The Great Depression in the 1930s led to cuts in production, with exports particularly hard hit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{geotechnical}} properties of <b>the</b> ordovician weathered <b>slates</b> outcropping in <b>the</b> urban area of Salamanca. Due to the mesozoic weathering, the originated profile imported characteristics of residual soils to <b>the</b> <b>slates</b> in some locations. This process has important effects on the geomechanical behaviour of these materials. <b>The</b> <b>slates</b> have been tested in moisture content, granulometric analysis, liquid and plastic limit, apparent density, Proctor, permeability, compression strength and California Bearing Ratio (C. B. R.). <b>The</b> weathered <b>slates</b> are low permeability silty or clay soils with low plasticity (ML-CL); they are composed of kaolinite, illite, quartz and feldspar.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>slates</b> {{were formed}} during the Early Devonian when a slaty {{cleavage}} was {{imposed on the}} Ordovician and Silurian rocks of the area. <b>The</b> best quality <b>slate</b> with <b>the</b> most even and regular cleavage was formed fromthe lithologically uniform mudstone successions.|$|R
5|$|The {{existence}} of a slate industry in Wales is attested since the Roman period, when slate was used to roof the fort at Segontium, now Caernarfon. <b>The</b> <b>slate</b> industry grew slowly until the early 18th century, then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century, at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest Wales, including the Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda, the Dinorwic Quarry near Llanberis, the Nantlle Valley quarries, and Blaenau Ffestiniog, where <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> was mined rather than quarried. Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world, and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world. Slate is mainly used for roofing, but is also produced as thicker slab {{for a variety of}} uses including flooring, worktops and headstones.|$|E
5|$|The preglacial {{drainage}} {{pattern was}} controlled by the rock structure. Ver Steeg reconstructed a preglacial drainage pattern that shows major streams flowing east in <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> belts. Short tributaries and short north-south segments of the major streams cut across ridges which formed small gaps that are still present.|$|E
5|$|The {{quarries}} and mines made {{increasing use of}} mechanization {{from the}} start of the 20th century, with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a hydro-electric plant was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of Snowdon, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area. The use of electric saws and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting <b>the</b> <b>slate,</b> but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of silicosis. The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths. A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> mines was 3.23 per thousand, higher than the rate for coal miners.|$|E

The four main divisions, from the top down, are the Upper Slaty, Upper Cherty, Lower Slaty and Lower Cherty. Below these are {{quartzite}} and granite, and Virginia Slate and Duluth gabbro lie above. <b>The</b> <b>slate</b> is from 50 to several hundred feet thick, and the four iron-bearing layers are from 400 to 600 feet thick.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>slates</b> on <b>the</b> roof should be, when rightly understood, a {{pleasant}} subject for contemplation to the dweller in a town.

I only wish that he should--at least after reading this paper--let <b>the</b> <b>slates</b> on <b>the</b> roof carry him back in fancy to the mountains whence they came; perhaps to pleasant trips to the lakes and hills of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and North Wales; and to recognise--as he will do if he have intellect as well as fancy--how beautiful and how curious an object is a common slate.|$|R

5|$|The {{prosperity}} of <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> industry {{led to the}} growth of a number of other associated industries. Shipbuilding increased at a number of coastal locations, particularly at Porthmadog, where 201 ships were built between 1836 and 1880. Engineering companies were set up to supply the quarries, notably De Winton at Caernarfon. In 1870, De Winton built and equipped an entire workshop for the Dinorwig Quarry, with machinery powered by overhead shafting that in its turn was driven by the largest water-wheel in the United Kingdom, over 50feet in diameter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>slate</b> {{deposits}} of Wales belong to three geological series: Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian. The Cambrian deposits run south-west from Conwy to near Criccieth; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries {{and in the}} Nantlle Valley. There are smaller outcrops elsewhere, for example on Anglesey. The Ordovician deposits run south-west from Betws-y-Coed to Porthmadog; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of Ordovician slate further south, running from Llangynnog to Aberdyfi, quarried mainly in the Corris area, with a few outcrops in south-west Wales, notably Pembrokeshire. The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the Dee valley and around Machynlleth.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Welsh writers have {{drawn on the}} lives of the quarrymen for their material, for example the novels of T. Rowland Hughes. Chwalfa, {{translated}} into English as Out of their night (1954), has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background, while Y cychwyn, translated as The beginning (1969), follows the apprenticeship of a young quarryman. Several novels by Kate Roberts, the daughter of a quarryman, give a picture of the area around Rhosgadfan, where <b>the</b> <b>slate</b> industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders. Her novel Traed mewn cyffion (1936), translated as Feet in chains (2002), gives a vivid picture of the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914. Y Chwarelwr ("The Quarryman") produced in 1935 was the first Welsh-language film. It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman's life at Blaenau Ffestiniog.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to the end}} of <b>the</b> 18th century, <b>slate</b> was {{extracted}} on a {{small scale}} by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to <b>the</b> landlord, carted <b>slate</b> to <b>the</b> ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on a larger scale. After <b>the</b> government abolished <b>slate</b> duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport <b>the</b> <b>slates</b> to <b>the</b> ports.|$|R
