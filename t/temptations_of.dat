5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for the <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the fallen empire lands (for many of them it happened possibly rather quickly, {{during the first half}} of that century).|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{impact on}} the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often {{effected}} by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise clash with {{the traditions of the}} Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{literary}} critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's psychological struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's theories on psychoanalysis. Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being disappointed that his traditional religious upbringing {{is not enough to}} overcome the <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the modern world. Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} high regard for natural law and {{for the idea of}} a {{universe}} without miracles, deists were especially susceptible to the <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> determinism.

25|$|Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress is {{an allegory}} of {{personal}} salvation and {{a guide to}} the Christian life. Instead of any focus on eschatology or divine retribution, Bunyan instead writes about how the individual saint can prevail against the <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> mind and body that threaten damnation. The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and biography, and yet it also shows an awareness of the allegorical tradition found in Edmund Spenser.|$|E

Saint Mary Magdalen de Pazzi (1566–1607) and Saint Veronica Giuliani (1660–1727) were both observed binge eating—giving in, as they believed, to the <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the devil. Saint Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) is known to have supplemented her strict abstinence from food by purging as reparation for her sins. Catherine died from starvation at age thirty-three.|$|E
25|$|Yet the <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> {{the city}} and corrupting companionships could easily lead a {{perfectly}} diligent servant {{into the path of}} crime. A mounting anxiety grew between eighteenth-century Londoners regarding the danger posed by servants seeking employment in order to steal or open the house at night to their accomplices. According to Defoe, living in fear and suspicion of your servants, as feeling unsafe outdoors at night, means to live in an hostile country, a depiction unworthy of his idea of a flourishing England.|$|E

He felt too that his fame was being used to increase the guru's visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Magdalene College {{is located}} at the bend of the River Cam on the northwestern side of the town centre, at the foot of Castle Hill.

As such, it was the first Cambridge college to be built on the northwestern side of the Cam. The college's main site was previously settled during the Roman occupation of England.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} 12 pictures {{indicate the}} virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included {{a great number}} of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged Pharaohs and the devil himself. Each painting required a landscape. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in Botticelli's scene of The Purification of the Leper, there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case The <b>Temptations</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|E

25|$|Amidst the vogue {{enjoyed by}} existentialism and {{positivism}} in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception {{of natural history}} that critiqued the twin <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> ontology and empiricism through studies of Kierkegaard and Husserl. As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of Arnold Schoenberg resulted in his studying composition with Alban Berg of the Second Viennese School, Adorno's commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with Thomas Mann on the latter's novel Doctor Faustus, while the two men lived in California as exiles during the Second World War. Working for the newly relocated Institute for Social Research, Adorno collaborated on influential studies of authoritarianism, antisemitism and propaganda that would later serve as models for sociological studies the Institute carried out in post-war Germany.|$|E
