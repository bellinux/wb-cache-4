5|$|Four {{weeks after}} his {{discharge}} from the Air Force, Waters married Gladys Saunders, {{with whom he had}} six children. He worked as an automotive mechanic, but was forced to cease by union rules, which required him to serve an apprenticeship. Waters was then briefly employed by a local council in Queensland as a road worker, before returning <b>to</b> <b>shearing,</b> which took him away from his family to properties stretching from North Queensland to Victoria. He personally estimated that he sheared a million sheep during his life.|$|E
5|$|The local bedrock {{is a hard}} red sandstone, {{which the}} {{inhabitants}} used {{in the construction of}} monuments and architecture. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> or fracturing, allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the Americas. Quiriguá was built directly over the Motagua Fault and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Victor (Len) Waters (20June 1924– 24August 1993) was {{the first}} Aboriginal Australian {{military}} aviator, {{and the only one}} to serve as a fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. Aborigines at the time suffered significant discrimination and disadvantages in Australian society, such as restrictions on movement, residence, employment, and access to services and citizenship. Born in northern New South Wales and raised in Queensland, Waters was working as a shearer when he joined the RAAF in 1942. Training initially as a mechanic, he volunteered for flying duties and graduated as a sergeant pilot in 1944. He flew P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre, where he completed 95 missions, mainly close air support. By {{the end of the war}} he had risen to the rank of warrant officer. Following his discharge from the RAAF in 1946, he attempted to start a regional airline but was unable to secure financial backing and government approval. He went back <b>to</b> <b>shearing,</b> and died in 1993 at the age of 69.|$|E

5|$|The oldest fossils {{that fall}} {{within the range of}} the modern coyote date to 0.74–0.85 Ma (million years) in Hamilton Cave, West Virginia; 0.73 Ma in Irvington, California; 0.35–0.48 Ma in Porcupine Cave, Colorado and in Cumberland Cave, Pennsylvania. Modern coyotes arose 1,000 years after the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts, Pleistocene coyotes (C.l. orcutti) were larger and more robust, likely in response to larger competitors and prey. Pleistocene coyotes were likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants, as their teeth were more adapted <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> meat, showing fewer grinding surfaces suited for processing vegetation. Their reduction in size occurred within 1000 years of the Quaternary extinction event, when their large prey died out. Furthermore, Pleistocene coyotes were unable to exploit the big-game hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf (C.dirus), as it was rapidly filled by gray wolves, which likely actively killed off the large coyotes, with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph.|$|E

25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially sitting up in bed, their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward {{the foot of the}} bed. This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} volume (or critical state) {{shear strength}} {{is said to}} be extrinsic to the soil, and independent of the initial density or packing arrangement of the soil grains. In this state the grains being sheared are said to be 'tumbling' over one another, with no significant granular interlock or sliding plane development affecting the resistance <b>to</b> <b>shearing.</b> At this point, no inherited fabric or bonding of the soil grains affects the soil strength.|$|E
25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire nail {{pull out of the}} frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular nail gun models. After finding the ideal nail head size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire nail from pulling out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, it was noted that above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>shearing.</b> The final touch to the original prototype was a special high-carbon alloy designed by a metallurgist that had the perfect combination of stiffness and pliability, giving it the highest possible strength.|$|E

2500|$|The dynamic {{viscosity}} of a fluid expresses its resistance <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> flows, where adjacent layers move parallel {{to each other}} with different speeds. It can be defined through the idealized situation known as a Couette flow, where a layer of fluid is trapped between two horizontal plates, one fixed and one moving horizontally at constant speed [...] This fluid has to be homogeneous in the layer and at different shear stresses. (The plates are assumed to be very large, so that one need not consider what happens near their edges.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Pulmonary {{laceration}} is {{a common}} result of penetrating trauma but may also be caused by blunt trauma; broken ribs may perforate the lung, or the tissue may be torn due <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> forces that result from different rates of acceleration or deceleration of different tissues of the lung. Violent compression of the chest can cause lacerations by rupturing or shearing the lung tissue. [...] Pulmonary laceration may result from blunt and penetrating forces {{that occur in the}} same injury and may be associated with pulmonary contusion. Lacerations of the lung tissue can also occur by compression of the alveoli against the ribs or spine. As with contusions, pulmonary lacerations usually occur near solid structures in the chest such as ribs. Pulmonary laceration is suspected when rib fractures are present.|$|E
2500|$|Bite wounds {{from other}} animals (and rarely humans) {{are a common}} occurrence. [...] Wounds from objects that the animal may step on or run into are also common. [...] Usually these wounds are simple {{lacerations}} {{that can be easily}} cleaned and sutured, sometimes using a local anesthetic. [...] Bite wounds, however, involve compressive and tensile forces in addition <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> forces, and can cause separation of the skin from the underlying tissue and avulsion of underlying muscles. [...] Deep puncture wounds are especially prone to infection. [...] Deeper wounds are assessed under anesthesia and explored, lavaged, and debrided. [...] Primary wound closure is used if all remaining tissue is healthy and free of contamination. [...] Small puncture wounds may be left open, bandaged, and allowed to heal without surgery. [...] A third alternative is delayed primary closure, which involves bandaging and reevaluation and surgery in three to five days.|$|E
2500|$|But in {{addition}} to friction, soil derives significant shear resistance from interlocking of grains. [...] If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend to spread apart from {{each other as they}} are subject to shear strain. The expansion of the particle matrix due <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> was called dilatancy by Osborne Reynolds. If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a distance, y. [...] Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they become looser (their void ratio increases), and their rate of dilation decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. Contractive soils become denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach a critical void ratio.|$|E

6000|$|The great {{principle}} {{of the division of}} labour has been brought to bear on selection. In certain districts (20/12. Wilson in 'Transact. Highland Agricult. Soc.' quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1844 page 29.) [...] "the breeding of bulls is confined to a very limited number of persons, who by devoting their whole attention to this department, are able from year to year to furnish a class of bulls which are steadily improving the general breed of the district." [...] The rearing and letting of choice rams has long been, as is well known, a chief source of profit to several eminent breeders. In parts of Germany this principle is carried with merino sheep to an extreme point. (20/13. Simmonds quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1855 page 637. And for the second quotation see 'Youatt on Sheep' page 171.) So [...] "important is the proper selection of breeding animals considered, that the best flock-masters do not trust to their own judgment or to that of their shepherds, but employ persons called 'sheep-classifiers' who make it their special business to attend to this part of the management of several flocks, and thus to preserve, or if possible to improve, the best qualities of both parents in the lambs." [...] In Saxony, [...] "when the lambs are weaned, each in his turn is placed upon a table that his wool and form may be minutely observed. The finest are selected for breeding and receive a first mark. When they are one year old, and prior <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> them, another close examination of those previously marked takes place: those in which no defect can be found receive a second mark, and the rest are condemned. A few months afterwards a third and last scrutiny is made; the prime rams and ewes receive a third and final mark, but the slightest blemish is sufficient to cause the rejection of the animal." [...] These sheep are bred and valued almost exclusively for the fineness of their wool; and the result corresponds with the labour bestowed on their selection. Instruments have been invented to measure accurately the thickness of the fibres; and [...] "an Austrian fleece has been produced of which twelve hairs equalled in thickness one from a Leicester sheep." ...|$|E

40|$|Osteoblasts respond <b>to</b> both fluid <b>shear</b> and {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH) with a {{rapid increase in}} intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i). Because both stimuli modulate the kinetics of the mechanosensitive cation channel (MSCC), we postulated PTH would enhance the [Ca 2 +]i response <b>to</b> fluid <b>shear</b> by increasing the sensitivity of MSCCs. After a 3 -minute preflow at 1 dyne/cm 2, MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were subjected to various levels of shear and changes in [Ca 2 +]i were assessed using Fura- 2. Pretreatment with 50 nM bovine PTH(1 - 34) [bPTH(1 - 34) ] significantly enhanced the shear magnitude-dependent increase in [Ca 2 +]i. Gadolinium (Gd 3 +), an MSCC blocker, significantly inhibited the mean peak [Ca 2 +]i response <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> and shear + bPTH(1 - 34). Nifedipine (Nif), an L-type voltage-sensitive Ca 2 + channel (VSCC) blocker, also significantly reduced the [Ca 2 +]i response <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> + bPTH(1 - 34), but not <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> alone, suggesting VSCC activation plays an interactive role in the action of these stimuli together. Activation of either the protein kinase C (PKC) or protein kinase A (PKA) pathways with specific agonists indicated that PKC activation did not alter the Ca 2 + response <b>to</b> <b>shear,</b> whereas PKA activation significantly increased the [Ca 2 +]i response to lower magnitudes of shear. bPTH(1 - 34), which activates both pathways, induced the greatest [Ca 2 +]i response at each level of shear, suggesting an interaction of these pathways in this response. These data indicate that PTH significantly enhances the [Ca 2 +]i response <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> primarily via PKA modulation of the MSCC and VSCC...|$|R
