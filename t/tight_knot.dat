True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E

40|$|The {{interplay of}} topological {{constraints}} and Coulomb interactions in static and dynamic properties of charged polymers is investigated by numerical simulations and scaling arguments. In {{the absence of}} screening, the long-range interaction localizes irreducible topological constraints into <b>tight</b> molecular <b>knots,</b> while composite constraints are factored and separated. Even when the forces are screened, <b>tight</b> <b>knots</b> may survive as local (or even global) equilibria, {{as long as the}} overall rigidity of the polymer is dominated by the Coulomb interactions. As entanglements involving <b>tight</b> <b>knots</b> are not easy to eliminate, their presence greatly influences the relaxation times of the system. In particular, we find that <b>tight</b> <b>knots</b> in open polymers are removed by diffusion along the chain, rather than by opening up. The knot diffusion coefficient actually decreases with its charge density, and for highly charged polymers the knot's position appears frozen. Comment: Revtex 4, 9 pages, 9 eps figure...|$|R

In selected stands, spruce trees were cut down and their length, stem thickness, height to the crown base and stem diameters at every 1 m along the length of merchantable bole were measured. The diameter of knots was measured and they were classified according to their healthiness and the degree of their tightness with the surrounding wood. The relative knot diameters were calculated and the relative height of their location on stem was determined. In total on sample trees there were analysed 1070 knots, of which sound knots (close to 75 %) and tight (more than 60 %) prevailed. Sound and <b>tight</b> <b>knots</b> had largest diameters, relative diameters and relative heights of location on merchantable boles.

60|$|He {{walked away}} through the city, beside the Seine and over it, {{and took the}} {{direction}} of the Rue d'Enfer. The day had the softness of early spring; but the weather was gray and humid. Newman found himself in a part of Paris which he little knew--a region of convents and prisons, of streets bordered by long dead walls and traversed by a few wayfarers. At the intersection of two of these streets stood the house of the Carmelites--a dull, plain edifice, with a high-shouldered blank wall all round it. From without Newman could see its upper windows, its steep roof and its chimneys. But these things revealed no symptoms of human life; the place looked dumb, deaf, inanimate. The pale, dead, discolored wall stretched beneath it, far down the empty side street--a vista without a human figure. Newman stood there a long time; there were no passers; he was free to gaze his fill. This seemed the goal of his journey; it was what he had come for. It was a strange satisfaction, and yet it was a satisfaction; the barren stillness of the place seemed to be his own release from ineffectual longing. It told him that the woman within was lost beyond recall, and that the days and years of the future would pile themselves above her like the huge immovable slab of a tomb. These days and years, in this place, would always be just so gray and silent. Suddenly, from the thought of their seeing him stand there, again the charm utterly departed. He would never stand there again; it was gratuitous dreariness. He turned away with a heavy heart, but with a heart lighter than the one he had brought. Everything was over, and he too at last could rest. He walked down through narrow, winding streets {{to the edge of the}} Seine again, and there he saw, close above him, the soft, vast towers of Notre Dame. He crossed one of the bridges and stood a moment in the empty place before the great cathedral; then he went in beneath the grossly-imaged portals. He wandered some distance up the nave and sat down in the splendid dimness. He sat a long time; he heard far-away bells chiming off, at long intervals, to the rest of the world. He was very tired; this was the best place he could be in. He said no prayers; he had no prayers to say. He had nothing to be thankful for, and he had nothing to ask; nothing to ask, because now he must take care of himself. But a great cathedral offers a very various hospitality, and Newman sat in his place, because while he was there he was out of the world. The most unpleasant thing that had ever happened to him had reached its formal conclusion, as it were; he could close the book and put it away. He leaned his head for a long time on the chair in front of him; when he took it up he felt that he was himself again. Somewhere in his mind, a <b>tight</b> <b>knot</b> seemed to have loosened. He thought of the Bellegardes; he had almost forgotten them. He remembered them as people he had meant to do something to. He gave a groan as he remembered what he had meant to do; he was annoyed at having meant to do it; the bottom, suddenly, had fallen out of his revenge. Whether it was Christian charity or unregenerate good nature--what it was, in the background of his soul--I don't pretend to say; but Newman's last thought was that of course he would let the Bellegardes go. If he had spoken it aloud he would have said that he didn't want to hurt them. He was ashamed of having wanted to hurt them. They had hurt him, but such things were really not his game. At last he got up and came out of the darkening church; not with the elastic step of a man who had won a victory or taken a resolve, but strolling soberly, like a good-natured man who is still a little ashamed.|$|E
40|$|We give a short {{proof that}} if a non-trivial band sum of two knots results in a <b>tight</b> fibered <b>knot,</b> then the band sum is a {{connected}} sum. In particular, this means that any prime knot obtained by a non-trivial band sum is not tight fibered. Since a positive L-space <b>knot</b> is <b>tight</b> fibered, a non-trivial band sum never yields an L-space knot. Consequently, any knot obtained by a non-trivial band sum cannot admit a finite surgery.

40|$|New {{results on}} the groundstate energy of <b>tight,</b> {{magnetic}} <b>knots</b> are presented. Magnetic knots are defined as tubular embeddings of the magnetic field in an ideal, perfectly conducting, incompressible fluid. An orthogonal, curvilinear coordinate system is introduced and the magnetic energy {{is determined by the}} poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field. Standard minimization of the magnetic energy is carried out under the usual assumptions of volume- and flux-preserving flow, with the additional constraints that the tube cross-section remains circular and that the knot length (ropelength) is independent from internal field twist (framing). Under these constraints the minimum energy is determined analytically by a new, exact expression, function of ropelength and framing. Groundstate energy levels of <b>tight</b> <b>knots</b> are determined from ropelength data obtained by the SONO tightening algorithm developed by Pieranski (Pieranski, 1998) and collaborators. Results for torus knots are compared with previous work done by Chui & Moffatt (1995), and the groundstate energy spectrum of the first prime knots (up to 10 crossings) is presented and analyzed in detail. These results demonstrate that ropelength and framing determine the spectrum of magnetic <b>knots</b> in <b>tight</b> configuration. Comment: 26 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
