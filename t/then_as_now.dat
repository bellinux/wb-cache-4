5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much <b>then,</b> <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much <b>then,</b> <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, the City proper—the area bounded by the City {{wall and the}} River Thames—was {{only a part of}} London, {{covering}} some , and home to about 80,000 people, or one sixth of London's inhabitants. The City was surrounded by a ring of inner suburbs where most Londoners lived. The City was <b>then,</b> <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> the commercial heart of the capital, and was the largest market and busiest port in England, dominated by the trading and manufacturing classes.|$|E

5|$|After graduating a Bachelor of Arts, Tarr was {{articled}} to the solicitors firm of Owston, Dickinson, Simpson, and Bigg in Leicester, {{and also}} joined the Leicester Tigers, <b>then</b> <b>as</b> <b>now</b> {{considered one of}} the strongest clubs in the country. He scored 72 points in 94 appearances. In 1913, having been dropped by England four years earlier, he was surprised to be called up again to play Scotland on 15 March at Twickenham. Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance. England, meanwhile, only managed a 3–0 victory, but it was enough to regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam.|$|E
5|$|Llanbadarn Fawr was {{the focus}} of the English forces {{assembled}} in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By this time the rector was invariably an absentee cleric; John de Camera, Rector 1329–1334 was also canon of St David's, Hereford and Abergwili, and was a government clerk. <b>Then,</b> <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> such a large and remote charge invited pluralism and non-residence. There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the rector was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{repertory}} in the 1960s {{combined the}} standard operatic works and less familiar pieces. The five composers whose works were given most frequently were Verdi, Puccini, Wagner, Mozart and Richard Strauss; {{the next most}} performed composer was Britten. Rarities performed in the 1960s included operas by Handel and Janáček (neither composer's works being as common in the opera house <b>then</b> <b>as</b> <b>now),</b> and works by Gluck (Iphigénie en Tauride), Poulenc (The Carmelites), Ravel (L'heure espagnole) and Tippett (King Priam). There was also a celebrated production of Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron in the 1965–66 and 1966–67 seasons. In the mainstream repertoire, a highlight of the decade was Franco Zeffirelli's production of Tosca in 1964 with Callas, Renato Cioni and Gobbi. Among the guest conductors who appeared at Covent Garden during the 1960s were Otto Klemperer, Pierre Boulez, Claudio Abbado and Colin Davis. Guest singers included Jussi Björling, Mirella Freni, Sena Jurinac, Irmgard Seefried and Astrid Varnay.|$|E

50|$|Dario Castello, a wind {{player at}} St. Mark's Venice {{in the early}} 17th century had two books of Sonate Concertate {{published}} in 1621 and 1629. The sonatas of 1-4 parts with bass continuo often specify trombones, as well as cornett, violin and bassoon. The numerous reprints during the 17th century affirm his popularity <b>then,</b> <b>as</b> perhaps <b>now.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{old house}} creaked and groaned {{in the blast}} {{as if it would}} come down, and the men taking shelter there looked out to sea in silence. The bronzed {{veterans}} there knew full well that at that hour many a despairing cry was being uttered, many a hand was stretched wildly, helplessly, and hopelessly from the midst of the boiling surf, and many a soul was passing into eternity. They would have been ready <b>then,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> to have risked life and limb to save fellow-creatures from the sea, but ordinary boats they knew could not live in such a storm.|$|R
5|$|<b>Then</b> <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> Madagascar was an island, having {{separated}} from the Indian subcontinent less than 20 million years earlier. It was drifting northwards but still 10–15° more southerly in latitude than it is today. The prevailing climate of the time was semi-arid, with pronounced seasonality in temperature and rainfall. Majungasaurus inhabited a coastal flood plain cut by many sandy river channels. Strong geological evidence suggests the occurrence of periodic debris flows through these channels {{at the beginning of}} the wet season, burying the carcasses of organisms killed during the preceding dry season and providing for their exceptional preservation as fossils. Sea levels in the area were rising throughout the Maastrichtian, and would continue to do so into the Paleocene Epoch, so Majungasaurus may have roamed coastal environments like tidal flats as well. The neighboring Berivotra Formation represents the contemporaneous marine environment.|$|E

50|$|The {{assumption}} {{of any such}} new name would take place formally at baptism, in which the catechumen, <b>then</b> probably <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> had {{to be addressed by}} some distinctive appellation, and the imposition of a new name at baptism had become general. Every child had necessarily to receive some name or other, and when baptism followed soon after birth this allowed public recognition of the choice made.|$|R

25|$|WFIE {{was granted}} a {{construction}} permit on June 10, 1953, and began broadcasting on November 15, 1953 on analog UHF channel 62. The station, Indiana's sixth, was originally co-owned by Jesse, Isadore, and Oscar Fine.

25|$|With the X-1, {{flight testing}} at Muroc began to assume two {{distinct}} identities. Highly experimental research programs—such as the X-3, X-4, X-5 and XF-92A—were typically flown {{in conjunction with}} the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, and were conducted in a methodical fashion to answer largely theoretical questions. <b>Then,</b> <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> the great bulk of flight testing at Muroc focused on evaluations of the capabilities of aircraft and systems proposed for the operational inventory.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s Europe {{was still}} for most {{purposes}} divided into national markets and 72% of the 204s produced {{were sold in}} France. Principal export markets within Europe were West Germany – Germany being <b>then</b> <b>as</b> <b>now</b> Europe's largest 'national' market – and Benelux. However, most western European markets took some 204s. In Africa the 204 never achieved the popularity of its larger siblings. Nevertheless, the 204 was not entirely unknown outside Europe.|$|E

25|$|In ancient times, abortion, {{along with}} infanticide, was {{considered}} {{in the context of}} family planning, gender selection, population control, and the property rights of the patriarch. Rarely were the rights of the prospective mother, much less the prospective child, taken into consideration. Although generally legal, the morality of abortion, birth control and child abandonment (as a form of infanticide) was sometimes discussed. <b>Then,</b> <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> these discussions often concerned the nature of man, the existence of a soul, when life begins, and the beginning of human personhood.|$|E
25|$|The van Eycks' Ghent Altarpiece, <b>then</b> <b>as</b> <b>now</b> {{famous as}} a supreme example of Early Netherlandish {{painting}} and already a major tourist attraction, just restored in 1550, was saved by dismantling it and hiding {{it in the}} cathedral tower.

When a larger attack was made at night two days later the iconoclasts had provided themselves with a tree trunk as a battering ram, and succeeded in breaking through the doors.|$|E
25|$|The specialists {{fell into}} three categories. First there were species describers, then specialists in species {{recognition}} and then specialists in gross taxonomy. There were however considerable degrees of overlap. Also <b>then,</b> <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> few could entirely resist {{the lure of}} groups other than their own, and this was especially true of those in small countries where they were the sole 'expert', and many famous specialists in one order also worked on others. Hence, for instance, many works which began as butterfly faunas were completed as general regional works, often collaboratively.|$|E
