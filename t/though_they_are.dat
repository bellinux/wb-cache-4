5|$|Many {{animals are}} highly {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat camouflage. Moving objects with disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Music for Star Wars: Dark Forces {{was mostly}} {{original}} works composed by Clint Bajakian, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> based on cues from John Williams' original Star Wars works through {{the utilization of}} the iMUSE system to create interactive music. The game also features full speech and sound effects in stereo.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{have been}} a staple of popular culture {{for as long as}} their cousins the dinosaurs, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> usually not {{featured}} as prominently in films, literature or other art. Additionally, while the depiction of dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in paleontology, a mainly outdated picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} inhabits areas with significant cover from grasses or heavy undergrowth, {{and close to}} water bodies. It generally keeps away from human-inhabited areas. <b>Though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> habitat generalists, {{four-horned antelope}}s mostly occur in open, dry, deciduous forests in hilly terrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands are}} {{completely}} crossed by three narrow channels which resemble and are called rivers, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> inlets of the sea. The wildlife {{is much like}} that of New Guinea, 150 miles (240 km) away, which he supposes was once connected by a land bridge. Most flowers are green; large and showy flowers are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|Among Chacoan mammals are the {{plentiful}} coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also {{live within}} the canyon, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant.|$|E

As the team's historian, Gordon Macey, lists the statistics from wartime matches {{such as the}} two London Combination leagues, the Wartime League and the Football League War Cup {{as well as the}} abandoned 1939–40 season; they are included even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> normally considered unofficial.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with mouse lemurs, such as M.murinus, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> typically {{found higher in}} the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the albums produced, music from the original soundtracks of the SaGa games has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Books are available for Romancing SaGa 3, Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song, SaGa Frontier, SaGa Frontier II, and Unlimited SaGa. The compositions from Unlimited SaGa were rewritten by Tadaomi Idogawa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. The music for the other books was written by Asako Niwa for piano solos of similar difficulty.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, {{ambulances}} are designed to meet local conditions, being built using intermediate technology. Ambulances can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered ambulances can be particularly useful in regions that are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with sidecars (or motorcycle ambulances) are also used, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road ambulances. The level of care provided by these ambulances varies between merely providing transport to a medical clinic to providing on-scene and continuing care during transport.|$|E
5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> still convincing and realistic.|$|E

5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not part of the original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{complexes}} tend to {{be similar}} to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes {{tend to be}} rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic − is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.|$|E
5|$|Some very fragmentary fossils {{belonging}} to pteranodontian pterosaurs, and possibly Pteranodon itself, {{have also been}} found on the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States. For example, some bone fragments from the Mooreville Formation of Alabama and the Merchantville Formation of Delaware {{may have come from}} Pteranodon, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too incomplete to make a definite identification. Some remains from Japan have also been tentatively attributed to Pteranodon, but their distance from its known Western Interior Seaway habitat makes this identification unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris spores are {{narrowly}} ellipsoid, {{and measure}} from 9 to 14 by 4 to 5.5 micrometres (μm). The spores are white, and contain small granules. The spores are borne on basidia which measure 50 to 70 by 7 to 8 μm, with four spores on each basidium. The downy covering {{of the stem}} {{is made up of}} thick-walled hairs, each measuring 15 to 60 by 3 to 7 μm, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often swollen towards the base. The sclerotium measures from 1.5 to 3 by 0.5 μm, and is a pale yellow colour. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.|$|E
