40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make thread milling cutters {{has shown that}} most of milling cutters are produced with the helical flutes with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °. Thus, thread milling cutters, made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter,</b> made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development. Dependences are obtained for the model with a variation of the five factors (external diameter d, step profiles, P, rake γтц, clearance α, inclination angle of helical flutes ω) for thread milling cutters, made of cemented carbide and according to the model that extends the range of variation factors (d, P, γтц, ω) according to GOST 1336 - 77. Thus, this model to have the angles of the tooth profile of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes can be used both to obtain the angles profile β 1 and β 2 {{in a wide range of}} varying tool parameters for all types of tool materials, and to broaden the possibilities for calculation of parameters according to GOST 1336 - 77. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{established}} that the lead and back angles of teeth, angle of helical flutes available require for correcting a thread profile of milling cutter teeth to machine a thread with an appropriate degree of accuracy. Based on the previously developed geometrical model an experiment is conducted to calculate the values of tooth profile angles of thread milling cutters with helical flutes at variation of five factors in the established factorial space. When planning the experiment the full central composite draft has been elaborated in the coded form for five factors at three levels {{taking into account the}} orthogonality and the impossibility to conduct repeatedly experiments in the chosen points. As the conducted researches have shown that a nature of dependence of the tooth profile angle values on design and geometrical parameters of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is nonlinear, the second degree of an approximating polynom is accepted. As a consequence, to assess all the coefficients of the polynom of the second degree the factors have been varied at three levels. Based on the method of planning the mathematical models are developed to calculate the tooth profile angles of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes allowing to obtain the values of angles depending on a pitch of thread, a cutter diameter, a rake angle, an angle of lead of helical flutes, and a back angle. In terms of making manual calculations the obtained polynoms are cumbersome, however when using the model in CAD systems of thread milling cutters {{there is no need to}} simplify it. The represented mathematical models can be chosen as starting ones at calculation of profile angles when designing the thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Calculation of the profile angles of the <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> under study made according to polynoms obtained for all combinations of factors has shown that an error of calculated values in comparison with the values obtained using a geometrical model does not exceed 1. 3 % that makes 0 ° 24 ' and is no more than a tolerance for a half of tooth profile angle according to GOST 1336 - 77. </p...|$|E

The simulation kernel enables to continually subtract the swept volume of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> undergoing helical movement from the workpiece and to calculate the virtual workpiece (VWP).

The force model is composed of surface and edge force components. The cutting edge is modelled from the geometry of the milling cutter, including the helix angle and thread tooth profile. To determine the specific cutting force coefficients for surface and edge force components, the cutting forces are measured with a dynamometer along a horizontal linear path and compared with the calculated force {{by means of the}} exact uncut chip thickness which results from the modelling of chip volume per tooth at a prescribed time on the <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter.</b> The run-out errors are considered to estimate the uneven cutting force distribution for each tooth. The measured cutting forces for the brass workpiece material (CuZn 37) for a linear path shows quite good agreement with the simulated cutting forces.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread milling cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct tooth profile thread milling cutters to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|E

Evaluation of the contour quality of the CABE <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is crucial in enhancing machining accuracy and eciency. In order adequately to describe {{the shape of the}} clamped cutter, the centre-line axis of the minimum circumscribed cylinder of the cylinder shank is taken as the referenced datum axis. The minimum circumscribed concave-arc revolving surface and the minimum circumscribed spherical surface are carefully derived in sequence. The pro®le errors and tolerances are estimated. The quality of the CABE <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is assured by using the proposed modelling procedure, and several numerical examples are presented to illustrate its eVectiveness. The results indicate that the present method is feasible and can be extended to enhance the quality of various revolving cutters...|$|R
