5000|$|For the 1986-1993 model years, {{there were}} mainly three trim levels {{available}} in North America: Base, SE-5, LX, and LE-5. The base model came with standard 14-inch steel wheels {{and not much}} else besides the basics (this did not include a rear step bumper). The SE-5 was the [...] "sporty" [...] trim level, with added features such as a tachometer, side-mounted truck mirrors, a rear step bumper, an AM/FM stereo, sporty white/black wheels, white-lettered Bridgestone SF Radial tires (which have long since been discontinued), and a prominent stripe graphic kit, the latter being the most easily distinguishable feature of the SE-5. The LX was the more luxurious trim level, with standard features that made it the most well-equipped <b>trim</b> line <b>of</b> the <b>bunch.</b> Such added features included air conditioning, power steering, power brakes, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with cassette deck and equalizer, center console, locking glove box, and chrome trim throughout (interior door handles and window cranks, taillight bezels, chrome added trim {{on the sides of the}} body, a chrome rear step bumper, a chrome strip on the front bumper, and the same steel wheels that came with the SE-5 but with a chrome finish). For the 1990 model year, the LX trim level was replaced with the LE-5, which combined a hybrid of styling and features from both the LX and SE-5.|$|R
40|$|Considering {{growth of}} a vicinal face from solution, by {{carrying}} out Monte Carlo simulation, we study step bunching induced by flow of atoms in solution. For simplicity, we use two-diffusional solution field and one-dimensional vicinal face. When the flow of atoms in solution is in the step-down direction, the vicinal face is unstable and step bunching occurs. When the flow is fast, small bunches are formed in the inital stage. The size <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> increases by coalescence <b>of</b> small <b>bunches.</b> In a later stage, coalescence and separation <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> repeatedly occur, and the size <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> is saturated. When the flow is slow, the bunches grow from the modulation of step density in the initial stage. The size <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> increases with time as ∼ t 1 / 3...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explain the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> around kink {{points in the}} tax schedule, and {{investigate}} whether such bunching may be occurring at the kink point created by the Norwegian wealth tax. I conclude that {{there seems to be}} no evidence <b>of</b> such <b>bunching,</b> after examining the distribution of taxpayers around the kink point in several ways. Theoretically, bunching at kink points should occur when there is an increase in the marginal tax rate, as the change in marginal payoff will lead to an uneven distribution of taxpayers around the kink point. This could also be further affected by different assets being treated differently for tax purposes. I present such a model, explaining the various mechanisms that affect the amount <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> and explain how it can occur. There have been other studies <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> with some that found evidence <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> and some that did not. Very few such studies have examined wealth taxation, with the exception of a recent Swedish study (Seim 2012) that found evidence <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> around a kink point created by the Swedish wealth tax. No such studies have been previously done for Norway, however. Examining tax data for the year 2012, I observe that the distribution of taxpayers appears to have no trace <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> with various methods for observing potential bunching leading to the same conclusion. Furthermore, a look at the composition of wealth gave no indication that taxpayers responded to the wealth tax at all around the kink. It is particularly difficult to point to any strong reason for the different findings, given the similarity between Norway and Sweden in most aspects related to taxation. There are some methodological differences however, that are worth taking into account...|$|R
