5|$|Gotcha is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari and released in October 1973. It {{was the fourth}} game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze,</b> which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if they do, a point is scored, and the players reset positions. The game emits an electronic beeping sound, which increases in pace as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating him <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> of consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by {{a quartet of}} multi-colored ghosts. The goal {{of the game is}} to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the next one in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E
5|$|Labyrinth: The Computer Game is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} {{game in which}} the player maneuvers a character <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> while solving puzzles and evading dangers. It is an adaptation of the 1986 film Labyrinth, many of whose events and characters are reproduced in the game. However, {{it does not follow}} the plot of the film. At the beginning, the player enters their name, sex and favorite color: the last two fields determine the appearance of the player character. Afterward, a short text-based adventure sequence unfolds, wherein the player enters a movie theater to watch the film Labyrinth. The game then changes to a graphic adventure format. Jareth, the main antagonist, appears on the projection screen and transports the protagonist to a labyrinthine prison.|$|E

5|$|Tank is an arcade game {{developed}} by Kee Games, {{a subsidiary of}} Atari, and released in November 1974. It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property {{developed by}} Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, in a central minefield. Each player controls their tank {{with a pair of}} joysticks, moving them forwards and back to drive, reverse, and steer, and firing shells with a button to attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
5|$|After {{restoring}} the Beanstar, Mario and Luigi travel to Joke's End {{to make the}} exchange, once again traveling <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> filled with puzzles to be solved. Bowletta refuses to hand over Peach, but Luigi, disguised in Peach's spare dress, ends up being taken in Peach's stead. He escapes from the repaired Koopa Cruiser, reclaiming the Beanstar in the process. The brothers return to Beanbean Castle Town, finding it under attack by Bowletta using Bowser's flying castle. The brothers and Prince Peasley fly up to it to stop Cackletta. Mario and Luigi battle past the Koopalings, but before they can reach Bowletta the brothers encounter Fawful yet again. A fierce battle between the three ensues with the brothers coming out on top. But Fawful plays a dirty trick and attacks the brothers while they weren't paying attention. However, Prince Peasly comes in and send Fawful flying, seemingly defeating him. The Bros. finally confront Bowletta and another epic battle begins. Feigning defeat, she tricks the brothers and swallows them. After waking up in her belly, the brothers battle and defeat Cackletta's soul, exorcising her from Bowser's body. The two are regurgitated and Bowser returns to normal. Afterwards, the brothers escape the castle before it explodes from a bomb set by Peasley. The explosion sends the castle falling into the ocean. Exhausted from their vacation, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toadsworth decide {{to head back to}} the Mushroom Kingdom. Before they can leave, Peasley brings a farewell gift for them to take home, which is Bowser, who regained his memory. The gang then returns home, and a movie based on their adventure is being shown at the Yoshi Theatre.|$|E

25|$|The player {{controls}} Pac-Man <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> {{of various}} dots, known as Pac-Dots, {{as well as}} four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal {{of the game is}} to consume all the Pac-Dots in a stage in order to proceed to the next one. Between some stages, one of three intermission animations plays. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touch Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default—DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points to 15,000 or 20,000, or disable the bonus life altogether. The number of lives can be set to 1 life only or up to five lives maximum. High score cannot exceed 999,990 points; players may exceed that score, but the game keeps the last 6 digits.|$|E
25|$|Besieged by reporters, Ethan checks into a motel. He {{receives}} {{a letter from}} the killer, which leads to a shoebox containing a mobile phone, a handgun, and five origami figures. The killer calls him and explains that each of the figures contains instructions on how to complete a trial, which will allow him to determine how much Ethan loves his son. If he chooses to complete them, then he will receive a piece of the address where Shaun is held. The trials force Ethan to make increasingly difficult moral decisions, including driving against traffic at high speeds on the highway, crawling <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> composed of broken glass and active electrical pylons, cutting off one of his fingers, breaking into the apartment of a drug dealer and murdering him in front of his family, and drinking a glass of poison on camera. While undergoing the trials, he meets Madison Paige, a journalist who occasionally checks into the motel to deal with her chronic insomnia. She sympathizes with Ethan's plight, and decides to conduct her own investigation into the Origami Killer.|$|E
25|$|Mata Nui learns of Bara Magna's past, his creators the Great Beings, and {{his destiny}} to reunite the planet with its moons Aqua Magna and Bota Magna to {{recreate}} the once-plentiful Spherus Magna. He begins his quest by travelling <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> occupied with booby-traps (using the map he found as a guide), where he uncovers an unstable power source. After convincing the Glatorian and Agori to let him use the prototype robot that they use as their Mega-Village, Mata Nui places the power source, the Mask of Life and his spirit inside it, and as the vessel, begins the process of reuniting Bara Magna with its satellites. Later, Makuta Teridax - in Mata Nui's old body - touches down on Bara Magna after sensing Mata Nui's presence. Planning to conquer the planet and eventually {{the rest of the}} universe, he offers Mata Nui the chance to join him. He refuses, and the two robots do battle. On the ground, several Rahkshi and Skakdi under Teridax's command exit the Matoran Universe via his heel, followed by Tahu, Takanuva and other Toa. The Makuta's forces are soon joined by the Skrall, who together, battle the Glatorian and Agori. Meanwhile, the Mask of Life reduces Tahu into his original Toa Mata form so he can don the Golden Armor; a weapon originally devised to destroy the Makuta species if they were to ever betray Mata Nui. Teridax notices and scatters the armor across the desert with an energy blast. With help from the Glatorian Gresh, Tahu and Takanuva retrieve the armor back from their enemies. When Tahu bestows it, a wave of energy is unleashed that incinerates all the Kraata powering the Rahkshi armor, leaving the Skakdi and Skrall greatly outnumbered. Mata Nui notices Teridax's hesitation in sensing the loss of his Rahkshi and sees a chance to swing his body into the oncoming path of a rock fragment from Aqua Magna. It crashes into the Makuta's head and damages the robot's core processor, killing the tyrant for good. Mata Nui completes his destiny of reforming Spherus Magna, but the strain is too great as his body plummets to the ground. The Toa and Glatorian arrive at the crash-site to find Mata Nui speaking from inside the undamaged Mask of Life. He asks them to seek out the Great Beings as his final wish before deciding to stay dormant within the mask. The Toa, Matoran, Glatorian, Agori and all other beings from both worlds now begin a new life on Spherus Magna.|$|E

5000|$|Guardic {{is unique}} in that the player can choose stages, which are {{connected}} by <b>a</b> <b>maze.</b> Each stage is a non-scrollable single screen and has 1 to 3 groups of different enemies. The player can [...] "buy" [...] ship power-ups like speed, weaponry, and special powers before each stage—a departure from the traditional scrolling-shooter power-up system. In {{the end of each}} stage, the ship could safely fly <b>through</b> <b>a</b> scrollable <b>maze</b> to another stage.|$|R
500|$|Many early AI {{programs}} {{used the}} same basic algorithm. To achieve some goal (like winning a game or proving a theorem), they proceeded step by step towards it (by making a move or a deduction) as if searching <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze,</b> backtracking whenever they reached a dead end. This paradigm was called [...] "reasoning as search".|$|E
500|$|Beck {{continued}} {{to explore new}} guitar sounds and used a recently purchased Sho-Bud steel guitar to create the slide fills for the song.

500|$|On 2 June, {{the launch}} cleared Cape York, the extreme {{northern}} {{point of the}} Australian continent. Bligh turned south-west, and steered <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> of shoals, reefs, sandbanks, and small islands. The route taken was not the Endeavour Strait, but a narrower southerly passage later known as the Prince of Wales Channel. At 20:00 that evening, they reached the open Arafura Sea, still [...] from Coupang. The following eight days encompassed {{some of the toughest}} travel of the entire journey and, by 11 June, many were close to collapse. The next day, the coast of Timor was sighted: [...] "It is not possible for me to describe the pleasure which the blessing of the sight of this land diffused among us", Bligh wrote. On 14 June, with a makeshift Union Jack hoisted, they sailed into Coupang harbour.|$|E
500|$|Gotcha was not commercially successful; later {{sources have}} {{described}} it as receiving a [...] "lukewarm reception" [...] and [...] "arousing little more than controversy". Ralph Baer, however, claims it sold 3,000 units. Additionally, despite Gotchas prominence as Atari's fourth game and their second game not related to Pong, the 1973 arcade video game market was largely dominated by Pong clones; while Pong was the fourth arcade video game ever produced, Gotcha was approximately the twentieth, with nearly all the other games released before and after Gotcha {{through the end of}} the year Pong clones. Gotcha was the first arcade maze video game, though non-commercial maze-based video games had been developed as early as the 1959 Mouse in the Maze computer game. In 1977, Atari produced a version of Gotcha for the Atari 2600—then called the Atari VCS—named Maze Craze. Developed by Rick Maurer, the game featured one or two players controlling policemen chasing a robber <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze,</b> with added sound, graphics, and adjustable movement speeds and visibility of the maze. Maze Craze was a [...] "highly popular" [...] game on the system.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 July, Hitler summoned Kluge and Manstein to his {{headquarters}} at Rastenburg in East Prussia. Two days earlier, the Western Allies had invaded Sicily. The threat of further Allied landings in Italy or along southern France made Hitler believe it was essential to move forces from Kursk to Italy and to discontinue the offensive. Kluge welcomed the news, as {{he was aware that}} the Soviets were initiating a massive offensive against his sector, but Manstein was less welcoming. Manstein's forces had just spent a week fighting <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> of defensive works and he believed they {{were on the verge of}} breaking through to more open terrain, which would allow him to engage and destroy the Soviet armoured reserves in a mobile battle. Manstein stated, [...] "On no account should we let go of the enemy until the mobile reserves he [...] committed [...] completely beaten." [...] Hitler agreed to temporarily allow the continuance of the offensive in the southern part of the salient, but the following day he ordered Manstein's reserve – the XXIV Panzer Corps – to move south to support the 1st Panzer Army. This removed the force Manstein believed was needed to succeed.|$|E
