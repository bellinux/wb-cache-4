As with all other daimyō families, the Satake clan was relieved of its title in 1871.|$|E

The integrated circuit has eight levels: (1) a 300 nm thick Nb ground plane, (2) a 2 μm layer of SiO2 <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> <b>the</b> microstripline dielectric, (3) a 200 nm Nb film <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> <b>the</b> lower electrode of the Josephson junctions, (4) a 3 nm metal oxide layer <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> <b>the</b> Josephson tunneling barrier, (5) a 100 nm Nb junction counter electrode (6) a 300 nm SiO2 film with windows for contacts {{to the counter}} electrode, (7) a 400 nm film of Nb that connects the junction counter electrodes, and (8) a 100 nm resistive film <b>that</b> <b>forms</b> <b>the</b> stripline terminations.|$|R

5|$|During the Pacific War, the US Navy's fast battleships had mainly {{been used}} to escort the groups of {{aircraft}} carriers <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> United States Pacific Fleet's main striking force.

5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> cluster. That is, the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of globular clusters are then used to study the evolution of the Milky Way as a whole.|$|E

5|$|The {{impacting}} object {{probably had}} a mass {{comparable to that of}} Mars, and the impact probably occurred {{near the end of the}} period of giant impacts. The collision kicked into orbit some of the impactor's mantle, which then coalesced into the Moon.

5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{also has}} {{significant}} history with rail transport, as {{the location of}} two major regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at {{what is now the}} SUNY System Administration Building. In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country.|$|E

5|$|Another of Hill's {{concerns}} was {{the availability}} of open spaces for poor people. She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save London's Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from being built on. She {{was one of the}} three founders of the National Trust, set up to preserve places of historic interest or natural beauty for the enjoyment of the British public. She was a founder member of the Charity Organisation Society (now the charity Family Action) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> basis for modern social work. She {{was a member of the}} Royal Commission on the Poor Laws in 1905.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the site of Fort Jackson had become the {{footings}} for a new railroad bridge, constructed in 1903. Three years later, a road bridge was constructed just to the west. A brickworks was also located nearby, sometimes utilizing the clay <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> bastions of Fort Runyon as raw material for the bricks that would later go into the walls of Washington homes. These projects obliterated what little trace there was of Fort Jackson.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the New Zealand and Australian Division, {{under the}} command of Major General Alexander Godley, was being formed for {{operations}} in the Dardanelles, and the battalion was attached to the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, one of the two infantry brigades (the other was the Australian 4th brigade) <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the division. In April, the division, now part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) embarked for Gallipoli. The Wellington Battalion was landed at Anzac Cove on the afternoon of 25 April, and made its way up to Plugge's Plateau.|$|E

He later served as the company's vice president. Byrd also did business in real estate and construction. Byrd was active with service organizations. In 1962, he {{became a member of the}} Loyal Order of the Moose. Byrd organized the College Park Rotary Club and served as its first president. Byrd was a member of the Defense Orientation Conference Association (DOCA), an organization which educates civilians on the Defense Department's programs and policies.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{alleged that}} it {{contacted}} Warner Bros. before production began in 2005, {{and told the}} studio that it had violated Fox's 1991 and 1994 deals with Gordon. Warner Bros. claimed that it was originally unaware of either deal, and that in 2005 Fox had declined to produce the Hayter screenplay <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> basis of the production. Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros. The studio's motion to dismiss the case in August 2008 {{was rejected by the}} judge.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Taurus was {{identified}} with Zeus, who assumed {{the form of}} a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as Io, a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife Hera, Zeus changed Io into {{the form of a}} heifer. Greek mythographer Acusilaus marks the bull Taurus as the same <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> myth of the Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Heracles.|$|E

5|$|In September 1975, the 24th Infantry Division was {{reactivated}} at Fort Stewart, Georgia, {{as part of}} {{the program}} to build a 16-division US Army force. Because the Regular Army could not field a full division at Fort Stewart, the 24th had the 48th Infantry Brigade of the Georgia Army National Guard assigned to it as a round-out unit in place of its 3rd Brigade. Targeted for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) role, the 24th Division was reorganized as a mechanized division in 1979. It was one of several divisions equipped with new M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> core of the U.S. Army's heavily armored mechanized force for the 15 years that followed.|$|E
5|$|In his {{commentary}} on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen wrote {{of the importance of}} choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority <b>that</b> <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his {{commentary on}} the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.|$|E
