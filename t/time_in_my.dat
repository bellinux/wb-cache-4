5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I {{used to always}} {{feel the need to}} be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me from time to <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

25|$|There was a <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{life when}} I wasn't popular and {{accepted}} by kids in school. I was {{made fun of}} with braces and kinky hair, and being from a multicultural family, etcetera... And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s heralded a rebirth in Vaughan's {{recording}} activity. In 1971, Bob Shad, who {{had worked}} with her as producer at Mercury Records, asked her to record for his new record label, Mainstream Records. Basie veteran Ernie Wilkins arranged and conducted her first Mainstream album A <b>Time</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Life in November 1971. In April 1972, Vaughan recorded a collection of ballads written, arranged and conducted by Michel Legrand. Arrangers Legrand, Peter Matz, Jack Elliott and Allyn Ferguson teamed up for Vaughan's third Mainstream album, Feelin' Good. Vaughan recorded Live in Japan, a live album in Tokyo with her trio in September 1973.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, I cannot {{find in the}} Canadian Bill of Rights {{anything}} clearly {{showing that}} Parliament intended to establish concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms some overriding general principles to be enforced by the courts against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in statutes existing at the <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> opinion, Parliament did nothing more than instruct the courts to construe and apply those laws {{in accordance with the}} principles enunciated in the Bill on the basis that the recognized rights and freedoms did exist, not that they were to be brought into existence by the courts.|$|E

500|$|Despite Avro Canada's {{success in}} {{producing}} the CF-100, Canada's first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), aircraft development had {{proven to be}} a time-consuming and expensive process. The projected next generation aircraft, Canada's first supersonic jet interceptor, the CF-105 Arrow, was a more daunting project in terms of financial commitment and a leap in technological prowess.

Reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn wrote of Hobart in 1922, [...] "for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> recollection, and the last for that matter, the Vice President was recognized as somebody, {{as a part of}} the Administration, and {{as a part of the}} body over which he presided".|$|E

I was not at all shocked when her single immediately hit the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts in 1989 [...] As much as that song means to me – I'm proud and thankful to have co-written it – I'll never be able to hear it without associating it with a sad <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life.|$|E
