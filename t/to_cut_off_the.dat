5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke {{on the horizon}} and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} while the two British cruisers turned <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> two Austrian destroyers. Aquila opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central boiler room and severed her main steam pipe. The Austrian ships managed to disengage before the cruisers could close the distance.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Manstein was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 11th Army after its previous commander, Colonel-General Eugen Ritter von Schobert, perished when his plane landed in a Soviet minefield. The 11th Army was tasked with invading the Crimean Peninsula, capturing Sevastopol, and pursuing enemy forces on the flank of Army Group South during its advance into the Soviet Union. Hitler's intention was to prevent the Red Army from using airbases there, and <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Soviet supply of oil from the Caucasus.|$|E

5|$|Judas {{was killed}} in 160BCE and succeeded by his brother Jonathan, who {{attempted}} to build a barrier <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Acra's supply line. Jonathan had already assembled the manpower required for the task when {{he was forced to}} confront the invading army of Seleucid general Diodotus Tryphon at Beth Shan (Scythopolis). Having invited Jonathan to a friendly conference, Tryphon had him seized and murdered. Jonathan was succeeded by another brother, Simon, who besieged and finally captured the Acra in 141BCE.|$|E
5|$|After {{having won}} {{control of the}} seas, a Roman force landed on the African coast under Marcus Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the Battle of Adys and forcing Carthage to sue for peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Aigle was {{in action}} again on 22 March 1808 against two large, French frigates; Italienne of 40 guns and the 38-gun Sirene. A {{squadron}} comprising Aigle, the 32-gun frigate , the two seventy-fours Impétueux and , {{and two or}} three smaller vessels were anchored between the Glénan islands, whilst being resupplied by a transport convoy. At 15:45, two French frigates to the south-east were simultaneously seen from Aigle's masthead and by the British schooner , which was stationed midway between the squadron and the island of Groix. Aigle immediately gave chase, and coming within hailing distance at 19:30, Wolfe directed Cuckoo to relay to Impétueux and Narcissus, now following two miles behind, his intention <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> French ships by sailing between Groix and the mainland.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus and {{his disciples}} {{go to the}} garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal.

In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ear {{of a man in}} the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.|$|E

[...] As a result, he ordered two more redoubts to be constructed, of which one was completed, near the beach between Funen and Fredericia. [...] On 30 May, Danish troops launched another sally, damaging what had been constructed so far, and spiking 9 cannons. [...] The Schleswig-Holsteins were not able <b>to</b> completely <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> town, but the threat that that could still happen prompted Lunding to urge his superiors to launch an attack soon.|$|R

5|$|Many navvies {{had been}} farm labourers from the Yorkshire Dales, North East England and the Fens, or {{had come for}} work from Scotland and Ireland. Drunkenness and {{fighting}} was such that Jos Midgeley, a railway police inspector, was hired for £1.25 per week to keep order. At one time he was attacked {{by a group of}} men, and at Wescoe Hill, two miles away {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wharfe, a riot occurred when the contractors tried <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> beer supply to keep the men sober enough to work.|$|E
5|$|Montfort's {{support was}} now dwindling, and Edward retook Worcester and Gloucester with {{relatively}} little effort.

Edward managed to make a surprise attack at Kenilworth Castle, where the younger Montfort was quartered, before moving on <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> earl of Leicester. The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons' War, the Battle of Evesham, on 4August 1265. Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces, and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated on the field.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{was still}} in command of China's armed forces when Mao ordered the {{shelling}} of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu, islands {{off the coast of}} Fujian that were still held by the Kuomintang, in the late summer and autumn of 1958. Peng developed a strategy with his Chief of Staff, Su Yu, to bombard the islands so intensely that the morale of their defenders would collapse, eventually leading to the islands' surrender. After the islands' surrender, the PLA would then use the islands to launch attacks against Taiwan. The saturated shelling of the islands included over half the artillery in China, and began on August 28. The attack included a coordinated effort <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> islands' air and sea supply lines.|$|E

5|$|The Landing at Saidor (Operation Michaelmas) was an Allied amphibious {{landing at}} Saidor, Papua New Guinea on 2 January 1944 {{as part of}} Operation Dexterity during World War II. In Allied hands, Saidor was a {{stepping}} stone towards Madang, the ultimate objective of General Douglas MacArthur's Huon Peninsula campaign. The capture of the airstrip at Saidor also allowed construction of an airbase to assist Allied air forces to conduct operations against Japanese bases at Wewak and Hollandia. But MacArthur's immediate objective was <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> 6,000 Imperial Japanese troops retreating from Sio {{in the face of}} the Australian advance from Finschhafen.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} calm for Pagan {{ended in the}} early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> retreat of Song {{refugees}} in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.|$|E
5|$|With the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve, Chauvel {{sent the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{to move on}} Magdhaba by the north and {{north-east}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> possibility of retreat while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade followed the telegraph line straight to Magdhaba. The 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced mounted to the attack but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi bed. By midday all three brigades and the Camel Brigade, despite support from machine-guns and artillery, were hotly engaged. Aerial reconnaissance from Australian and British aircraft, which scouted out the Turkish positions, greatly assisted the attack, although the Turkish positions were obscured by {{the effect of a}} mirage and dust clouds.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} envisaged {{preceding the}} sea-borne landings with airborne drops: near Caen {{on the eastern}} flank to secure the Orne River bridges, and north of Carentan on the western flank. The initial goal was to capture Carentan, Isigny, Bayeux, and Caen. The Americans, assigned to land at Utah and Omaha, were <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno, were to capture Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen {{in order to protect}} the American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Anglo-Canadian forces a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the town of Falaise. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory captured north of the Avranches-Falaise line during the first three weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the River Seine.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> French line of advance. With {{the wind in the}} northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the main German units retreated through Lyon. On 2September the 36thInfantry Division arrived at Lyon {{to find the}} Maquis {{fighting}} the Milice {{with much of the}} factory areas on fire. The next day, Lyon was liberated and 2,000 Germans were captured, but the rest had already continued their retreat north. Lyon celebrated for two days with the Americans. The Allies made a last-ditch attempt <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Germans with an offensive towards Bourg-en-Bresse by the 45thDivision and the 117thCavalry Squadron from the original Taskforce Butler. However, the 45thDivision was not able to overcome the German defenses near the town. The 117thCavalry Squadron had more success, bypassing Bourg-en-Bresse and taking Montreval and Marboz north of Bourg-en-Bresse instead. By 3September Montreval was secure, but the squadron soon found itself trapped by units from the 11thPanzer Division, which surrounded the town. As a result, the squadron was almost annihilated, and the German escape route was again open. The American units then retired to Marboz.|$|E
