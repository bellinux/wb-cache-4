25|$|The {{first major}} {{expansion}} in Henry and Clem's South Bend business came from their being in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> {{meet the needs}} of the California Gold Rush that began in 1849. From his wheelbarrow enterprise at Placerville, John M. had amassed $8,000. In April 1858, he quit and moved out to apply this to financing the vehicle manufacturing of H & C Studebaker, which was already booming because of a big order to build wagons for the US Army. In 1857, they had also built their first carriage—"Fancy, hand-worked iron trim, the kind of courting buggy any boy and girl would be proud to be seen in".|$|E

25|$|Weekes had {{a classic}} batting style, possessed {{a variety of}} shots {{on both sides of}} the wicket, and is {{considered}} one of the hardest hitters in cricket history. Described by The Times as lightly bow-legged, with a wonderful eye, wrists the envy of any batsman, and feet always <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> play a shot, Richie Benaud stated that many Australians who saw Weekes in action said he was the closest batsman in style to the pre-World War II Donald Bradman. He was also compared to Bradman in his ability to keep the scoreboard moving and at using his feet to come down the pitch to slower bowlers. Additionally, Weekes was an excellent fielder, initially in the covers before moving into the slips, and produced a training manual entitled Aspects of Fielding.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of Book One describes which Armenians decide on resistance and which on {{cooperating with the}} deportation order. Bagradian camps out {{with his family and}} friends on Musa Dagh, to ensure that it is <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> make a stand. Those who decide to resist, dig up a cache of rifles left over from the revolution of 1908, when they were allies of the Young Turks and subsequently bury their church bells, so that these do not fall into Turkish hands. Eventually the Ottoman military police, the dreaded saptiehs, arrive led by the red-haired müdir. They instruct the Armenians to prepare for deportations—- and then leave after beating Ter Haigasun and Bagradian. Instead of complying, the 6,000 Armenians march with everything they can carry, their animals and their weapons to a plateau on Musa Dagh. Bagradian hangs behind and observes the wailing women and the other graveyard folk—- who represent the old ways and sympathetic magic of pagan Armenia—- sacrifice a goat. Its meaning is propitious as well as cautionary. The chapter ends with Bagradian helping Krikor carry the last volumes of his magnificent if eclectic library to the Damlayik, the plateau the Armenians have chosen as their refuge.|$|E

But the therocephalians ("beast heads"), which {{appear to have}} arisen {{at about the same}} time as the gorgonopsians, had additional mammal-like features, e.g. their finger and toe bones had the same number of phalanges (segments) as in early mammals (and the same number that primates have, including humans).|$|R

500|$|At Michigan, Volk was {{a three-year}} starter from 1964 to 1966. Prior {{to the start}} of the 1964 season, he was given jersey no. 49, the same number worn by his uncle when he played for Michigan. [...] During the 1964 season, Volk played at the halfback {{position}} on both offense and defense and also served as a backup at quarterback to Bob Timberlake. [...] In his first game for the Wolverines, he intercepted a pass in the end zone against Air Force. In his second game, he helped the Michigan defense hold scoreless a high-scoring Navy team led by Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach. [...] He also threw a 33-yard touchdown pass against Northwestern in October 1964. In a close victory over Minnesota, after the Golden Gophers had cut Michigan's lead to five points and advanced the ball to Michigan's 7-yard line, Volk [...] "smashed through to down the Gopher ball carrier, and save the game on fourth down." [...] Volk was described by sports writer Joe Hendrickson as [...] "instinctive — usually in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> mess things up for the opposition."

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the “right to place” as a {{political}} theory of wild animal <b>rights.</b> Out of <b>the</b> debate between terrestrial cosmopolitans inspired by Kant and Arendt and rooted cosmopolitan animal <b>right</b> theorists, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> emerges from <b>the</b> fold of rooted cosmopolitanism in tandem with environmental and ecological principles. Contrary to terrestrial cosmopolitans—who favour extending citizenship rights to wild animals and advocate at the same time large-scale humanitarian interventions and unrestricted geographical mobility—I argue that the well-being of wild animals is best served by <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> theory on account of its sovereignty model. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> theory advocates human non-interference in wildlife communities, opposing even humanitarian interventions, which carry the risk of unintended consequences. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> theory, with its emphasis on territorial sovereignty, bases its opposition to unrestricted geographical mobility on two considerations: (a) the non-generalist nature of many species and (b) the potential for abuse via human encroachment. In a broader context, the advantage of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> theory lies in its implicit environmental demands: human population control and sustainable lifestyles...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{practical}} {{limit to}} the use of a gravity assist maneuver is that planets and other large masses are seldom in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> enable a voyage to a particular destination. For example, the Voyager missions which started in the late 1970s were made possible by the [...] "Grand Tour" [...] alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. A similar alignment will not occur again until the middle of the 22nd century. That is an extreme case, but even for less ambitious missions there are years when the planets are scattered in unsuitable parts of their orbits.|$|R
500|$|Neill was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him {{in charge of the}} Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> stop the Mexican army in its tracks. [...] He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. [...] Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.|$|E

When Lievaart proved unable to trace, having left the country with Gogol Bordello, the only alternative would have been Newman's swim~ studio, but as Newman explained to emusic.com, this {{would not have been}} suitable: [...] "I can produce fairly decent-sounding mixes here , but for physical recording, if you're going to record drums in a nice room, first of all you've got to have a nice room, and someone who knows how to record drums.

2500|$|Moreover, the Savoy was not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> {{produce such}} a drama, because its {{audience}} {{was used to}} seeing comic operas focused on wit, humour and Gilbertian satire. [...] To {{provide them with a}} mostly dark-toned romantic piece consisting of pseudo-medieval dialogue (and too much of it), lengthy grand-operatic musical numbers and a serious exploration of complex characters {{turned out to be a}} grave mistake. [...] In addition, The Beauty Stone is a very long piece [...] it played for nearly four hours on opening night; several items were cut soon after opening night, but the cuts did not improve matters. [...] At the same time, competition from the new theatrical art form of George Edwardes-style musical comedy produced at other London theatres offered lighthearted entertainment choices to the Savoy audience, with catchy tunes, dancing and witty banter. [...] For a modern audience, however, there is much to admire about The Beauty Stone. [...] Pinero's book, though overly long, contains vivid characters with psychological depth that Sullivan was able to develop more fully than in his shorter comic operas. The complex way in which these characters react to the beauty stone makes this plot device different from the way Gilbert treated his magic lozenges and gave Sullivan a chance to employ rich musical portraits of yearning, despair, love and beauty.|$|E
