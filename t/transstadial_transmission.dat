40|$|Understanding the {{paradigm}} of the pathogen-tick-host triad remains an intricate issue. Basic research focusing on {{each one of these}} interplays is necessary to better comprehend this dynamic system. One of such complex association is the Babesia ovis, transmitted by the Rhipicephalus bursa ticks. B. ovis is an intra-erythrocytic protozoan parasite highly pathogenic parasite, causing severe infection in sheep. Pathogen and vector co-evolved and during infection a substantial molecular dialogue/interchanges takes place. The pathogen is adapted to both its hosts, and remarkably transovarial and <b>transstadial</b> <b>transmissions</b> are present in the vector.

40|$|Lumpy {{skin disease}} (LSD) is an {{economically}} important cattle disease. The disease is endemic in many African countries, but outbreaks {{have also been}} reported in Madagascar and the Middle East. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the potential role of ixodid (hard) ticks in the transmission of the disease. Cattle were infected with a virulent, South African field isolate of lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). Three common African tick species (genera Rhipicephalus, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus)) in different life cycle stages were fed on the infected animals during the viraemic stage and on skin lesions. Post-feeding, the partially fed male ticks were transferred to the skin of non-infected ‘recipient’ animals, while females were allowed to lay eggs that were then tested using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and virus isolation. Nymphs were allowed to develop for 2 – 3 weeks after which time they were tested. The non-infected ‘recipient’ cattle were closely monitored, both skin and blood samples were tested using PCR and virus isolation, and serum samples were tested by the serum neutralization test. This is the first report showing molecular evidence of potential transmission of LSDV by ixodid ticks. The study showed evidence of <b>transstadial</b> and transovarial <b>transmission</b> of LSDV by R.

This type of transmission is seen in other parasites like viruses or Rickettsia. In addition to ticks, mites are another common vector.

Regardless of the tick stage that acquired the infection, subsequent tick stages were shown to be infected (confirming <b>transstadial</b> and transovarial <b>transmissions)</b> {{and were able to}} transmit R. rickettsii to uninfected animals, as demonstrated by serological and molecular analyses. However, the larval, nymphal and adult stages of A. cajennense were shown to be partially refractory to R. rickettsii infection, as in all cases, only part of the ticks became infected by this agent, after being exposed to rickettsemic animals. In addition, less than 50 % of the infected engorged females transmitted rickettsiae transovarially, and when they did so, only part of the offspring became infected, indicating that vertical transmission alone is not enough to maintain R. rickettsii in A. cajennense for multiple generations. Finally, the R. rickettsii-infected tick groups had lower reproductive performance than the uninfected control group. Our results indicate that A. cajennense have a low efficiency to maintain R. rickettsii for successive generations, as R. rickettsii-infection rates should decline drastically throughout the successive tick generations.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{consisted}} of two experiments that evaluated experimental infections of Haemaphysalis leporispalustris ticks by a Brazilian strain of Rickettsia rickettsii, and their effect on tick biology. In experiment I, ticks were exposed to R. rickettsii during the larval, nymphal or adult stages by feeding on rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) needle-inoculated with R. rickettsii, and thereafter reared on uninfected rabbits for the entire next tick generation. Regardless of the tick stage that acquired the infection, all subsequent tick stages were shown to be infected by PCR (infection rates varying from 1. 3 to 41. 7 %), {{and were able to}} transmit R. rickettsii to uninfected rabbits, as demonstrated by rabbit seroconversion, guinea pig inoculation with rabbit blood, and PCR on rabbit blood. In Experiment II, ticks were exposed to R. rickettsii during the larval stage by feeding on rabbits co-infested with R. rickettsii-infected adult ticks, and thereafter reared on uninfected rabbits until the next generation of larvae. Again, all subsequent tick stages were shown to be infected by PCR (infection rates varying from 3. 0 to 40. 0 %), and were able to transmit R. rickettsii to uninfected rabbits. Thus, it was demonstrated that larvae, nymphs, and adults of H. leporispalustris were able to acquire and maintain the R. rickettsii infection by <b>transstadial</b> and transovarial <b>transmissions</b> within the tick population, with active transmission of the bacterium to susceptible rabbits by all parasitic stages. Analyses of biological parameters of uninfected and R. rickettsii-infected tick lineages were performed in order to evaluate possible deleterious effects of R. rickettsii to the infected tick lineages. Surprisingly, {{all but one of the}} four R. rickettsii-experimental groups of the present study showed overall better biological performance than their sibling uninfected control ticks. Results of the present study showed that H. leporispalustris could support infection by a high virulent strain of R. rickettsii for at least two generations, in which infected tick lineages tended to have better performance than uninfected ticks. Our results support a possible role of H. leporispalustris in the enzootic maintenance of R. rickettsii in Latin America, as previously suggested by earlier works.

40|$|No início de 2010, uma nova riquetsiose foi descrita em um paciente humano, que foi infestado por carrapato em Barra do Una, no litoral sul do Estado de São Paulo. Técnicas moleculares indicaram que esta nova doença foi causada por uma nova cepa de riquétsia, que foi denominada de Rickettsia parkeri cepa Mata Atlântica. Estudos mais recentes demonstraram que 10 a 15 % dos carrapatos Amblyomma ovale, coletados em áreas de Mata Atlântica nos estados de São Paulo (incluindo a área do caso índice da infecção humana em Barra do Una) e Santa Catarina estavam infectados com R. parkeri cepa Mata Atlântica. Desta forma, o presente estudo iniciou-se a partir de fêmeas ingurgitadas de A. ovale, coletadas de cães naturalmente infestados em Barra do Una. No laboratório, foi constatado por PCR que parte dessas fêmeas (6, 25 %) estavam naturalmente infectadas por R. parkeri cepa Mata Atlântica; os ovos dessas fêmeas foram utilizados para formar uma colônia de A. ovale naturalmente infectada por R. parkeri. Ovos de fêmeas não infectadas, foram utilizados para formar uma colônia não infectada. As duas colônias foram estudadas de forma paralela no laboratório, visando analisar e quantificar a transmissão transestadial e transovariana de R. parkeri cepa Mata Atlântica e a competência vetorial do A. ovale. As infestações por larvas foram {{realizadas}} em roedores (Calomys callosus), enquanto ninfas e adultos foram alimentados em Oryctolagus cunicullus (coelho doméstico). Amostras de 10 indivíduos de cada uma das fases (larvas, ninfas e adultos F 1, ovos, larvas e ninfas F 2) foram testadas individualmente por um sistema de taqman real-time PCR, para presença de Rickettsia spp. Os soros sanguíneos de todos animais infestados foram testados por imunofluorescência indireta com antígeno de R. parkeri, no dia zero e 21 dias após a infestação por carrapatos, a fim de verificar soroconversão para antígenos de Rickettsia. Os resultados obtidos demonstraram 100 % de transmissões transestadial (larva para ninfas e ninfas para adultos) e transovariana de R. parkeri em A. ovale, uma vez que todas as amostras de ovos, larvas, ninfas e adultos do grupo infectado foram positivas na PCR. Larvas e ninfas de A. ovale demonstraram alta competência vetorial, pois todos animais infestados por esses estágios infectados soroconverteram para R. parkeri. Por outro lado, adultos foram parcialmente competentes, pois apenas metade dos coelhos soroconverteu após ser infestada com carrapatos adultos infectados. Nenhum carrapato do grupo controle foi positivo na PCR, assim como nenhum animal deste grupo soroconverteu para R. parkeri. Fêmeas infectadas por R. parkeri cepa Mata Atlântica tiveram parâmetros reprodutivos inferiores aos das fêmeas não infectadas, indicando algum efeito deletério da infecção por este agente sobre os carrapatos. Os resultados sugerem a importância do carrapato A. ovale na epidemiologia desta nova riquetsiose brasileira, assim como sugerem uma capacidade vetorial de A. ovale para R. parkeri cepa Mata Atlântica, uma vez que este carrapato é frequentemente encontrado infestando humanos no bioma de Mata Atlântica. In early 2010, a novel rickettsiosis {{was described}} in a human patient that had been infested by a tick in Barra do Una, southern coast {{of the state of}} São Paulo, Brazil. Molecular tests indicated that the disease was caused by a new rickettsial strain, named Rickettsia parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest. More recent studies demonstrated that 10 to 15 % of Amblyomma ovale ticks, collected in Atlantic rainforest areas in the states of São Paulo (including the human index case area in Barra do Una) and Santa Catarina were infected with R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest. Within this context, the present study started with A. ovale engorged females collected from naturally infested dogs in Barra do Una. In the laboratory, it was shown by PCR that part of these females (6. 25 %) were naturally infected with R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest; the eggs of these females were used to form a lab colony of A. ovale, naturally infected by R. parkeri. Eggs laid by uninfected females were used to form an uninfected tick colony. Both colonies were evaluated in parallel in the lab, aiming to verify and quantify the <b>transstadial</b> and transovarian <b>transmissions</b> of R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest in A. ovale ticks, and the vector competence of the different parasitic stages of this tick. Larval infestations were done on rodents (Calomys callosus), while nymphal and adult infestations were done on rabbits (Oryctolagus cunicullus). Samples of 10 individuals of each tick stage (F 1 larvae, nymphs and adults; F 2, eggs, larvae, and nymphs) were tested individually by a taqman real-time PCR targeting the genus Rickettsia. Blood serum samples from all infested animals were tested through immunofluorescence assay employing R. parkeri antigens, on zero and 21 days post tick infestation, in order to verify seroconversion to rickettsial antigens. The results demonstrated 100 % of transstadial (larvae to nynphs; nymphs to adults) and transovarian transmissions of R. parkeri in A. ovale ticks, since all egg, larval, nymphal, and adult samples from the infected colony were PCR-positive. A. ovale larvae and nymphs demonstrated high vector competence because all animals infested by these tick infected stages seroconverted to R. parkeri. On the other hand, adult ticks were partially competent since only half of the animals seroconverted after being infested by infected adult ticks. None tick of the uninfected control colony was PCR positive, as well as no animal from this group seroconverted to R. parkeri. Tick females infected by R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest had lower reproductive parameters than uninfected females, indicating some deleterious effect of the infection on these ticks. The results suggest an important role of A. ovale ticks in the epidemiology of this novel Brazilian rickettsiosis, and also suggest that A. ovale are capable to transmit R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest under natural conditions, since this tick is frequently found infesting humans on the Atlantic rainforest biome...|$|R

Brown dog ticks become carriers of the pathogen when they take a blood meal from a rickessemic dog.

Both the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick serve as long-term reservoirs for Rickettsia rickettsii, in which the organism resides in the tick posterior diverticulae of the midgut, the small intestine and the ovaries. In addition, an infected male tick can transmit the organism to an uninfected female during mating.

5000|$|Babesia bovis {{protozoa}} {{are transmitted}} by R. microplus and cause babesiosis or redwater fever in cattle throughout the tropics and subtropics wherever this boophilid species occurs. The less pathogenic Ba. bigemina is transmitted by R. microplus and R. decoloratorus. Development of Babesia in the tick {{is complex and}} includes sexual reproduction. These Babesia are transmitted from adult female boophilid ticks to the next generation, as larvae, by infection of the eggs. This is known as transovarian transmission; it provides the only opportunity for transmission through one-host ticks. Other species of Babesia are transmitted by three-host ticks in ways similar to Theileria protozoa, as described below. In cattle, infection of the red blood cells may grow rapidly to create a potentially fatal inflammatory crisis of the blood. The name redwater (coloured urine) derives from the hemoglobinuria caused by the destruction of red blood cells infected with the merozoite stage of Babesia; anemia results from the same destruction. Horses suffer babesiosis or biliary fever when infected by Ba. equi or B. caballi. This occurs in many countries where vector ticks are found, such as R. e. evertsi, Hy. truncatum, and D. nitens. Dogs are at risk from severe infection with Ba. canis and its subspecies, transmitted by the dog ticks R. sanguineus, D. reticulatus, and Ha. leachi. Domestic cats become infected with Ba. felis and Ba. cati from feeding ticks. Cytauxzoon felis is a protozoan related to Babesia and Theileria. It is transmitted by the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis. This microbe circulates between wild bobcats in southern USA, causing little apparent disease. If it infects domestic cats, it causes a cytauxzoonosis that is eventually fatal. 11Theileria annulata is a protozoan closely related to Babesia. In cattle, it causes the disease tropical theileriosis throughout a long arc of countries from Morocco across to China. [...] Theileria parva is the causative microbe of East Coast fever of cattle in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa. Theileria species infect monocytic white blood cells of their hosts. The infected cells are induced to divide by the Theileria, which then proliferates within each daughter cell, in a rapidly expanding infection. This causes multiple inflammatory crises, of which pulmonary edema is a predominant cause of death. Theileria annulata is transmitted by Hy. a. anatolicum, Hy. detritum, and other hyalommas. Theileria parva is transmitted predominantly by Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Because this is a three-host feeding tick, the opportunities for transmission are from infected cow to feeding larva then through the molt into the nymph which feeds and transmits. Similarly, also, transmission can be from feeding nymphs to infected adult. This is known as <b>transstadial</b> <b>transmission,</b> and no transovarian transmission occurs in this case. The development of Theileria in ticks includes sexual reproduction which enables generation of new variants that can evade the immune mechanisms of cattle.|$|E

We reviewed the literature to determine which songbird species were the most frequent carriers of B. afzelii-infected I. ricinus larvae and nymphs. We tested experimentally whether B. afzelii is capable of co-feeding transmission on two common European bird species, the blackbird (Turdus merula) and the great tit (Parus major). For each bird species, four naïve individuals were infested with B. afzelii-infected I. ricinus nymphal ticks and pathogen-free larval ticks. None of the co-feeding larvae tested positive for B. afzelii in blackbirds, but a low percentage of infected larvae (3. 33 %) was observed in great tits. <b>Transstadial</b> <b>transmission</b> of B. afzelii DNA from the engorged nymphs to the adult ticks was observed in both bird species. However, BSK culture found that these spirochetes were not viable. Our study suggests that co-feeding transmission of B. afzelii is not efficient in these two songbird species...|$|E
40|$|Lumpy {{skin disease}} (LSD), an acute, sub-acute or {{inapparent}} disease of cattle, {{is caused by}} {{lumpy skin disease virus}} (LSDV), a member of the genus Capripoxvirus in the family Poxviridae. LSD is characterised by high fever, formation of circumscribed skin lesions and ulcerative lesions on the mucous membranes of the mouth, respiratory and digestive tracts. It is an economically important disease due to the permanent damage to hides, the reduction in productivity and trade restrictions imposed on affected areas. Transmission has been associated with blood-feeding insects such as stable flies (Stomoxysis calcitrans) and mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti). Mechanical (intrastadial) and <b>transstadial</b> <b>transmission</b> by Amblyomma hebraeum and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus as well as transovarial transmission by R. decoloratus have been reported. In this study transovarial passage of LSDV to larvae and subsequent transmission to recipient animals were demonstrated. The finding of transovarial passage of LSDV in female ticks shows the potential for A. hebraeum, R. appendiculatus and R. decoloratus to be reservoir hosts for LSDV.

40|$|Background: Tick-borne Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. are {{considered}} to be emerging human pathogens, but only limited data are available on their occurrence in Sweden. Two real-time PCR assays followed by nested PCR and sequence analysis were carried out to investigate the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum and spotted fever rickettsiae in ticks from seven areas in Sweden. Results: In 139 pooled samples, representing a total of 1245 Ixodes ricinus ticks (204 larvae, 963 nymphs, 38 males, 40 females), the overall positive mean infection prevalence was 1. 3 - 15. 0 % for A. phagocytophilum and 1. 5 - 17. 3 % for R. helvetica. A. phagocytophilum was only detected in nymphs (1. 7 - 19. 4 %), whereas R. helvetica was detected in all three tick stages. Support for vertical and <b>transstadial</b> <b>transmission</b> was only obtained for R. helvetica. Both agents showed similar infection rates across study areas, although infection rates were greater in coastal areas. Conclusions: The results show that both pathogens occurred in all seven locations, indicating that they are prevalent in Sweden and should be considered etiological agents in patients recently bitten by ticks. Background Most ticks found on humans and other large and medium-sized mammals in Sweden belong to the hard tic...|$|E
40|$|Background Tularemia is a {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} the Francisella tularensis, a highly infectious Gram-negative coccobacillus. Due to easy dissemination, multiple routes of infection, high envi-ronmental contamination and morbidity and mortality rates, Francisella is considered a potential bioterrorism threat and classified as a category A select agent by the CDC. Tick bites {{are among the most}} prevalent modes of transmission, and ticks have been indicated as a possible reservoir, although their reservoir competence has yet to be defined. Tick-borne transmission of F. tularensis was recognized in 1923, and <b>transstadial</b> <b>transmission</b> has been demonstrated in several tick species. Studies on transovarial transmission, how-ever, have reported conflicting results. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of ticks as reservoirs for Francisella, assessing the transovarial transmission of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica in ticks, using experimen-tally-infected females of Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus. Results Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed F. tularen-sis within oocytes. However, cultures and bioassays of eggs and larvae were negative; in addition, microscopy techniques revealed bacterial degeneration/death in the oocytes. Conclusions These results suggest that bacterial death might occur in oocytes, preventing the transovar-ial transmission of Francisella.

40|$|Abstract. Infected deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis) {{were allowed}} to attach to naive mice for {{variable}} lengths of time to determine the duration of tick attachment required for Powassan (POW) virus transmission to occur. Viral load in engorged larvae detaching from viremic mice and in resulting nymphs was also monitored. Ninety percent of larval ticks acquired POW virus from mice that had been intraperitoneally inoculated with 105 plaque-forming units (PFU). En-gorged larvae contained approximately 10 PFU. <b>Transstadial</b> <b>transmission</b> efficiency was 22 %, resulting in approxi-mately 20 % infection in nymphs that had fed as larvae on viremic mice. Titer increased approximately 100 -fold during molting. Nymphal deer ticks efficiently transmitted POW virus to naive mice after as few as 15 minutes of attachment, suggesting that unlike Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, no grace period exists between tick attachment and POW virus transmission. Pathogens transmitted by ticks frequently require a period of reactivation and/or replication prior to being transmitted from an infected tick to a naive host. This phenomenon is an adaptation by tick-borne agents to the many months that may pass between tick blood meals, 1 and has been well docu-mented for the agents of Rocky Mountain spotted feve...|$|E
40|$|Powassan (POW) virus, {{the cause}} of human {{encephalitis}} in the northeastern U. S. and Canada, is transmitted by tick bite. Since the geographic and host distribution patterns of Ixodes dammini Spielman, et al, 1979 and POW virus overlap, the potential of this tick species to transmit POW virus was explored. Transmission experiments were conducted with hamsters and rabbits which fed immature and adult ticks, respectively, from a POW-free colony. Oral infection rates in larvae and nymphs fed on POW-infected hamsters were 10 % and 40 %, respectively; in females fed on POW-infected rabbits, 57 %. <b>Transstadial</b> <b>transmission</b> rates for nymphs exposed to POW virus as larvae, adults exposed as larvae, and adults exposed as nymphs, were 9. 5 %, 10 % and 54 %, respectively. Evidence of transovarial transmission was acquired when 2 clean hamsters feeding F$ sb 2 $ larvae and nymphs originally exposed to virus in the F$ sb 1 $ nymphal stage seroconverted to POW virus with hemagglutination inhibition titers of 80 and 5120, respectively, on week 4 post-tick-drop-off. The transovarial transmission rate was 16. 6 %. All developmental stages were able to transmit POW virus orally to clean hosts regardless of when the ticks were originally exposed to virus. These results indicate that I. dammini is a competent vector of POW virus under experimental conditions. Field studies are necessary {{to determine if the}} same holds true under natural conditions...|$|E

40|$|Background: Enterobacter cloacae {{bacterium}} is a known symbiont of {{the most}} Anopheles gut microflora and nominated as {{a good candidate for}} paratransgenic control of malaria. However, the population dynamics of this bacterium with­in An. stephensi and its introduction methods to the mosquitoes have not yet been explored. Methods: Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens expressing green fluorescent protein and defensin (GFP-D) was used to study <b>transstadial</b> <b>transmission</b> and the course of time, larval habitat, sugar, and blood meal on dynamics of the bacterium in the mosquito life stages in the laboratory condition. The bacterial quantities were measured by plating samples and counting GFP expressing colonies on the Tet-BHI agar medium. Results: The E. cloacae population remained stable in sugar bait at least for eleven days whereas it was lowered in the insectary larval habitat where the bacteria inadequately recycled. The bacterium was weakly transmitted transstadi­ally from larval to adult stage. The bacterial populations increased smoothly and then dramatically in the guts of An. stephensi following sugar and blood meal respectively followed by a gradual reduction over the time. Conclusion: Enterobacter cloacae was highly stable in sugar bait and increased tremendously in the gut of female adult An. stephensi within 24 h post blood meal. Sugar bait stations can be used for introduction of the transgenic bacteria in a paratransgenic approach. It is recommended to evaluate the attraction of sugar bait in combination with attractive kairomones as well as its stability and survival rate in the semi-field or field conditions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Borrelia sp. {{prevalence}} in ticks on {{migratory birds}} was surveyed in central Japan. In autumn, {{a total of}} 1, 733 birds representing 40 species were examined for ticks. A total of 361 ticks were obtained from 173 birds of 15 species, and these ticks were immature Haemaphysalis flava (94. 4 %), Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ixodes columnae, Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes turdus, and an unidentified Ixodes species. Of these, 27 juveniles of H. flava on Turdus pallidus, Turdus cardis, or Emberiza spodocephala, 2 juveniles of I. persulcatus on T. pallidus, and 1 female H. flava molted from a T. pallidus-derived nymph were positive {{for the presence of}} Borrelia by Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly culture passages. In spring, a total of 16 ticks obtained from 102 birds of 21 species were negative for the spirochete. Isolates from 15 ticks were characterized by 5 S- 23 S rRNA intergenic spacer restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis; all isolates were identified as Borrelia garinii with pattern B/B′ based on the previous patterning. According to the intergenic spacer sequences, 2 of 15 isolates, strains Fi 14 f and Fi 24 f, were highly similar to B. garinii strains 935 T of Korea and ChY 13 p of Inner Mongolia, China, respectively. These findings indicate that Lyme disease-causing B. garinii may have been introduced to Japan by migratory birds from northeastern China via Korea. Additionally, a case of <b>transstadial</b> <b>transmission</b> of B. garinii from nymph to adult H. flava suggests that the infected H. flava may transmit Borrelia to large animals...|$|E
