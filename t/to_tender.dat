5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg.

They were not ready, however, <b>to</b> <b>tender</b> an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|Officers from Latona {{were first}} {{to board the}} French frigate but Emeric refused <b>to</b> <b>tender</b> his formal {{surrender}} except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage.

Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most of the credit for the victory to Latona, in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies.|$|E
