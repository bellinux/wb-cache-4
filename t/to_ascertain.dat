Despite the lack of knowledge of who might have helped him, however, he is given the credit for the editorship and the overall structure of the book.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} modern {{measurements}} of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations.

It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a plumb bob was used <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.|$|E
