5000|$|The term [...] "thermoelectric effect" [...] {{encompasses}} three separately identified effects: the Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect.</b> The Seebeck and Peltier {{effects are}} different {{manifestations of the}} same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the Peltier-Seebeck effect (the separation derives from the independent discoveries of French physicist Jean Charles Athanase Peltier and Baltic German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck). The <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect</b> {{is an extension of}} the Peltier-Seebeck model and is credited to Lord Kelvin.|$|E

5000|$|To {{describe}} the Peltier and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effects</b> {{the flow of}} energy must be considered. To start the dynamic case where both temperature and charge may be varying with time can be considered. The full thermoelectric equation for the energy accumulation, [...] is ...|$|R

5000|$|Often, {{more than}} one of the above effects is {{involved}} in the operation of a real thermoelectric device. The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect</b> can be gathered together in a consistent and rigorous way, described here; the effects of Joule heating and ordinary heat conduction are included as well. As stated above, the Seebeck effect generates an electromotive force, leading to the current equation ...|$|E
50|$|In {{different}} materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not {{constant in}} temperature, {{and so a}} spatial gradient in temperature {{can result in a}} gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur. This <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect</b> was predicted and subsequently observed by Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) in 1851.It describes the heating or cooling of a current-carrying conductor with a temperature gradient.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a thermoelectric device used as a heat pump or refrigerator is mainly affected by the Peltier, Fourier, Joule and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effects.</b> The differential equations governing the temperature field inside the device operated between two heat reservoirs are established by using nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

The complete thermoelectric model is verified by comparing with experimental results on temperature distributions of suspended aluminum and polysilicon resistors and contacts. Near the contacts, temperature differences {{of up to}} 10 % of highest temperature are found when changing current direction. This is closely matched in the presented simulations...|$|R

The conversion efficiency was discussed {{with respect to}} the lattice thermal conductivity, keeping other parameters such as Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity to the same values. If room temperature lattice thermal conductivity is decreased up to 0. 5 W/mK, the conversion efficiency of a PbS based material becomes as high as 15 % with the temperature difference of 500 K between 800 K and 300 K...|$|R
50|$|Angelo Battelli (28 March 1862 - 11 December 1916) was an Italian scientist, {{notable for}} having {{measured}} temperatures and heats of fusion of non-metallic substances, metallic conductivities and thermoelectric effects in magnetic metals, and the <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect.</b> He investigated osmotic pressures, surface tensions, and physical properties of carbon disulfide (CS2), water (H2O), and alcohols, especially their vapor pressures, critical points, and densities. He studied X-rays and cathode rays. He investigated {{the resistance of}} solenoids to high-frequency alternating currents.|$|E
5000|$|A {{measurement}} of the Thomson coefficient , which expresses {{the strength of the}} <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect,</b> can be used to yield the absolute Seebeck coefficient through the relation: , provided that [...] is measured down to absolute zero. The reason this works is that [...] is expected to decrease to zero as the temperature is brought to zero—a consequence of Nernst's theorem. Such a measurement based on the integration of [...] was published in 1932, though it relied on the interpolation of the Thomson coefficient in certain regions of temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{thermoelectric}} effect {{refers to}} phenomena by which either a temperature difference creates an electric potential or an electric potential creates a temperature difference. These phenomena are known more specifically as the Seebeck effect (converting temperature to current), Peltier effect (converting current to temperature), and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect</b> (conductor heating/cooling). While all materials have a nonzero thermoelectric effect, in most materials {{it is too}} small to be useful. However, low-cost materials that have a sufficiently strong thermoelectric effect (and other required properties) could be used in applications including power generation and refrigeration. A commonly used thermoelectric material in such applications is bismuth telluride (...) [...]|$|E
40|$|The Peltier {{effect is}} the {{fundamental}} mechanism that makes interface demarcation through current pulsing possible. If a method for calculating the necessary current density for effective demarcation is to be developed, {{it will be necessary}} to know the value of the Peltier coefficient. This study determined experimentally the value of the Peltier coefficient for gallium-doped germanium by comparing the change in average growth rates between current-on and current-off periods. Current-on and current-off layer thickness measurements were made using differential interference contrast microscopy and atomic force microscopy. It was found that the Joule and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effects</b> could not be neglected. Peltier coefficients calculated from the experimental data with an analysis that accounts for Joule, <b>Thomson,</b> and Peltier <b>effects</b> yielded an average value for the Peltier coefficient of 0. 076 +/- 0. 015 V...|$|R
40|$|With {{the help}} of Domenicali's {{equation}} and the heat flux equation, a finite difference method is directly {{used to determine the}} temperature and heat flux distribution profiles in one dimension of a thermoelectric generator simultaneously including the Peltier, Fourier, Joule, and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effects.</b> This calculative method is also used to evaluate the performance of a thermoelectric generator, based on experimental data of thermoelectric materials PbTe 1 -yIy and PbTe: Na/Ag 2 Te. The efficiency of the thermoelectric generator {{as a function of the}} electric current is calculated and the effects of structure parameters on the performance of the thermoelectric generator are revealed. The method proposed here offers a simple way to properly choose n-type and p-type thermoelectric materials of a thermoelectric generator. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Micromachined power sensors with {{operation}} up to 50 GHz {{were recently}} achieved in CMOS technology [1]. To improve their sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, while maintaining microwave performance, several design parameters must be considered, {{such as the}} number and placement of thermocouples. This paper presents experimental and analytical thermal characterization of the sensors, which provides insight into the proper adjustment of the layout parameters. Experimental results were obtained by indirect measurements of the sensor temperature distribution under various applied power conditions. A simple and approximate model was developed, and adjusted based on experimental results, which was then used to show {{the effects of the}} variations in layout parameters on the overall device sensitivity.

40|$|Thermoelectric devices offer {{noiseless}} {{and environment}} friendly operation, {{which makes them}} the most suitable devices of the future in their category. However, the performance of these devices is still way below its competitor thermal and electrical systems. The major factor that decides the performance of these devices is the thermoelectric material. Although the use of Silicon as a thermoelectric material greatly improved the performance of new thermoelectric devices over the metal based thermoelectric devices, {{it is still not}} close to the performance level of heat engines or refrigerators. With a limit on the material properties, these devices must be optimized based on all known effects that occur in the thermoelectric devices. The various effects that occur in a thermoelectric device are Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, Joule effect and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect.</b> Most of the time, the design of thermoelectric generators and sensors is based on the steady state characteristics, which include only the governing thermoelectric effect (Seebeck effect) into the mathematical model. The Joule effect, <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect</b> and Peltier effect are historically assumed to have negligible influence on its performance characteristics. In this thesis, a complete steady state and transient model of thermoelectric generator is formed incorporating all the thermoelectric effects. The comprehensive model accounts for the internal heat generation inside the thermoelements due to the Joule effect and the <b>Thomson</b> <b>effect.</b> The Peltier effect is included as a plane heat source at the junctions that release heat in both directions. The model is formulated using finite element method, which is implemented into a computer program. The influence of different thermoelectric effects is studied under various working conditions. The use of finite element program, as a design tool for thermoelectric devices, is also demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{approach}} to local nonlinear effects in cosmic microwave background anisotropies, and discuss the qualitative features of these effects. New couplings of the baryonic velocity to radiation multipoles are found, arising from nonlinear <b>Thomson</b> scattering <b>effects.</b> We also find a new nonlinear shear effect on small angular scales. The full set of evolution and constraint equations is derived, including the nonlinear generalizations of the radiation multipole hierarchy, and of the dynamics of multi-fluids. These equations govern radiation anisotropies in any inhomogeneous spacetime, but their main application is to second-order effects in a universe that is close to the Friedmann models. Qualitative analysis is given here, and quantitative calculations are taken up in further papers.

50|$|According to {{a report}} done by Energetics Incorporated for the DOE in November 2004 titled Technology Roadmap and several others done by the European commission, the {{majority}} of energy production from conventional and renewable resources are lost to the atmosphere due to onsite (equipment inefficiency and losses due to waste heat) and offsite (cable and transformers losses) losses, that sums to be around 66% loss in electricity value. Waste heat of different degrees {{could be found in}} final products of a certain process or as a by-product in industry such as the slag in steelmaking plants. Units or devices that could recover the waste heat and transform it into electricity are called WHRUs or heat to power units. For example, an Organic Rankine cycle unit uses an organic fluid as the working fluid. The fluid has a lower boiling point than water to allow it to boil at low temperature, to form a superheated gas that could drive the blade of a turbine and thus a generator. Thermoelectric (Seebeck, Peltier, <b>Thomson</b> <b>effects)</b> units may also be called WHRU, since they use the heat differential between two plates to produce DC Power.|$|R

40|$|Detection of {{microstructural}} changes {{caused by}} embrittlement and thermal treatments or {{history of the}} component, {{can be a very}} useful support to the safety and economy of the plant. Following previous studies on non-destructive assessment of neutron embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel steels, this paper presents results of relative Seebeck coefficient and resistivity obtained on thermally embrittled JRQ steel, a ferritic steel used as reference in many international projects. The Institute for Energy of the Joint Research Centre (JRC-IE) has developed two devices, focussed on the measurement of the electrical properties which prove to give a good non-destructive assessment of the embrittlement state of ferritic steels. The first technique, called STEAM (Seebeck and <b>Thomson</b> <b>Effects</b> on Aged Material), is based on the measurement of the relative Seebeck coefficient, characteristic of the material and related to the microstructural changes induced by embrittlement. With the same aim the second technique, named REAM (Resistivity Effects on Aged Material), measures instead the resistivity of the material. The applicability of combined measurements is also proposed. The results obtained prove that techniques based on the measurement of electrical properties can have interesting applications to non-destructive embrittlement assessment of ferritic steels. JRC.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{generators}} (TEG) are {{devices that}} convert temperature differences into usable electricity. TEGs {{are made from}} thermoelectric modules which are solid-state integrated circuits that employ three established thermoelectric effects known as the Peltier, Seebeck and <b>Thomson</b> <b>effects.</b> TEGs require heat as an energy source and can generate power {{as long as there}} is a heat source such as gas or oil flame, stove, camp fire, industrial machinery, and furnace. Solar modules which convert light energy into usable electricity need direct sunlight to generate maximum rated power. Usually solar tracking systems are used to receive direct sun light to increase the efficiency of the modules. This type of setup increases the cost of the photovoltaic systems. A team of students with a renewable energy projects background compared solar panels with TEGs. The comparison study dealt with efficiency, power generation capability and capacity, cost, size, potential consumer applications, and system installation complexity to generate power. The balance of the system included the number of the components that go into the system. For both devices, two separate laboratory environments were created to measure the power outputs and efficiencies. Both devices were tested at different locations due to operating environments were not similar. A solar PV module was tested under sun light whereas TEG module was tested inside an air conditioner condenser unit on same days.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{recognized}} {{that most of}} the available geological storage capacity for CO 2 is in saline aquifers. The best aquifers are likely to be in sedimentary basins (and in many cases near to fossil energy sources). However, unless the formations have been explored for hydrocarbon potential, it is likely that little data exists so significant work will be required to evaluate the realistic storage potential. Depleted gas fields offer more limited capacity but are better characterized, have seals that have successfully retained hydrocarbon gas for millions of years, and may offer a shorter route to practical implementation for early projects. Estimates indicate that depleted offshore gas fields in UK waters have the potential to store around 3. 8 billion tonnes of CO 2. This is a significant capacity and an inviting target particularly if existing infrastructure and wells can be reused. This paper explores the issues around injecting and storing CO 2 in highly depleted gas fields using a case study based on the characteristics of a Southern North Sea gas field. The study shows that assessing and managing the flow control aspects of CO 2 injection, particularly initially when the reservoirs are at very low pressure {{is going to be a}} major technical challenge. The challenges include a requirement for a high -tech flow control device at the base of the tubing to allow the dense phase CO 2 to be expanded in a controlled manner. Also the requirement for CO 2 -specific well flow performance software as conventional software, designed to model the flow of hydrocarbons, is not necessarily suffciently rigorous when modeling a complex fluid like CO 2, particularly the thermodynamics aspects. Understanding and mitigating Joule <b>Thomson</b> <b>effects</b> is necessary to avoid the possible formation of ice and gas hydrates. Without a comprehensive understanding of CO 2 flow systems and accurate modeling of the thermodynamic effects it may not be possible to realize the potential that gas field storage offers...|$|R
40|$|Major {{advances}} in the observation and theory of cosmic microwave background anisotropies have opened up {{a new era in}} cosmology. This has encouraged the hope that the fundamental parameters of cosmology will be determined to high accuracy in the near future. However, this optimism should not obscure the ongoing need for theoretical developments that go beyond the highly successful but simplified standard model. Such developments include improvements in observational modelling (e. g. foregrounds, non-Gaussian features), extensions and alternatives to the simplest inflationary paradigm (e. g. non-adiabatic effects, defects), and investigation of nonlinear effects. In addition to well known nonlinear effects such as the Rees-Sciama and Ostriker-Vishniac effects, further nonlinear effects have recently been identified. These include a Rees-Sciama-type tensor effect, time-delay effects of scalar and tensor lensing, nonlinear <b>Thomson</b> scattering <b>effects</b> and a nonlinear shear effect.
