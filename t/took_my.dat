5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I <b>took</b> <b>my</b> prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E
25|$|I {{said nothing}} to my brothers. But I went {{immediately}} to the show and <b>took</b> <b>my</b> painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that.|$|E
25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you <b>took</b> <b>my</b> best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope you will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E

25|$|A {{locomotive}} cut {{the car in}} half, killing {{my father}} instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, {{as if trying to}} discover why it was wet. These men <b>took</b> <b>my</b> sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, <b>took</b> <b>my</b> arm and pulled me out.|$|E
25|$|George Jones famously drove a John Deere {{lawn tractor}} to {{a liquor store}} after his wife had taken away his car keys {{to keep him from}} driving drunk. The {{incident}} was later memorialized as part of country music lore in numerous songs and videos, including Jones’ own “Honky Tonk Song” in 1996. Twelve years earlier, the video for Hank Williams Jr.’s “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight” featured George Jones riding a lawnmower. Vince Gill’s 1993 hit “One More Last Chance” includes the line, “She might have <b>took</b> <b>my</b> car keys, but she forgot about my old John Deere.” The video ends with Gill on a John Deere tractor passing Jones on a John Deere lawnmower. The video for John Rich’s “Country Done Come to Town” also features Jones on a riding lawnmower.|$|E

500|$|Winehouse's {{parents have}} each written memoirs about their {{daughter}} and donated {{the proceeds from}} both books to the Amy Winehouse Foundation. In the introduction to Mitch Winehouse's biography, entitled Amy: My Daughter (2012), he explained: [...] "Apart from being her father, I was also her friend, confidant and adviser—not that she always <b>took</b> <b>my</b> advice, but she always heard me out." [...] Her mother Janis published Loving Amy: A Mother's Story, in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Night {{fighter pilot}} Wilhelm Johnen {{commented on the}} arrival of Sayn-Wittgenstein at his unit: [...] "... A madman, I thought, as I <b>took</b> <b>my</b> leave. Once outside I got into {{conversation}} with the Prince's crew. Among other things {{they told me that}} their princely coachman had recently made his radio operator stand to attention in the plane and confined him to his quarters for three days because he (the radio operator) had lost his screen [...] during a mission." ...|$|E

[...] The lyrics continue: [...] "I'm too {{depressed}} to go on / You'll be sorry when I'm gone." [...] "Adam's Song" [...] includes a reference to [...] "Come as You Are" [...] by Nirvana. [...] "Come as You Are" [...] by Nirvana includes the lyrics [...] "Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, don't be late".

500|$|Rupert Penry-Jones {{noted that}} the initial fan {{reaction}} towards Adam Carter was negative, [...] "because Matthew [...] was so successful and loved." [...] It {{took a while for}} fans to accept him. Penry-Jones also felt that his role in Spooks, [...] "definitely <b>took</b> <b>my</b> profile up several notches." [...] In the [...] "best of drama" [...] viewer polls at BBC Online, Penry-Jones was voted third in the [...] "Best Actor" [...] category, beating co-stars Matthew Macfadyen, who was fifth, David Oyelowo, who was seventh, and Peter Firth, who was tenth. He was later voted fifth in 2005, and ninth in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Garrick also {{opened the}} temple and garden {{to the public}} on special occasions. Each May Day, seated on the chair noted by Mrs Delany and {{accompanied}} by his wife, he would give the poor children of Hampton money and cakes. A woman who attended one such May Day event later recalled: [...] "When I was called up, I <b>took</b> <b>my</b> six [...] into the Temple, where Mr Garrick was sitting by the fine bust with great cakes before him; he took down all their names, and then gave a shilling {{and a piece of}} plum-cake to every individual one; not even leaving out poor babes in their mothers' arms." ...|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby <b>took</b> <b>my</b> heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{was rather}} taken aback {{when the doctor}} entered the Anfield boot room", Wark said. [...] "He was small in stature and I {{could not help but}} detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he {{introduced}} himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. [...] "He <b>took</b> <b>my</b> blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. [...] "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical." ...|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{observes that}} the dedication, [...] "For Many Unknown Little Friends, Including Monica", is {{evidence}} that Potter's audience for Timmy Tiptoes was not as clearly defined as the audiences for her other books, especially those books composed for very specific children. Though [...] "Monica" [...] suggests a particular child of Potter's acquaintance, Monica was simply one of many children who posted fan letters to the author. [...] "I {{do not know the}} child," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "She is the school friend of a little cousin, who asked for it as a favour, and the name <b>took</b> <b>my</b> fancy." [...] MacDonald suggests it was this lack of a clearly defined audience that led to Potter's lack of imagination and control in the tale, and her [...] "false step" [...] with the chipmunks' marital relationship.|$|E

500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really <b>took</b> <b>my</b> cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to have much to say, because Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E
500|$|Matangi was {{recorded}} in various locations around the world, including London, New York and Los Angeles. The track [...] "Atention" [...] (stylised as [...] "aTENTion") {{was recorded}} {{on the island of}} Bequia in the Grenadines. M.I.A. contended that the recording process for the song involved input from Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who purportedly [...] "came into the studio and <b>took</b> <b>my</b> computer and basically decrypted the whole of the internet, and downloaded every word in the whole of the language that contained the word tent within it". [...] The rapper has been a friend of Assange for several years and he made an appearance via Skype at one of her concerts promoting the release of the album. [...] The album was the first by M.I.A. to feature no contribution from producer Diplo, with whom she was in dispute.|$|E
500|$|Ford was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry on September 30, 1949. He later said in 1975, [...] "When I <b>took</b> <b>my</b> obligation {{as a master}} mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value my own father attached to that order. But I {{had no idea that}} I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States." [...] Ford was made a 33° Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962. In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977. Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States.|$|E
