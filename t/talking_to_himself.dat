He starts <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> and notices that the road looks “like someone’s face, like a fucked-up face.” He experiences a narcoleptic episode and dreams of his mother comforting him as he replays home movies of his childhood in his mind.|$|E
25|$|Ibrahimović {{received}} a three-match ban after being shown a red card in a 1–1 home draw against Bari in March 2011 for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach. An additional three-match ban {{was given to}} Ibrahimović in February 2012 in a 2–1 home defeat against Fiorentina for swearing at an assistant referee. Ibrahimović stated in his defence that he was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> in frustration. He won his first Scudetto with Milan after a draw against Roma. All agreements between Milan and Barcelona were confirmed on 18 June 2011.|$|E
25|$|Biff {{leaves the}} {{restaurant}} in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy has picked up. They leave a confused and upset Willy {{behind in the}} restaurant. When they later return home, their mother angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> Biff tries unsuccessfully to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father {{that he is not}} meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The feud reaches an apparent climax with Biff hugging Willy and crying as he tries to get Willy {{to let go of the}} unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed (despite her urging him to follow her), lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he sees his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy idolized. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house. Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out.|$|E

500|$|At {{the local}} courthouse, a {{psychiatrist}} explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years prior out of jealousy. Unable {{to bear the}} guilt, he exhumed her corpse and began to treat it {{as if she were}} still alive. In order to preserve that illusion, he recreated his mother in his own mind as an alternate personality, often dressing in her clothes and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> in her voice. This [...] "Mother" [...] personality is jealous and possessive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, [...] "Mother" [...] kills her. As [...] "Mother", Norman had killed two young girls prior to Marion, as well as Arbogast. The psychiatrist says the [...] "Mother" [...] personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, [...] "Mother" [...] protests that the murders were Norman's doing and that she [...] "wouldn't even harm a fly." [...] Meanwhile, Marion's car is pulled out of the swamp.|$|E
500|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Rintarō Okabe, the protagonist of Steins;Gate. Okabe is an {{eccentric}} individual, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who often goes by the pseudonym [...] Mayuri and Daru call him , a portmanteau of his surname and given name. He {{is the founder of}} what he calls the [...] in Akihabara, where he spends most of his time, and has dubbed himself Lab Member No. 001 (as he is the first person to join). Okabe gives off the appearance of being delusional and paranoid, frequently referring to the [...] "Organization" [...] that is after him, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> on his phone, and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter. Most of the time he takes on a fairly arrogant personality. He is usually seen wearing a lab coat. As he experiments with time travel, he learns that he {{is the only one who}} possesses the ability to determine changes between different timelines, which he dubs [...] "Reading Steiner". He is 18 years old and a first-year student at Tokyo Denki University.|$|E
500|$|Due to his busy {{schedule}} at that time, Nagesh had a call sheet {{of one and}} a half days to finish his portions. When he learned that Ganesan's arrival was delayed because his make-up had not been completed, he asked Nagarajan whether they could film any solo sequences, which included a scene where Dharumi rants about his misfortune in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. While filming, Nagesh spontaneously came up with the dialogue, [...] "Varamaattan. Varamaattan. Avan nichchaiyam varamaattan. Enakku nalla theriyum. Varamaattan" [...] (...) [...] According to Nagesh, he was inspired by two incidents: one that involved two assistant directors discussing whether Ganesan would be ready before or after lunch— one said he would be ready while the other said he would not. The other was when Nagesh happened to notice a passerby <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> about how the world had fallen on bad times. The dubbing for the scenes featuring Nagesh and Ganesan was completed after the footage was shot. After viewing the sequences twice, Ganesan requested Nagarajan not to remove a single frame of Nagesh's portions from {{the final version of the}} film as he felt that they, along with Balaiah's scenes, would become a major highlight of the film.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the first}} day of trial, Cooper's bizarre {{behavior}} (such as fleeing from his defense attorney, refusing to change his prison clothes because regular clothes [...] "burned" [...] him, and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> while in the fetal position) induced the court to conduct a further competency hearing. This time the trial judge observed Cooper and heard testimony from people including lay witnesses, defendant Cooper, and a third psychologist who concluded that Cooper was incompetent. While expressing his uncertainty and not disagreeing with the psychologist, the judge ruled against Cooper and ordered the trial to proceed, finally opining: ...|$|E
2500|$|Kubrick's {{reliance}} on mirrors as visual aids for underscoring the thematic {{meaning of this}} film portrays visually the internal transformations and oppositions that are occurring to Jack Torrance psychologically. Through...these devices, Kubrick dramatizes the hotel's methodical assault on Torrance's identity, its ability to stimulate the myriad of self-doubts and anxieties by creating opportunities to warp Torrance's perspective on himself and [...] Furthermore the fact that Jack looks into a mirror whenever he [...] "speaks" [...] to the hotel means, to some extent, that Kubrick implicates him directly into the hotel's [...] "consciousness", because Jack is, in effect, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{only child}} not {{especially}} {{close to his}} parents, the young Clark had a boyhood that was often solitary, but he was generally happy. He later recalled {{that he used to}} take long walks, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> a habit he believed stood him in good stead as a broadcaster: [...] "Television is a form of soliloquy". On a modest scale Clark senior collected pictures, and the young Kenneth was allowed to rearrange the collection. He developed a competent talent for drawing, for which he later won several prizes as a schoolboy. When he was seven he was taken to an exhibition of Japanese art in London, which was a formative influence on his artistic tastes; he recalled, [...] "dumb with delight, I felt that I had entered a new world".|$|E

2500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Lennie James as Morgan Jones in a brief uncredited post-end credits cameo. It marked his third appearance in the show, after the pilot, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and the season three episode [...] "Clear". Gimple explained {{in an interview with}} The Hollywood Reporter that Morgan's appearance was the [...] "beginning of something" [...] for the character, but would not state further; he instead said, [...] "Looking at him, how he's dressed, how he's acting — it's not a 42-minute episode there — but you get some hints about where he's at. I would look at that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than the last time we saw him. He looks pretty well put together. You know, he’s not <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> I would say that, just laying eyes on him, it looks like a different Morgan." [...] Kirkman stated that Morgan was possibly following Rick's trail, as Rick left him a map in [...] "Clear". He also said that the post-credits scene was used not only to surprise the audience, but to also [...] " [...] story of this episode...into its own contiguous piece." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the marshes, {{they then}} cross the desolation {{and come to}} the Black Gate. [...] At night, Sam overhears Gollum <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> and {{plotting}} to get the Ring back. [...] Unable to do so because of the promise he made to Frodo, he resolves to allow something he refers to only as [...] "She" [...] {{to take care of his}} problem. Sam realizes that the Ring masters Gollum more than hunger. Gollum persuades Frodo and Sam not to enter the Black Gate, where they would have been surely caught. Gollum tells them of a secret entrance to Mordor. Thus, they head south into Gondor's province of Ithilien, where they get to see one of the [...] "oliphants" [...] in a battle between the men of Gondor and the Haradrim. [...] They are then accosted by a group of Gondorian rangers led by Faramir, the brother of Boromir. Frodo learns from Faramir of Boromir's death. Faramir and the Rangers lead Frodo and Sam into a secret hideout where Sam accidentally reveals to Faramir that Frodo carries the One Ring. As a result of this, Frodo reveals the plan to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Unlike his brother Boromir, Faramir resists the temptation of the Ring. Later that night, Gollum is captured diving for fish into the sacred pool. Frodo negotiates Gollum's freedom with Faramir. The following morning Faramir allows them to go on their way, but warns them that Gollum may know more about the secret entrance than he has been telling them.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} edited Garfield strips {{have been made}} {{available}} on the Internet, some hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site called the [...] "Garfield Randomizer" [...] created a three-panel strip using panels from previous Garfield strips. Another approach, known as [...] "Silent Garfield", involves removing Garfield's thought balloons from the strips. Some examples date from 2006. A webcomic called Arbuckle does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style. [...] The Arbuckle website creator writes: [...] "'Garfield' changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat's thoughts. This is the world as he sees it. This is his story". Another variation along the same lines, called [...] "Realfield" [...] or [...] "Realistic Garfield", is to redraw Garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons. Still another approach to editing the strips involves removing Garfield and other main characters from the originals completely, leaving Jon <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> While strips in this vein can be found online as early as 2006, the 2008 site Garfield Minus Garfield by Dan Walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media. Reception was largely positive: at its peak, the site received as many as 300,000 hits per day. Fans connected with Jon's [...] "loneliness and desperation" [...] and found his [...] "crazy antics" [...] humorous; Jim Davis himself called Walsh's strips an [...] "inspired thing to do" [...] and said that [...] "some of [...] work better [...] ". Ballantine Books, which publishes the Garfield books, released a volume of Garfield Minus Garfield strips on October 28, 2008. The volume retains Davis as author and features a foreword by Walsh.|$|E
