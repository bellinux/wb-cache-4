You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E

The U.S. Attorney said, [...] "Essentially the court holds that we did not abuse the bankruptcy filing, just <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> filed differently." [...] He also noted that only a minimal amount of money had been collected.|$|E
500|$|Mackintosh had two daughters, {{the second}} born {{while he was}} in Australia {{awaiting}} the Aurora's departure. On the return Barrier journey in February 1916, expecting to die, he wrote a [...] farewell message, with echoes of Captain Scott. The message concludes: [...] "If it is God's will <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> given up our lives then we do so in the British manner as our tradition holds us in honour bound to do. Goodbye, friends. I feel sure that my dear wife and children will not be neglected." [...] In 1923, Gladys Mackintosh married Joseph Stenhouse, Auroras first officer and later captain.|$|E
500|$|The cover art, {{a collage}} by Lou Beach, {{features}} a bull with the band's name branded on its rear end, while the packaging is decorated by {{images of the}} band as cowboys on a [...] "dude ranch". The gatefold packaging features a painting stating [...] "Greetings from the Blink-182 Dude Ranch," [...] which {{was intended to be}} a pastiche of both [...] "cheesy postcards" [...] and a parody of Bruce Springsteen's Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.. Art direction for the album was headed by Tim Stedman, with Stedman and graphic designer Ashley Pigford designing the package. The disc art, a revolver chamber, was designed by artist Victor Gastelum, while the band photography was done by Steven Shea. DeLonge recalled in 2012 that the only [...] "bad" [...] aspect of Dude Ranch in retrospect were the jokes found within the inside artwork: [...] "I remember sitting at the Sombrero taco shop going, 'Fuck, we’ve got to finish off our album cover, let’s just write some jokes to these cowboy pictures.' Why did we do <b>that?</b> <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had better jokes for those pictures." ...|$|E

500|$|Obama {{initially}} viewed Ryan as a Republican {{who could}} help cut the federal deficit. In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in there ... that I would agree with, {{but there are some}} ideas <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} of Overwatchs closed beta in February 2016, victory poses, among other {{elements}} {{were added to the}} characters. In March 2016, a controversy arose over Tracer's [...] "Over the Shoulder" [...] victory pose, after a user opined in the game's forums that it was out of character and that its supposed oversexualization [...] "reduces Tracer to just another bland female sex symbol". The post generated a discussion in the forums, which gaming outlets noted was civil; several users added their dissenting opinions of the pose, while others disagreed with the original poster's thoughts. Kaplan posted an apologetic response in which he announced Blizzard's plans to replace the pose, writing [...] "the last thing {{we want to do is}} make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented". The decision was met with mixed reactions from the gaming community, with some gamers arguing that Blizzard yielded its creative control over the game, censoring its content to appease an offended user, while others praised Blizzard's willingness to listen to the community and adhere to standards for portraying a character according to their personality. Kaplan later expressed that the game's development team was not [...] "entirely happy with the original pose", and had internal creative struggles about its inclusion. The following week, a replacement pose was released, although it was described by one commentator to be [...] "different, butt not by much" [...] referring to the posterior cleavage of the original pose. Jessica Lachenal of The Mary Sue website identified the replacement pose as [...] "inspired" [...] by a Billy De Vorss cheesecake pin-up illustration.s Tracer Receives New Victory Pose, Seemingly Inspired by Pin-Up Art|work=The Mary Sue|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=May 29, 2016}} Kaplan called the replacement pose [...] "a really cool, cute, playful over-the-shoulder pose [...] <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> gone with in the first place".|$|E

Their leader, Pat Robertson, has written <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a world government but only when the messiah arrives.

2500|$|The UN {{resolution}} {{does not}} specifically mention the Palestinians. The United Kingdom had recognized the union between the West Bank and Transjordan. Lord Caradon {{said that the}} parties assumed that withdrawal from occupied territories as provided in the resolution was applicable to East Jerusalem. [...] "Nevertheless so important {{is the future of}} Jerusalem that it might be argued <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> specifically dealt with that issue in the 1967 Resolution.

2500|$|A newer {{convention}} of parkour philosophy {{has been the}} idea of [...] "human reclamation". Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as [...] "a means of reclaiming {{what it means to}} be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it." [...] Another traceur writes, [...] "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour." ...|$|E

[...] About Chattopadhayay's 1977 book, Science and Society in Ancient India, he said: [...] "I feel that you have entirely proved your case that the Caraka-samhita and the Susruta-samhita have an ambiguous character, which, when dissected, reveals the intense struggle between the theological philosophers on the one hand, and the doctors who strove for a truly scientific view of the world, on the other. It is unmistakably a chapter in the 'warfare of science with religion'...I do feel that your philological and philosophical analysis has been here a really splendid contribution." ...|$|E
2500|$|A week later, on February 23, the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee {{convened a}} meeting to invite Fluke to speak. Fluke offered {{testimony}} in support of President Obama's ruling that religiously affiliated institutions such as universities and hospitals should provide insurance plans that cover all costs for medicinal contraceptives. During her testimony, Fluke stated, [...] "We did not expect that women would be told in the national media <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> gone to school elsewhere" [...] to receive contraception coverage. [...] "We refuse to pick between a quality education and our health," [...] she said. Fluke further stated that 40% of Georgetown Law School's female population suffered financial hardship {{as a result of}} birth control not being covered by the student health insurance plan, and that the lack of contraception coverage in the university insurance plans would induce many low-income students to go without contraceptives. She said that the women of Georgetown, other religious schools, and employees of religious institutions such as hospitals have endured [...] "financial, emotional and medical burdens because of this lack of contraceptive coverage". She mentioned friends affected by such policies, citing a friend with polycystic ovary syndrome. Fluke stated this friend needed contraceptive hormones costing over $100 per month to treat the disease, and that while PcOS was [...] "covered by Georgetown insurance", the insurance company repeatedly denied contraceptives because they suspected the purpose of the medication was for contraceptive uses.|$|E

2500|$|At last, in 1223, Henry V {{executed}} a deed, {{by which he}} appointed his nephew his successor in {{all that remained of}} the allodial domains of the duchies of Saxony and Bavaria, and also in the private fiefs which he held as an individual {{in other parts of the}} empire. These states, however, constituted so small a portion of the former wealth of his illustrious house, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> thought there was scarcely a pretext for either envy or alarm in the breast of his enemy, yet when the Emperor, Frederick II, was made acquainted with the intentions of the Count Palatine, [...] he [...] began [...] to [...] intrigue [...] with [...] his daughters. That he might have a pretense for depriving Otto of the succession at his uncle's death, he purchased from Irmgard, the Margravine of Baden and Agnes, the Duchess of Bavaria their claims as the only issue of the Duke of Saxony; and no sooner was the death of Henry announced, than the King of the Romans was dispatched with an imperial force to take possession of the city and territory of Brunswick. But Otto had been regularly acknowledged by the states as their legitimate sovereign and had been received as such by the city and principality. They therefore joined him heartily in repelling this invasion, and the king and his array were compelled to retire, without being able to effect the object which the emperor had in view.|$|E
2500|$|The British Army drew {{many of its}} raw {{recruits}} {{from the}} lowest classes of Britain. Since army life {{was known to be}} harsh, and the remuneration low, it attracted mainly those for whom civilian life was worse. The Duke of Wellington himself said that many of the men [...] "enlist from having got bastard children – some for minor offences – some for drink". They were, he once said, [...] "the scum of the earth; it is really wonderful <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> made them to the fine fellows they are." [...] In Scotland however, a number of men enlisted due to the collapse of the weaving trade and came from skilled artisan or even middle-class households. Most soldiers at the time signed on for life in exchange for a [...] "bounty" [...] of £2317s6d, a lot of which was absorbed by the cost of outfitting [...] "necessities", but a system of 'limited service' (seven years for infantry, ten for cavalry and artillery) was introduced in 1806 to attract recruits. Soldiers began, from 1800 onward, to receive a daily Beer money allowance in addition to their regular wages; the practice was started on the orders of the Duke of York. Additionally, corporal punishment was removed for a large number of petty offences (while it was still retained for serious derelictions of duty) and the Shorncliffe System for light infantry was established in 1803, teaching skirmishing, self-reliance and initiative. Unlike other armies of the time, the British did not use conscription to bolster army numbers, with enlistment remaining voluntary.|$|E
