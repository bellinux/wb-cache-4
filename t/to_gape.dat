5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted it is likely <b>to</b> <b>gape</b> in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower {{than that of a}} typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behaviour}} of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability <b>to</b> <b>gape</b> indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items. Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct Cylindraspis land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.|$|E
500|$|Debate {{continues}} {{as to how}} Smilodon killed its prey. Traditionally, the most popular {{theory is that the}} cat delivered a deep stabbing bite or open-jawed stabbing thrust to the throat, generally cutting through the jugular vein and/or the trachea and thus killing the prey very quickly. Another hypothesis suggests that Smilodon targeted the belly of its prey. This is disputed, as the curvature of their prey's belly would likely have prevented the cat from getting a good bite or stab. In regard to how Smilodon delivered its bite, the [...] "canine shear-bite" [...] hypothesis has been favored, where flexion of the neck and rotation of the skull assisted in biting the prey, but this may be mechanically impossible. The mandibular flanges may have helped resist bending forces when the mandible was pulled against the hide of a prey. The protruding incisors were arranged in an arch, and were used to hold the prey still and stabilize it while the canine bite was delivered. The contact surface between the canine crown and the gum was enlarged, which helped stabilize the tooth and helped the cat sense when the tooth had penetrated to its maximum extent. Since saber-toothed cats generally had a relatively large infraorbital foramen (opening) in the skull, which housed nerves associated with the whiskers, it has been suggested the improved senses would have helped the cats' precision when biting outside their field of vision, and thereby prevent breakage of the canines. The blade-like carnassial teeth were used to cut skin to access the meat, and the reduced molars suggest that they were less adapted for crushing bones than modern cats. As the food of modern cats enters the mouth through the side while cutting with the carnassials, not the front incisors between the canines, the animals do not need <b>to</b> <b>gape</b> widely, so the canines of Smilodon would likewise not have been a hindrance when feeding.|$|E

2500|$|The Banu Nadir left on 600 camels, parading through Medina to {{the music}} of pipes and tambourines.

People lined up <b>to</b> <b>gape</b> at them." [...] Most of Banu Nadir found refuge among the Jews of Khaybar, while others emigrated to Syria. According to Ibn Ishaq, the chiefs of Nadir who went to Khaybar were Sallam b. Abu'l-Huqayq, Kenana ibn al-Rabi and Huyayy b. Akhtab. When these chiefs arrived in Khaybar, the Jewish inhabitants of Khaybar became subject to them.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of switching activity patterns {{in a central}} pattern generator is fundamental to the generation of diverse motor behaviors. Based on {{what is known about}} a brainstem substrate mediating the oral components of ingestion and rejection, we use computational techniques to construct a hypothetical multifunctional network that switches between the motor outputs of ingestion (licking) and rejection (gaping). The network is constructed using single-compartment conductance-based models for individual neurons based on Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. Using a fast-slow reduction and geometric analysis we describe a mechanism for pattern switching between licks and gapes. The model supports the hypothesis that a single configuration of network connections can produce both activity patterns. It further predicts that prolonged inhibition of some network neurons could lead to a switch in network activity from licks <b>to</b> <b>gapes.</b> Motor Pattern Switching 3...|$|R
