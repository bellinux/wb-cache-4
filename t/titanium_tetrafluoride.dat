40|$|The present review summarises {{the effects}} of <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (TiF(4)) on the {{development}} and progression of carious and erosive lesions. The mode of action of TiF(4) {{is due to the}} formation of an acid-stable surface layer, which provides mechanical protection to the surface, and to an increased fluoride uptake, which might chemically reduce demineralisation of dental hard tissues. Most in vitro studies showed that TiF(4) is effective in reducing the formation of carious and erosive enamel and dentine lesions. Thereby, TiF(4) was equally or more effective than sodium fluoride (NaF), amine fluoride (AmF) or stannous fluoride (SnF(2)). While clinical data confirm the caries-preventive effect, clinical trials analysing the anti-erosive effect of TiF(4) are lacking. Few data available from in situ studies revealed conflicting results by showing either no effect or a beneficial effect of TiF(4) on enamel erosion. Even though research focused on TiF(4), there is also evidence to show that other metal fluorides, such as zirconium and hafnium tetrafluorides, affect enamel and dentine demineralisation. CONCLUSION: The potential of TiF(4) to prevent acid demineralisation requires further research to confirm the promising in vitro results obtained by in situ studies and clinical trials...|$|E

Thirteen subjects took part in this cross-over, split-mouth, double-blind study performed in three phases of 14 d each. In each subject, two sound and two predemineralized specimens of bovine enamel were worn intra-orally and plaque accumulation was allowed. One sound and one predemineralized specimen in each subject was treated once with sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish or solution (Treatment A); TiF 4 varnish or solution (Treatment B); or placebo varnish or no treatment (Treatment C). The initially sound enamel specimens were exposed to severe cariogenic challenge (20 % sucrose, eight times daily for 5 min each time), whereas the predemineralized specimens were not. Eleven subjects were able to finish all experimental phases. The enamel alterations were quantified by surface hardness and transversal microradiography. Demineralization of previously sound enamel was reduced by all test formulations except for the NaF solution, while both TiF 4 formulations were as effective as NaF varnish. For the predemineralized specimens, enamel surface hardness was increased only by TiF 4 formulations, while subsurface mineral remineralization could not be seen in any group.

Twelve volunteers participated in this double-blind, randomized crossover study. Six enamel specimens were positioned in intraoral appliances throughout four treatment stages: 4 % TiF 4 varnish (experimental varnish), 5 % sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish (Duraphat ®), placebo varnish, and negative control (deionized water). After 24 h, the varnishes were removed and plaques were allowed to accumulate. A 20 % sucrose solution was dripped onto enamel blocks (10 x/day). Enamel alterations were analyzed by surface microhardness (SMH), percentage of surface loss (%SML), cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Student’s paired t-test was used for SMH analysis and repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for %SML and CSMH (∆Z) analyses (p-value= 0. 05).

40|$|Dental erosion {{develops}} through {{chronic exposure}} to extrinsic/intrinsic acids {{with a low}} pH. Enamel erosion {{is characterized by a}} centripetal dissolution leaving a small demineralized zone behind. In contrast, erosive demineralization in dentin is more complex as the acid-induced mineral dissolution leads to the exposure of collagenous organic matrix, which hampers ion diffusion and, thus, reduces further progression of the lesion. Topical fluoridation inducing the formation of a protective layer on dental hard tissue, which is composed of CaF(2) (in case of conventional fluorides like amine fluoride or sodium fluoride) or of metal-rich surface precipitates (in case of <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> or tin-containing fluoride products), appears to be most effective on enamel. In dentin, the preventive effect of fluorides is highly dependent on the presence of the organic matrix. In situ studies have shown a higher protective potential of fluoride in enamel compared to dentin, probably as the organic matrix is affected by enzymatical and chemical degradation as well as by abrasive influences in the clinical situation. There is convincing evidence that fluoride, in general, can strengthen teeth against erosive acid damage, and high-concentration fluoride agents and/or frequent applications are considered potentially effective approaches in preventing dental erosion. The use of tin-containing fluoride products might provide the best approach for effective prevention of dental erosion. Further properly designed in situ or clinical studies are recommended in order to better understand the relative differences in performance of the various fluoride agents and formulations...|$|E

Aim: Compare the effects of mouthrinses with different active agents in the prevention of initial dental erosion caused by HCl. Subjects and Methods: Casein (CAS at 0. 2 %), sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP at 0. 02 %), <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (TiF 4 at 0. 34 %), and stannous fluoride (SnF 2 at 0. 87 %) were individually added to an experimental mouthrinse. The mouthrinse without additives was used as the negative control (C) and a commercially available mouthrinse for erosion (ELM - Elmex ®) as the reference product. Enamel specimens were exposed to human saliva and randomly assigned to 6 experimental groups (n = 8). Specimens were submitted to erosion in HCl for 10 s, followed by to the experimental mouthrinses for 30 s, and artificial saliva for 60 min. This cycle was repeated 3 times. The total amounts of calcium and phosphorus released by the specimens in the 2 nd and 3 rd erosive challenges were evaluated by atomic emission spectrometry. Statistical analysis used Shapiro-Wilks and Hartley tests, followed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. Results: When compared with C, ELM and HMP presented significantly less calcium in solution, with no difference between them.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fluoride in caries prevention has been convincingly proven. In recent years, researchers {{have investigated the}} preventive effects of different fluoride formulations on erosive tooth wear with positive results, but their action on caries and erosion prevention {{must be based on}} different requirements, because there is no sheltered area in the erosive process as there is in the subsurface carious lesions. Thus, any protective mechanism from fluoride concerning erosion is limited to the surface or the near surface layer of enamel. However, reports on other protective agents show superior preventive results. The mechanism of action of tin-containing products is related to tin deposition onto the tooth surface, as well as the incorporation of tin into the near-surface layer of enamel. These tin-rich deposits are less susceptible to dissolution and may result in enhanced protection of the underlying tooth. <b>Titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> forms a protective layer on the tooth surface. It is believed that this layer is made up of hydrated hydrogen titanium phosphate. Products containing phosphates and/or proteins may adsorb either to the pellicle, rendering it more protective against demineralization, or directly to the dental hard tissue, probably competing with H(+) at specific sites on the tooth surface. Other substances may further enhance precipitation of calcium phosphates on the enamel surface, protecting it from additional acid impacts. Hence, the future of fluoride alone in erosion prevention looks grim, but the combination of fluoride with protective agents, such as polyvalent metal ions and some polymers, has much brighter prospects...|$|E

As expected, a synergistic effect that remarkably enhancing the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of gaseous styrene by the prepared composite photocatalysts was observed in comparison with that the degradation efficiency using pure anatase TiO 2 and the adsorption of CNTs. Similar results were also confirmed in the decolorization of liquid methyl orange. Further investigation demonstrated that the synergistic effect in the photocatalytic activity was related to the structure of the sub-micrometer-sized anatase TiO 2 spheres and the significant roles of CNTs in the composite photocatalysts. By controlling the content of CNTs, the content of TiO 2 or the temperature during the hydrothermal synthesis process, anatase TiO 2 spheres with controllable crystallite size and dominant crystal facets such as { 001 }, { 101 }, or polycrystalline could be obtained, which was beneficial for the increase in the synergistic effect and further enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiencies.

40|$|Objective: This {{in vitro}} study aimed {{to analyze the}} {{influence}} of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) laser irradiation on the efficacy of <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (TiF(4)) and amine fluoride (AmF) in protecting enamel and dentin against erosion. Methods: Bovine enamel and dentin samples were pretreated with carbon dioxide (CO(2)) laser irradiation only (group I), TiF(4) only (1 % F, group II), CO(2) laser irradiation before (group III) or through (group IV) TiF(4) application, AmF only (1 % F, group V), or CO(2) laser irradiation before (group VI) or through (group VII) AmF application. Controls remained untreated. Ten samples of each group were then subjected to an erosive demineralization and remineralization cycling for 5 days. Enamel and dentin loss were measured profilometrically after pretreatment, 4 cycles (1 day), and 20 cycles (5 days) and statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and Scheffe's post hoc tests. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed in pretreated but not cycled samples (two samples each group). Results: After 20 cycles, there was significantly less enamel loss in groups V and IV and significantly less dentin loss in group V only. All other groups {{were not significantly different}} from the controls. Lased surfaces (group I) appeared unchanged in the SEM images, although SEM images of enamel but not of dentin showed that CO(2) laser irradiation affected the formation of fluoride precipitates. Conclusion: AmF decreased enamel and dentin erosion, but CO(2) laser irradiation did not improve its efficacy. TiF(4) showed only a limited capacity to prevent erosion, but CO(2) laser irradiation significantly enhanced its ability to reduce enamel erosion.

Therefore, {{we compared the}} cytotoxicity of TiF 4 with sodium fluoride (NaF) (already applied in Dentistry) considering different fluoride concentrations, pH values and experimental models. Step 1) NIH/ 3 T 3 fibroblasts were exposed to mediums containing NaF or TiF 4 (from 0. 15 to 2. 45 % F), both at native and adjusted pH, for 6 h. Step 2) NIH/ 3 T 3 were exposed to NaF or TiF 4 varnishes with 0. 95, 1. 95 or 2. 45 % F (native pH), for 6, 12 or 24 h. We applied MTT (1 st and 2 nd steps) and Hoescht/PI stain (2 nd step) assays. Step 3) NIH/ 3 T 3 were exposed to NaF or TiF 4 varnish (2. 45 % F), at native pH, for 6 or 12 h. The cell stiffness was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Step 1) All cells exposed to NaF or TiF 4 mediums died, regardless of the F concentration and pH. Step 2) Both varnishes, at 1. 90 and 2. 45 % F, reduced cell viability by similar extents (33 - 86 % at 6 h, 35 - 93 % at 12 h, and 87 - 98 % at 24 h) compared with control, regardless {{of the type of}} fluoride. Varnishes with 0. 95 % F did not differ from control. Step 3) TiF 4 and NaF reduced cell stiffness to a similar extent, but only TiF 4 differed from control at 6 h. Based on the results of the 3 experimental steps, we conclude that TiF 4 and NaF have similar cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity was dependent on F concentration and exposure time.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (TiF 4) varnish and {{evaluate}} the stability of the formulation and its reactivity with dental enamel. The varnish was prepared in a resinous matrix using ethanol 96 % as solvent. Samples (n= 45) were aged at 65 °C and 30 % of relativity humidity (RE n° 01 / 05 - ANVISA) and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, nine samples were removed for evaluation and compared with fresh samples. Chemical stability of TiF 4 varnish was determinate by 19 F-NMR and the reactivity of the formulation was quantified by formation of fluoride loosely (CaF 2) and firmly bound (fluorapatite; FA) to enamel. For reactivity comparisons, a varnish without TiF 4 was used as control. The loss of soluble fluoride was about 0. 9 % after one year of storage. The values of the reactivity (mean±S. D.) of fresh, aged at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and control samples were: CaF 2 (μgF/mm 2) : 89. 3 ± 27. 5 a; 54. 5 ± 14. 3 b; 51. 2 ± 29. 8 b; 69. 3 ± 21. 3 a; 48. 0 ± 27. 4 b; 0. 10 ± 0. 07 c, FA (μg F/g) : 2477. 5 ± 1044. 0 a; 2484. 8 ± 992. 0 a; 2580. 0 ± 1383. 9 a; 2517. 2 ± 929. 9 a; 2121. 0 ± 1059. 2 a; 330. 0 ± 180. 0 b, respectively.

40|$|The {{prevention}} of dental erosion with fluoride is still largely unknown territory. It was {{the aim of}} this study to determine the erosion-inhibiting effect of topical neutral 1 % sodium fluoride (NaF) application and an application of a 4 % <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (TiF 4) solution compared with no treatment. Ten bovine incisors were selected and three enamel samples prepared from each tooth. One sample from each tooth was assigned to one of three experimental groups. The experimental treatments were: no fluoride application (control); 4 min application of neutral 1 % NaF gel; and 4 min application of 4 % TiF 4 solution. All of the specimens were repeatedly exposed to 50 mm citric acid solution containing 0. 4 mm CaCl 2, and 2. 2 mm KH 2 PO 4 at pH 3. 0 over four consecutive days. The acid exposure was performed in intervals and the intensity was increased over the days of the experiment. Enamel dissolution was determined by calcium content measurement of the acid solution after exposure, using atomic absorption spectroscopy. A statistically significant erosion-inhibiting effect was found for both NaF and TiF 4 treatments compared with the control group from an erosion exposure time of 3 min. The reduction of calcium loss, however, was higher for the TiF 4 -treated specimens than the NaF-treated. From 16 min of erosion exposure, the erosion-inhibiting effect was significantly stronger in the TiF 4 than the NaF group. The relative reduction of calcium loss compared with the control group remained stable for the TiF 4 group, whereas for the NaF group the relative reduction decreased with cumulative erosion time. It is concluded that topical TiF 4 application provides a potential treatment option in erosion prevention. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This in situ/ex vivo study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (TiF 4) on permanent human enamel subjected to erosion. Design: Ten volunteers took part in this study performed in two phases. In the first phase (ERO), they wore acrylic palatal appliances containing two enamel blocks, divided into two rows: TiF 4 (F) and no-TiF 4 (no-F). During the 1 st day, {{the formation of a}} salivary pellicle was allowed. In the 2 nd day, the TiF 4 solution was applied on one row (ERO + F), whereas on the other row no treatment was performed (ERO + no-F). From 3 rd until 7 th day, the blocks were subjected to erosion, 4 x per day. In the 2 nd phase (no-ERO), the volunteers wore acrylic palatal appliances containing one enamel block, during 2 days, to assess the effect of TiF 4 only (no-ERO + F). Enamel alterations were determined using profilometry (wear), microhardness (%SMHC) tests, scanning electron microscope and microprobe analysis. The %SMHC and wear were tested using ANOVA and Tukey`s post hoc tests (p < 0. 05). Results: The mean of %SMHC and wear (mu m) values (+/- S. D.) were, respectively: ERO + F - 73. 32 +/- 5. 16 (A) / 2. 40 +/- 0. 60 (a); ERO + no-F - 83. 49 +/- 4. 59 B/ 1. 17 +/- 0. 48 (b) and no-ERO + F - 67. 92 +/- 6. 16 (A) / 0. 21 :E 0. 09 (c). In microscope analysis, the no-F group showed enamel with honeycomb appearance. For F groups, it was observed a surface coating with microcracks. The microprobe analysis revealed the presence of the following elements (%) in groups ERO + F, ERO + no-F and no-ERO + F, respectively: Ca (69. 9, 72. 5, 66. 25); P (25. 9, 26. 5, 26. 06); Ti (3. 0, 0, 5. 93).

Background data: The effect of Nd:YAG laser irradiation on NaF and AmF was analyzed; however, there is no available data on the interaction between Nd:YAG laser irradiation and TiF(4). Methods: Bovine enamel specimens were pre-treated with NaF varnish, TiF(4) varnish, NaF solution, TiF(4) solution, placebo varnish, Nd:YAG (84. 9 J/cm(2)), Nd:YAG prior to or through NaF varnish, Nd:YAG prior to or through TiF(4) varnish, Nd:YAG prior to or through NaF solution, Nd:YAG prior to or through TiF(4) solution, and Nd:YAG prior to or through placebo varnish. Controls remained untreated. Ten specimens in each group were then subjected to an erosive demineralization (Sprite Zero, 4 x 90 s/day) and remineralization (artificial saliva, between the erosive cycles) cycling for 5 days. Enamel loss was measured profilometrically (mu m). Additionally, treated but non-eroded specimens were additionally analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (each group n- 2). The data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (p < 0. 05). Results: Only TiF(4) varnish (1. 8 +/- 0. 6 mu m), laser prior to TiF(4) varnish (1. 7 +/- 0. 3 mu m) and laser prior to TiF(4) solution (1. 4 +/- 0. 3 mu m) significantly reduced enamel erosion compared to the control (4. 1 +/- 0. 6 mu m). SEM pictures showed that specimens treated with TiF(4) varnish presented a surface coating. Conclusions: Nd:YAG laser irradiation was not effective against enamel erosion {{and it did not}} have any influence on the efficacy of F, except for TiF(4) solution. On the other hand, TiF(4) varnish protected against enamel erosion, without the influence of laser irradiation.

40|$|Biocompatible anatase TiO 2 single-crystals with 27 % [...] 50 % {{chemically}} reactive facets {{were obtained}} in 90 minutes {{by using a}} microwave-assisted method. The preparation involved an aqueous solution of <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> and an ionic liquid (1 -methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate). The as-obtained TiO 2 single-crystals exhibited a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal shape. By simply changing the concentration of the ionic liquid, the level of reactive facets can be continuously tuned from 27 % to 50 %. The use of microwave heating is critical as it allows rapid and uniform heating of the reaction mixture. The TiO 2 single-crystals were characterized by XRD, TEM, XPS and FESEM. The products exhibited excellent photocatalytic efficiency for both oxidation of nitric oxide in air and degradation of organic compounds in aqueous solution under UV light irradiation. The relationship between the physicochemical properties and the photocatalytic performance of the samples was discussed. The TiO 2 single-crystals {{were found to be}} nontoxic using Zebrafish (D. rerio) as a model. Bismuth oxyhalide semiconductors (BiOBr, BiOCl) with marigold-like open architectures were also prepared by a solvothermal method involving imidazolium-based ionic liquids and ethylene glycol. The 3 D self-assembled marigold-like materials were effective photocatalysts for degrading organic pollutants and generating hydrogen. The main advantages of the new materials were large surface area, high surface-to-bulk ratio, facile species transportation, and ease of recovery and regeneration. By using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method involving <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> and a tetrafluoroborate-based ionic liquid (1 -butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium-tetrafluoroborate), a micro-sheet anatase TiO 2 single crystal photocatalyst with remarkable 80 % reactive facets was synthesized. The as-obtained TiO 2 single-crystal exhibited a truncated tetragonal bipyramidal shape. The high reactivity of facets made these single crystals highly photocatalytically active. They were easily recyclable and thermally stable up to 800 °C. Furthermore, a simple and environmentally benign approach for the synthesis of photocatalytically active rutile TiO 2 mesocrystals was developed. It was a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method involving titanium(III) chloride as the only reactant. The resulting 1 D rutile nanowires could easily assemble into 3 D hierarchical architectures without the help of surfactants or additives. The average aspect ratio for the nanowires was 267. The BET specific surface area of the mesocrystal was 16 m 2 /g. Part I: Size-tunable monodispersed hierarchical metallic Ni nanocrystals (58 - 190 nm in diameter) were prepared by the reduction of Ni 2 + with hexadecylamine under atmospheric pressure. The diameter of the particles could be tuned by simply changing the reaction time. A reaction mechanism was proposed and the relationships between the size, hierarchical surfaces and the magnetic properties were investigated. The as synthesized Ni crystals exhibited higher coercivities than the bulk metallic material owing to the reduced size and the hierarchical surface structure. The saturation magnetization (Ms) and the ratio of remanence to saturation (Mr/Ms) increased with increasing particle size. Part II: A facile microwave-assisted solvothermal method was developed for the controlled synthesis of novel 3 D CdS structures. Dendrite-, star-, popcorn- and hollow sphere-like CdS structures could be obtained by changing the reaction conditions including the reaction temperature and the amounts of reagents and solvents. The results revealed that the final structures were related to the solvent properties such as surface tension and viscosity. The degree of supersaturation was also responsible for the morphology variation and it could be adjusted by the reaction temperature. The CdS products with different morphologies exhibited interesting shape-dependent optical properties and photocatalytic activities. The optical band energy of the product exhibited an obvious red-shift of 0. 2 eV with aspect to that of pure rutile TiO 2. This red-shift effect may be ascribed to the high aspect ratio of the rutile nanowires. The products showed excellent photocatalytic activity for NO removal in air and the activity was well maintained after three cycles. Gold modification on the rutile TiO 2 resulted in a 50 % improvement in the photocatalytic performance. This thesis focuses primarily on the preparation of various functional materials with controllable structures and properties. The first part describes the synthesis of materials by solvothermal methods. The second part describes the rapid fabrication of novel semiconductor materials by microwave-assisted methods.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho, cruzado, duplo-cego, realizado in situ, foi avaliar o esmalte dental humano submetido a um grande desafio cariogênico após aplicação de tetrafluoreto de titânio (TiF 4) a 1 %. Para isso, 5 voluntários utilizaram dispositivos intrabucais superiores contendo 80 fragmentos dentais durante 2 etapas (TiF 4 e Controle) de 14 dias cada, gotejando 8 vezes ao dia glicose 25 %. Após o uso, o esmalte foi submetido à análise através da MEV (microscopia eletrônica de varredura) e a MDT (microdureza em corte transversal) em 5 posições até a profundidade de 100 µm da superfície anatômica do dente. Os resultados não revelaram diferença significativa entre esmalte decíduo e permanente. Os dados da MDT, submetidos à análise de variância multifatorial também não revelaram efeito significativo do TiF 4, porém, através da MEV, verificou-se diferença entre TiF 4 e Controle com p = 0, 027 (teste do qui-quadrado). O número de lesões brandas era igual para os dois grupos, porém no Controle haviam 10 fragmentos com esmalte sem cárie e 18 com lesões severas contra 20 e 8 respectivamente do grupo TiF 4. Os dados permitem sugerir que o TiF 4 modificou o padrão da lesão formada amenizando-a, sendo necessários novos estudos definindo esse efeito em termos de profundidade. The {{purpose of}} this in situ, double blind, {{crossover}} study was to compare the effectiveness of an application of <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (TiF 4) on deciduous and permanent enamel submitted to highly cariogenic conditions. Five volunteers used palatal appliances with 80 sections of teeth during two phases (TiF 4 and Control) of 14 days each. They dropped 25 % glucose on the sections, eight times per day. After that, the enamel was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the Knoop Hardness Number (KHN) was determined at five different depths, up to 100 µm. The results revealed that differences between deciduous and permanent enamel were not significant. The KHN (Multiple Range Analysis) did not show a significant TiF 4 effect, but SEM (Chi Square Test) results revealed differences between TiF 4 and the Control group with p value = 0. 027. There were equal numbers of incipient lesions in both groups, but there were 10 caries-free sections and 18 severe lesions in the Control group, against 20 and 8 in the TiF 4 group, respectively.

Application of the volume-based approach to thermodynamics (VBT) offers a means, for the first time, of exploring the energetics surrounding these materials and in the thermodynamic section a discussion of this new approach is provided. It emerges that the basis of the thermodynamic driving force of formation of [TiF 3 L 3][SbF 6](s) salts, that enforces the unfavourable [Delta H degrees =+ 237 (+/- 20) kJ mol(- 1) ] fluoride ion transfer from the Lewis acid TiF 4 (s) to SbF 5 (l) to give the hypothetical [TiF 3](+) [SbF 6](-) (s), is the higher Ti - L (L = ligand) bond energy in the cationic complexes [TiF 3 L 3](+) as compared to that in the molecular adducts TiF 4 L 2 (s) and SbF 5 L(s) so giving rise to larger enthalpies of complexation of [TiF 3](+) (g) by 3 L(g) compared to those for complexation of TiF 4 (g) by 2 L(g) and SbF 5 (g) by 1 L(g). Formation of the trans-[TiF 2 (15 -Crown- 5) ](2 +) and trans-[TiF 2 (18 -Crown- 6) ](2 +) is accounted for the stabilization of [TiF 2](2 +) cation by the five donor acceptor Ti - O contacts and the accompanying positive charge delocalization. Cationic titanium(IV) complexes fac-[TiF 3 (MeCN) (3 -n) L-n](+) (n = 0 - 3) and cis-[TiF 3 (18 -Crown- 6) ](+), trans-[TiF 2 (Crown) ](2 +) (Crown = 15 -Crown- 5 and 18 -Crown- 6) were obtained in MeCN solution by the reaction of fac-[TiF 3 (MeCN) (3) ](+) and L = Et 2 O, THF, H 2 O or crown ethers.
