40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the colonial experience (1945 - 1997) on the planning of <b>secondary</b> <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> in Hong Kong. Specifically, the origins of <b>secondary</b> <b>technical</b> institutions and their positioning in <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> are examined. Primary source materials are used as the basis of investigation and analysis, supplemented by secondary sources. The study finds that the origins and form of <b>secondary</b> <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> in Hong Kong mirrored those of <b>secondary</b> <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> in the British tripartite school system (grammar, technical, and modern). The breakdown of the tripartite school system in Britain might have led the colonial government not to adopt the full British model of <b>secondary</b> <b>technical</b> <b>education.</b> Nevertheless, the British tripartite school system had a long-term impact on the development of <b>secondary</b> <b>technical</b> schools in Hong Kong. Following the end of colonial rule, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government initiated education reform, which brought an end to curriculum differentiation by school types (grammar, technical, and prevocational) and replaced it with comprehensive education. © 2011 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|The Werner-Cravatte {{government}} (1964-1969) {{once again}} saw {{an urgent need}} to reform the education system, due to economic and social changes. The government attempted to respond by diversifying the types of Lycées in existence. 1965 saw the creation of middle schools (écoles moyennes): these were intended to cater to young people not quite suited for a university education, in order {{to prepare them for}} mid-level careers in the administration or the private sector, and to take the weight off the over-crowded Lycées. May 1968 also saw unrest in Luxembourg: the students of the cours supérieurs went on strike, demanding a reform of higher education and the awarding of academic degrees. The Werner-Cravatte government drafted a law which would not, however, come to a vote until the next government was in office. The Werner-Cravatte Ministry did introduce changes in the secondary education system: it aligned girls' education—previously in separate Lycées—with that of boys, and introduced co-education. Secondary education (as opposed to <b>technical</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education)</b> was unified: two streams could be chosen, [...] "classical" [...] with Latin, and [...] "modern", without Latin.

Most importantly, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique is presented and then applied {{to a wide range of}} EU and OECD countries, with a special focus on Slovenia and Croatia, to evaluate the <b>technical</b> efficiency of <b>secondary</b> <b>education.</b> The empirical results show that <b>technical</b> efficiency in <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> varies significantly across the great majority of EU and OECD countries. Many EU countries, including Slovenia and Croatia, show a relatively high level of technical inefficiency in their <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> as they respectively only rank in the last two quartiles among selected countries.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the school that began <b>technical</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> in the Province of Ontario, Canada. It is an {{historical}} case study that seeks {{to understand why the}} Toronto Technical School (TTS) was established, how it functioned for 13 years, and why it was amalgamated with public secondary education in 1904. This case history analyzes the rationale and purposes behind this first school and considers the impact of provincial control. TTS played a role that directly influenced provincial legislation which resulted in the formal recognition, public funding, and eventually, the inclusion of technical education in the public school system. The TTS still exists today and serves as a reminder of the original vision of a school designed and created for technical education. The findings of this study prompt critical questioning of the need to continue separate educational space {{in the absence of the}} kind of support needed to make it a challenging and worthwhile option for students...|$|E
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries {{have relied on}} the varied forms of diversified secondary technical education as the main venue for training skilled workers and mid-level technicians. But {{there have been numerous}} and strong critics against this mode of technical education. As an alternative, the Mexican government established the CONALEP system (el Colegio National de Educacion Profesional Tecnica), a new vocational and technical education system) in the late 1970 's. This report tests the viability of the system by evaluating CONALEP graduates'labor market performance in comparison with other forms of education. It also supplements the scant literature on the transition from technical education to work and on the use of technical skills. Although it is a Mexican program, the special features of the CONALEP system bear policy implications for other countries as well. With globalization and the rapidly changing technology requirements of the Mexican economy, however, this alternative form of <b>technical</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> faces new challenges, notably adjustment of its curriculum to changing market circumstances and improvement of its external and internal efficiency.

This study explores the impact of these graphic organizers on learning in science classes in secondary education. An experiment was set up in a geography class in general- oriented <b>technical</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> in Belgium. One teacher taught four class groups (n= 77) on continental drift for three lessons of 50 minutes, and ended with a 10 -minute presentation that reviewed the topic. In the two control class groups, this review was presented using slideware, which was in line with the guidelines of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. In the two experimental class groups, the teacher presented an animated version of the review, which outlined the material via graphic organizers. Findings indicate that there is no significant difference in learning outcomes, self-efficacy, cognitive load and two motivational variables (attitude toward behaviour, intrinsic motivation), but the control version scored higher on perceived usefulness...|$|E

40|$|Belgium {{is one of}} {{the main}} investors in {{development}} education and awareness raising (DEAR) in Europe. Previous research suggested that in the current DEAR activities provided by development NGOs, for-profit private actors and vocational and <b>technical</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> (VTSE) receive less attention. This study picks up where previous research left off: it puts on trial the hypothesis of two underserved target groups, and explores if and why the current supply of DEAR fails to reach these target groups. Firstly, the study does not find strong indications that the current DEAR supply is underserving VTSE. A large proportion of DEAR offered by Belgian NGOs targets secondary education, and there is no evidence that VTSE is excluded from accessing it. On the contrary, NGOs have increased their efforts to involve VTSE in their DEAR activities. The bigger question however seems to be how much of this DEAR is actually developed for and truly adapted to VTSE audiences. Secondly, the study confirms that DEAR targeting for-profit private sector is scarce, and often fails to connect with its audience. With relatively few bridges between the development NGOs and the private sector, interaction is hindered by image problems, mismatches between NGO and business attitudes as well as daily managament practices and by a lack of knowledge of the other. The study discusses different initiatives that attempt to overcome these challenges. Finally, an issue raised by both target groups, is that target group specialisation in DEAR risks diverting the efforts from a truly ‘tailored’ approach that respects the diversity within both of these groups. nrpages: 34 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Luxembourg has a well {{differentiated}} {{and highly}} complex national vocational training system. Like many other countries, Luxembourg has a binary secondary education system, {{consisting of the}} largely institutionally separate areas of classical general education (secondaire générale) and rather more practical vocational training (secondaire technique). In the school year 2012 – 2013, there were 12, 958 pupils enrolled in general secondary education (33 %) and 26, 627 in <b>technical</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> (67 %). In the Luxembourg vocational education system at least four different qualifications can be distinguished; these are associated with very different possibilities for routes to subsequent education, such as {{access to higher education}} or training as a master craftsman. As compared to the other options, the régime technique provides the best opportunity to start university studies or, after one year of vocational training, to begin to train as a master craftsman. Of particular interest at the moment is the 2008 reform of vocational training, which is being implemented in stages between 2010 and 2015 and which is focusing more on skills and work processes, providing a more modular structure to the training and a more systematic combination of on-the-job- and school-based learning phases. International influences on the Luxembourg vocational training system are visible at different levels: first, the Luxembourg system itself contains elements of the dual German system and the more school-orientated and predominantly state-organised French system. Secondly, international cooperation with neighbouring countries – especially cross-border dual training – is essential because of the country's small size and the small number of qualified vocational trainers. Thirdly, the predominantly German-speaking Luxembourg vocational training system faces major challenges because of the high proportion of immigrants. It is clear that the Luxembourg system contains a certain degree of 'mix-and-match' of different elements and educational principles, which contribute to the strong separation between different pathways in secondary education. The vocational and practical training must not be a dead end for academically talented but linguistically disadvantaged pupils with an immigrant background, nor must vocational training be educationally unattractive for practically inclined and talented Luxembourgers for reasons of prestige. In order to formulate appropriate solutions in the context of these inequality-related problems, more international comparative research seems inevitable. An additional area for in-depth analysis is assessing the impact of the reform of 2008 on vocational training. Currently, {{it is not clear what}} lies behind a number of potentially problematic developments within the system. For example, there needs to be discussion on whether the modularisation measures have led to an unintended fragmentation of vocational training, which would be contrary to the principles and uniformity of the various professions. In this context, there is also the question of how the number of modules could be reduced...|$|E
