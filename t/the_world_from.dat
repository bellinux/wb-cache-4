5|$|Compared {{with other}} BBC series {{broadcast}} in the 1960s, Doctor Who is well-represented in surviving episodes.

For example, Seasons 1 and 2, {{the most widely}} sold abroad of the 1960s era, are missing only 9 and 2 episodes, respectively. By contrast, the less well-sold Seasons 4 and 5 respectively have none and two complete serials between them, The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>from</b> season five. Doctor Whos popularity and high-profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes which, for other less well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.|$|E
