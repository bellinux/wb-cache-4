25|$|In 1940, Wills, {{along with}} the Texas Playboys, co-starred with Tex Ritter in <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> <b>To</b> Oklahoma. Other films would follow. In December 1942, after several band members had left the group, and as World War II raged, Wills joined the Army {{at the age of}} 37, but he {{received}} a medical discharge in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|May 26, 1975 {{issue of}} TIME (Milestones section) read: [...] "Died. Bob Wills, 70, [...] "Western Swing" [...] bandleader-composer; of pneumonia; in Fort Worth.

2500|$|It's true. I {{have ranged}} widely, made myself a fool, squandered my treasure, and hurt my old lover {{by taking a}} new. I have truly given truth a {{sideways}} glance, but I swear this brought youth back to my heart. Experiment proved {{that you are the}} best that love has to offer. It is ended. Take what will not end. Never again will I whet my appetite on new loves to test the old, my one and only god of love. You are next to my heaven. <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> your pure and loving breast.|$|E
500|$|It <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{being in}} my car as a teenager. It <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> when <b>me</b> and my husband first meet, and he tries to scoop me and he thinks I'm the hottest thing in the world. I kinda had this whole fantasy {{of being in the}} car, and this whole movie played in my head. I didn't have a pen and paper. I got to the mic, I'm like, 'Oh, press Record.' ...|$|R
60|$|I was puzzled. I {{had only}} just been {{released}} from the dungeons, and was lying pain-racked in my customary cell, when they <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the dungeon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, that <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the {{old days}} at Oak Hall," [...] remarked Roger, when the singing {{had come to an}} end. [...] "My, but those were the great days!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> town as soon as you've had a drink," [...] he intervened, {{addressing}} the young man. [...] "We sail for America to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{pray that}} yonder Tyrant {{has not changed}} his mind and that these do not come to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the boat," [...] I said in a low voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've just {{sufficient}} {{money to}} <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Montreal, traveling Colonist, and I {{must go back}} to see how Wannop's getting on before very long. What {{are you going to}} do then?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Brown also draws {{inspiration}} from {{music of the}} '90s. [...] "Listening <b>to</b> Nirvana <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> being fourteen at the school disco. Bands from the nineties have that effect on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must say}} I am mighty glad I came," [...] said Dick to his brothers, as he {{surveyed}} the shouting and marching students. [...] "This certainly <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the days when I was here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the old scenes," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Bowman, dreamily. [...] "I {{have never}} kept anything back from you, Nathaniel. I told {{you all about}} the first man I ever thought anything of--Charlie Tucker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{gives it}} me, not displeased; and I {{put it to}} my lips, and then into my breast. Miss Larkins, laughing, draws her hand through my arm, and says, 'Now <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Captain Bailey.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] Roderick went on. [...] "This {{would be}} a lovely night for it, and I should be a lucky fellow {{to be buried in}} this garden. But bury me alive, if you prefer. <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Northampton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my place," [...] she said. [...] "Then {{you can go}} {{and talk}} {{nonsense}} to Sophy. I won't even ask you what she said when you told her the news. I suppose you did tell her?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Of the song, Nichols says, [...] "It <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> when I was a kid, and {{we would}} {{go out to the}} lake or the river and chill out all day. We'd do some stuff that we weren't {{supposed}} to be doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. The music, to {{tell the}} truth, {{is by no means}} very good. It is you who have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Old Country. Imagination will do a great deal, but it needs a fillip, and {{something}} tangible to build upon." ...|$|R
5000|$|Country Perspective {{rated the}} song 8/10, with an uncredited review saying that [...] " [...] This is {{straight}} up, stone cold, country music. It immediately <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> what country radio {{sounded like a}} couple of decades ago with all of the steel guitar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} not the chest," [...] replied the girl. [...] "He wishes to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my father, that is all. If you will return me to him you may keep the chest, if that is what you wish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] said Barakoff, who {{had come}} out of the house. [...] "He {{captured}} me this morning, and he released me upon parole rather than <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the French army, where I should have been starved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very, very big, this place," [...] he said, looking {{cautiously}} {{down the}} road, [...] "and {{we will get}} lost; but I will find a man and order him to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my house--like I did in Bombay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One night I was whisked off to London at a moment's notice. They <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} in Soho. Once I got away from the {{sanatorium}} I felt different--as though something in me that had been buried {{for a long time}} was waking up again.|$|R
5000|$|..... it <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the first}} Christmas I can remember, when the {{grandmother}} I hadn't yet met, who was Indian {{and lived in}} England, sent me a box. For me it still carries the taste of strangeness and confusion and wonder. Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking ...|$|R
60|$|Dick <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the cook's cabin and, bidding me remain inside, strode away. I beard {{footsteps}} so {{soon after}} his departure that I made certain he had returned, but the burly form which blocked {{the light in the}} cabin door was not Dick's. I was astounded to recognize Buell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Magnus {{could have}} done nothing, I think, which {{would not have been}} within your power. But it is useless talking of this. Will you not <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England, so as to prevent the {{necessity}} of Harry coming here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know and}} I don't care," [...] said Harvey. [...] "I'm {{grateful}} enough for being saved and all that, of course; but I {{want you to}} understand that the sooner you <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York the better it'll pay you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{looked at}} me and began to swear. He took me for a maniac,--a wild, crazy man, and told me the best thing I could do would be to go below and turn in, and he would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my friends, if I had any.|$|E
60|$|They <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Dunedin Jail, {{and clapped}} {{me into the}} old cell. The only {{difference}} they made was, that I had no work to do and was well fed. I stood this {{for a week or}} two, until one day the governor was making his rounds, and I put the matter to him.|$|R
2500|$|Walker wrote, [...] "At {{one point}} I learned Transcendental Meditation. This was 30-something years ago. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the way that}} I {{naturally}} was as {{a child growing up}} way in the country, rarely seeing people. I was in that state of oneness with creation {{and it was as if}} I didn't exist except as a part of everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, all I {{could think}} of to do was {{to go out and get}} in the buggy. The horse turned round and <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel. I hitched him and went in to see Andy. In his room I told him about this farmer, word for word; and I sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of sagaciousness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not. This sort of {{life will}} not suit me at all. I {{do not trust}} my aunt. I am weary of strangers. Let us give it all up. <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London with you. I feel as though I were going into prison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I lost {{every penny}} of that {{thousand}} pounds," [...] she declared. [...] "That is why I sent {{for my husband}} this morning {{and asked him to}} <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England. I am getting afraid of the place. My luck seems to have gone for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince," [...] he said, [...] "almost you <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the {{one mother}} country. Almost your words persuade {{me that the}} strangeness of these Western lands is a passing thing. We wonder, and as we wonder they shall crumble away. The sun rises in the East." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "October 16th.--Two days {{missed out}} of my Diary! I can hardly tell why, unless it is that Armadale irritates me beyond all endurance. The mere sight of him <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Thorpe Ambrose. I fancy I must have been afraid of what I might write about him, {{in the course of}} the last two days, if I indulged myself in the {{dangerous}} luxury of opening these pages.|$|R
6000|$|Good Lord deliver us {{from all}} great men, and <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> [...] humble life! That's Marshal Soult the Duke of Dalmatia! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have but}} to close my eyes, and my fancy <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> that {{birthday}} festival. Think of it, my dears! Near threescore years are gone since then, when {{this old man}} you call grandfather, and some--bless me!--great-grandfather, was a lusty lad like Comyn here. But his hand is steady as he writes these words and his head clear, because he hath not greatly disabused that life which God has given him.|$|R
