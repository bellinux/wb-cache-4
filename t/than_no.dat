5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain massage therapy was better <b>than</b> <b>no</b> {{treatment}} for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain massage therapy was no better <b>than</b> <b>no</b> treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain a little more <b>than</b> <b>no</b> treatment and {{about the same as}} medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

No. 224 then received its third rebuilding in 1897. In later years, no. 224 was used on secondary and branch line trains.|$|E

5|$|During the 2001 regular season, the Hokies' {{defense was}} the second-best in the country, {{allowing}} 237.91 yards per game. In no defensive statistical category were the Hokies worse <b>than</b> <b>No.</b> 10, and that ranking came in punt return defense, where Tech allowed 13.33 yards per return. The Hokies were No. 2 in rushing defense (71.64 ypg) and No. 8 in passing defense (166.27 ypg). Defensively, the Hokies {{were led by}} linebacker Ben Taylor, who had 121 tackles (the most on the team) and was named a semifinalist for the Butkus Award, given annually to the best linebacker in the country. Free safety Willie Pile was the team's No. 2 tackler, accumulating 94 tackles, four interceptions, and two fumble recoveries. Unexpectedly, linebacker Chad Cooper was diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome {{and had to be}} hospitalized prior to the game.|$|E
5|$|Having {{scored a}} century for Waverley against Petersham the week before, Fingleton made his {{first-class}} debut in 1928–29, playing in two matches and having two innings. On debut against Victoria, Fingleton {{was allowed to}} bat no higher <b>than</b> <b>No.</b> 8 by captain Tommy Andrews, despite being a specialist batsman. More than 600 runs had been scored {{by the time the}} sixth wicket had fallen, bringing him to the wicket to join Don Bradman, who had already brought up his double century. The pair put on an unbroken stand of 111 before Andrews declared at 7/613, of which Fingleton made 25 not out. During the partnership, Bradman farmed most of the strike, much to Fingleton's chagrin. The pair's first meeting had been prickly and Bradman glared angrily at Fingleton after a mix-up almost ended in a run out. The match was drawn, and Fingleton then made a duck against Tasmania in an innings victory. The following summer, with no Test matches, New South Wales' international representatives were available for the entire season, and Fingleton missed selection for every match.|$|E

Johanna realises what Virgil has done and forgives him, and tells the Emperor that better she take one chance in a million of a happy life with Virgil, <b>than</b> <b>no</b> chance at all with someone she cannot love.

25|$|Therefore, {{the use of}} placebos is a {{standard}} control component of most clinical trials, which attempt to {{make some sort of}} quantitative assessment of the efficacy of medicinal drugs or treatments. Such a test or clinical trial is called a placebo-controlled study, and its control is of the negative type. A study whose control is a previously tested treatment, rather <b>than</b> <b>no</b> treatment, is called a positive-control study, because its control is of the positive type. Government regulatory agencies approve new drugs only after tests establish not only that patients respond to them, but also that their effect is greater than that of a placebo (by way of affecting more patients, by affecting responders more strongly, or both).|$|E

25|$|The optimum {{size of a}} bench {{depends on}} the work to be done, space considerations, and budget. In general, bigger is better - though most woodworkers find that most work is done on the front few inches of the top, and then mostly in the front vise or right around the tail vise. So a smaller, narrow bench isn't {{as much of a}} {{drawback}} as might be expected - and it is far better <b>than</b> <b>no</b> bench at all. Tage Frid's classic bench is relatively small and {{it is one of the}} most copied designs. A big disadvantage of a smaller bench is that they are usually too light to resist heavy work without skidding around - but this problem can be overcome by attaching the bench to the floor.|$|E
25|$|The {{next few}} years saw Rundgren {{recording}} under the pseudonym TR-i ("Todd Rundgren interactive") for two albums. The first of these, 1993's No World Order, consisted of hundreds of seconds-long snippets of music, that could be combined in various ways to suit the listener. Initially targeted for the Philips CD-i platform, No World Order featured interactive controls for tempo, mood, and other parameters, along with pre-programmed mixes by Rundgren himself, Bob Clearmountain, Don Was and Jerry Harrison. The disc was also released for PC and Macintosh and in two versions on standard audio CD, the continuous mix disc No World Order and, later, the more song-oriented No World Order Lite. The music itself was quite a departure from Rundgren's previous work, with a dance/techno feel and much rapping by Rundgren. The follow-up, The Individualist (1995), featured interactive video content, that could be viewed or in one case, played; {{it was a simple}} video game along with the music, which was more rock-oriented <b>than</b> <b>No</b> World Order.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Frank Sherwood Rowland, Chemistry Professor at the University of California at Irvine, and his {{postdoctoral}} associate Mario J. Molina {{suggested that}} long-lived organic halogen compounds, such as CFCs, might {{behave in a}} similar fashion as Crutzen had proposed for nitrous oxide. James Lovelock had recently discovered, during a cruise in the South Atlantic in 1971, that almost all of the CFC compounds manufactured since their invention in 1930 were still present in the atmosphere. Molina and Rowland concluded that, like , the CFCs would reach the stratosphere where they would be dissociated by UV light, releasing chlorine atoms. A year earlier, Richard Stolarski and Ralph Cicerone at the University of Michigan had shown that Cl is even more efficient <b>than</b> <b>NO</b> at catalyzing the destruction of ozone. Similar conclusions were reached by Michael McElroy and Steven Wofsy at Harvard University. Neither group, however, had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of stratospheric chlorine—instead, they had been investigating the possible effects of HCl emissions from the Space Shuttle, which are very much smaller.|$|E
