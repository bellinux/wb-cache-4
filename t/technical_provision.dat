40|$|Providing risk-sharing {{benefits}} to risk-averse policy holders {{is a primary}} function of insurance companies. We model that policy holders are paying a fee over {{the present value of}} indemnifications (i. e., <b>technical</b> <b>provisions)</b> to enjoy these risksharing benefits. This fee implies that a capital structure largely consisting of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> is optimal for insurance firms, making the traditional Modigliani-Miller logic inappropriate for them. To support the issuance of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> with socially desirable properties, insurance firms hold a surplus to absorb losses. We show that the Modigliani-Miller logic applies to the composition of this loss-absorption capacity. This explains why insurance companies may use, next to equity and <b>technical</b> <b>provisions,</b> financial debt in supporting their activities. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Entities such as {{commercial}} {{insurance companies are}} obliged to create <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> {{in order to fulfill}} their activities. <b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> are used to cover liabilities of commercial insurance companies arising from insurance and reinsurance activities. The principal aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the impact of the creation and use of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> for some important items of the financial statements, which are liabilities, a balance sheet, profit and an income tax base. A prerequisite to fulfill the objective of the paper is to analyze the accounting legislation for <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> in an insurance company. The intention of the presented paper can be divided according to its conception into two parts. The first part of the paper is devoted to methodological aspects in relation to the general definition of the accounting principles and their importance in the accounting of commercial insurance companies. The second part deals with the methodological procedure of the accounting of the creation and use of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and the specifics of how they are reported in the financial statements of commercial insurers.

40|$|ABSTRACT New {{developments}} in {{information and communication}} technologies (ICT) to support learning have brought about increasing interest by both academic and non-academic institutions in e-learning. These {{developments in}} ICT are principally multimedia and the Internet with its World Wide Web. Interest in ICT supported learning is also fuelled by the associated (expected) cost reduction and easy expansion of education to the increasing and flexible market that is difficult to reach by traditional delivery. Expansion of e-learning, especially in higher education, raises the issue of quality, resulting in both anecdotal and empirical evidence of how to achieve high quality {{while at the same time}} benefiting from e-learning. After examining key current research, the authors developed a conceptual framework of nine factors of quality in e-learning in higher education. These factors include content, delivery, <b>technical</b> <b>provision</b> (referred to as tangibles) and globalisation. This article takes the research further by attempting to operationalise the nine factors and develop a questionnaire such that future work can undertake a primary study to validate the framework...|$|E
