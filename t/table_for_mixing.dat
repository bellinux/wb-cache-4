30|$|In this section, {{the models}} {{developed}} here (Equations 3 / 4 with appropriate parameters from Table  3) are {{compared to other}} published yield <b>tables.</b> <b>For</b> western hemlock, the comparison is made to yield tables published by Barnes (1962) and Taylor (1934). These <b>tables</b> are <b>for</b> fully stocked stands with a minimum diameter limit of 1.5  cm, making them approximately {{the same as the}} EP 703 hemlock plots. However, both of these yield <b>tables</b> are <b>for</b> <b>mixed</b> species stands, and no thinning or fertilisation information is available. Barnes (1962) published yield <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> Oregon/Washington, Alaska, and British Columbia; the British Columbia tables were used in this comparison. At the same starting conditions at age 20, both the Taylor and Barnes yield curves are approximately the same for site index 25 and 29 stands. The western hemlock model predicts greater yields than these two yield tables at site index 25 and 29, but at site index 29 the yields are similar below age 60. At site index 34, the yields from Equations 3 / 4 and from Barnes’ yield table are almost identical (Taylor did not publish yield <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> site indexes greater than 32).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this tool is to {{determine}} the best mix of tables in a restaurant, while simultaneously determining which reservations should be accepted from forecasted demand. A key parameter in the tool {{is the degree to which}} average dining durations are inflated. The tool user selects this inflation factor according to expectations regarding the extent to which parties will exceed the anticipated average dining time. Lower inflation factors result in more revenue, because more reservations are accepted, but also come with lower service levels, meaning more customers will need to wait <b>for</b> a <b>table.</b> Based on the user inputs, the tool, which uses the Solver add-in for Microsoft Excel, returns the optimum <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> <b>for</b> the greatest revenue...|$|R
40|$|In fall 2005 The Center for Hospitality Research (CHR) at Cornell University {{released}} the Restaurant Table Mix Optimizer (or RTMO), which I developed. This tool identifies the best <b>mix</b> of <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> a restaurant, {{based on a}} variety of inputs. The tool itself is web-based, with the CHR storing users 2 ̆ 7 data anonymously in a database. As of mid March 2007, a total of 1, 543 people had registered to use the RTMO. However, not all of those registrants created a valid table-mix scenario. With unusable scenarios eliminated, the final study analyzed the table mixes of 68 restaurants. While eight of the restaurants had the actual optimum <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> <b>for</b> peak operating times, the other 60 restaurants were leaving some money on the table. That is, most restaurants could improve their table mix. On average, the restaurants in this sample could increase their peak revenue by almost 15 percent by implementing a more effective table mix. Almost one-fifth of the restaurants in this sample could improve revenue by more than 20 percent just by having the appropriate mix of right-size tables...|$|R
30|$|Aerosol optical {{properties}} {{are a key}} determinant of their influence on the Earth’s radiation budget. We plan to follow standard methods employed in existing aerosol transport models (e.g., GOCART, SPRINTARS, ECHAM: Pozzoli et al. 2011; the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model HadGEM: Bellouin et al. 2011) to determine the aerosol {{optical properties}}. The single-scattering properties of spherical aerosol particles can be approximated using Mie scattering theory in radiative flux calculations. The wavelength of light, the radius of a particle, and the refractive index of its medium at the relevant wavelength are required to determine the extinction coefficient, single-scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor. The effect of water uptake on hygroscopic aerosol particles is approximated by calculating the particle radius and refractive index {{for a series of}} relative humidity values; the refractive indices are calculated {{on the basis of the}} volume-weighted mixing assumption between water and dry components (e.g., Haywood et al. 1997; Takemura et al. 2002; Eq. 3). The internal mixture effect is also approximated using the volume-weighted <b>mixing</b> assumption <b>for</b> multiple different components. Non-spherical dust particles are approximated as their corresponding spherical particles in calculating their optical properties, because relative errors introduced by this assumption are very small (Fu et al. 2009). We will generate lookup tables of extinction coefficients, single-scattering albedos, and asymmetry factors computed using a Mie theory program for the discretized series of aerosol particle radii, relative humidity values, and band wavelengths as applicable to each aerosol type. An internal mixture will be assumed only for organic and black carbonaceous aerosol particles at this stage to avoid heavy computational loads by including all mixture combinations; lookup <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> the <b>mixed</b> particles will also be prepared.|$|R
