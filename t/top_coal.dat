25|$|Coal is {{extracted}} from the ground by coal mining. Since 1983, the world's <b>top</b> <b>coal</b> producer has been China. In 2015 China produced 3,747 million tonnes of coal – 48% of 7,861 million tonnes world coal production. In 2015 other large producers were United States (813 million tonnes), India (678), European Union (539) and Australia (503). In 2010 the largest exporters were Australia with 328 million tonnes (27% of world coal export) and Indonesia with 316 million tonnes (26%), while the largest importers were Japan with 207 million tonnes (18% of world coal import), China with 195 million tonnes (17%) and South Korea with 126 million tonnes (11%).|$|E
25|$|According to IEA Indonesia was the 10th top {{natural gas}} {{producer}} in 2009: 76 billion cubics (bcm) 2.5% of world production of which 36 bcm was exported. In 2009 Indonesia was the 5th <b>top</b> <b>coal</b> producer: 263 million tonnes hard coal and 38 million tonnes brown. The majority of this, 230 Mt of hard coal, was exported. Indonesia has significant energy resources, starting with oil – it has 22 {{billion barrels of}} conventional oil and gas reserves, of which about 4 billion are recoverable. That's the equivalent of about10 years of oil production and 50 years of gas. It has about 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources. It has 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal. It has 28 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal potential.|$|E
25|$|The lumber {{boom that}} {{swept through the}} hills and forests of Pennsylvania did not reach the Great Trough Creek area until 1910. At this time the area was a {{thriving}} second growth forest that had grown {{in place of the}} forests that were stripped during the industrial era. The mountains were stripped by the lumbering operation of Caprio and Grieco who had built a railroad into the area and built a sawmill at Paradise Furnace. The lumbermen took the logs to the sawmill where they were cut into lumber. Smaller logs were used to reinforce the mine shafts at the Broad <b>Top</b> <b>Coal</b> and Mineral Company mines in Jacobs, Pennsylvania. The only thing the lumbermen left behind was the treetops. These tree tops were left to dry. The passing steam locomotives on the railroads would ignite this dry brush causing massive wildfires that swept through the mountains and valleys. The Great Trough Creek area was left to waste. The forests struggled to regrow {{in the wake of the}} wildfire. The hills began to erode. The streams were dying and wildlife was scarcely found.|$|E
50|$|<b>Top</b> <b>coaling</b> {{began as}} a method of {{increasing}} production in areas that had already been mined. In 1932 the tunnels were 2.4 m high, in 1948 some <b>top</b> <b>coaling</b> was done to raise the height to 3.7 m, but the coal yielded was a poor grade and the practice stopped. In 1951 <b>top</b> <b>coaling</b> began once again as a new electricity power station had been built and it was able to use lower grade coal. The roof height was raised to 4.3 m and 5.5 m in places, and by 1957 <b>top</b> <b>coaling</b> was a significant contributor to production.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} {{multiple}} coal discharges {{is to provide}} time and space for the <b>top</b> <b>coals</b> and the immediate roof to fracture and cave. Therefore, the delay time of the second coal discharge cannot be too short. Generally, the second coal discharge should be more than 10  m away from the first coal discharge. It should be adjusted according to the movement of <b>top</b> <b>coals</b> and the roof.|$|R
50|$|Factors {{contributing}} to the collapse were the process of <b>top</b> <b>coaling</b> which raised {{the height of the}} tunnels and pillar and panel mining reducing the size of structures holding up the tunnel roof.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{economic}} times, the railroad's management remained confident. On May 10, 1894, the directors approved {{the extension of}} the main line from Struble to Pine Grove Mills. Such an extension had been contemplated as long ago as 1884, during the BRB era. While Pine Grove Mills would originate some traffic through farming and logging, the extension was primarily contemplated {{as part of a larger}} route. By extending south from Pine Grove Mills to Huntingdon, the line could connect with the Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad, an independent railroad serving the Broad <b>Top</b> <b>coal</b> region. By linking to the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania at Bellefonte (built in 1893 over the contemplated Nittany Valley & Southern route), the Bellefonte Central could form part of a coal route tapping the Broad Top field on behalf of the New York Central. However, the route faced a formidable obstacle in the crossing of Tussey Mountain. Such a line would require switchbacks or a long summit tunnel. The Pennsylvania Railroad already occupied the only usable gap at Spruce Creek and would not look favorably on its new competitor for the Broad Top traffic. However, the economy remained slow, and the railroad found it difficult to obtain land at favorable prices. After a little grading, the project stalled until 1896, when the railroad lifted the rail from the derelict Red Bank Branch west of Graysdale and used it to lay track on the extension. Service on the extension opened to Bloomsdorf in September 1896 and to Pine Grove Mills in December. Despite a $75,000 subscription offered by the town of Stone Valley (now submerged under Lake Perez) to complete the extension to Huntingdon, the expense of further extension would clearly have outstripped the railroad's finances. The Bellefonte Central undertook no further construction towards Huntingdon.|$|E

India is the third <b>top</b> <b>coal</b> producer in 2013 with 7.6% production share of coal (including lignite) in the world.

However, India ranks fifth in global coal production at 228 mtoe (5.9%) in 2013 when its inferior quality coal tonnage is converted into tons of oil equivalent. Coal-fired power plants account for 59% of India's installed electricity capacity. After electricity production, coal is also used for cement production in substantial quantity. In 2013, India imported nearly 95 Mtoe of steam coal and coking coal which is 29% of total consumption {{to meet the demand}} in electricity, cement and steel production. Pet coke availability, at cheaper price to local coal, is replacing coal in cement plants.|$|E
30|$|When {{the drawing}} {{interval}} is small, the gangue {{in the direction}} of the goaf reaches the discharge window earlier than the <b>top</b> <b>coals</b> do, and the discharged coals mix with gangue. Before coal discharge, the boundary between coal and gangue near the discharge window is beyond the lower boundary of the tail beam. Therefore, it results in the part of middle to <b>top</b> <b>coals</b> being unable to be discharged due to the enclosure of gangue and the tail beam. In this case, the gauge might enter the discharge window from the bottom of the window, and increase the percentage of gangue in the coals obtained.|$|R

30|$|During {{the process}} of coal discharge, the size of caved coal is {{suitable}} at the initial stage and the discharged coal flow is smooth. With the discharge of <b>top</b> <b>coals,</b> the large-size coals increase and form a balanced arch above the discharge window to block the coal flow. In this case, {{the base of the}} balanced arch should be broken using a coal discharge device. In addition, the large coal blocks should be crushed to enable the continuity of coal discharge. Therefore, the tail beam should be continuously swung up and down during {{the process of}} coal discharge to disturb the awaited <b>top</b> <b>coals.</b> The upswing of the tail beam can crush large coal blocks and the down swing can loosen the coal flow.|$|R

Simultaneously, the size of the discharge window in the longitudinal direction (along the strike direction of the face) was controlled.|$|R
