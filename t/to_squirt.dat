25|$|In 1999, Moss {{had another}} {{impressive}} season, catching 80 passes for 1,413 yards and 11 touchdowns. He {{went on to}} record five receptions for 127 {{yards and a touchdown}} in the Vikings 27–10 NFC wildcard playoff win over the Dallas Cowboys. Minnesota lost in the divisional round to the St. Louis Rams 49–37, despite Moss catching nine passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns. Moss was fined $40,000, which was later reduced to $25,000, during that game due <b>to</b> <b>squirting</b> an NFL referee with a water bottle.

25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle <b>to</b> <b>squirt</b> water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E

[...] This not only confuses predators, but also the blood tastes foul to canine and feline predators. It appears to have no effect against predatory birds.

40|$|In this paper, the {{reservoir}} is modeled by homogeneous two-phase media based on BISQ model. We {{focus on the}} effects of the squirt flow on the fundamental guided waves propagation in borehole embedded in saturated porous media excited by monopole, dipole and quadrupole point sources.

The curves of velocity dispersion, attenuation coefficients and excitation of the fundamental guided waves have shown that velocity dispersions are almost independent of the characteristic squirt flow length, attenuations of guided waves are enhanced due <b>to</b> the <b>squirt</b> flow, and excitations of guided waves are decreased due <b>to</b> the <b>squirt</b> flow.

2500|$|A {{cephalopod}} (pronounced [...] or ~) is {{any member}} of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , kephalópoda; [...] "head-feet") such as a squid, octopus or nautilus. These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot.

2500|$|Ketchup is a non-Newtonian fluid {{meaning that}} its {{viscosity}} changes under stress {{and is not}} constant. It is a shear thinning fluid which means its viscosity decreases with increased shear stress. The equation used to designate a Non-Newtonian fluid is as follows: [...] This equation represents apparent viscosity where apparent viscosity is the shear stress divided by shear rate. Viscosity is dependent on stress. This is apparent when you shake a bottle of tomato sauce/ketchup so it becomes liquid enough <b>to</b> <b>squirt</b> out. Its viscosity decreased with stress.|$|E
2500|$|An early device used <b>to</b> <b>squirt</b> water onto a {{fire was}} known as a squirt or fire syringe. Hand squirts and hand pumps are noted before Ctesibius of Alexandria invented the first fire pump around the 2nd century B.C., and an example of a force-pump {{possibly}} used for a fire-engine is mentioned by Heron of Alexandria. [...] The fire pump was reinvented in Europe during the 16th century, reportedly used in Augsburg in 1518 and Nuremberg in 1657. A book of 1655 inventions mentions a steam engine (called a fire engine) pump used to [...] "raise a column of water [...] ", but {{there was no mention of}} whether it was portable.|$|E
50|$|Squirt boating {{is a form}} of {{whitewater}} kayaking or canoeing where the boat is designed to be as low in volume as possible while still allowing the paddler <b>to</b> float. <b>Squirt</b> boats are designed to use both surface and underwater currents to manoeuvre within the water. These manoeuvres can be used to effect navigational control or to perform tricks.|$|R

50|$|An orbit {{is pretty}} much a front surf <b>to</b> a stern <b>squirt</b> <b>to</b> a front surf. The paddler starts in a front surf then carves to about 45 degrees dips the {{upstream}} edge into the water letting the current catch the stern while doing a pry stroke on the down stream side. This will put the paddler into a stern squirt where the paddler will take another with the same blade to bring the boat back around to a front surf. This {{is also one of}} the excuses used for a window shade (see window shade/carpet roll).|$|R
2500|$|The {{very first}} version of Eddie was a mask made by an art student who was friends with Dave [...] "Lights" [...] Beasley, then in charge of lighting, {{pyrotechnics}} and other effects for Iron Maiden's live show. According to Beasley, the original mask was a papier-mâché mould of his own face, which was then used in the band's backdrop, consisting of lights and the band's logo. At {{the end of their}} live set, during the [...] "Iron Maiden" [...] song, a fish tank pump was used <b>to</b> <b>squirt</b> fake blood out of the mask's mouth, which typically covered their then-drummer Doug Sampson. After this initial incarnation, Beasley constructed a larger mask out of fibreglass, equipped with flashing eyes and the ability to release red smoke from its mouth.|$|E

5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able <b>to</b> shoot <b>squirts</b> of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being <b>squirted,</b> and attempt <b>to</b> wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|R

She felt she hated him. He stood there, watching the music, his lips curling in his faintly-derisive Italian manner, as he talked to the other man. His eyelashes were as long and dark as ever, his eyes had still the attractive look of being set in with a smutty finger. He had got the same brownish suit on, which she disliked, the same black hat set slightly, jauntily over one eye.

60|$|As Washington may {{be called}} the head-quarters of tobacco-tinctured saliva, the time is come when I must confess, without any disguise, that the {{prevalence}} of those two odious practices of chewing and expectorating began about this time {{to be anything but}} agreeable, and soon became most offensive and sickening. In all the public places of America, this filthy custom is recognised. In the courts of law, the judge has his spittoon, the crier his, the witness his, and the prisoner his; while the jurymen and spectators are provided for, as so many men who in the course of nature must desire to spit incessantly. In the hospitals, the students of medicine are requested, by notices upon the wall, to eject their tobacco juice into the boxes provided for that purpose, and not to discolour the stairs. In public buildings, visitors are implored, through the same agency, <b>to</b> <b>squirt</b> the essence of their quids, or 'plugs,' as I have heard them called by gentlemen learned in this kind of sweetmeat, into the national spittoons, and not about the bases of the marble columns. But in some parts, this custom is inseparably mixed up with every meal and morning call, and with all the transactions of social life. The stranger, who follows in the track I took myself, will find it in its full bloom and glory, luxuriant in all its alarming recklessness, at Washington. And let him not persuade himself (as I once did, to my shame) that previous tourists have exaggerated its extent. The thing itself is an exaggeration of nastiness, which cannot be outdone.|$|E
