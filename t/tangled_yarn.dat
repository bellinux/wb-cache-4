This paper presents outer hood design of Esemka R 2 that has a potential to improve hood’s ability and also to absorb the impact energy of a pedestrian’s head. The developed method {{for the design of}} an outer hood configuration aims to provide a robust design and homogeneous of Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for impact position at WAD 1000 and three different thicknesses (1. 25 mm, 1. 35 mm & 1. 50 mm) of outer hood panel of Esemka R 2 compact SUV, taking into consideration the limited space available for deformation. The non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software (Explicit Dynamics) was used in this research to simulate the testing procedurs of head impact for child pedestrian. The results show that the average of comparison dimensional of outer hood panel of Esemka R 2 was 4. 89 mm. The minimum of deformation space meet the requirement for HIC value which required obtaining robust and homogeneous head impact performance. Outer hood thickness and materials were identified as the factors to influence the stress and HIC value of the hood. By comparing all outer hood panels, aluminium alloy as the best selected material which has the lowest value is 32. 78 % for the pedestrian protection...|$|E
40|$|Fragment of woven wool fabric {{with yellow}} warp and bands of yellow, deep brown, light brown/gold as follows:; deep brown 1 cm; yellow 0. 8 cm; light brown/gold 1 cm; yellow 0. 5 cm; deep brown 2 cm; yellow 1. 2 cm; light brown/gold 0. 6 cm; yellow 0. 7 cm; dark brown 1 cm; Below these bands the fabric deteriorates into {{a mass of}} tangled woven fabric and sewing yarns. There are some coarse {{stitches}} in the area with the weft bands.; Fairly clean but very worn. Several interior holes. Frayed edges. Some embedded plant material in the <b>tangled</b> <b>yarns.</b> Damage to the weft has left some exposed warps...|$|R

A tie is visible at the left; after untying, the hank may be wound {{into a ball}} or balls suitable for crocheting. Crocheting from a normal hank directly is likely to <b>tangle</b> the <b>yarn,</b> producing snarls.|$|R
60|$|What {{they can}} be {{thinking}} of I cannot tell. Life, I suppose, {{is made up of}} the same prosaic material there that it is every where. The mother thinks how she shall make her goat's milk and black bread hold out. The grandmother knits stockings, and runs out to see if Jaques or Pierre have not tumbled over the precipice. Jaques and Pierre, in return, <b>tangle</b> grandmother's <b>yarn,</b> upset mother's milk bucket, pull the goat's beard, tear their clothes to pieces on the bushes and rocks, and, in short, commit incredible abominations daily, just as children do every where.|$|R
40|$|Long, narrow {{fragment}} of yellowed woven wool fabric with three small remnants of blue dove-tail tapestry. There is a 4 -ply <b>yarn</b> <b>tangled</b> around {{one end of}} the fabric.; Somewhat dirty and very worn. There is a very long edge tear at one end. Damaged wefts leave large areas of exposed warps. The weft shows wear from abrasion. Weft edges are frayed...|$|R
25|$|Generally yarn is skeined {{directly}} after spinning or plying. This {{is because}} after spinning or plying the yarn generally gets washed, and a skein {{is the best}} form to have the yarn in for washing. Although balls are easier for knitters and crocheters to use because they don't get <b>tangled</b> as easily, <b>yarn</b> is sometimes taken from a ball and reskeined {{in order to measure}} the yardage of leftover yarn, store it without tension, or to wash out kinks if the yarn was unraveled.|$|R
40|$|The above {{measurements}} are the overall size of two yellowed woven wool fragments {{which have been}} sewn together at right angles.; fragment A - warp 6. 5 cm, weft 19. 5 cm; fragment B - warp 20 cm, weft 6. 5 cm (There are purple and brown wool yarns and natural linen <b>yarns</b> <b>tangled</b> with the loose yarns at one end.; Dirty and very worn. Fragment A has several small interior holes and edge tears. Fragment B has damaged weft that leaves exposed warp. Fragment B is more deteriorated than fragment A. A fine plant stem pierces fragment B. Both have some edge fraying...|$|R

The next layer was a piece of fragment B, folded and wrapped over the piece of fragment A. Three more pieces of fragment A were folded and placed over each other. A 2 -ply yellow yarn was wrapped around the fragments twice and tied in the back. There are some dark brown <b>yarns</b> <b>tangled</b> with the loose yarns of the fabrics.; Dirty and very worn. There are tears in some of the fragments. Fragment B has many deteriorated wefts and several loose warps {{at the front of the}} doll. There is some weft edge fraying...|$|R
50|$|Gao Yang was {{not well}} {{regarded}} as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared {{that he was actually}} of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them <b>tangled</b> balls of <b>yarn</b> to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (彭樂) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.|$|R
40|$|A weaver, seamstress, laundress and artist, in {{this essay}} I shall spin a <b>yarn,</b> <b>tangle</b> a web, and {{construct}} a text(ile) of the inter-weave of narrative and identity that I define as my intellectual, textual, somatic and material/visual practice obsessions. My work explores ‘the places in-between’ in the entanglements of Irish and Northern Irish gender and identity, and in the abject fabrics of death and of desire. As an Irish feminist, sense-making of the complexities, conundrums, challenges and contradictions of my land, my cloth, my body and my culture owes much to Irish women before me who fought for female suffrage, and Irish women now – {{north and south of}} the border that divides the island of Ireland – who still struggle for equality of citizenship, social justice, human rights, and full reproductive autonomy. My contention is that when we accept that Ireland herself is a many layered cloth, a stained and bloodied cloth, a cloth marked irreversibly by history, conflict, denial and abuse, stained by its own repression, marked through denial of all its people’s rights and needs, and bloodied by its greatest export, the haemorrhage of its people, then – polemical, didactic or reflective, with more compassion, empathy, humility and heart – we just might make peace with our past...|$|R

[...] "I tell you I marked them both last eve, and though I seldom turn {{my mind to}} such follies, I saw the plain tokens of love in every look and gesture of the young springald. Nay, 'twas his countenance that put it into my mind, for I am even too good-natured--over good-natured, Susan Talbot. How now," [...] at some sound below, {{springing}} to the little window and flinging it back, [...] "you lazy idle wenches--what are you doing there? Is my work to stand still while you are toying with yon vile whelp? He is <b>tangling</b> the <b>yarn,</b> don't you see, thou purblind Jane Dacre, with no eyes but for ogling. There! there! Round the leg of the chair, don't you see!" [...] and down flew a shoe, which made the poor dog howl, and his mistress catch him up. [...] "Put him down! put him down this instant! Thomas! Davy!

The good nature was so far veritable that when she found little harm done, and had vented her wrath in strong language and boxes on the ear, she would forget her sentence upon the poor little greyhound, which Mrs. Jane Dacre had hastily conveyed out of sight during her transit downstairs. Susan was thus, to her great relief, released for the present, for guests came in before my Lady had fully completed her objurgations on her ladies, the hour of noon was nigh at hand, sounds in the court betokened {{the return of the}} huntsmen, and Susan effected her escape to her own sober old palfrey--glad that she would at least be able to take counsel with her husband on this most inconvenient proposition.|$|R
5000|$|Big Skin Bayou, {{also known}} as Skin Bayou or Big Skin Creek, is a {{tributary}} of the Arkansas River located in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma. It takes its name from the French word [...] "skein" [...] which are loose, <b>tangled</b> layers of <b>yarn.</b> A large, colorful canebrake resembling yarn; formed a near impenetrable, natural wall near the mouth of the creek before it was cleared for farming. French trappers and explorers named several of the major tributaries of the Arkansas River in Oklahoma; as it was once a part of the French Territory of Louisiana that was later the Louisiana Purchase. At one time, there were large rock bluffs near Big Skin's confluence with the Arkansas (most of these bluffs were later destroyed to provide rock fill for the W.D. Mayo Lock and Dam). The bluff on the south side (LeFLore County side) of the river and across from Big Skin's confluence was known as Swallow Rock, named for the birds that nested there and was the site of the old Fort Coffee. The bluff {{on the north side of}} the river (Sequoyah County side) and west of Big Skin is known as Wilson Rock (on some maps listed as Wilson's Rock). Both bluffs formed a natural wharf and served as historic steamboat landings and ferry crossings. The cemetery at Wilson Rock contains the graves of local residents as well as some travelers that fell victim to the river over the years. Tiana, the wife of the famed Texan Sam Houston was buried at Wilson Rock Cemetery for several years until she was moved to a cemetery near Fort Gibson. Wilson Rock and Big Skin Bayou were also drop off points for several groups of Cherokees that were forced to relocate to that part of Oklahoma/Indian Territory on the Trail of Tears. The relocated tribesmen that disembarked here would then follow the creek into the interior parts of Skin Bayou District where they settled. Most of eastern Sequoyah County was included in the [...] "Skin Bayou District" [...] of Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory; which also took its name from the creek.|$|R
