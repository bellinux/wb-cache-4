5|$|To counter this threat, the Admiralty {{developed}} <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> catapult ship {{a converted}} freighter, manned by a naval crew, carrying a single Hawker Hurricane fighter. When an enemy bomber was sighted, <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> would be launched {{into the air}} with rockets, and fly up to destroy or drive away the bomber. Being large and slow, the Fw 200 became a rather vulnerable target. After the combat, <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> pilot would bail out or ditch in the ocean near the convoy, and be picked up if all went well.|$|E

5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, {{the length of the}} blips depended on the position of the target relative to <b>the</b> <b>fighter.</b> For instance, a target located 35 degrees above <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see directly in front of <b>the</b> <b>fighter,</b> so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one {{on either side of the}} centreline.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the war was}} {{entering}} its final stages, the squadron still had to watch for anti-aircraft artillery. <b>The</b> <b>fighter</b> squadrons continued to make advances until February, {{while waiting for the}} Canadian push through the Reichwald. Although there was some aerial fighting, the major conflict with the Luftwaffe occurred when the Canadians started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945.|$|E

5|$|Having {{lost all}} of its Bristol Blenheim night fighters in the raid of 16 August, Tangmere {{dispatched}} two Hurricanes from <b>the</b> <b>Fighter</b> Interception Unit (FIU) fitted with FIU airborne radar to test the device in action. RAF Coastal Command also joined in, and committed No. 235 Squadron RAF and its Bristol Blenheims. The defence was reliant on the 68 Spitfires and Hurricanes. The numerical standing meant a ratio of one RAF fighter to every four German fighters and bombers, or in other words, one British aircraft to every two German fighters. Even had <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> controllers realised {{the strength of the}} raid, there was little that could be done. Other fighters were refuelling and rearming after the attacks on Kenley and Biggin Hill and would not be available.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{although}} already timetabled to be retired, a Sea Harrier {{was modified}} with an 'Autoland' system to allow <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> {{to perform a}} safe vertical landing without any pilot interaction.

50|$|The {{expedient}} {{solution to}} this was the use huff-duff stations to tune in on <b>the</b> <b>fighter's</b> radios. Every Sector Control, {{in charge of a}} selection of fighter squadrons, was equipped with a huff-duff receiver, along with two other sub-stations located at distant points, about 30 miles km away. These stations would listen for broadcasts from <b>the</b> <b>fighters,</b> compare <b>the</b> angles to triangulate their location, and then relay that information to the control rooms. Comparing the positions of the enemy reported by the ROC and <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> from <b>the</b> huff-duff systems, the Sector Commanders could easily direct <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> to intercept <b>the</b> enemy.|$|R
5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. The project has been named the HX Fighter Program. The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018. The goal is to start <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> candidates’ environmental testing in Finland in 2019. The buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.|$|E

5|$|Marty (Eddie Jones) is {{a former}} boxer, now {{a high school teacher}} and boxing trainer/manager who had {{previously}} coached a fighter to a title shot, only to have <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> leave him just before the fight.

The fighter's manager instructs Tommy to make his fighter look good, but after he suffers a low blow, Tommy knocks <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> out with one punch. The manager and the gym's owner angrily order Tommy from the gym but Marty and Diane chase after him, inviting him to train with Marty.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the wing}} {{had the option of}} moving with the F-15s to Barnes, but most decided to stay behind and train for new missions.

5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of <b>the</b> <b>fighter,</b> the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>fighter.</b> Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks.

Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> jets were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>fighter</b> jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E
