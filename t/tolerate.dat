5|$|Cure {{rates in}} {{clinical}} trials have ranged from 20–45%; although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able to <b>tolerate</b> aggressive therapies. The overall cure rate for all people with AML (including the elderly and those unable to <b>tolerate</b> aggressive therapy) is likely lower. Cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can {{be as high as}} 98%.|$|E

5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not <b>tolerate</b> independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed {{as a threat to}} the Caliphate's survival.|$|E
5|$|Colchicine is an {{alternative}} for those unable to <b>tolerate</b> NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others.|$|E
50|$|Sea torchwood <b>tolerates</b> {{full sun}} to light shade. In Florida, it often grows {{along the edges}} of hammocks. It <b>tolerates</b> many soil types, {{including}} soil over rock and coastal sand. It grows in well-drained sites, but it <b>tolerates</b> 750 to 2000 mm of yearly precipitation in Puerto Rico. Young plants linger in the understory until gaps allow further growth.|$|R
40|$|Background: Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) {{improves}} {{survival in}} patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Some studies show that four-hour use of NIV, at home, {{is not enough to}} define compliance to treatment. Study objective: to evaluate improve of survival in patients that use NIV for more than four hours a day and the effect of NIV on survival of the patients doing the treatment for less than four hours. Patients. Starting criteria of NIV were: Vital Capacity (VC) = 55 ± 5, PCO 2 > 45 mmHg, dyspnea, orthopnea and sleep disturbance. We studied 187 patients and separated them in two groups: <b>tolerating</b> (69 patients <b>tolerating</b> NIV for more than four hours) and not <b>tolerating</b> (118 patients <b>tolerating</b> NIV for less than four hours). The groups were similar to: age of onset (57, 62 <b>tolerating</b> vs 62, 43 not <b>tolerating),</b> ratio female/male, VC at timing NIV (52, 05 ± 13, 90...|$|R
5000|$|... 'Evereste' crabapple grows best in {{moderately}} {{moist soil}} which well drained. It prefers full sun but <b>tolerates</b> partial shade. This species {{is one of}} the most disease resistant, and also <b>tolerates</b> pollution.|$|R
5|$|Crucibles used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can <b>tolerate</b> this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to <b>tolerate</b> the coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} animal are kept as pets, the most popular being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, yielding flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; some, such as cactuses, able to <b>tolerate</b> dry conditions, are grown as houseplants.|$|E
50|$|As an example, {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (TCAs) {{are very}} poorly <b>tolerated</b> and often produce severe side effects including sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and anticholinergic effects, whereas newer antidepressants have far fewer adverse effects and are well <b>tolerated.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{native to}} North America, the Camassia cusickii <b>tolerates</b> damp meadows at subalpine and alpine {{elevations}} (4000 [...] - [...] 6000 ft) and <b>tolerates</b> pond edges, rich soils and bloom well in either sun or shade.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} human study of BIBW 2992, the maximum <b>tolerated</b> dose in a two-week-on, two-week off {{schedule}} was 70 mg once-daily. BIBW 2992 was well <b>tolerated,</b> with reversible adverse events including rash, diarrhoea, elevations in transaminases.|$|R

5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females {{give birth to}} up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will not <b>tolerate</b> the presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to germinate. In the absence of further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George recommends that cultivated plants be treated as for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and <b>tolerate</b> only light pruning not below the green foliage.|$|E
50|$|No {{religion}} is free from internal dissent, although {{the degree of}} dissent that is <b>tolerated</b> within a particular religious organization can strongly vary. This degree of diversity <b>tolerated</b> within a particular church is described as ecclesiastical tolerance, and is one form of religious toleration. However, when people nowadays speak of religious tolerance, they most often mean civil tolerance, which refers {{to the degree of}} religious diversity that is <b>tolerated</b> within the state.|$|R
40|$|Study A {{included}} 30 {{patients who}} received immediate postoperative enteral feeding with a nonelemental diet. The nonelemental diet was well <b>tolerated.</b> Study patients rapidly achieved nitrogen equilibrium and had a cumulative nitrogen balance of - 11. 1 g verus - 46. 7 g for the control group. In part B, 16 patients {{with varying degrees of}} bowel dysfunction received elemental and nonelemental diets in a crossover design. Patients with moderate small bowel impairment <b>tolerated</b> nonelemental better than the elemental diets. In those patients with more severe bowel impairment, the elemental diet was better <b>tolerated.</b> Nitrogen balance for both types of diet was similar in both groups of patients. It is concluded that nonelemental diets are better <b>tolerated</b> in most patients with moderate degrees of small bowel abnormality. In patients with severe bowel abnormality, elemental diets may be better <b>tolerated,</b> but nonelemental diets should still be the initial formula...|$|R
25|$|Various cyclic amine {{groups can}} act as the basic moiety and potency stays {{relatively}} unchanged for example aryl piperazine, piperidine and morpholine. An acyclic tertiary amine is <b>tolerated</b> as the basic moiety but larger steric groups are less <b>tolerated.</b>|$|R
5|$|Resolution of DKA {{is defined}} as general {{improvement}} in the symptoms, {{such as the ability}} to <b>tolerate</b> oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1 mmol/l) or urine. Once this has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administrered regimen, one hour after which the intravenous administration can be discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Starfish do {{not appear}} to have any {{mechanisms}} for osmoregulation, and keep their body fluids at the same salt concentration as the surrounding water. Although some species can <b>tolerate</b> relatively low salinity, the lack of an osmoregulation system probably explains why starfish are not found in fresh water or even in many estuarine environments.|$|E
5|$|The breed can <b>tolerate</b> other pets well, {{although}} the King Charles {{still has the}} hunting instincts of its ancestors and {{may not always be}} friendly towards smaller animals. It is intelligent enough to be used for obedience work and, due to its stable temperament, it can be a successful therapy dog for hospitals and nursing homes.|$|E

5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to <b>tolerate</b> the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
