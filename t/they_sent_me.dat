5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> through the scripts and stuff, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw my mistake. <b>They</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> wrong by {{deliberate}} design! At this supreme moment Kalaua had intentionally {{attempted to}} escape my notice.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{comfortable}} here," [...] he remarked, [...] "but {{no doubt it}} is some fashionable watering-place, and <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> away to recruit my health. My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{she is my}} aunt, but she is {{very good}} to me; takes as much care of me as if I was her own daughter. I don't belong to this place. <b>They</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> here for my health." ...|$|R
500|$|Theron Patterson, {{a friend}} of Moore's and former classmate at California Institute of the Arts, was working in Istanbul, Turkey and invited Moore to visit. Moore, who {{had been living in}} Costa Rica, stayed with him for two weeks, then decided to settle in Istanbul and record the third Chroma Key album there. Moore signed to InsideOut Records. [...] "They've been really great {{supporting}} this; <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> out to Turkey when I told them I wanted to record out there, basically supporting the whole process," [...] he said. The first project Moore worked on after he moved to Istanbul was Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the Turkish film Okul. Moore enjoyed the experience and decided to write the third Chroma Key album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E
500|$|Darla {{is first}} {{killed in the}} seventh episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In that episode, it is {{revealed}} that Darla was once romantically involved with Angel and that she made him a vampire. Angel stakes her through the heart. Benz was asked {{to return to the}} role three years later, but not on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Joss Whedon wanted her to appear on the spin-off Angel, which focused on Angel's adventures in Los Angeles. Benz said in an interview: I was shocked, really. When <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the script [...] I kept asking, 'Where's Darla?' I remember calling my agent asking, 'Are you sure they want me for this episode because I can't seem to find me?' And then I get to the last page and there I am... naked in a box. Awesome. It was exciting.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. <b>They</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] Mr. Brott said, [...] "that I shall shock you. You are an aristocrat of the aristocrats, I {{a democrat}} of the democrats. The {{people are the}} only masters whom I own. <b>They</b> first <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to Parliament." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allie," [...] {{burst out}} Neale, [...] "they {{never told me}} a word about you--never gave <b>me</b> a hint. <b>They</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>me</b> {{to come back to}} my job. I could have come a day sooner--the day Campbell found me.... Oh!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{swept the}} court with his questioning eye. [...] "The message is not for you, good father Abbot. It is for one whom I know not. I have been to his house, and <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> hither. The name is Nigel Loring." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Rihanna {{explained}} why {{she liked to}} collaborate with Minaj, saying [...] "She has a great buzz {{and she has a}} 'thing' to her. She is a star and that's why people love her. She's also really entertaining with her visual as well as her lyrics, and she has a great melody." [...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that. [...] not only raps but she can write songs too... It was really easy actually. We were going back and forth with the texts on how {{we were going to get}} to do it because we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules." [...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. I had an off day, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy." [...] "Raining Men" [...] was sent for urban radio adds as the third single from Loud on December 7, 2010. On January 25, 2011, the song was re-released for urban radio adds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, she sued Columbia Pictures to be {{released}} from her contract, but asked for her $150,000 salary, alleging that the filming failed to start when agreed. She said, [...] "I was in Switzerland when <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the script for Affair in Trinidad and I threw it across the room. But I did the picture, and Pal Joey, too. I came back to Columbia because I wanted to work and first, see, I had to finish that goddamn contract, which is how Harry Cohn owned me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ronaldson {{worked for}} the British Colonial Service as a District Commissioner for fifteen years and, while at Mbulu, trained Tanzanian {{marathon}} runner, John Stephen Akhwari, who was favourite for the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. [...] Akhwari is notable for his honourable last place finish. [...] He fell early in the race, cutting his knee and dislocating the joint but went on to complete the race, stating to journalists that [...] "My country did not send me 10,000 miles just to start the race; <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to finish the race." [...] 18 other competitors did not finish the race.|$|E
6000|$|... "They have {{forbidden}} her, in my name," [...] Mrs. Gallilee continued, [...] "to act as {{nurse to}} my niece. They have informed her that Miss Carmina will {{be restored to}} my care, the moment she can be moved. And <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> her unconditional submission in writing, signed by herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then old Calloway expects us to read it, anyhow," [...] said he. [...] "He's up a tree, or something, and he's {{made this}} up {{so as to}} get it by the censor. It's up to us. Gee! I wish <b>they</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>me,</b> too. Say--we can't afford to fall down on our end of it. 'Foregone, preconcerted rash, witching'--h'm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{brother is}} the dearest thing {{in life to}} me," [...] she said. [...] "He is all that I have left to me {{belonging}} to my own world. All these days I have spent at his bedside, except when <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> away. This evening I {{have come to see}} you. You are his child, Ruth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> away on {{the plea}} that--oh, on the silly plea of my youth and innocence, which {{were not to be}} offended." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I can’t," [...] said the urchin, {{becoming}} hopeful; [...] "that’s why <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to sea, becos I couldn’t read or write." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I can't," [...] said the urchin, {{becoming}} hopeful, [...] "that's why <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to sea becos I couldn't read or write." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I, Señor Don Almirante, {{although}} <b>they</b> who <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> here fancy as much. It {{is natural}} {{for a man}} to wish to see his estates, once in his life, and I am told that we are bound on a voyage {{to the other side of}} the world. God forbid that I should hold aloof, on such an occasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what is {{all this}} trouble about, which <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> to set right? About a marriage. There is a girl wants to marry one man, and a woman who wants to marry her to another. Ponder the {{possibilities}} of tragedy in such a situation. Half this world's upheavals have had their source in less. Yet you, Rabecque, would have married!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 17. Wherefore {{to prison}} <b>they</b> <b>me</b> <b>sent,</b> [...] Where {{to this day}} I lie, [...] And can with very much content [...] For my {{profession}} die.|$|R
6000|$|... "Between ourselves, I've {{never done}} {{anything}} much in England, and I fancy the family were getting a bit fed. At any rate, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> over here--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Last {{year when}} my {{assistant}} took a holiday <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a 'Varsity man. I told 'em {{not to do}} it again. Too damned gentlemanly for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of {{them got}} out by the back way, and we got some of them out by ladders. The others are seeing to that. <b>They</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> off at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I won't, then, {{for your}} sake; {{but only to}} think of it--isn't it a shame? <b>They</b> never <b>sent</b> for <b>me,</b> nor <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> any word, and, if it hadn't been for Tom Lincon, I shouldn't have heard it. I tell you, I blew 'em up well, all of 'em, at home!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you know}} all about it. There isn't {{anything}} for you to do. There are Miss Edgeworth's novels down-stairs, and 'Pride and Prejudice' in my bed-room. I don't subscribe to Mudie's, because when I asked for 'Adam Bede,' <b>they</b> always <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> the 'Bandit Chief.' Perhaps you can borrow books from your friends at Richmond. I daresay Mrs. Greystock has told you that I'm very cross." ...|$|R
6000|$|I shall here subjoin some {{computations}} {{relating to}} Mr. M'Culla's copper notes. <b>They</b> were <b>sent</b> to <b>me</b> {{by a person}} well skilled in such calculations; and therefore I refer them to the reader.[118] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She's at the Railway Arms--we passed it, just against Rollin's Mill Crossing.... <b>They</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> a note {{this morning}} to go an' see her when I can spare time. She's got consumption.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Austen, dispassionately. He {{had hardly}} heard what Zeb had said; his mind {{had been going}} onward. [...] "Yes. <b>They</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> an annual pass, and I took it back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he {{all right}} now? I {{lost sight of}} him when <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> {{to another part of}} the road. It was my fault--he wrote, but I'm not {{punctual}} at answering letters, and hadn't much time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must leave}} the sheep that {{was lost to}} you, Rose," [...] said Julius. [...] "You can do more for them than I as yet, and <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> for <b>me</b> to the Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam," [...] said my wife, sobbing, [...] "why {{would you}} {{take me back to}} them? <b>they</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> away before! I only asked the Duchess whether she didn't like rum-shrub better than all your Maxarinos and Curasosos: and--would you believe it?--all the company burst out laughing; and the Duchess told me just to keep off, and not to speak till I was spoken to. Imperence! I'd like to tear her eyes out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{not exactly}} serious," [...] he answered. [...] "I do not {{understand}} what has happened, but <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> for <b>me</b> to go--well, where {{it was agreed that}} I should not go except as a matter of urgent necessity." ...|$|R
