5|$|In {{the period}} of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a {{detached}} fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built {{to the east of}} the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture which refers to work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses {{in the service of the}} Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>this</b> fortress as soon as possible.|$|E

25|$|For example, 412 mod 1649 = 32, 422 mod 1649 = 115, and 432 mod 1649 is 200. None {{of these}} numbers 32, 115, 200 is a square, but the product (32)(200) = 6400 = 802 is a square. Modulo 1649, this product is (32)(200) = (412)(432) = ((41)(43))2 = 1142 as (41)(43) mod 1649 = 114.
