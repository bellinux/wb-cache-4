40|$|THESIS 9062 This thesis {{deals with}} the hydrochemistry and the algal {{communities}} {{in a set of}} 22 Irish <b>turloughs</b> (karstic seasonal lakes) which represent a broad hydrogeological spectrum. During a flooding season (2006 / 2007) <b>turloughs</b> were sampled monthly from the onset of flooding (October) until they dried out (March to June). Temporal patterns in chemical characteristics amongst the <b>turloughs</b> were identified. Nitrogen (N) had a similar temporal pattern in all turloughs: a rise until peaking in mid winter and a steady decline thereafter. Phosphorus (P) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) did not show a common pattern amongst <b>turloughs,</b> with peaks of P and Chl a occurring at different times in different <b>turloughs.</b> A significant positive correlation was found between total phosphorus (TP) in the water and previously measured values of trophic sensitivity of the terrestrial plant communities, suggesting an influence of water P on plant community structure. Analyses of the concentrations of chemical variables revealed some discrete groups of <b>turloughs</b> with distinctive characteristics. In particular, a group of four deeper, hydrologically connected and more coloured <b>turloughs</b> in the Gort Lowlands was identified. The high colour in these tmloughs is thought to be related to larger proportions of peat areas in their catchments. <b>Turloughs</b> showed similar levels of nutrients and Chl a to those reported for Irish and international permanent lakes. Chlorophyll a, which peaked between November and February in the majority of <b>turloughs,</b> presented values at times higher than those measured in mesotrophic Irish lakes during the summer. A significant log-linear regression was found between TP and Chl a which suggests P- limitation of algal biomass in the majority of the <b>turloughs</b> (N= 17). The regression characteristics were not significantly different to those described in similar studies of permanent lakes. Some <b>turloughs</b> were considered to have factors other than P limiting phytoplankton biomass...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Turloughs</b> usually fill {{and empty}} at {{particular}} {{places on the}} floor of the depression; sometimes an actual hole or passage is visible but more often a hollow with stones in the bottom is all that can be seen, and it may not be easy to recognise when it is dry in midsummer. Some <b>turloughs</b> have a spring at one place and a sinkhole (also known as a [...] "swallet") somewhere else on the floor where water drains away, but many <b>turloughs</b> fill and empty through the same hole. A few <b>turloughs</b> are filled by surface rivers and streams flowing into them as well as by water rising from underground.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{seasonal}} {{succession of}} phytoplankton communities in <b>turloughs</b> is described {{for the first}} time. R-selected species dominated throughout the duration of flooding and a clear succession of communities, with three distinct phases, was found in most turloughs: prevalence of Chlamydomonas, cryptophytes, pennate diatoms and Tribonema {{in the first few}} months of flooding followed by dominance in winter by cryptophytes, pennate diatoms and centric diatoms. A final stage in late spring was characterised by filamentous greens and chrysophytes. Algal communities in <b>turloughs</b> resemble those of ponds, lakes or even slow-flowing rivers, depending on the time of the year. Multivariate analysis showed that the variables significantly affecting phytoplankton composition in <b>turloughs</b> were total phosphorus (TP), season and mean depth/colour. <b>Turloughs</b> with higher TP tended to have a higher prevalence of green algae, particularly filamentous forms. Tychoplanktonic algae were also important in <b>turloughs</b> (up to 82 % of total biovolume), probably owing to their shallow nature and to the presence of terrestrial vegetation on the bottom of the basins. The results are discussed in relation to Reynolds functional groups and other studies and, in general, it is shown that there is good accordance between the algae found in <b>turloughs</b> and what is presently known of their ecologies...|$|R
5|$|As {{the race}} continues, {{several of the}} vessels are {{destroyed}} by explosions. The Doctor suspects that the crew aboard the Buccaneer, a 17th-century pirate ship, responsible {{as it was the}} closest vessel at the time of destruction. <b>Turlough,</b> while attempting to escape control of the Black Guardian, ends up aboard the Buccaneer, and meets the Eternal Captain Wrack, learning she too is working for the Black Guardian. He finds equipment aboard her ship that appears to be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian's voice nearby. Later, Wrack offers the Edwardian officers a reception aboard her ship. During the reception, <b>Turlough</b> demonstrates the equipment to the Doctor, while Wrack gifts Tegan with a tiara with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the Buccaneer nearing the Edwardian ship, and determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the tiara before Wrack can destroy the ship.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the race, {{the solar}} winds {{dissipate}} and the Buccaneer pulls ahead of the Edwardian ship. Not wishing to see Wrack win, the Eternals return the TARDIS to the Doctor, allowing him to travel to the Buccaneer. However, he is captured, and Wrack's first mate suggest that the Doctor and <b>Turlough</b> be thrown overboard. From the Edwardian ship, Tegan and the others watch as two bodies are ejected from the Buccaneer just before it crosses the finish line.|$|E
5|$|The {{plots of}} the unmade serials also vary. A theme of a {{civilisation}} {{where women are}} dominant was proposed twice—once for The Hidden Planet, and again for The Prison in Space. In some cases, elements of unmade serials were adapted, or were moved from one serial to another; for example, Song of the Space Whale {{was intended to be}} the introduction of Vislor <b>Turlough</b> until it was repeatedly set back, causing Mawdryn Undead to be Turlough's first appearance.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>turloughs</b> {{flood in}} the autumn, usually {{sometime}} in October, and then dry up some time between April and July. However, some <b>turloughs</b> in the Burren can flood {{at any time}} of year in {{a matter of a few}} hours after heavy rainfall, and they may empty again a few days later.|$|R
40|$|Nutrient {{contamination}} of surface and groundwaters {{is an issue}} of growing importance as the risks associated with agricultural runoff escalate due to increasing demands on global food production. In this study, the nutrient flux occurring within the surface and groundwaters of a lowland karst catchment in western Ireland was investigated {{with the aid of a}}lkalinity sampling and a hydrological model. Water samples were tested from a variety of rivers, lakes (or <b>turloughs),</b> boreholes and springs at monthly intervals over three years. Alkalinity sampling was used to elucidate the contrasting hydrological functioning between different <b>turloughs.</b> Such disparate hydrological functioning was further investigated with the aid of a hydrological model which allowed for an estimate of allogenic and autogenic derived nutrient loading into the karst system. The model also allowed for an investigation of mixing within the <b>turloughs,</b> comparing observed behaviours with the hypothetical conservative behaviour allowed for by the model. Within the <b>turloughs,</b> nutrient concentrations were found to reduce over the flooded period, even though the <b>turloughs</b> hydrological functioning (and the hydrological model) suggested this should not occur. As such, it was determined that nutrient loss processes were occurring within the system. Denitrification during stable flooded periods (typically 3 – 4 months per year) was deemed to be the main process reducing nitrogen concentrations within the <b>turloughs</b> whereas phosphorus loss is thought to occur mostly via sedimentation and subsequent soil deposition. The results from this study suggest that, in stable conditions, ephemeral lakes can impart considerable nutrient losses on a karst groundwater system...|$|R

5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} a strong {{commitment}} to renewable energy, ranking {{as one of the top}} 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's <b>Turlough</b> Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E
5|$|After penning {{a number}} of radio and TV scripts, {{including}} episodes of Crossroads and Waggoner's Walk, Barbara Clegg submitted a story idea to Doctor Who script editor Eric Saward, an acquaintance from the BBC drama department. Interested in writing for the series, Clegg had been inspired when distant relatives had stayed with her and demanded constant entertainment during their visit, basing {{the character of the}} Eternals upon them. Initially titled The Enlighteners, her submission involved ships racing through space that, with the addition of the Black Guardian sub-plot, eventually evolved into the story as screened. Saward and series producer John Nathan-Turner liked Clegg's ideas, and they commissioned the script in September 1981. The first episode was delivered by Clegg in October and the three following episodes arriving in January 1982. The serial was now scheduled to conclude a three-story trilogy featuring the Black Guardian, and Clegg duly wrote the recurring characters into her scripts. By May 1982 there were problems with a script by Pat Mills, Song of the Space Whale, which had been intended to open the Black Guardian trilogy. Mills' script was eventually dropped and the production team considered moving The Enlighteners forward in the season to replace it, necessitating considerable re-wites. Peter Grimwade was eventually commissioned to write Mawdryn Undead to replace The Song of the Space Whale, and The Enlighteners was confirmed as the fifth serial of the season. The first draft of Part One did not contain any of the material concerning the Guardians, and <b>Turlough</b> was a peripheral figure, with the script focussing on the relationship between Marriner and Tegan. With pre-production underway, Saward changed the story title to Enlightenment in September 1982, a title he felt was more enigmatic. Saward also rewrote portions of the script pertaining to the story-arc, particularly the final confrontation scenes at the end of Part Four. Peter Moffatt had been originally scheduled as the serials director, but following the problems with the Space Whale script he was asked to helm its replacement due to his experience, and so Fiona Cumming was asked to take over Enlightenment.|$|E

50|$|Many {{people think}} that <b>turloughs</b> have no animal life. However, frogs and newts may spawn there, and {{sticklebacks}} may survive in the larger <b>turloughs,</b> retreating into underground cracks in the rock when waters are low.

These hatch and grow fast, finding safety in the warm fish-free waters. Flatworms and snails are also often abundant; these pass the dry periods in spring mouths or marshy areas.|$|R

25|$|In the {{following}} year he was summonsed to attend Parliament in Dublin as Earl of Tyrone and, in 1587 after {{a visit to the}} Court in England, he was awarded a patent to the lands of his grandfather, the first earl, Conn O'Neill. His constant disputes with <b>Turlough</b> were fomented by the English with a view to weakening the power of the O'Neills, but with the growing power of Hugh, the two came to some agreement and <b>Turlough</b> abdicated in 1595. Hugh was subsequently inaugurated as The O'Neill at Tullahogue {{in the style of the}} former Gaelic kings, and became the most powerful lord in Ulster.|$|E
40|$|Tiankengs lie at {{one extreme}} of the {{collapse}} doline spectrum, and a key question is {{whether there is a}} distinctive ‘tiankeng process’ or whether the distinction is purely morphological. At {{the opposite end of the}} doline spectrum, the <b>turloughs</b> of Ireland are broad closed depressions with seasonal lakes. They may be differentiated from poljes by their smaller dimensions, gentler surrounding slopes and processes of formation. In particular, <b>turloughs</b> are only found in areas where there are glacial deposits and are, at least in part, glaciokarstic landforms whereas poljes occur in many climatic zones and their locations frequently demonstrate a structural influence. <b>Turloughs</b> have been recognised by the European Union as special karst landforms with a distinctive vegetation assemblage, although the term is not widely used because, with one exception, they are confined to Ireland. There are clear parallels with ‘tiankeng’ the majority of which are in China and which are distinguished from collapse dolines by their large size, and special processes of formation. It is argued that the terms ‘turlough’ and ‘tiankeng’ should both become established in the karst geomorphology lexicon...|$|R

25|$|As in most countries, energy {{consumption}} is low {{at night and}} high during the day. Aware of the substantial waste of night-time capacity, the ESB commissioned the <b>Turlough</b> Hill pumped storage hydro-electric station in 1968. This station, located in County Wicklow, pumps water uphill at night with the excess energy created by other stations, and releases it downhill during the day to turn turbines. The plant can generate up to 292 MW of power – but output is limited in terms of hours because of the storage capacity of the reservoir.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} land {{drainage}} on groundwater resources is particularly acute in karst areas {{because of the}} unique characteristics of karstic aquifers.

25|$|O'Neill {{became a}} {{ward of the}} state and was brought up in the Hovenden {{household}} at Balgriffen, outside Dublin, but after the death of Shane he returned to Ulster in 1567 under the protection of Sir Henry Sidney, lord deputy of Ireland. In Tyrone, Hugh's cousin, <b>Turlough</b> Luineach O'Neill had succeeded Shane O'Neill as The O'Neill, or chieftain, but was not recognized by the English as the legitimate Earl of Tyrone. The crown therefore supported Hugh O'Neill as the rightful claimant and as an ally in Gaelic controlled Ulster.|$|E
25|$|O'Neill {{followed}} Shane's {{policy of}} arming the people, {{rather than relying}} as <b>Turlough</b> had done upon Scots mercenary soldiers, such as redshanks or Irish professionals employed under buannacht. This policy allowed him to field an impressive force, with cavaliers and gunpowder supplied from Spain and Scotland, and in 1595 he gave the crown authorities a shock by ambushing and routing a small English army at the Battle of Clontibret. He and other clan chiefs then offered the crown of Ireland to Philip II of Spain who refused it.|$|E
25|$|Another failed {{plantation}} {{occurred in}} eastern Ulster in the 1570s.

The conquest of east Ulster was contracted out to the Earl of Essex and Sir Thomas Smith. The O'Neill chieftain, <b>Turlough</b> Luineach O'Neill, feared an English bridgehead in and Ulster, helped his O'Neill kinsmen of in Clandeboye. The MacDonnells in Antrim, led by Sorley Boy MacDonnell, also called in reinforcements from their kinsmen in the Western Isles and Highlands of Scotland.|$|E

50|$|Coole Park is {{a nature}} reserve of {{approximately}} 1000 acre located {{a few miles}} west of Gort, County Galway, Ireland.It is operated by the Irish National Parks & Wildlife Service, part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.The park is in a low-lying karstic limestone area characterised by seasonal lakes, known as <b>turloughs,</b> which are almost unique to Ireland. It has extensive woodlands. There are 6 kilometres of signposted nature trails plus a formal late 18th century walled garden.|$|R
5000|$|All of the <b>turloughs</b> {{are found}} in {{limestone}} areas. This is because limestone can be dissolved away by rainwater, which becomes mildly acidic by picking up carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere. The cracks or joints in the rock become widened {{to such an extent}} that eventually all of the rain falling on the limestone disappears underground, and the water moves through the rock openings ranging from cracks a few millimetres wide to large cave passages. The limestone is then said to be [...] "karstified".|$|R
