5|$|Rupert was {{appointed}} to the King's Privy Council in 1662, taking roles on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Admiralty Committee and the Tangier Committee. Accounts vary of Rupert's role in all these committees of government. Samuel Pepys, no friend of Rupert's, sat on the Tangier Committee with him and later declared that all Rupert did was <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> swear occasionally: other records, such as those of the Foreign Affairs Committee, show him taking a full and active role in proceedings.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th century, Spain {{introduced}} drama {{which is}} a play that is usually done within one act. Drama mainly focuses on the contemporary lives of Filipinos.

25|$|According to hitman-turned-informant Charles Crimaldi, {{one time}} DeStefano made his wife Anita take {{his gun and}} put {{the end of the}} barrel in her mouth, then demanded that she pull the trigger. When she pulled the trigger and the gun didn't go off, DeStefano began <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> told her that he had removed the bullets. He would tell this story over and over again to his mob {{associates}} for amusement.|$|E
25|$|Emotional lability, another {{consequence}} of stroke, causes {{the person to}} switch quickly between emotional highs and lows and to express emotions inappropriately, for instance with an excess of laughing or crying {{with little or no}} provocation. While these expressions of emotion usually correspond to the person's actual emotions, a more severe form of emotional lability causes the affected person <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> cry pathologically, without regard to context or emotion.|$|E
25|$|Carson's show {{launched}} {{the careers of}} many performers, especially comedians and musicians. For a comedian appearing on the show, getting him <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> being invited to the guest chair were considered the highest honor. Most notable among these were David Letterman, Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Jeff Foxworthy, Ellen DeGeneres, Joan Rivers, David Brenner, Tim Allen, Drew Carey, and Roseanne Barr. Carson was successor to The Ed Sullivan Show as a showcase {{for all kinds of}} talent, as well as continuing a vaudeville-style variety show.|$|E

25|$|Soon afterward, the Republic of Ezo was established, and as {{a result}} of the first attempt at {{democratic}} elections that Japan had ever seen, Ōtori was elected Minister of the Army. However, in terms of battlefield experience, Ōtori was expert mostly in theory; while his second-in-command Hijikata Toshizō was far more experienced in combat, and Ōtori's awkwardness, as well as his tendency <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> say Mata maketa yo! ("Oh I lost again!") in the face of defeat gave him a bad reputation with his men.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Gandhi's {{choice of}} the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru and Dibyalochan Sahoo were ambivalent; Sardar Patel {{suggested}} a land revenue boycott instead.

500|$|A Season 8 scene - {{cut from}} its {{intended}} episode due to time constraints - showed Catherine Willows visiting Grissom's apartment to update {{him on a}} case. While {{he is in his}} bedroom, she snoops around and finds a woman's dressing robe in his closet. She then notices a photograph of Gil and Sara together on the fridge.

500|$|Crash was genetically {{engineered}} {{through the use}} of Cortex and Doctor Nitrus Brio's Evolvo-Ray. Before escaping from Doctor Neo Cortex's island fortress, Crash became romantically attached to a female bandicoot named Tawna, who was another one of Cortex's experiments. Crash's separation from Tawna at the hands of Cortex serves as the primary root of Crash's antagonisation of Cortex. Crash is a very emotional character who is quick <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> quick to cry. While he has a danger-loving, fearless nature and loves a good fight, he prefers relaxing in the sun and rarely seeks out trouble deliberately. Crash has an extremely limited vocabulary, preferring to speak in unintelligible gibberish; the few English words he is capable of speaking include [...] "Whoa!" [...] (which he often exclaims upon being physically harmed), [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "pancakes". To the ire of his friend Crunch, but the amusement of his sister Coco, Crash is prone to impolite personal habits such as belching or scratching his posterior.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{opened with}} a musical number which parodied the song [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] from Mamma Mia! The Movie. Awards were presented by John Wilson, the ceremony's founder. Awardees received a gold spray-painted raspberry worth $4.97. The Love Guru received three awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Screenplay. Worst Picture was the last award given out at the ceremony. John Wilson {{did not agree with}} the voters' determination on The Love Guru, and after viewing the film again in preparation for the ceremony, said to the Associated Press: [...] "A couple of things he did got me <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> <b>and</b> these days, two laughs in a comedy is a high ratio." [...] "The main thing wrong with it is no one said to Myers that it wasn't funny. He managed to offend the entire Indian population and his investors," [...] said Wilson in a statement in The Guardian. Wilson shredded a copy of The Love Guru at the awards ceremony.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco {{participated in}} a panel {{discussion}} with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in Architecture Boston. She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, [...] "Somehow MOBA frees kids <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> point, {{to have their own}} opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly... frees us." [...] Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to [...] "fix" [...] the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.|$|E

500|$|Pete Oliva of North Texas Daily {{said the}} episode [...] "proves {{that it is}} {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> cry at the same time without being able to control either response." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] shows that even if The Simpsons is not dealing with famous celebrities or [...] "high profile places", the writers can still [...] "wring uproarious comedy out of their cast of regulars. Flanders is a special creation in the canon of humor, a regular guy who is funny because of how hyper-normal he is compared to his Neanderthal neighbors. The focus on people who are left-handed, and the whole idea of being a lefty, is an unusual basis for a television show. But then again, nothing about The Simpsons is ever common." [...] Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town also praised the writers, stating that they [...] "are able to craft a downtrodden tale for the perpetually clueless Flanders family that serves to illustrate how dark emotions can eventually be overcome by Homer's guilt. A memorable episode." [...] Niel Harvey of The Roanoke Times called [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] a [...] "classic bit of Simpsonia." [...] The episode's reference to It's a Wonderful Life [...] was named the 26th greatest film reference {{in the history of the}} show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the film}} was re-released in the United States in late 2006 by Janus Films, Entertainment Weekly {{magazine}} film critic Owen Gleiberman praised its direction and simple story line that {{reminded him of his}} youth, and wrote, [...] "More than any other children's film, The Red Balloon turns me into a kid again whenever I see it... see The Red Balloon is <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> <b>and</b> cry, at the impossible joy of being a child again." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} Thelma, on {{the other}} hand, was first written as a character who [...] "had kids and stuff like that, but I realized that she couldn’t have kids. The idea that Darryl wanted her to wait, because the kids would be a sacrifice for him financially, fit perfectly. And, of course, she’s really a child herself. I had {{to set it up}} that way. I love <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> <b>and</b> I wanted this to be a movie you were enjoying and having a good time with because you were watching these women get their lives. Even though they would lose them, they were becoming more and more themselves. It was a beautiful experience, a liberating experience to watch that." ...|$|E
