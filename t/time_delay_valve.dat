40|$|The {{relation}} between ventricular function and electrocardiographic evidence of hypertrophy (by voltage criteria, "strain", and U wave inversion) was examined {{by means of}} M mode echocardiography and apex cardiography in 73 patients with diseases associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and 10 normal volunteers. In patients with disease, left ventricular cavity dimension and fractional shortening were unrelated to electrocardiographic findings, but left ventricular posterior wall thickness was greater in those with strain or U wave inversion. Without U wave inversion, hypertrophy and strain were weakly related to diastolic abnormalities, but the addition of U wave inversion was strongly associated with a reduced rate of early diastolic posterior wall thinning, prolonged isovolumic relaxation <b>time,</b> <b>delayed</b> mitral <b>valve</b> opening after minimum cavity dimension, and a pronounced increase in transverse dimension during the isovolumic period suggesting incoordinate relaxation. It is concluded that, whereas a negative U wave frequently occurs {{in association with the}} pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy or strain, it alone is strongly related to abnormalities of isovolumic relaxation. The close {{relation between}} incoordinate relaxation and U wave inversion, events which occur virtually simultaneously during the isovolumic period, suggests a mechanical influence on U wave genesis...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} theoretical and {{experimental study of}} the dynamic response of a 2602 Texas Remcor solenoid valve. The dynamic response {{is characterized by a}} physical model. The model identifies the effective parameters on the valve performance. It has been found that current, pressure, flow rate, spring force, and plunger mass have some effect on the valve performance. Based on the dynamic model analysis, some operational conditions, like pressure and voltage, have been varied. Also some modifications have been applied to the original valve. The valve has been operated at 30, 40, and 50 psi and at 12, 24, and 36 volt. The valve modifications include the weight and the shape of the plunger and the volume of the cavity after the outlet orifice. In order to track any sign of improvement, the valve response has been divided into four phases: i. 	Plunger- opening time. ii. 	Flow- opening time. iii. 	Plunger- closing time. iv. 	Flow - shutting off time. For each phase, the performance of original and modified valve has been tested. For the first phase, a significant improvement has been achieved in which the <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> has been reduced from the average of 17. 8 and 25. 1 ms to 4. 6 and 4. 8 ms for original and modified valve respectively. Furthermore, it was observed that the valve required more voltage as the fluid pressure increased. Reducing the volume of the valve had helped in reducing the time for the flow to reach its maximum value into half (from 3. 95 to 2. 15 ms). The plunger - closing time was found to independent to the flow rate, pressure, and voltage. It depended only on the spring force; thus, by reducing plunger’s weight significantly reduced the closing time. The average closing time for the original plunger is 13. 5 ms where it is equal to 2. 9 ms for the modified <b>valve.</b> The <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> in the final phase depends on the ability of the nozzle to drain the remaining fluid in the valve after closing the plunger. The time is varied from 62 ms at the lowest flow rate to 1. 6 ms highest flow rate. Reducing the volume of the valve cavity significantly decreased this <b>time</b> <b>delay.</b> The <b>valve</b> performance in general has been measured for the original and the modified valve in terms of area under the response curve. The modifications reduced the application error and brought the performance closer to the ideal situation. Several springs were tested for performance, the <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> of opening and closing the plunger was improved by 34 % when using the NN – 47 spring. However, the optimum spring constant K in which the opening and closing time of the plunger were the shortest was found experimentally to be 200 N/m...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the relation between three manifestations of left ventricular hypertrophy [...] ST-T wave changes on the electrocardiogram, diastolic disturbances, and increased myocardial echo intensity [...] M mode and cross sectional echocardiograms were recorded in 12 normal subjects, 15 athletes, 16 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 42 patients with secondary left ventricular hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis (20), severe essential hypertension (8), coarctation (7), or subaortic stenosis (7). M mode echocardiograms were digitised and cross sectional echocardiograms were analysed for regional echo intensity. In patients with hypertrophy regional echo amplitude was significantly increased in mid and basal septum and posterior left ventricular wall. Patients with increased echo amplitude in any region showed a higher incidence of ST-T wave abnormalities than those without and of diastolic abnormalities [...] including prolongation of isovolumic relaxation <b>time,</b> <b>delay</b> in mitral <b>valve</b> opening with respect to minimum cavity dimension, and a reduction in peak rate of posterior wall thinning and dimension increase. There was a significant rank order correlation between median pixel count and these diastolic abnormalities. No significant differences were demonstrable in these relations between the diagnostic groups. By contrast, electrocardiographic findings, diastolic function, and pixel count were uniformly normal in athletes, although the increase in left ventricular mass was similar to that in the patients. Thus an increase in left ventricular mass alone is not responsible for repolarisation or wall motion abnormalities occurring in pathological left ventricular hypertrophy. These latter changes are, however, strongly associated with the change in myocardial properties detected as an increase in echo intensity and may be due to increased interstitial fibrosis...|$|R

Adopting the mass model whose innermost density profile is parameterized as ρ ∝ r −α, we derive a series of mass models which can fit observational data and then compute the probability distribution functions of <b>time</b> <b>delays.</b> We find that larger α has longer <b>time</b> <b>delays,</b> longer tails at the higher end of the probability distribution, and larger model uncertainties. The ratios of <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> slightly depend on the slope α.
