5000|$|All {{mentioned}} above market-based measures have a one important drawback. In particular, according to Da et al. (2014): [...] "Although market-based measures {{have the advantage}} of being readily available at a relatively high frequency, they have the disadvantage of being the equilibrium outcome of many economic forces other than investor sentiment." [...] In other words, one can never be sure that a particular market-based indicator was driven due to investor attention. Moreover, some indicators can work pro-cyclical. For example, a high trading volume can draw an investor attention. As a result, the trading volume grows even higher. This, in turn, leads to even bigger investor attention. Overall, market-based indicators are playing a very important role in measuring investor attention. However, an investor should always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> no other variables can drive the result.|$|E

Miele later claimed that the men had indicated they were willing to pay 20 kilograms of heroin in exchange for him downing a plane.|$|E

50|$|Assuming equal {{operating}} parameters to an 802.11g network achieving 54 {{megabits per second}} (on a single 20 MHz channel with one antenna), an 802.11n network can achieve 72 megabits per second (on a single 20 MHz channel with one antenna and 400 ns guard interval); 802.11n's speed may go up to 150 megabits per second if there aren't other Bluetooth, microwave or Wi-Fi emissions in the neighborhood by using two 20 MHz channels in 40 MHz mode. If more antennas are used, then 802.11n can go up to 288 megabits per second in 20 MHz mode with four antennas, or 600 megabits per second in 40 MHz mode with four antennas and 400 ns guard interval. Because the 2.4 GHz band is seriously congested in most urban areas, 802.11n networks usually have more success in increasing data rate by utilizing more antennas in 20 MHz mode rather than by operating in the 40 MHz mode, as the 40 MHz mode requires a relatively free radio spectrum which is only available in rural areas away from cities. Thus, network engineers installing an 802.11n network should strive to select routers and wireless clients with the most antennas possible (one, two, three or four as specified by the 802.11n standard) and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the network's bandwidth will be satisfactory even on the 20 MHz mode.|$|E

Karen then tells Bill that she is gay, and that their father, Bill Spencer Sr. threatened to disown her if she came out publicly, for fear it would hurt Spencer Publications. Bill tells her that unlike their father, he loves and accepts her for who she is, which Karen greatly appreciates. In September, Katie gives birth to a baby boy named William Logan Spencer.

Some other Tories were offered places [...] "but that serving for Jacobite counties they could not hazard a new election and therefore decline the acceptance of them".

After Lord Gower took office in this government, the Tories no longer looked to him as their leader, as Lyttleton wrote: [...] "...when it was discovered that Gower was really a friend to the Hanover succession, the Tories discarded him for being their leader, and adopted a determined Jacobite the Duke of Beaufort in his stead". In June 1745 the leaders of the Tories in the Commons (Wynn and Cotton) and Beaufort informed the Jacobite court that [...] "if the Prince Charles lands in present circumstances with ten battalions or even smaller body of troops there will be no opposition".
