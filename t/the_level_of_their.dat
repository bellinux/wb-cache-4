5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall {{found that people}} will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms {{could be used in}} bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{involvement}} <b>of</b> cytokines and <b>their</b> corresponding autoantibodies (Aabs) in inflammatory mechanisms {{in patients with}} lower respiratory tract infections, blood samples were taken from patients {{at the time of}} admission to the hospital and before treatment. Cell-released capturing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) produced spontaneously by peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNC). ELISA was used to measure Aabs to these cytokines in sera. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> both cytokines were inversely related to <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> corresponding Aabs. While a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> IFN-γ was observed together with a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> anti-IFN-γ Aab, decreased IL- 4 levels were observed with increased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Aabs to IL- 4. Immunoglobulins were purified, digested to obtain Fab fragments, and tested for specificity and cross-reactivity. The Aabs and their Fab fragments were tested in cytokine biological assays and showed neutralizing effects. Our data demonstrated increased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and decreased release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 4 during early presentation of lower respiratory tract infection. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> these cytokines were inversely related to <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> corresponding Aabs that exhibited regulatory effects on the cytokine biological function in vitro...|$|R
5|$|The {{artillery}} {{guns in the}} Device forts {{were the}} property of the Crown and were centrally managed by the authorities in the Tower of London. The Tower moved them between the various fortifications as they felt necessary, often resulting in complaints from the local captains. Various surviving records record the armaments held by individual forts on particular dates, and between 1547 and 1548 a complete inventory was made of the Crown's possessions, detailing the weapons held by all of the forts. The number of guns varied considerably from site to site; in the late 1540s, heavily armed forts such as Hurst and Calshot held 26 and 36 guns respectively; Portland, however, had only 11 pieces. Some forts had more guns than <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> regular, peace-time garrison; for example, despite only having an establishment of 13 men, Milton Blockhouse had 30 artillery pieces.|$|E

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of organizational commitment on job involvement of bank managers in Sri Lanka. Based on the literature a conceptual model was developed. The study adopted research instruments that have already been validated. A total of two hundred commercial bank managers were selected for the study using the convenience sampling technique and one hundred and sixty three usable questionnaires were returned. The model was tested with the measurement model and the structural model analysis by using Partial Least Square technique (PLS). The structural model analysis results provided the support for all hypotheses formulated in this study. Thus, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> organizational commitment of bank managers, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> job involvement and their job satisfaction.

25|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, {{possibly}} {{more so than}} any other order of invertebrates. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> intelligence and learning capability are debated, but maze and problem-solving studies show they have both short- and long-term memory.

Octopus arms show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organized in their brain using an internal somatotopic map of their body, instead using a non-somatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates. Some octopuses, such as the mimic octopus, move their arms in ways that emulate the shape and movements of other sea creatures.|$|E
25|$|Paracanoeist {{race in the}} {{traditional}} kayak (K) discipline and in va'a (V), which is canoe with an outrigger, that helps the canoeist to poise the boat. The contenders are divided into three classes according to <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> disability. Participants in LTA category have functional use of their legs, trunk and arms for paddling, and they can apply force to the footboard to propel the boat. TA class paddlers have functional use of the trunk and arms, but {{they are unable to}} apply continuous and controlled force to the footboard to propel the boat due to the weakened function of their lower limbs. Canoeist who have no trunk function are classified in the A category. At the World Championships 200 metres single events were organized for both genders in both disciplines in every disability class, however, a minimum of six competing national federations for each category were required in order to be a valid championship.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new tool for decentralized output-feedback control design of large-scale nonlinear {{systems in the}} presence of non-smooth sensor noise. Through a recursive control design approach, the closed-loop decentralized system is transformed into a network of input-to-state stable (ISS) systems and the influences of the sensor noise are represented by ISS gains. The decentralized control objective is achieved by applying the cyclic-small-gain theorem to the closed-loop decentralized system. Moreover, the outputs of the closed-loop decentralized system can be driven arbitrarily close to <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> corresponding sensor noise. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no {{sense of right and}} wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.|$|E

In response the Germans ordered the 7th Army to increase <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> preparedness and to expect an invasion, but General Hans Speidel decreased the level of alert when it was reported only dummy parachutists had been found. However, Generalfeldmarshall Gerd von Rundstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzerdivision Hitlerjugend {{to deal with a}} supposed parachute landing on the coast near Lisieux which was found to consist solely of dummies from Titanic III. The dummies and SAS teams of Titanic IV diverted a Kampfgruppe from the 915th Grenadier Regiment, the 352nd Infantry Division reserve away from the Omaha and Gold beaches and the 101st Airborne Divisions drop zones. The regiment, believing an airborne division had landed, were employed searching woods instead of heading to the invasion beaches.
