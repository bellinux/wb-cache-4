5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> London were to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a Hezbollah plot in Egypt was uncovered, where Egyptian {{authorities}} arrested 49 men {{for planning}} attacks against Israeli and Egyptian <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|On 12 August 1943, 330 B-17s bombed <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> Western Germany, escorted for {{the first}} time by P-47s with drop tanks. II./JG 1 had six Fw 190s force-land and another six {{suffered}} heavy damage, losing one pilot.|$|E
5|$|XX Bomber Command {{conducted}} {{its first}} combat operation on 5June 1944. On this day 98 B-29s were dispatched from bases in India to attack <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> Bangkok, Thailand, as a 'dress rehearsal' for more ambitious operations against Japan and <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> South East Asia. Although little {{damage was done}} and five B-29s were lost due to flying accidents and technical faults, the operation was rated a success by XX Bomber Command as it provided useful combat experience for the bomber crews as well as data on how the B-29 performed in action.|$|E
50|$|The next {{competition}} {{is very similar}} but {{is known as the}} double shot which features one <b>target</b> <b>in</b> the first 30m, slightly angled forwards, and a second <b>target</b> <b>in</b> the last 30m, slightly angled backwards.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{analysis}} above, the signal of <b>target</b> <b>in</b> receiver centered region is the QFM forms, so we propose a novel algorithm suit for imaging maneuvering <b>target</b> <b>in</b> the receiver centered region. That is Radon time chirp distribution Relax algorithm.|$|R
50|$|A shot {{grouping}} is {{the spread}} of multiple shots on a <b>target,</b> taken <b>in</b> one shooting session. The group size on <b>target</b> <b>in</b> milliradians can be obtainedby measuring {{the spread of}} the rounds on <b>target</b> <b>in</b> millimeters with a caliper and dividing by the shooting distance in meters. This way, using mils, one can easily compare shot groupings or target difficulties at different shooting distances.|$|R
5|$|After Betsy, {{two other}} hurricanes {{came close to}} being seeded. Hurricane Faith was {{considered}} a likely candidate, but it stayed {{out of range of}} the seeding planes. That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, but there were no seedings. Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive. Because of that, there were no suitable seeding <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> either of those two seasons.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{proximity}} and Sun-like properties of Epsilon Eridani, in 1985 physicist and author Robert L. Forward considered {{the system as}} a plausible target for interstellar travel. The following year, the British Interplanetary Society suggested Epsilon Eridani as one of the <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> its Project Daedalus study. The system has continued to be among the targets of such proposals, such as Project Icarus in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Bockscar {{was used}} in 13 {{training}} and practice missions from Tinian, and three combat missions in which it dropped pumpkin bombs on industrial <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> Japan, in which Bock's crew bombed Niihama and Musashino, and First Lieutenant Charles Donald Albury and crew C-15 bombed Koromo.|$|E

5|$|Bockscar {{was used}} in 13 {{training}} and practice missions from Tinian, and three combat missions in which it dropped pumpkin bombs on industrial <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> Japan. On 9 August 1945, Bockscar, piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, dropped a Fat Man nuclear bomb with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT over the city of Nagasaki. About 44% {{of the city was}} destroyed; 35,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{missions}} {{were flown}} by the 509th Composite Group on 20, 23, 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945, using the bombs against individual <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> Japanese cities. A total of 49 bombs were dropped on 14 targets, one bomb was jettisoned into the ocean, {{and two were}} aboard aircraft that aborted their missions.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies {{against what}} they saw as their {{potential}} enemy, Britain. The Russian blue-water navy was stationed in San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> case war broke out between the United States and Britain. This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|HMS Wessex (pennant number: R78) was one {{of eight}} W-class destroyers built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Completed in 1944, the ship {{spent most of the}} war {{assigned}} to the Eastern and Pacific Fleets. She screened British aircraft carriers as their aircraft attacked <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> the Japanese-occupied Nicobar Islands, the Dutch East Indies and Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Göring, {{commander-in-chief}} of the Luftwaffe sanctioned the operation. The Germans {{waited for}} an opportunity to begin the intruder operation and one presented itself {{on the night of the}} 3/4 March 1945 when Bomber Command attacked <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> western Germany. The operation failed to achieve the results hoped for; the successes of the attacking force were not sufficiently commensurate with the losses sustained.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the medals claimed were not all ones that had been targeted, with Team GB falling short of <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> some {{disciplines}} whilst exceeding them in others. Nine out of seventeen disciplines met their targets.|$|E

30|$|It is also {{noteworthy}} that PLA on Cu <b>target</b> <b>in</b> air {{was reported to}} form Cu(OH) 2 besides copper oxides {{under the influence of}} water vapor [10]. PLA on Zn <b>target</b> <b>in</b> water was also found to form ϵ-Zn(OH) 2 besides W-ZnO [11]. By contrast, the present PLA on brass <b>target</b> <b>in</b> water with optional dwelling in water did not cause appreciable Cu(OH) 2 or Zn(OH) 2. This can be rationalized by the presence of multiple alloying elements of the present Cu-Zn-O-H system to have additional beneficial high entropy for disordering as mentioned.|$|R

5|$|JG 2 was {{tasked with}} {{defending}} <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> occupied France against the RAF fighter offensive. For {{the next two}} years Oesau led JG 2 through the war of attrition waged by the RAF. On 10 August 1941 Oesau claimed a Spitfire for his first kill with JG 2. Over the next two days, he claimed four more Spitfires. By the end of September 1941, Oesau had claimed two more Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{stood out}} of Hampton Roads on 11 September 1952 and arrived at Yokosuka on 17 October. Vice Admiral Joseph J. Clark, {{commander}} of the 7th Fleet, brought his staff onboard on 19 October. Her primary mission was to provide seagoing artillery support by bombarding enemy <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> the Chaho-Tanchon area, at Chongjin, in the Tanchon-Sonjin area, and at Chaho, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Hungnam during the period 25 October through 2 January 1953.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> Lebanon.|$|E
