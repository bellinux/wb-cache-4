50|$|Wrist {{arthroscopy}} is a {{minimally invasive}} operating technique {{that can be}} used to treat or diagnose wrist problems. To perform a wrist arthroscopy the patient has to be positioned in such a way that the surgeon can use the <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus</b> and access the wrist with the instruments through the portals. Depending on the medical problem a dry or wet arthroscopy can then be performed.|$|E
50|$|Before surgery can be started, {{the patient}} has to be {{positioned}} {{in such a way}} that the wrist is stabilized. In order to do this, {{the patient has}} to be placed on the operating table with his or her face upward. The wrist of the arm on which will be operated on, has to be placed on a separate operating table on the side of the other operating table. To properly stabilize the wrist, the patient's elbow is flexed and the forearm is immobilized by using a <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus.</b> By using a <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus,</b> it will also become easier to insert the instruments. In general, 4.5-6.8 kilograms of traction is implemented with the aid of finger traps. The surgeon can either opt for nylon finger traps or for wire traps. In most cases, nylon finger traps will be preferred to wire traps, as nylon is a more resilient material and thus distributes the traction force to the skin more evenly. Usually, traction is applied to two fingers, namely the index finger and middle finger. Sometimes it may be necessary to more evenly distribute the traction force on the skin, as the patient's skin may be too fragile or atrophic. The traction brought about by the <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus</b> is then applied to three or even four fingers.The surgeon can either opt for dry arthroscopy or for wet arthroscopy. When performing a dry procedure the wrist can still, if necessary, be approached using open surgery. This may, for example, be required when a TFCC lesion is diagnosed. The latter is not possible when a wet procedure is performed, because the fluid that is used causes expansion of the tissue. To improve visualization within the wrist, an inflow irrigation system is used during surgery. Currently, several systems are available, such as gravity flow, a hand pump, large syringes, or a mechanical infusion pump. For irrigation, lactated Ringer’s solution is generally used. The characteristics of lactated Ringer’s solution are that it is physiological and rapidly absorbed. Moreover, the right equipment must be available to finish a complete diagnostic arthroscopy, as well as to perform various operative procedures. Complications of using an irrigation system is that fluid extravasation into the soft tissues of the forearm can result in a compartment syndrome.|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} clinical {{results of}} the treatment of lumbar disk disorder patients by using active <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus</b> DRX- 9000 (Axiom Worldwide, Tampa, FL, USA). Fifty patients were received 30 -minites sessions every week or 2 weeks, for 3 months. Pain as measured on visual analog scale rating significantly decreased at 4. 91 ± 0. 93 to 2. 69 ± 1. 02 (p< 0. 01), and 76 % patients indicated satisfaction for treatment.. DRX- 9000 spinal decompression is expected to improve discogenic low back pain producing negative pressure in intervertebral disc by different mechanism from conventional traction. Further studies are requires to demonstrate the evidence of effectiveness of DRX- 9000 treatment on lumbar disc disorders. 能動的牽引治療器DRX- 9000 による椎間板障害患者の治療を行い、 76 ％の患者で疼痛の改善効果が得られた。これまでの牽引装置と異なるメカニズムで椎間板に陰圧を生じることにより除圧効果が期待される。本治療器の有効性の確立にはさらなる検討が必要であり、Randomized double blind trialを含めた研究の蓄積が求められる...|$|E
40|$|Adequate {{distraction}} can {{be obtained}} in ankle arthroscopy by placing a Steinmann pin transversely in the calcaneus and using the fracture table in a hip or tibial nailing mode. A sterile traction bow {{is attached to the}} calcaneal pin and then to the <b>traction</b> crank <b>apparatus</b> of the fracture table. Gross traction is first applied through the leg in the usual manner and then fine traction tension may be increased or decreased intraoperatively through the traction crank. This method of using the fracture table is easy to perform and is familiar to the orthopaedist, as it is used in intra-medullary nailing procedures. The primary advantage is that it allows for excellent exposure while avoiding the morbidity associated with a distraction pin through the distal tibia...|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} performance of solid lubricated rolling elements {{was conducted with}} a specially designed <b>traction</b> (friction) test <b>apparatus.</b> Graphite lubricants containing three additives (silver, phosphate glass, and zinc orthophosphate) were evaluated from room temperature to 540 C. Two hard coats were also evaluated. The evaluation of these lubricants, using a burnishing method of application, shows a reasonable transfer of lubricant and wear protection for short duration testing except in the 200 C temperature range. The graphite lubricants containing silver and zinc orthophosphate additives were {{more effective than the}} phosphate glass material over the test conditions examined. Traction coefficients ranged from a low of 0. 07 to a high of 0. 6. By curve fitting the traction data, empirical equations for slope and maximum traction coefficient as a function of contact pressure (P), rolling speed (U), and temperature (T) can be developed for each lubricant. A solid lubricant traction model was incorporated into an advanced bearing analysis code (SHABERTH). For comparison purposes, preliminary heat generation calculations were made for both oil and solid lubricated bearing operation. A preliminary analysis indicated a significantly higher heat generation for a solid lubricated ball bearing in a deep groove configuration. An analysis of a cylindrical roller bearing configuration showed a potential for a low friction solid lubricated bearing...|$|R
40|$|Lubrication of wheel/rail {{systems has}} been {{recognized}} {{for the last two}} decades as a very important issue for railroads. Energy savings and less friction and wear can be realized if a lubricant can be used at the wheel/rail interface. On the other hand, adverse influences are seen in operating and wear conditions if improper or excessive lubrication is used. Also, inefficiencies in lubrication need to be avoided for economic and environmental reasons. The top-of-rail (TOR) lubricant concept was developed by Texaco Corporation to lubricate wheels and rails effectively and efficiently. Tranergy Corporation has been developing its SENTRAEN 2000 {trademark} lubrication system for the last ten years, and this revolutionary new high-tech on-board rail lubrication system promises to dramatically improve the energy efficiency, performance, safety, and track environment of railroads. The system is fully computer-controlled and ensures that all of the lubricant is consumed {{as the end of the}} train passes. Lubricant quantity dispensed is a function of grade, speed, curve, and axle load. Tranergy also has its LA 4000 {trademark} wheel and rail simulator, a lubrication and <b>traction</b> testing <b>apparatus.</b> The primary task of this project was collecting and analyzing the volatile and semivolatile compounds produced as the lubricant was used. The volatile organic compounds were collected by Carbotrap cartridges and analyzed by adsorption and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The semivolatile fraction was obtained by collecting liquid that dripped from the test wheel. The collected material was also analyzed by GC/MS. Both of these analyses were qualitative. The results indicated that in the volatile fraction, the only compounds on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund List of Analytes detected were contaminants either in the room air or from other potential contamination sources in the laboratory. Similarly, in the semivolatile fraction none of the detected compounds are on the EPA's Superfund List of Analytes. The major compound in the semivolatile fraction is 1, 2 -propanediol, which was also found as the major component of the TOR lubricant before testing. Other compounds found in trace quantities either were present in the TOR lubricant or were small fragments from the polymeric component of the TOR lubricant. The second task for Argonne in this project was to investigate the effects of axle load, angle of attack, and quantity of lubricant on lateral friction forces, as well as the consumption time of the TOR lubricant. The second task was to collect and qualitatively identify any volatile and semivolatile compounds produced upon use of the TOR lubricant...|$|R
40|$|The limited wall space {{available}} in modern buildings, where the outside walls {{are replaced by}} windows, gives wonderful natural light, but makes {{the task of the}} physiotherapist who wants to instal various kinds of apparatus rather complicated. I was faced with this problem last year and was fortunate to have the assistance of a carpenter who was prepared to inspect various types of equipment, study its uses, and then design and construct a unit incorporating all necessary equipment but fitting into a small area of solid wall space. The plans (Figure I) illustrate a unit combining wall bars, weights and pulleys and vertical neck <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus.</b> There is nothing original about any section of the unit but the combination has proved most efficient in operation as well as economical of space...|$|E
40|$|A {{cervical}} {{traction system}} is discussed that offers advantages over {{traditional methods of}} applying cervical traction. The major advantage of this system {{is that it allows}} precise application of traction to only the restricted spinal segments. Because of this specificity, traction may be applied at reduced force, decreasing the risk of injury. The <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus</b> is adjusted easily to the individual and may be used in the clinic or at home. My experience with the apparatus has shown greater patient compliance, resulting in increased treatment effectiveness, when compared with traditional traction methods. Four representative case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this traction system. Closely controlled studies are needed to substantiate the effectiveness and safety of this traction system. Key Words: Cervical vertebrae, Physical therapy, Spine, Traction. Cervical traction is used frequently in physical therapy to relieve pain and {{has been found to be}} a useful and effectiv...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMeasuring water {{self-diffusion}} in the oriented {{structure of}} stretched Nafion represents {{an effective way}} of studying {{the correlations between the}} stress-induced order and the transport properties of the membrane. In this work, we performed pulsed-field gradient NMR experiments to investigate water self-diffusion in a single membrane under traction. The data were collected with a high signal-to-noise ratio and small draw ratio steps using a specially design NMR probe together with a mini <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The results demonstrate that the anisotropy of diffusion is much larger in a membrane under traction than in a stack of membranes that were uniaxiafly stretched at high temperature before the measurements. Arguments based on the mechanical properties of Nafion can explain qualitatively the observed differences by highlighting the important role of both applied stress and temperature in the stress-induced order. We used a simple, but realistic, deformation model to analyze the experimental data by extracting the evolution of the diffusion anisotropy {{as a function of the}} orientational order parameter of the water conducting channels. Finally, we made analogies between the self-diffusion of water in the anisotropic structure of stretched Nafion and the Brownian dynamics of elongated particles...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Vascularized or non-vascularized fibula {{transport}} {{is a novel}} {{procedure for}} limb salvage but {{has been associated with}} high failure rates and complications. Ipsilateral medial fibular transport (IMFT) using Ilizarov apparatus is a modification of the procedure to prevent complications and increase success rate. This article presents the largest series of limb salvage for massive tibial bone loss in children due to pan-osteomyelitis by IMFT with Ilizarov apparatus. Methods: A case series of 12 patients {{with a mean age of}} 12 (6 – 18) years is described. At the first stage of surgery, the excision of all dead bone was performed, and Ilizarov without <b>traction</b> <b>apparatus</b> was applied. In second stage, ipsilateral fibula is gradually transferred to tibial defect with the help of ilizarov olive wires. In the third stage, the freshening of docking sites of fibula to tibia was performed. The minimum follow up was of two years. Results: Hypertrophy of the transported fibula accompanied by full weight bearing and satisfactory joint motion occurred in all patients. Removal of sequestrated bone resulted in control of infection in 27. 17  ±  7. 76 days. Fibular transport took 16. 58  ±  4. 14 days. The length of tibial bone loss replaced by fibula was 9. 50  ±  2. 23  cm. The mean days required for union after freshening of the docking site was 76. 58  ±  6. 20 days. Conclusions: Ilizarov frame for pan tibial osteomyelitis with bone excision and medial fibular transport works well for limb salvage in children...|$|E
