5|$|It is {{possible}} to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone—a statistical method known as meta-analysis. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients. It concluded <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> patients achieved a 50% reduction in seizures and a third achieved a 90% reduction.|$|E

Alabama's offense was stifled {{throughout}} by effective pressure from Tech defensive end Corey Moore, and Tech was able to turn several fumbles and interceptions by the Crimson Tide into points on the scoreboard. The final 387 Virginia Tech victory was the biggest win in Virginia Tech bowl game history, and Moore was named the game's most valuable player. The two teams did not meet again until the 2009 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game on September 5, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Like most European nations the Scots in {{this period}} began to covert from the bow to {{gunpowder}} firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> troops were missile men and half of those were arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops {{seems to have been}} an aim of Scottish commanders for most of the century, although it was not always possible in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, who seem to have extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions of the Rough Wooing.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E

5|$|The record-breaking {{performance}} {{brought him}} an invite from the Berlin IAAF Golden League meet, although organising group Euromeetings condemned the move. Revelations in Chambers' autobiography Race Against Me brought further controversy {{as the book}} had in-depth accounts of his past drug abuse and claimed drug use remained rife in athletics, estimating <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> American Olympic athletes in Beijing had used illegal substances. Chambers signed a statement with UK Sport, verifying that he believed the information to be true, which brought a close to the organisation's inquiries into his drug use. An IAAF investigation concluded that the book demanded no further action on their part. Olympic gold medallist and anti-drugs campaigner Ed Moses gave his support, saying that Chambers admissions provided a useful insight, but that athletes and administrators remained in denial about {{the high levels of}} doping in athletics.|$|E
5|$|Some {{soldiers}} had received training through the compulsory training scheme {{that had been}} established in 1911, while others had served as volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or {{as members of the}} British Army, but their numbers were limited and in many cases the quality of the training they had received was also limited. The original intention had been <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> initial intake would consist of soldiers that were currently serving in the Militia, but ultimately this did not come to fruition and while about 8,000 of the original intake had some prior military experience, either through compulsory training or as volunteers, over 6,000 had none at all. In terms of officers, the situation was better. For example, within the 1st Division, of its initial 631 officers, 607 had had previous military experience. This was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early {{in order for them to}} join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions. Other than small numbers of Duntroon graduates, from January 1915 the only means to be commissioned into the AIF was from the ranks of enlisted personnel. As a result, by 1918 the majority of company and battalion commanders had risen from the ranks. While the AIF's initial senior officers had been members of the pre-war military, few had any substantial experience in managing brigade-sized or larger units in the field as training exercises on this scale had been rarely conducted before the outbreak of hostilities. This inexperience contributed to tactical mistakes and avoidable casualties during the Gallipoli campaign.|$|E
