5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>can</b> find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general haven of reform movements.|$|E
5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>can</b> deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

The manifesto also asserted that African-Americans were a [...] "black colony" [...] within a U.S. government that was doomed to overextend itself. [...] And the RYM was needed to quicken this process. Dohrn said, [...] "The best thing that we can be doing for ourselves, as well as for the [...] Panthers and the revolutionary black liberation struggle, is to build a fucking white revolutionary movement." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Carlyle {{would have}} admired Lyttelton. His {{politics}} (at one juncture) were 'The Dictatorship for Lord Chatham'! How does this {{agree with the}} sentiments of Junius? In 1767-69 Junius had exhausted on Chatham his considerable treasury of insult. He is 'a lunatic brandishing a crutch,' 'so black a villain,' 'an abandoned profligate,' and he exhibits 'THE UPSTART INSOLENCE OF A DICTATOR!' This goes not well with Lyttelton's sentiments in 1774. True, but by that date (iii. 305) Junius himself had discovered 'that if <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>can</b> be saved, it must be saved by Lord Chatham's spirit, by Lord Chatham's abilities.' Lyttelton and Junius are assuredly both of them ruffianly, scandal-loving, inconsistent, and patrician {{in the manner of}} Catiline. So far, the likeness is close.|$|E

Tripe is more expensive, properly understood, than the hothouse pine-apple. Taking into account the number of animals slaughtered yearly within the bills of mortality alone; and forming a low estimate of the quantity of tripe which the carcases of those animals, reasonably well butchered, would yield; I find that the waste on that amount of tripe, if boiled, would victual a garrison of five hundred men for five months of thirty-one days each, and a February over. The Waste, the Waste!’ ...|$|E

6000|$|... "As for {{all this}} cry about aristocracy, I don't {{understand}} it. Hugh Littlepage has just as good a right to his ways as I have to mine. The gentleman says he needs gold spoons and silver forks to eat with. Well, what of that? I dare say the gentleman himself finds a steel knife and fork useful, and has no objection to a silver, or, at least, to a pewter spoon. Now, there are folks that use wooden forks, or no forks, and who are glad to get horn spoons; and they might call that gentleman himself an aristocrat. This setting of ourselves up as the standard in all things is anything but liberty. If I don't like to eat my dinner {{with a man who}} uses a silver fork, no man in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>can</b> compel me. On the other hand, if young Mr. Littlepage don't like a companion who chews tobacco, as I do, he ought to be left to follow his own inclination.|$|E
6000|$|To conclude,--Mr. Littlepage and Mary Warren were married, in St. Andrew's Church, a {{very few}} days since. We met the young gentleman, on his wedding tour, no later than yesterday, and he assured us that, {{provided}} with such a companion, {{he was ready to}} change his domicile to any other part of the Union, and that he had selected Washington, {{for the express purpose of}} being favorably situated for trying the validity of the laws of the United States, as opposed to the [...] "thimble-rigging" [...] of the New York Legislature. It is his intention to have every question connected with the covenants of his leases clearly settled, that of taxing the landlord for property on which the tenant has covenanted to pay all taxes; that of distress for rent, when distress must precede the re-entry stipulated for by the leases; and that of any other trick or device which the brains of your [...] "small-potato" [...] Legislature may invent in order to wrong him out of his property.

[...] "Why," [...] said I, [...] "will it make you sorry?"--"Because," [...] said he, [...] "you have brought me here twenty-five days journey, and will leave me to go back alone; and which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without a ship, without a horse, without pecune?"

60|$|The good work, however, {{in spite}} of all {{political}} and party differences, has been well begun; we are all interested in it; it is advancing, and cannot be stopped by any opposition, although it may be retarded in this place or in that, by the indifference of the middle classes, with whom its successful progress chiefly rests. Of this success I cannot entertain a doubt; for whenever the working classes have enjoyed an opportunity of effectually rebutting accusations which falsehood or thoughtlessness have brought against them, they always avail themselves of it, and show themselves in their true characters; and it was this which made the damage done to a single picture in the National Gallery of London, by some poor lunatic or cripple, a mere matter of newspaper notoriety and wonder for some few days. This, then, establishes a fact evident to the meanest comprehension--that any given number of thousands of individuals, in the humblest walks of life in <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>can</b> pass through the national galleries or museums in seasons of holiday-making, without damaging, in the slightest degree, those choice and valuable collections. I do not myself believe that the working classes ever were the wanton or mischievous persons they were so often and so long represented to be; but I rather incline to the opinion that some men take it into their heads to lay it down as a matter of fact, without being particular about the premises; and that the idle and the prejudiced, not wishing to have the trouble of forming opinions for themselves, take it for granted--until the people have an opportunity of disproving the stigma and vindicating themselves before the world.|$|E
60|$|My Lords, {{here is an}} act of Parliament; {{here are}} {{regulations}} enacted in consequence of an inquiry which had been directed to be made into the grievances of India, for the redress of them. This act of Parliament declares the existence of oppressions in the country. What oppressions were they? The oppressions which it suffered by being let out to the farmers of the Company's revenues. Who was the person that sold these revenues to the farmers? Warren Hastings. By whom were these oppressions notified to the Court of Directors? By Lord Cornwallis. Upon what occasion were these letters written by my Lord Cornwallis? They were answers to inquiries made by the Court of Directors, and ordered by an act of Parliament to be made. The existence, then, of the grievances, and the cause of them, are expressly declared in an act of Parliament. It orders an inquiry; and Lord Cornwallis, in consequence of that inquiry, transmits to the Court of Directors this very information; he gives you this identical state of the country: so that it is consolidated, mixed, and embodied with an act of Parliament itself, which no power on earth, I trust, but the power that made it, can shake. I trust, I say, that neither we, the Commons, nor you, the Lords, nor his Majesty, the sovereign of <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>can</b> shake one word of this act of Parliament,--can invalidate the truth of its declaration, or the authority of the persons, men of high honor and character, that made that inquiry and this report.
