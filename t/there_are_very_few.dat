5|$|In some {{countries}} the monarch had {{little control over}} lords, or required {{the construction of new}} castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission– {{as was the case in}} England in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal {{that is difficult to}} fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E

5|$|The mansion {{itself was}} {{originally}} constructed as a Federal-style {{home by the}} prominent family of iron masters; an 1895 remodeling transformed the structure {{with the addition of}} Victorian features. The mansion is constructed of locally quarried red sandstone, as are the outbuildings, which at one time numbered nearly 30. The grounds is also notable for its pre-1840 American formal garden, of which <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> surviving. The estate currently hosts the Mount Hope Estate and Winery, the Swashbuckler Brewing Company, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire, and other events held throughout the year (see below).|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of the {{district}} in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there are dry sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi-natural woodlands. Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are infrequent. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> flood meadows left, although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> Arabians {{registered}} as roan, {{and according to}} researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics. Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently lighten with age, while a gray does.|$|E

5|$|The Danish {{name is not}} unexpected; the {{language}} of the Ormulum, an East Midlands dialect, is stringently of the Danelaw (Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.174–75). It includes numerous Old Norse phrases (particularly doublets, where an English and Old Norse term are co-joined), but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> Old French influences on Orm's language (Bennett 1986, p.33). Another—likely previous—East Midlands work, the Peterborough Chronicle, shows a great deal of French influence. The linguistic contrast between it and the work of Orm demonstrates both the sluggishness of the Norman influence in the formerly Danish areas of England and the assimilation of Old Norse features into early Middle English (Bennett 1986, pp.259–63).|$|E
5|$|The predilection {{of insects}} for this {{mushroom}} was noted by 19th-century British mycologist Anna Maria Hussey, {{who wrote in}} 1847: <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> of the soft-fleshed tribes, {{all of which are}} the nurseries of innumerable insects, so much in favour as the poisonous Boletus luridus, on breaking an old one it is a living mass of larvae. Our present subject is so soon attacked by insects that it is very rare to find specimens devoid of wriggling life, and being a very common and abundant kind, it must be of great service in the economy of insect existence. Several fly species have been recorded feeding on the fruit bodies, including Phaonia boleticola, P.rufipalpis, Thricops diaphanus, and, in North America, Drosophila falleni, Pegomya mallochi, P.winthemi, Megaselia pygmaeoides, and Muscina assimilis. In contrast, slugs tend to avoid consuming this species.|$|E
5|$|Carabane, {{also known}} as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme {{south-west}} of Senegal, {{in the mouth of}} the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the mangrove trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of Ziguinchor Region, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a dry season and a wet season. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are mangos and oranges. Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> mammals.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> {{material}} {{remains of}} the medieval town today. The city wall that surrounded the settlement has largely disappeared and is difficult to trace today, but from the remains of its foundations {{it does not appear}} to have been a substantial fortification. It was lightly built, with a thickness of perhaps , reinforced by rectangular towers. The three gates have left far more substantial remains. The eastern, southeastern and southern sides were fronted by a ditch of some , with the excavated soil dumped on the inner side and used to elevate the city wall. A small citadel was located in the southwestern corner of the town. The port was separated from the main town by a wall, and was situated in an excavated basin (today a swamp) and probably separated from the sea by an artificial mole and protected by extensions of the city walls. The entrance to the harbour was from the west, offering protection from both the wind and the coast's shoals.|$|E
5|$|The University of Central Florida has {{a unique}} campus layout {{that has become a}} model for other universities, {{reminiscent}} of the plans by Walt Disney for his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, or EPCOT. The campus was designed to be a pedestrian oriented campus, with a series of concentric circles. The outermost circle is Gemini Blvd, which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus. Inside of Gemini, there is Apollo Circle, Mercury Circle, and finally Pegasus Circle as the innermost circle. Pegasus Circle contains the student union, which is the center of the campus, with the John C. Hitt Library located directly to the south of it. All academic buildings are located inside of Gemini, with the circle divided up into pie-shaped sections for each college. As <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> roads inside of Gemini, many buildings' loading docks are accessible only by sidewalks and thus receive most deliveries at night. The University of Central Florida campus is one of only two in the nation with a concentric circle design, the other being the University of California, Irvine. Newsweek has ranked UCF as having the 20th most beautiful university campus in the country. Student housing is provided along the perimeter of the campus. Outside of Gemini, the campus is divided up into different themed sections. The northwest side of campus includes Greek communities, the north side contains Knights Plaza, an uptown style athletic village, the east side contains the Arboretum of the University of Central Florida, and the south side contains student recreation and wellness facilities.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{structure}} of the army was {{the division of the}} companion cavalry (hetairoi) with the foot companions (pezhetairoi), augmented by various allied troops, foreign levied soldiers, and mercenaries. The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of Alexander I of Macedon, while Macedonian troops are accounted for in the history of Herodotus as subjects of the Persian Empire fighting the Greeks at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. Macedonian cavalry, wearing muscled cuirasses, became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), at times siding with either Athens or Sparta and supplemented by local Greek infantry instead of relying on Macedonian infantry. Macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers, while the cavalry was composed of noblemen eager to win glory. An early 4th-century BC stone-carved relief from Pella shows a Macedonian infantryman wearing a pilos helmet and wielding a short sword showing a pronounced Spartan influence on the Macedonian army before Philip II. Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that at the beginning of Philip II's reign in 359 BC, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, the latter figure similar to that recorded for the 5th century BC. However, Malcolm Errington cautions that any figures for Macedonian troop sizes provided by ancient authors should be treated with a degree of skepticism, since <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>few</b> means by which modern historians are capable of confirming their veracity (and could have been possibly lower or even higher than the amount stated).|$|E
