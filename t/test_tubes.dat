5|$|A {{breakthrough}} came in 1948 when {{a research}} group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human {{tissue in the}} laboratory. This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed {{that there were a}} few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining <b>test</b> <b>tubes,</b> on the off chance that the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E
5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase sequencer into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, a {{gold medal}} {{competition}} {{was sponsored by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of protein purification, the eluent is usually pooled in {{different}} <b>test</b> <b>tubes.</b> All <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> containing no measurable trace of the protein to purify are discarded. The remaining solution is thus made of the protein to purify and any other similarly-sized proteins.|$|E

30|$|For {{the test}} of {{parasite}} eggs detection, initially, half a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> was filled with zinc sulfate solution. After transferring 1  g of the sample into the <b>test</b> <b>tube,</b> the suspension was prepared. The above suspension was passed through a two-layered filtrate and the filtered solution was returned to the <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> Zinc sulfate solution {{was added to the}} <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> as long as a distance of 2 – 3  mm from the solution {{to the surface of the}} <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> opening was achieved. After centrifugation at a speed of 3000  rpm for 1  min, a loop from the zinc solution was obtained and added onto a slide containing a legal solution so that the identification process could be carried out under the microscope.|$|R

30|$|If an AD is effective, it {{will keep}} {{asphaltenes}} in the solution {{and there are no}} asphaltene agglomerate particles. Therefore, the mean transmittance remains constant along the Turbiscan <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> (Fig.  2 a). For semi-stability mixtures, the received light varies with time (Fig.  2 b). For ineffective ADs, agglomeration occurs and asphaltene particles deposit {{at the bottom of the}} <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> Hence, the mean transmittance increases towards the top of the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> as the upper part of the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> becomes less dense (Fig.  2 c). In this case, the change in the stability of the fluid depends mostly on the fluid characteristics.|$|R
25|$|Gause’s 1930s lab {{experiments}} showed logistic {{growth in}} microorganisms. Populations of yeast grown in <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> initially grew exponentially. But as resources became scarcer, their growth rates slowed until reaching the carrying capacity. If the populations {{were moved to}} a larger container with more resources they would continue to grow until reaching their new carrying capacity. The shape of their growth can be modeled very effectively with the logistic growth model.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene Petri {{dishes and}} other {{laboratory}} containers such as <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> and microplates {{play an important}} role in biomedical research and science. For these uses, articles are almost always made by injection molding, and often sterilised post-molding, either by irradiation or by treatment with ethylene oxide. Post-mold surface modification, usually with oxygen-rich plasmas, is often done to introduce polar groups. Much of modern biomedical research relies on the use of such products; they therefore play a critical role in pharmaceutical research.|$|E
25|$|Associated Press {{commissioned}} the Linus Pauling Institute {{to measure the}} in vitro antioxidant strength of Xango Juice against retail fruit juices. The antioxidant strength of XanGo Juice measured slightly higher than cranberry juice but lower than black cherry and {{less than half the}} value for blueberry juice. However, the value of in vitro analysis of antioxidant strength is questionable, as there is no current evidence that antioxidant phytochemicals present in Xango or other fruit juices actually have functions inside the human body. The measurements of antioxidant strength apply to <b>test</b> <b>tubes,</b> but consumed juices are affected by stomach acids that would neutralize or destroy antioxidant value preventing the same biological effects in vivo.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach {{to the study of}} history that he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact that}} it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions how to address those difficulties.|$|E
500|$|Rafael Grugman dystopian novel Nontraditional Love (2008) {{describes}} the twenty-third century. [...] USA. [...] The world is homosexual.

[...] The Netherlands is the only country where mixed-sex marriages are permitted. [...] In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world.

500|$|However, other reviews were positive. After Briggs' {{review was}} published, {{a large number}} of letters {{supportive}} of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to [...] "take a second look" [...] at the show, with Matt Shumway and Lamont Wayne writing a much more positive review, calling it [...] "a fresh show with very different approaches". The Sarasota Herald-Tribune was highly positive of the show and felt that the show's lively animation and slapstick humor recalled [...] "the delight of earlier cartoon era", writing: [...] "In times of old, cartoon characters had eyes that bugged out when they drank something unpleasant, legs that became whirling circles when they ran and bodies that flattened into pancakes when they crashed into slammed doors. Well, they're ba-a-a-ck." [...] The Herald Sun considered Ed, Edd n Eddy an animated mixture of well-known classic TV shows, noting [...] "just imagine Dexter in his laboratory working on some new project for the Cartoon Network when he tunes into The Little Rascals and The Three Stooges. Alfalfa, Spanky, Moe and Curly really excite the wunderkind who decides to extract some DNA from the old TV legends. Into the <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> with the DNA ... add a little animation and Dexter has Ed, Edd N Eddy".|$|E

500|$|Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, {{according}} to film scholars Jay R. Letzner and Donald R. Ross, [...] "garnered both {{some of the}} harshest epithets {{and some of the}} most lavish praise in recent cinematic history". It received acclaim from many critics; even Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had up til that point been primarily dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars and commented, [...] "David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there I forgive him for Wild at Heart (1990) and even Lost Highway (1997). At last his experiment doesn't shatter the <b>test</b> <b>tubes.</b> The movie is a surrealist dreamscape {{in the form of a}} Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." [...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "exhilarating... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" [...] and added, [...] "there's a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146minutes [...] proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves." ...|$|E
