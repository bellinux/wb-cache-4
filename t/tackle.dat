40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} the relationships between <b>tackling</b> ability, playing position, muscle strength and power qualities, and match-play <b>tackling</b> performance in semiprofessional rugby league players. Methods: Sixteen semiprofessional rugby league players (mean ± SD age 23. 8 ± 1. 9 y) underwent tests for muscle strength and power. <b>Tackling</b> ability of the players was tested using video analysis of a standardized 1 -on- 1 <b>tackling</b> drill. After controlling for playing position, players were divided into “good tackler” or “poor tackler” groups based on the median split {{of the results of}} the 1 -on- 1 <b>tackling</b> drill. A total of 4547 <b>tackles</b> were analyzed from video recordings of 23 matches played throughout the season. Results: Maximal squat was significantly associated with <b>tackling</b> ability (rS =. 71, P 3 ̆c. 05) and with the proportion of dominant <b>tackles</b> (rS =. 63, P 3 ̆c. 01). Forwards performed more <b>tackles</b> (P =. 013, ES = 1. 49), with a lower proportion of missed <b>tackles</b> (P =. 03, ES = 1. 38) than backs. Good tacklers were involved in a larger proportion of dominant <b>tackles</b> and smaller proportion of missed <b>tackles</b> than poor tacklers. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that lower-body strength contributes to more effective <b>tackling</b> performance during both a standardized <b>tackling</b> assessment and match play. Furthermore, players with good <b>tackling</b> ability in a proficiency test were involved in a higher proportion of dominant <b>tackles</b> and missed a smaller proportion of <b>tackles</b> during match play. These results provide further evidence of the practical utility of an off-field <b>tackling</b> assessment in supplying information predictive of <b>tackling</b> performance in competition...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the <b>tackling</b> technique of high-performance, collision-sport athletes and documented the relationships between <b>tackling</b> technique and playing experience, playing level, game-specific <b>tackling</b> performance, and injury in these athletes. Twenty-two national rugby league (NRL) and 17 state-based rugby league (SRL) players underwent a standardized one-on-one <b>tackling</b> drill in a 10 m grid. Video footage {{was taken from the}} rear, side, and front of the defending player. <b>Tackling</b> technique was assessed using standardized technical criteria. A large difference (ES = 1. 53, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) was detected between playing groups for <b>tackling</b> technique, with NRL players having better <b>tackling</b> technique than SRL players. Players who had at least 150 NRL matches experience had a significantly greater (ES = 1. 1 – 1. 6, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) <b>tackling</b> technique than players who had played up to 49 NRL matches, 50 – 99 NRL matches, or 100 – 149 NRL matches. Significant relationships (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) were detected between <b>tackling</b> technique and the proportion of <b>tackles</b> missed each game (r = − 0. 74) and the proportion of dominant <b>tackles</b> effected each game (r = 0. 78). There was no relationship between <b>tackling</b> technique and the incidence of <b>tackling</b> injuries. The results of this study demonstrate that playing level and playing experience influence <b>tackling</b> technique in high-performance, collision sport athletes, with greater playing experience and playing level associated with greater <b>tackling</b> technique. Furthermore, significant relationships were detected between <b>tackling</b> technique and the proportion of <b>tackles</b> missed each game (negative) and the proportion of dominant <b>tackles</b> effected each game (positive).
