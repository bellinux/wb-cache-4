40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the process of {{bacterial}} sulphate reduction, which is used to removal of heavy metals and sulphate ions from waste waters. The life of animals and plants depends on the existence of microscopic organisms  microorganisms (MO), which {{play an important role in}} cycle changes of biogenic elements on the earth. The sulphur cycle in the nature is considered as one of the oldest and most significant biological systems (Fig. 1). The sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) miss the assimilatory part of the cycle and produce sulphides. The microbial population of this dissimilatory part is called sulfuretum. The SRB can be found in anaerobic mud and sediments of freshwater, thermal or non-thermal sulphur springs, mining waters from sulphide deposits, oil deposits, sea and ocean beds, and in the gastrointestinal tract of man and animals. The SRB represent a group of chemoorganotrophic, strictly anaerobic and gramnegative bacteria, which exhibit a great morphological and physiological diversity. Despite of their considerable morphological variety, they have one property in common, which is the ability to utilise preferentially sulphates (occasionally sulphites, <b>thiosulphates,</b> tetrathionates) as electron acceptors, which are reduced to sulphides, during anaerobic respiration. The electron donors in these processes are simple organic compounds as lactate, malate, etc.,(heterotrophically reduction) or gaseous hydrogen (autotrophically reduction). SRB can produce a considerable amount of hydrogen sulphide, which reacts easily in aqueous solution with the cations of heavy metals, forming metal sulphides that have low solubility. The bacterial sulphate reduction can be used for the treatment of acid mine drainage waters, which is considered to be the major problem associated with mining activities. In order to remove heavy metals from waste waters, e. g., from galvanizing plants, mine waters (Smolnik, obov locality) and metallurgic plants (works Krompachy) by use of the activity of SRB, mixed strains were isolated, cultivated, and their production of hydrogen sulphide was assessed. The cultures were then tested for the ability to precipitate copper and sulphates from a model solution. The bacteria were isolated from water samples from two localities: Východoslovenské eleziarne (works)  VS and spring Gajdovka  Gj. Isolation, cultivation and eliminating Cu 2 + and SO 42 - was carried out under following conditions: statically, temperature 30 oC, pH 7, 5, nutrient medium by J. Postgate (medium B, C and D) and anaerobic conditions. Residual copper in the solution was measured by atomic absorption photometry. The concentracion of sulphates in the solution was measured by the nefelometric method. Our findings from the isolation of SRB from two Slovak water samples and testing the cultures for their ability to remove copper permit the following conclusions: SRB occur in sufficient numbers in sulphur mineral water from natural sources and in industrial waste waters reservoirs, the sulphate-reducing activity can be harnessed for the purification of some industrial waste waters. The nature possesses a great biological potential that can be exploited under certain conditions in the cleanup of environmental pollution resulting from the industrial activity in the past and present...|$|E
40|$|An {{extended}} {{overview of}} the phase-mineral transformations of organic and inorganic matter that occur during biomass combustion was conducted. Some general considerations and particularly {{problems associated with the}} composition of biomass and biomass ash (BA) and behaviour of biomass during burning were discussed initially. Then, reference peer-reviewed data plus own investigations were used to organise and describe systematically the above topics. It was demonstrated that the phase composition of BA is polycomponent, heterogeneous and variable and includes: (1) mostly inorganic matter (IM) composed of non-crystalline (amorphous) and crystalline to semi-crystalline (mineral) constituents; (2) subordinately organic matter (OM) consisting of char and organic minerals; and (3) some fluid matter associated with both IM and OM. Approximately 291 phases or minerals were identified in BA. These species have primary, secondary or tertiary origin in the combustion residue and they are generated from natural authigenic and detrital) and technogenic phases or minerals originally present in biomass. Afterwards, common issues related to the composition, occurrence, transformation and origin of common constituents in biomass and BA such as: (1) OM, namely cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, char and other organic phases plus organic minerals; and (2) IM such as silicates, oxides and hydroxides, phosphates, sulphates (plus sulphides, sulphosalts, sulphites and <b>thiosulphates),</b> carbonates (plus bicarbonates), chlorides (plus chlorites and chlorates), nitrates, glass, amorphous (non-glass) material and other inorganic phases; were described and compared to coal ash. As a final point, a systematization of physico-chemical transformations during biomass combustion is given. It was found that the original OM and IM in biomass during combustion transform: (1) initially to devolatilization of OM and burning of combustible gases and char with formation of intermediate and less stable oxalates, nitrates, chlorides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulphates and inorganic amorphous (non-glass) material; (2) subsequently to more stable silicates, phosphates and oxides; (3) then to melting accompanied by dissolution of the refractory minerals; with increasing combustion temperatures in the system; and (4) followed by crystallisation of melt and formation of glass accompanied by some salt condensation and hydroxylation, hydration and carbonation of newly formed phases during cooling of BA. Finally, some post-combustion transformations of the newly formed minerals and phases to stable during weathering species among silicates, hydroxides, phosphates, sulphates, carbonates, chlorides and nitrates also occur due to their hydration, hydroxylation and carbonation by moisture and CO 2 in the air through storage of BA. Certain major associations related to the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases were identified in the BA system and they include: (1) Si–Al–Fe–Na–Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca–Mg–Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K–P–S–Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, chlorides, glass and some silicates and carbonates). These associations were applied for classification of BAs to four types and six sub-types. It was found that such systematic relationships have a key importance in both fundamental and applied aspects related to innovative and sustainable processing of biomass and BA. The ash formation mechanisms and ash fusion behaviour, as well as some indications of potential technological problems and environmental risks during combustion of biomass types and sub-types and application of their BAs will be described in Part II of the present work.

40|$|Background. Methanol is a {{volatile}} organic compound commonly found in the effluent of the pulp and paper industries. Because of its toxicity, methanol can cause metabolic acidosis, neurologic sequelae, and even death when ingested. Information on biokinetic activity such as biodegradation rate of methanol and <b>thiosulphate,</b> biomass growth rate and biomass yield coefficient is limited in the literature. Objectives. To study the biomass growth rate and biomass yield coefficients of methanol and <b>thiosulphate</b> biodegradation. This research aims to increase {{knowledge of how to}} reduce the emission of toxic gas to the environment. Methods. The biodegradation trends of both methanol and <b>thiosulphate</b> were studied under anaerobic conditions using batch experiments at ambient temperature and alkaline conditions. Both supplement each other for their degradation. Methanol is an electron donor, whereas <b>thiosulphate</b> acts as an electron acceptor. A mixed culture from a previously used biomass in a biotrickling filter reactor from theUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), International Graduate Water Education Facility and fresh activated sludge from the Harnaschpolder wastewater treatment plant were used as a biomass source. Results. A specific biomass growth rate of biomass ranging from 0. 04 to 1. 7 g per day was observed. The <b>thiosulphate</b> is biologically degraded by the biomass grown inside the reactor. The biodegradation rate of <b>thiosulphate</b> in the reactor varied from 0. 02 to 0. 80 g per unit gram of biomass per day. A biodegradation rate of methanol in the reactor was observed in the range between 0. 04 to 3. 9 g per unit gram of biomass per day. Bacterial biomass was grown as per the amount of methanol present inside the reactor. A maximum biomass yield coefficient of 0. 7 g biomass per gram of methanol was recorded. <b>Thiosulphate</b> was converted to sulphate that indirectly served as an electron acceptor for methanol degradation.

Though these results were not unexpected, it was not anticipated that under equilibrium conditions the behaviour of <b>thiosulphate</b> and polythionate would be relatively independent of each other. [...] As the freeze-thaw cycle has been shown to influence thiosalt speciation, a stability study was conducted to determine the stability of thiosalt species at different pHs. The thiosalts were found to be reasonably stable using a fast-freeze approach, where at pH 2, 4, and 7, most thiosalt concentrations changed within the range of ± 6 % after fast freezing in liquid nitrogen, storage in a freezer, and thawing in a water bath at 20 °C just prior to analysis. [...] Kinetic experiments were designed and conducted with the purpose of investigating thiosalt reaction kinetics under acidic, neutral, and basic conditions at variable temperatures. According to the results of this study, <b>thiosulphate</b> decomposed to trithionate, sulphate, and tetrathionate at pH 2. At pH 2 and 9, trithionate decomposed to sulphate, <b>thiosulphate</b> and tetrathionate only at 30 °C; while at pH 4 and 7, trithionate decomposed to sulphate, <b>thiosulphate</b> and tetrathionate at temperatures of 15 °C or greater. At pH 9, tetrathionate decomposed to <b>thiosulphate,</b> trithionate, and sulphate. In a mixture of thiosalt, <b>thiosulphate</b> and trithionate reacted as in the single species experiments, but tetrathionate was more reactive. Generally, the relative rates of decomposition of <b>thiosulphate,</b> trithionate, and tetrathionate were second or higher order. The decomposition rates increased with increasing initial thiosalt concentration and temperature (except for <b>thiosulphate</b> decomposition at pH 9 and 30 °C) ...|$|R
30|$|The genus Chlorella is {{a widely}} {{employed}} microalga for biodiesel, {{as it can be}} grown using photo/mixo/heterotrophic mode of cultivation. The present investigation was undertaken with the hypothesis that addition of different substrates (amino acids, carbon sources, vitamins) along with reducing agents may aid in diverting Acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA or fatty acid biosynthesis, under mixotrophic conditions in Chlorella sorokiniana. Preliminary investigations undertaken with two reducing agents individually (sodium <b>thiosulphate</b> and methyl viologen) along with selected substrates revealed the promise of sodium <b>thiosulphate</b> (1 %) in enhancing lipid accumulation significantly. Further, the role of inclusion of twelve substrates and sodium <b>thiosulphate</b> revealed that supplementation with tryptophan (0.1 %) recorded 57.28 % enhancement in lipid productivity on 4 th day. Highest values of lipid productivity of 33 % were recorded on 8 th day in 0.1 % glucose supplemented medium containing sodium <b>thiosulphate.</b> Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) profiles generated revealed significant reduction in the content of Poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and enhanced Mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (especially oleic acid) in the treatments involving tryptophan, Vitamin B 12, sodium pyruvate and glucose. This study reveals the promise of using sodium <b>thiosulphate</b> along with selected substrate for enriching {{the quality and quantity of}} lipids, which can be valuable for exploiting algae as a source of biodiesel.|$|R

Phylogenetic relatives of Chlorella zofingiensis, such as Chlorella vulgaris and C. protothecoides were reported to accumulate high amounts of lipids when cultivated under heterotrophic conditions (Liu et al. 2011 a;Hsieh and Wu 2009). However, knowledge on Chlorella species to accumulate lipids and fatty acids under different growth modes remains largely unknown.|$|R

40|$|<b>Thiosulphate</b> has {{received}} much attention {{as an alternative}} non-cyanide lixiviant for gold recovery {{over the last three}} decades. In particular, {{a number of studies have}} shown that an ammoniacal copper(II) /thiosulphate system offers fast leaching kinetics, but there are difficulties in controlling the complex solution chemistry and there are concerns over the use of ammonia. Recently, <b>thiosulphate</b> leaching of gold in the absence of ammonia has shown to be one of the most promising alternatives to cyanide, as evident from the <b>thiosulphate</b> gold processing plant recently commissioned at Barrick Goldstrike for treating pressure-oxidized double refractory ore. However, the published information on non-ammoniacal <b>thiosulphate</b> systems is limited. In this work, the dissolution of gold in non-ammoniacal <b>thiosulphate</b> solutions has been studied using a rotating electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (REQCM), rotating gold disk, gold powder, and selected sulphidic gold ores. The electrochemical studies found that gold oxidation is enhanced by increases in temperature, <b>thiosulphate</b> concentration, and the addition of low levels of copper. Oxygen reduction was found to occur much more readily on sulphide mineral surfaces than on the gold surface, offering an opportunity for galvanic interaction. The subsequent leaching tests using REQCM showed that the gold leach rate in the oxygen-thiosulphate system without any additives is in the order of 10 - 7 mol m- 2 s- 1, two orders of magnitude lower than a typical cyanidation rate. However, the use of elevated temperature, high oxygen concentration, and copper addition, in conjunction with the galvanic effect of sulphide minerals, dramatically improved the gold leach rate to the same order of magnitude as a typical cyanidation rate. This was supported by the results obtained from prolonged leaching tests using gold powder and sulphidic gold ores. This study hence shows that the oxygen-thiosulphate system could be a promising alternative to cyanidation for treating some sulphidic gold ores...|$|R
40|$|The {{progress}} of the oxidation of <b>thiosulphate</b> by ferricyanide ion has been followed spectrophotometrically in buffered solution over the pH range 4 [...] 7. Tracer studies with 35 S showed the presence of polythionate as the major product of oxidation, some sulphate being formed when equivalent concentrations of the reactants were used. The reaction {{was found to be}} catalysed by tetrathionate, and kinetics in the absence of products were studied as initial rates. Two rate laws, both independent of ferricyanide, were found to apply. One of these, first order with respect to hydrogen and second order with respect to <b>thiosulphate</b> was shown to proceed by a mechanism which has previously been observed for the initial stages of the acid catalysed decomposition of <b>thiosulphate.</b> No detailed mechanism was proposed for the second contributor which appeared to be dominant at high cation concentration where the order with respect to hydrogen, <b>thiosulphate</b> and cation was one. In the later stages, the catalysed reaction was resolved by fitting rate-[S 4 O 6 2 [...] ] data to a second degree polynomial in tetrathionate concentration. This expression was found to be equivalent to a rate law of first order with respect to ferricyanide and tetrathionate ions, in agreement with previously reported work. Kinetic data for the oxidation of <b>thiosulphate</b> by iodate and by bromate ions are presented, the former reaction showing catalysis by potassium and caesium ions but not sodium ion. The latter reaction, for which only a preliminary study was made, showed general acid catalysis. Both processes gave rate laws, with respect to <b>thiosulphate,</b> hydrogen and halate ions, which were the same as those reported by previous authors and the observed results were explained in terms of well established mechanisms. <p...|$|R
