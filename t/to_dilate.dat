5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart <b>to</b> <b>dilate</b> and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E

50|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{the most}} common form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. It occurs more frequently in men than in women, and is most common between the ages of 20 and 60 years.

25|$|Topical {{atropine}} {{is used as}} a cycloplegic, {{to temporarily}} paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, <b>to</b> <b>dilate</b> the pupils.

25|$|Dr. Evelyn Fisher {{wrote of}} how {{women living in}} a mining town in Wales during the 1920s used candles {{intended}} for Roman Catholic ceremonies <b>to</b> <b>dilate</b> the cervix {{in an effort to}} self-induce abortion. Similarly, the use of candles and other objects, such as glass rods, penholders, curling irons, spoons, sticks, knives, and catheters was reported during the 19th century in the United States. Women of Jewish descent in Lower East Side, Manhattan are said to have carried the ancient Indian practice of sitting over a pot of steam into the early 20th century. Abortion remained a dangerous procedure into the early 20th century, more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930.|$|E

50|$|Myocarditis, {{also known}} as {{inflammatory}} cardiomyopathy, is inflammation of the heart muscle.

25|$|If {{water is}} not allowed to flow in or out of the soil, the stress path is called an {{undrained}} stress path. During undrained shear, if the particles are surrounded by a nearly incompressible fluid such as water, then the density of the particles cannot change without drainage, but the water pressure and effective stress will change. On the other hand, if the fluids are allowed to freely drain out of the pores, then the pore pressures will remain constant and the test path is called a drained stress path. The soil is free <b>to</b> <b>dilate</b> or contract during shear if the soil is drained. In reality, soil is partially drained, somewhere between the perfectly undrained and drained idealized conditions.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{substances}} and poisons (like atropine) can {{significantly reduce the}} range of aperture. Pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar side-effects. Tropicamide and phenylephrine are used in medicine as mydriatics <b>to</b> <b>dilate</b> pupils for retinal and lens examination. These medications take effect in about 30–45 minutes after instillation and last for about 8 hours. Atropine is also used {{in such a way}} but its effects can last up to 2 weeks, along with the mydriatic effect; it produces cycloplegia (a condition in which the crystalline lens of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects). This effect goes away after 8 hours. Other medications offer the contrary effect. Pilocarpine is a miotic (induces miosis); it can make a pupil as small as 1mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics. Such drops are used in certain glaucoma patients to prevent acute glaucoma attacks.|$|E

500|$|The cervix plays a {{major role}} in childbirth. As the fetus descends within the uterus in {{preparation}} for birth, the presenting part, usually the head, rests on and is supported by the cervix. As labour progresses, the cervix becomes softer and shorter, begins <b>to</b> <b>dilate,</b> and rotates to face anteriorly. The support the cervix provides to the fetal head starts to give way when the uterus begins its contractions. During childbirth, the cervix must dilate to a diameter of more than [...] to accommodate the head of the fetus as it descends from the uterus to the vagina. In becoming wider, the cervix also becomes shorter, a phenomenon known as effacement.|$|E
500|$|Bates {{adhered to}} a {{different}} explanation of accommodation {{that had already been}} generally disregarded by the medical community of his time. Bates' model had the muscles surrounding the eyeball controlling its focus. In addition to their known function of turning the eye, Bates maintained, they also affect its shape, elongating the eyeball to focus at the near-point or shortening it to focus at a distance. Commenting on this hypothesis in an interview with WebMD, ophthalmologist Richard E. Bensinger stated [...] "When we put drops in the eye <b>to</b> <b>dilate</b> the pupil, they paralyze the focusing muscles. The evidence of the anatomical fallacy is that you can't focus, but your eye can move up and down, left and right. The notion that external muscles affect focusing is totally wrong." [...] Science author John Grant writes that many animals, such as fishes, accommodate by elongation of the eyeball, [...] "it's just that humans aren't one of those animals." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{intricate}} designs of the Transformers, {{even the simplest}} motion of turning a wrist needs 17 visible parts; each of Ironhide's guns are made of ten thousand parts. Bumblebee uses a piece below his face-plate as an eyebrow, pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile, and all the characters' eyes are designed <b>to</b> <b>dilate</b> and brighten. According to Bay, [...] "The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering 38 hours for ILM to render just one frame of movement"; that meant ILM had to increase their processing facilities. Each rendered piece had to look like real metal, shiny or dull. This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots had to transform from clean cars. Close-up shots of the robots were sped up to look [...] "cool", but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly illustrate a sense of weight. Photographs were taken of each set. These were used as a reference for the lighting environment, which was reproduced within a computer, so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there. Bay, who has directed numerous car commercials, understood ray tracing {{was the key to}} making the robots look real; the CG models would look realistic based on how much of the environment was reflecting on their bodies. Numerous simulations were programmed into the robots, so the animators could focus on animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance.|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{document}} the morphological progression from acute idiopathic myocarditis <b>to</b> end-stage <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy we studied 20 patients with a diagnosis of myocarditis who had had serial endomyocardial biopsies performed with intervals of 1 month to 2 years and whose ages varied from 6 months to 62 years. Fifteen of these patients were treated with immunosuppressive drugs for myocarditis. Ten out of 15 treated patients stabilized clinically. In the remaining 5 cases there was worsening congestive heart failure and 1 patient underwent cardiac transplantation. Of the 5 patients who did not receive immunosuppression, 2 stabilized spontaneously, and 3 developed heart failure, 2 of whom subsequently had cardiac transplants. Whether the patients received immunosuppression or not, in all cases, the inflammatory infiltrate was less but the myocardium developed significant hypertrophy {{with an increase in}} interstitial fibrosis and in 8 cases the morphological changes were those of dilated cardiomyopathy. From the morphological standpoint of this study we have shown some evidence that dilated cardiomyopathy can be the end result of acute myocarditis. It appears that not every case of acute myocarditis progresses <b>to</b> <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy and that steroid treatment does not necessarily prevent progression of myocarditis <b>to</b> <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction A {{progression}} from viral myocarditis <b>to</b> <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy has been recently established [1] due to {{developments in the}} molecular analyses of autopsy and endomycardial biopsy using modern immunological techniques.

A new promising therapy of the virally induced myocarditis seems to be treatment with interferon. This therapy is known to augment the inflammatory response {{which can lead to}} virus elimination from the heart tissue. In the present study, patients with myocarditis and virus-positive biopsy have been treated by interferon and followed up using magetocardiographic (MCG) mapping.
