40|$|Deductive Inference for <b>the</b> Interiors and <b>Exteriors</b> of Horn TheoriesIn this paper, we {{investigate}} the deductive inference for <b>the</b> interiors and <b>exteriors</b> of Horn knowledge bases, where <b>the</b> interiors and <b>exteriors</b> were introduced by Makino and Ibaraki [11] to study stability properties of knowledge bases. We present a linear time algorithm for the deduction for the interiors {{and show that}} it is co-NP-complete for the deduction for <b>the</b> <b>exteriors.</b> Under model-based representation, we show that the deduction problem for interiors is NP-complete while <b>the</b> one for <b>exteriors</b> is co-NP-complete. As for Horn envelopes of <b>the</b> <b>exteriors,</b> we show that it is linearly solvable under model-based representation, while it is co-NP-complete under formula-based representation. We also discuss the polynomially solvable cases for all the intractable problems...|$|R
