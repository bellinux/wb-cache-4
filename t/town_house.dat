The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977 and 1979, with contributions on several tracks from Bruce Woolley. The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin's <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> in West London, while the vocals were recorded and mixed at Sarm East Studios. Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979.|$|E
5|$|Kirkcaldy <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> on Wemyssfield is the centrepiece of the town's civic square. It was {{designed}} in the 1930s by David Carr and William Howard of Edinburgh. World War II stopped work on the building until 1950. Construction was split into two phases: the west wing, which was completed in 1953, and the east wing, completed in 1956.|$|E

Collins showed some ability as an all-rounder, with his right-arm medium pace bowling taking 11 wickets for 63 runs.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} is split between a condominium apartment building and nine <b>town</b> <b>houses.</b> The apartment building reflects {{the design of}} factories located near the original Superior Ink factory. Arthur Lublow, writing for The New York Times, criticized the <b>town</b> <b>houses,</b> complaining {{that they were not}} similar to other <b>town</b> <b>houses</b> in Greenwich Village, but rather resembled those on the Upper East Side owing to their heavy ornamentation.|$|R

Hardy is buried in Westminster Abbey, but his heart was removed and buried in Stinsford.|$|E
5|$|The school {{continued}} to use the former guildhall site in Hill Street until 1898, by which stage the medieval building was much altered and in a dilapidated condition. At this point, the school moved to an 18th-century house on South Brink. A fundraising campaign was launched {{to pay for the}} house, but after insufficient funds were donated, the cost of purchase was met by Alexander, Baron Peckover. The house and its grounds was originally intended to be the headmaster's residence and provide lodgings for a few boarders, but soon expanded to accommodate the entire school with the construction of classrooms and a hall. The central block of the 18th-century <b>town</b> <b>house</b> was used as a panelled library. An unusual feature of the old <b>town</b> <b>house</b> is the cupola on the roof, evidence of the town's sea-based prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} Commodore Charles Knowles, {{who served as}} Governor of Louisbourg after its capture, had {{a large number of}} seamen from Boston harbour {{impressed}} for service in his squadron. A mob of more than 300 men seized three naval officers and a deputy sheriff and beat the sheriff. The mob then went to Governor Shirley's house, demanding the release of the men impressed by Knowles. Shirley tried to call out the militia, but they did not respond. Shirley did succeed in getting the naval officers into his house, and the mob eventually left. Later in the day Shirley went to the <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> to meet the people. The mob, now consisting of several thousand people, attacked the <b>Town</b> <b>House,</b> breaking many windows in the building. Shirley spoke to the mob and promised to present their demands to Commodore Knowles. The mob left, intending to find a Royal Navy ship to burn.|$|E

5|$|Arundel House was {{originally}} the <b>town</b> <b>house</b> of the Bishops of Bath and Wells. It {{was owned by}} William FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Southampton between 1539 and his death in 1542, with ownership passing to Thomas Seymour in 1545. After Seymour was executed in 1549, the property was sold to Henry FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, and was owned by the Earldom {{for much of the}} 16th and 17th century. In 1666, it became the meeting place of the Royal Society after the Great Fire of London destroyed their previous venue. The house was demolished in 1678 and Arundel Street, adjoining the Strand, was built on the site.|$|E
5|$|Fife Council, {{based in}} Glenrothes, the unitary local {{authority}} for Kirkcaldy, is the executive, deliberative, and legislative body responsible for local governance. Kirkcaldy <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> {{is the main}} administrative headquarters for the Kirkcaldy area within the local authority. The Kirkcaldy area also sends eleven councillors, elected from three wards, to Fife Council. Beyond the tiers of local government, the Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters from the Parliament of the United Kingdom, such as education, health, and justice.|$|E

5|$|In the {{north-east}} are two {{homes of}} early wealthy merchants and shipowners connected with Kirkcaldy's harbour. The Merchant’s House or Law’s Close at 339–343 High Street; {{once owned by}} the Law family, {{is one of the}} best surviving examples of a sixteenth-century <b>town</b> <b>house</b> in Scotland. Sailors' Walk, at 443–449 High Street; consists of two seventeenth-century houses, resting on foundations dating back to around 1460. These two houses were once divided into four dwellings; three of which were owned by the Oliphant family and the fourth by James Ferguson of Raith.|$|E
5|$|Other Roman remains include part of {{the town}} walls and the {{foundations}} of a <b>town</b> <b>house</b> near the county hall. Modern building works within the walls have unearthed Roman finds; in 1936 a cache of 22,000 3rd-century Roman coins was discovered in South Street. Other Roman finds include silver and copper coins known as Dorn pennies, a gold ring, a bronze figure of the Roman god Mercury and large areas of tessellated pavement.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Allen, an {{entrepreneur}} and philanthropist, was notable for his reforms to the British postal system. He moved in 1710 to Bath, {{where he became}} a post office clerk, and {{at the age of}} 19, in 1712, became the Postmaster. In 1742 he was elected Mayor of Bath, and was the Member of Parliament for Bath between 1757 and 1764. The building in Lilliput Alley, now North Parade Passage in Bath, which he used as a post office, became his <b>Town</b> <b>House.</b>|$|E

5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham {{was working in}} the country at Petworth, gave Brettingham another opportunity to design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's <b>town</b> <b>house.</b> Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known at the time as Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 16th century the Dunlugas Ogilvies {{undertook}} re-furbishment and extension work, including {{the addition of}} courtyard buildings and a distinctive circular tower that incorporated the hall into its first storey. An act recording the lands in favour of George Ogilvy was ratified by King Charles I in late June 1633. George {{was the son of}} Walter Ogilvy, and an ardent Royalist and supporter of the king against the Covenanters. Inchdrewer Castle was left in ruins after being attacked by Covenanter forces led by General Robert Monro in 1640; another of the family properties, a <b>town</b> <b>house,</b> was also devastated. George Ogilvy was appointed a peer in 1642, becoming the first Lord Banff.|$|E
5|$|Leicester possessed one of {{the largest}} {{collections}} of paintings in Elizabethan England, being the first great private collector. He was a principal patron of Nicholas Hilliard, as well as interested in all aspects of Italian culture. The Earl's circle of scholars and men of letters included, among others, his nephew Philip Sidney, the astrologer and Hermeticist John Dee, his secretaries Edward Dyer and Jean Hotman, as well as John Florio and Gabriel Harvey. Through Harvey, Edmund Spenser found employment at Leicester House on the Strand, the Earl's palatial <b>town</b> <b>house,</b> where he wrote his first works of poetry. Many years after Leicester's death Spenser wistfully recalled this time in his Prothalamion, and in 1591 he remembered the late Earl with his poem The Ruins of Time.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{went on to}} rent further {{land around}} the north of Plas Mawr. The land {{at the south end}} of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne {{purchased}} this in 1585, probably for the relatively high price of £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr. Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west side of the house and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around £300. The result was the grandest Elizabethan <b>town</b> <b>house</b> in Wales at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Age of Plastic had {{a budget}} of £60,000. Hugh Padgham {{recorded}} the backing tracks at Virgin's <b>Town</b> <b>House</b> in West London, due to Sarm East's very small size and Horn wanting to record real drums. The Buggles went to London’s Wardour Street to gain the attention of and record two females {{to appear on the}} album. The mixing and Horn's vocal recording were later done at Sarm East Studios, and mixing was finished before Christmas 1979 for a new year's release of the album. Sarm East mixer Gary Langan used a 40-input Trident TSM console to record and mix the album, which was housed inside the same control room as two Studer A80 24-track machines and outboard gear that included an EMT 140 echo plate, Eventide digital delay, Eventide phaser, Marshall Time Modulator, Kepex noise gates, Urei and Orban EQs, and Urei 1176, Dbx 160, and UA LA2 and LA3 compressors.|$|E
5|$|Within Dorchester parish {{there are}} 293 {{structures}} that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest, including five that are listed Grade I and sixteen that are Grade II*. The Grade I structures are the Church of St George on Fordington High Street, the Church of St Peter on High West Street, Max Gate on Syward Road, the Roman <b>town</b> <b>house</b> on Northernhay, and Shire Hall on High West Street. The Church of St George has a late-11th-century south door {{that has a}} Caen stone tympanum with a realistic carved representation of St George surrounded by soldiers, said to depict the miracle of his appearance at the Battle of Antioch. The south aisle and the north part of the porch date from the 12th century. The Church of St Peter mostly dates from 1420–21, with a 12th-century south doorway reset into it. There are many notable monuments, including two 14th-century effigies and a 14th-century tomb chest. Thomas Hardy contributed to {{the addition of the}} vestry and chancel in 1856-7. Max Gate was designed by Thomas Hardy in the Queen Anne style, and was his home until his death in 1928. It was built in 1885. The remains of the Roman house north of county hall date from the early 4th century, with later 4th-century enlargements. It has a hypocaust heating system and mosaic pavements. It is the only visible Roman <b>town</b> <b>house</b> in Britain. The current Shire Hall building was designed by Thomas Hardwick and built in Portland stone ashlar in 1797. It replaced a previous structure that had fallen into disrepair. A tablet commemorates the sentencing of the Tolpuddle Martyrs here in 1834. The building housed the Crown Court until 1955; Thomas Hardy was a magistrate here and his experience provided inspiration for his writing. The building has changed little since the 19th century, and in 2014 planning permission was granted to transform it into a heritage centre and tourist attraction, to open in 2017.|$|E
