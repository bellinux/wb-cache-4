Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> {{to be used for}} social mobility.|$|E
5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legal in Ireland since 16 November 2015. A referendum on 22 May 2015 amended the Constitution of Ireland to provide <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> recognised {{irrespective of the}} sex of the partners. The measure was signed into law by the President of Ireland as the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 August 2015. The Marriage Act 2015, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 October 2015 and signed into law by the Presidential Commission on 29 October 2015, gave legislative effect to the amendment. Marriages of same-sex couples in Ireland began being recognised from 16 November 2015 and the first marriage ceremonies of same-sex couples in Ireland occurred on 17 November 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church teaches <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> {{a social}} and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and {{procreation}} of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E

5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E

25|$|Believing <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> {{a celebration}} of God's love, the church recognizes and celebrates all legal marriages, {{including}} same-sex couples, previously divorced people, and couples of different religions. The actual policy of whom to marry is left up to the church council of each pastoral charge. For instance, one congregation might not allow same-sex marriages to be performed in their building, while another allows all marriages regardless of sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|The Church does {{recognize}} that there are rare occasions when it is better that couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces. For the Orthodox, to say <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man.|$|E
25|$|Some {{religious}} groups argue that having the government decide whether a same-sex marriage should be legally binding {{on the grounds}} of the ideology of other {{religious groups}} restricts their religious freedom.

Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the United States, no church or other religious institution is forced to perform same-sex marriages, but the FMA would deny the opportunity for religions which approve of same-sex marriage to perform legally binding same-sex marriages.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial began}} with opening {{statements}} by Theodore Olson and San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Therese Stewart for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sought to show <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> a fundamental right; that depriving {{gays and lesbians}} {{of the right to}} marry hurts them and their children; {{and that there was no}} reason or societal benefit in prohibiting them from getting married. Charles J. Cooper made an opening statement for the defendants, saying that marriage had been universally limited to opposite-sex couples. The plaintiffs then testified about their personal experiences as gay Americans, and the reasons why they wished to marry.|$|E
25|$|Gay activist Jonathan Rauch {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> {{good for all}} men, whether {{homosexual}} or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity. The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated {{to their ability to}} provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, the Scottish Episcopal Church {{became the}} first in the Anglican Communion to take steps to allow {{same-sex}} marriages to be performed in their churches. The General Synod voted in favour of a motion to begin discussion amongst the seven dioceses to remove the doctrinal clause which states <b>that</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> {{between a man and a}} woman. The vote received support from five of seven bishops, 69% of the clergy and 80% of the laity. The General Synod formally approved the change to the doctrinal clause in June 2017, removing language stating that marriages could only be between a man and a woman and introducing a new conscience clause which allows clergy to opt out of performing same-sex weddings. On 20 July 2017 it was announced that a same-sex wedding was to be held in St Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow, later in the summer. On 1 August 2017, a same-sex marriage which included the Eucharist as a nuptial mass was held at the Church of St John the Evangelist, Edinburgh. The Scottish Episcopal Church is estimated to have 100,000 members, and offers same-sex marriage to other Anglicans, including members of churches in England and America.|$|E
