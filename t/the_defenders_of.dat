5|$|Courbet and Paris {{formed a}} Fifth Squadron at the {{beginning}} of the war. They were transferred to the Atlantic to continue their training duties without interference. Both ships were ordered restored to operational status on 21 May 1940 by Amiral Mord and their light anti-aircraft outfits were augmented at Cherbourg. Courbet was ordered to provide gunfire support to <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Cherbourg against the advancing 7th Panzer Division and covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies while Paris supported <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Le Havre. Lack of spotting aircraft meant that neither ship was particularly effective in that role.|$|E
5|$|In Nova Covert Ops, Valerian {{has been}} under {{pressure}} from <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> <b>of</b> Man, who oppose his rule. Valerian questions Nova {{when she returned to}} the Dominion after being missing for some time. Valerian believes her claim, that she didn't betray the Dominion and grants her her own covert ops team to discover what <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> <b>of</b> Man are up to. After Nova learns, that the Defenders are using psi emitters to lure zerg to Dominion Worlds to discredit him, and learning the identity of their leader, General Davis, Valerian contacts her and announces his wish to step down as the Emperor of the Dominion.|$|E
5|$|Many major {{ports and}} {{positions}} {{were incorporated into}} the Atlantic Wall, receiving heavy fortifications. Hitler ordered all positions {{to fight to the}} end, and some of them remained in German hands until Germany's unconditional surrender. Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarines after being surrounded by Allied Forces. <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> these positions included foreign volunteers and Waffen-SS troops.|$|E

5|$|Martorana {{placed the}} pieces of marble {{in a way that}} looked artistic. In 1947, a {{pedestal}} of granite taken from the Mellon Mansion was erected on the northern end of the oval. On top of it was placed a life-size bronze statue of Christ with open arms. On Armistice Day, November 11, 1951, the monument was dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> the United States.|$|E
5|$|Statius {{mentions}} Orion {{four times}} in his Thebaïd; twice as the constellation, a personification of storm, but twice as the ancestor of Dryas of Tanagra, one of <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Thebes.

5|$|Dutthagamani's army {{attacked}} {{all four}} {{gates of the}} city simultaneously. He led the main assault on the southern gate with Nandimithra, Suranimala and the elephant Kandula, while {{the attacks on the}} northern and western gates were led by Bharana, Khanjadeva, Phussadeva and Labhiyavasabha. The eastern gate was attacked by Mahasona, Gothaimbara, Theraputthabhaya and Velusumana. <b>The</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> the eastern gates were routed by Velusumana after a cavalry attack, and Elara's forces withdrew into the city.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{withdrawal}} from the area around Orsogna, the 2nd New Zealand Division {{was one of a}} number of divisions that was transferred from the Eighth Army to the Fifth Army, then engaged on the western side of the Apennines. This was part of an overall strategy to breach the Gustav Line and break an otherwise deadlocked Italian front. Together with the 4th Indian Division and supporting British and American artillery, the division formed the New Zealand Corps, under the command of Freyberg. The corps moved to Cassino, <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> which had resisted American forces for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Kami, Perempoean (Perfected Spelling: Kami, Perempuan; Indonesian for We, the Women) is a 1943 stage play in one act by Armijn Pane. The six-character drama {{revolves}} around {{a conflict between}} two couples, with the women considering the men cowards for not wanting to join <b>the</b> <b>Defenders</b> <b>of</b> the Homeland and the men afraid of how the women will react to them having secretly joined. Despite warnings from the women's mother and father, the men prepare to leave for their training, with their partner's blessings.|$|E
5|$|This is no {{time for}} men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our {{heritage}} and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.|$|E

5|$|While the {{conflict}} between the HVO and the ARBiH contributed to the weakening defence of Jajce, the military superiority of the VRS was the principal reason behind the town's capture. Besides the advantage in troop size and firepower, VRS staff work and planning was significantly superior to the organisational efforts of <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Jajce. The principal problem for the defence of Jajce was that the town was defended by two separate command structures, one having authority over ARBiH troops and the other over HVO units.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Spanish Room, {{the library is}} the most {{atmospheric}} of rooms, upon the wall of which are hung the huge keys of the destroyed Corfe Castle, handed back to Mary Bankes after her defence of Corfe Castle during the Civil War. The state bedroom is extremely ornate and has housed such important guests as Kaiser Wilhelm II who stayed with the family for a week in 1907. The main staircase is beautifully carved from stone and features three huge statues which look out onto the gardens from their seats. These depict Sir John Bankes and Lady Bankes, <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Corfe Castle, and their patron, Charles I.|$|E
5|$|As consul he {{took part}} in a number of Senate debates. His first chance to shine in the Senate came in the dispute between ex-preator Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Cornelius failed to give his seat to Corbula at a gladiatorial show, and the {{incident}} sparked a debate between the rights of age and <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> tradition, in which Drusus argued a rapprochement. In another, it was proposed by Caecina Severus that the wives of governors be banned from joining their husbands in the provinces. Caecina delivered a speech in support of the bill, followed with speeches by both Valerius Messalinus and Drusus in opposition to it. The proposal was then abandoned, not because of the arguments made, but because of the intervention of an external force (the auctoritas of Drusus) the same reason for the later repeal of the Oppian law (lex Oppia).|$|E

5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E
5|$|Before marching towards Antioch, Khalid and Abu Ubaidah {{decided to}} isolate the city from Anatolia; this was done by {{capturing}} all the fortresses that were providing strategic defense to Antioch, most importantly A'zāz at north east of Antioch. In order to save the empire from annihilation, a desperate battle was fought between the Muslim army and that of <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Antioch outside the city near Orontes river, popularly known as Battle of Iron bridge. The Byzantine army was composed of the survivors of Yarmouk and other Syrian campaigns. After being defeated, the Byzantines retreated to Antioch and the Muslims besieged the city. Having little hope of help from emperor, Antioch surrendered on 30 October 637, with the terms that all Byzantine troops would be given safe passage to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|In 1778, Curtis {{returned}} to Britain in Eagle, {{but refused to}} carry out an order to sail the ship to the Far East, a refusal which earned the enmity of Lord Sandwich. In December {{of the same year}} he was married to Jane Sarah Brady. As punishment for his disobedience Curtis was unemployed for the next two years, before he secured the new frigate HMS Brilliant for service in the Mediterranean in 1780. Ordered to Gibraltar, Brilliant was attacked by a superior Spanish squadron close to the fortress and was forced to escape to British-held Menorca. Curtis's first lieutenant Colin Campbell complained extensively about his captain's refusal to leave port while enemy shipping passed by the harbour, but Curtis was waiting for a 25-ship relief convoy which he met and safely convoyed into Gibraltar, bringing supplies to <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> the Great Siege of Gibraltar then in progress.|$|E
5|$|In a heavy fog in October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. Instead, they repaired Leipzig enough to keep her afloat, and in that state, provided gunfire support to <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> Gotenhafen against the advancing Red Army in March 1945. As the Germans continued to retreat in the east, Leipzig was then used to transport a group of fleeing German civilians. She reached Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst <b>the</b> <b>defenders</b> <b>of</b> this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E

[...] When Liu was subsequently moved to be <b>the</b> <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> Taiyuan, Yang apparently followed Liu to his new post, and became a close confidant of Liu's.|$|R
