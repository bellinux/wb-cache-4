60|$|Washington, as usual, profited by the {{inactivity}} of Howe; quietly retreating through Derby (on the 12th) {{across the}} Schuylkill to Germantown, {{within a short}} distance of Philadelphia, where he gave his troops a day's repose. Finding them in good spirits and in nowise disheartened by the recent affair, which they seemed to consider a check rather than a defeat, he resolved to seek the enemy again and give him battle. As preliminary measures, he left some of the Pennsylvania militia in Philadelphia to guard the city; others, under General Armstrong, were posted at the various passes of the Schuylkill, with orders to throw up works; the floating bridge on the lower road was <b>to</b> be <b>unmoored,</b> and the boats collected and taken across the river.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{takes place}} in an {{unspecified}} Brazilian favela which the player has to navigate. The player takes {{on the role of}} Quico, a young boy who has run away from his home to escape his abusive and alcoholic father. Quico has the ability to turn the environment into a magical and dream-like world. For example, tugging a glowing thread can pull a stairway {{out of the side of}} a building, lifting a cardboard box can cause an entire building <b>to</b> come <b>unmoored</b> from its foundations, shacks can sprout legs and scuttle into place to provide a handy bridge. According to Ars Technica's website [...] "there's a sense of childlike imagination at play in the way the game adds a layer of magic into the rundown world, and it's likely to make you look at your own surroundings a little differently after you play".|$|R
60|$|Hiram had {{not stopped}} <b>to</b> <b>unmoor</b> the boat; but taking {{from his pocket}} a knife, slashed here and there at the hawsers until she was adrift, and the wind, driving from the south in furious gusts, sent her {{whirling}} {{in the direction of}} Hudson's point as if impelled by a dozen pairs of oars.|$|E

And now for my poor brother-in-law: {{though he}} is a soldier, we cannot let him slip without a word of {{consolation}} and a leave-taking, in my judgment. This has been an unlucky affair on every tack; though I suppose it is what one {{had a right to}} expect, considering the state of the times {{and the nature of the}} navigation. We must make the best of it, and try to help the worthy man <b>to</b> <b>unmoor,</b> without straining his messengers. Death is a circumstance, after all, Master Pathfinder, and one of a very general character too, seeing that we must all submit to it, sooner or later." ...|$|E
60|$|Talcott {{came to call}} me, at the {{indicated}} moment. I had made him chief-mate, and taken one of the Philadelphians for second officer; {{a young man who}} had every requisite for the station, and one more than was necessary, or a love of liquor. But, drunkards do tolerably well on board a ship in which reasonable discipline is maintained. For that matter, Neptune ought to be a profound moralist, as youths are very generally sent to sea to cure most of the ethical flings. Talcott was directed <b>to</b> <b>unmoor,</b> and heave short. As for myself, I got into a boat and pulled ashore, with an intention of making a last and strong appeal to Marble.|$|E
5000|$|Demy {{is perhaps}} best known for his {{original}} musical, Les Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, 1964), with a score by Legrand. Although the subversion of established genres was a typically New Wave obsession (notably Godards playful [...] "Neorealist musical," [...] A Woman Is a Woman), Demy was unusual in actually recreating them literally. The whimsical concept of singing all the dialogue sets the tone for this tragedy of the everyday. The film also sees the emergence of Demys trademark visual style: whereas Lola, filmed by Godards cinematographer Raoul Coutard, has a New Wave black and white austerity, Les Parapluies is shot in saturated supercolour, with every detail—neck-ties, wallpaper, even Catherine Deneuves bleached-blonde hair—selected for maximum visual impact. The young man, Roland Cassard, from Lola (Marc Michel) reappears here, marrying Deneuves character. Such reappearances are typical of Demys work. A huge fan of Les Parapluies was Kurt Vonnegut, who wrote in private correspondence: [...] "I saw The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which I took very hard. <b>To</b> an <b>unmoored,</b> middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. Thats all right. I like to have my heart broken." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{left the}} {{supercargo}} and my mate, also a kinsman of my own, a true sailor, {{who had been}} a midshipman, but was now a lieutenant; I say, to those I left the command of both my ships, but with express orders not <b>to</b> stir nor <b>unmoor,</b> upon any account whatever, unavoidable accidents excepted, until my return, or until, if I should die, they should hear of that event; no, though they were to stay there six months, for they had provisions enough, and an excellent place for watering lay just by them. And I made all the men swear to me that they would make no mutiny or disorder, but obey my said kinsman in one ship, and the supercargo in the other, in all things, except removing from that place; and that, if they should command them to stir from thence, they would not so much as touch a sail or a rope for the purpose.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study on the}} global motion characteristics of two semisubmersible units having similar hull arrangement, but different hull column geometry is carried out. All comparisons are considered at an operational draft. Each unit has four column ring pontoon hull. One of the units has quadratic hull column while the other unit has circular hull column. The hull of each unit has the same column center to center distance and pontoon dimension. At the considered operation draft, {{each of the two}} units is set to have similar initial stability in terms of metacentric height, similar water plane area and nearly similar displacement. Deck load arrangement is not discussed in detail but the overall mass distribution is also kept the same for the two units by employing the same radius of gyration about the global coordinates. Both of the units that are set for comparison are considered <b>to</b> be <b>unmoored</b> and also, riser stiffness, damping and inertia effects are not included for analysis. The sesame suite of software is used for modeling of each unit, running global hydrodynamic analysis and for the post processing of the results from the analysis. The global first order motion transfer functions of the two units are compared. Statistical post processing is performed by applying sea states from a selected environmental contour line. Then, comparison between the two units is also carried out in terms of global short term maximum responses, short term minimum air gap requirement, slamming load from breaking waves and also in terms of second order horizontal mean drift loads...|$|R
60|$|It {{sprung up}} a fresh gale {{in the evening}} at S.W. by W., which, being fair for the Portugal fleet, and the weather {{pleasant}} and agreeable, we heard the signal given <b>to</b> <b>unmoor,</b> and running in under the island of Si---, we hauled our mainsail and foresail up in the brails, lowered the topsails upon the cap, and clewed them up, that we might lie as snug as we could, expecting their coming out, {{and the next morning}} saw the whole fleet come out accordingly, but not at all to our satisfaction, for they consisted of twenty-six sail, and most of them ships of force, as well as burthen, both merchantmen and men-of-war; so, seeing there was no meddling, we lay still where we were also, till the fleet was out of sight, and then stood off and on, in hopes of meeting with further purchase.|$|E
60|$|Some hot-heads {{would have}} urged an attempt against all such array of force, but Lord Loudoun {{was aware of}} the {{probability}} of defeat, and the disgrace and ruin that it would bring upon British arms in America. He wisely, though ingloriously, returned to New York. Admiral Holbourne made a silly demonstration of his fleet off the harbor of Louisburg, approaching within two miles of the batteries, but retired on seeing the French admiral preparing <b>to</b> <b>unmoor.</b> He afterwards returned with a reinforcement of four ships of the line; cruised before Louisburg, endeavoring to draw the enemy to an engagement, which De la Mothe had the wisdom to decline; was overtaken by a hurricane, in which one of his ships was lost, eleven were dismasted, others had to throw their guns overboard, and all returned in a shattered condition to England. Thus ended the northern campaign by land and sea, a subject of great mortification to the nation, and ridicule and triumph to the enemy.|$|E
60|$|The wind being now N.W., {{the sea was}} {{considerably}} run down, and this morning at five o'clock the landing-master's crew, thirteen in number, left the tender; and having now no detention with the landing of artificers, they proceeded <b>to</b> <b>unmoor</b> the Hedderwick praam-boat, and towed her alongside of the Smeaton: {{and in the course}} of the day twenty-three blocks of stone, three casks of pozzolano, three of sand, three of lime, and one of Roman cement, together with three bundles of trenails and three of wedges, were all landed on the rock and raised to the top of the building by means of the tackle suspended from the cross-beam on the middle of the bridge. The stones were then moved along the bridge on the waggon to the building within reach of the balance-crane, with which they were laid in their respective places on the building. The masons immediately thereafter proceeded to bore the trenail-holes into the course below, and otherwise to complete the one in hand. When the first stone was to be suspended by the balance-crane, the bell on the beacon was rung, and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the building. Three hearty cheers were given while it was lowered into its place, and the steward served round a glass of rum, when success was drunk to the further progress of the building.|$|E

6000|$|Master Landry took me {{down and}} settled it all with the master, a French farmer fellow that came a horse-dealing to Paris. I knew what my young Lord was after, {{but none of the}} other varlets did; and I went down and made as decent a place as I could between decks. My Lord and Master Landry were gone down to the court meantime, and we were to lie off till we heard a whistle like a mavis on the bank, then come and take them aboard. Well, we waited and waited, and all the lights were out, and not a sound did we hear till just an hour after midnight. Then a big bell rang out, not like a decent Christianable bell, but a great clash, then another, and a lot of strokes enough to take away one's breath. Then half the windows were lighted up, and we heard shots, and screeches, and {{splashes}}, till, as I said to Jack Smithers, 'twas as if one half the place was murthering the other. The farmer got frightened, and would have been off; but when I saw what he was at, [...] "No," [...] says I, [...] "not an inch do we budge without news of my Lord." [...] So Jack stood by the rope, and let them see that 'twas as much as their life was worth to try <b>to</b> <b>unmoor.</b> Mercy, what a night it was! Shrieks and shouts, and shots and howls, here, there, and everywhere, and splashes into the rive; and by and by we saw the poor murthered creatures come floating by. The farmer, he had some words with one of the boats near, and I heard somewhat of Huguenot and Hereteek, and I knew that was what they called good Protestants. Then up comes the farmer with his sons looking mighty ugly at us, and signing that unless we let them be off 'twould be set ashore for us; and we began to think as how we had best be set ashore, and go down the five of us {{to see if we could}} stand by my young Lord in some strait, or give notice to my Lord Ambassador.' ...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} and enduring commitments to nationhood within Native American Studies have unsurprisingly engendered {{in the field}} {{extensive and}} enduring resistance to transnational theoretical and methodological frameworks. This is largely because scholarly transnationalism fundamentally seeks <b>to</b> <b>unmoor</b> intellectual work from national(ist) affiliations. This, of course, directly contradicts the commitments to nationhood within Native Studies. Yet even while conventional transnational modes of critical inquiry present trajectories and objectives that threaten to undermine the core commitments of Native American Studies, the judicious use of particular aspects of conventional transnationalism {{and the development of}} innovative conceptions of transnationalism can serve the field. While conventional transnationalism seeks to decenter the nation in any form—and therein maintains a strict opposition between nationalism and transnationalism—the mode of indigenous transnationalism that Bauerkemper and Stark propose decenters the settler-state while recentering Native nationhood. Maintaining Native American Studies’ commitments to nationhood, this mode of inquiry intentionally and self-consciously underscores the boundaries that distinguish Native nations as discrete polities. Through an analysis of Anishinaabe law and diplomacy, this mode of inquiry serves {{to lay the groundwork for}} recognizing the transnational flows of intellectual, cultural, economic, social, and political traditions between and across the boundaries of distinct yet often—though not always—allied and mutually amenable Native nations...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated successes of the feminist {{movement}} is its lasting impact on domestic violence criminal laws. Today, society has moved from discourse characterizing domestic abuse as legitimate or merely a private problem to a belief that battering is a heinous crime, more egregious than garden-variety assault. I know all too well how far the pendulum has swung, having practiced as a public defender in the District of Columbia domestic violence system. Day after day, prosecutors proceeded with cases against the wishes of victims, resulting in the mass incarceration of young black men. Could this have been the result feminist law reformers hoped for when they began their movement of resistance against patriarchy that legitimized domestic violence? This Article answers the foregoing question with a resounding no. It demonstrates that domestic violence reform has become far removed from its progressive roots and now supports rather than supplants patriarchal ideology. The Article traces the history of domestic violence reform and explains how it transformed from a grassroots populist movement to a politically powerful lobby deeply allied with law enforcement. One of the reasons for this transformation was the influence of the powerful victims 2 ̆ 7 rights movement. This movement originated as a conservative counter to Warren Court civil liberties and employs essentialist discourse objectifying victims and characterizing defendants as purely autonomous agents <b>to</b> <b>unmoor</b> crime from its social roots. The Article argues that in recent times, victims 2 ̆ 7 rights reformers and the government have appropriated the domestic violence issue, not to change the patriarchal institutions that support battering, but rather to further a pro-criminalization agenda. In addition, feminists, whose original program was to vindicate women 2 ̆ 7 s autonomy, have begun to adopt the essentialist discourse of objectifying battered women by characterizing abused women as helpless, scared, irrational, and sick. The Article suggests that feminists simply stop advocating criminal law reforms as the {{solution to the problem of}} domestic abuse and proposes some pedagogical methodologies for teaching domestic violence without characterizing abused women in an essentialist manner...|$|E
