Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E
5|$|The group {{received}} {{an influx of}} funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrative that he constructed.|$|E
5|$|Development of Silent Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers {{did not know how to}} proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.|$|E

25|$|Qutb, {{dissatisfied}} with the condition of contemporary Islam, identified its benighted state as having two principal causes. The first was that many Muslims were forsaking <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an, thereby disturbing the cosmic balance in the world. This had led to the virulent spread of a secular culture within Muslim societies, which, {{with the assistance of}} Western imperialism and colonialism that distorted the existing order, was a second important cause of the straying of many Muslims from the right path. Qutb asserted that the Islamic world had sunk into a state of Jahiliyyah (ignorance and foolishness).|$|E
25|$|Gerrard {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} wide midfielder on the right, {{although he did not}} excel in this position as he had a tendency to commit careless fouls in his youth. Nevertheless, Liverpool retained <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> youngster, and he was later shifted to a defensive midfield position as he matured, where he excelled as a ball-winner rather than as a playmaker. He continued to evolve tactically, coming into his own in a box-to-box central midfield role, which allowed him to be effective both offensively and defensively. Under Benítez, he was also used in a supporting and creative role, as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers, or even as a deep-lying playmaker.|$|E

Around this time, Sullivan was approached by British agents who tried to persuade him to switch sides. This was part of a concerted effort of approaches to other Generals such as Moses Hazen, Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold who it was believed were unhappy with their treatment by Congress and had lost <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> goal of American independence.

25|$|Hales {{retained}} {{his place}} in the test team for the Sri Lanka series, but after much debate by the selectors.

He was out for just eleven in the second innings as England secured a nine wicket victory. In the third and final test at Lord's, Hales scored just 18 runs in the first innings, but made a brilliant 94 in the second innings, and was dismissed lbw by Angelo Mathews just six runs short of a place on the honours board.

25|$|From {{the start}} of the war the Dutch {{priority}} had been to secure their Barrier fortress system as stipulated – though unspecified – in the Grand Alliance treaty; they also had concerns on their eastern German border (from Cleves in the south to East Frisia in the north) where their once political and economical dominance had come under threat from the Prussians. In consequence, Spain had become largely irrelevant to the States General, and they had increasingly looked favourably on a deal with France based on partition of the Spanish inheritance between Archduke Charles and the Duke of Anjou. As early as 1705 Louis XIV had approached the Allies with peace feelers, attempting to split the Dutch from the Alliance and achieve a partition of Spain. The defeat at Ramillies in 1706, and the defeat at Oudenarde and loss of Lille in 1708, had further encouraged Louis XIV to abandon the principle of Spanish integrity. Yet for dynastic and strategic reasons Joseph I and his ministers in Vienna were unwilling to grant Philip V compensation in Italy, while Charles III in Barcelona, after years of struggle, sincerely believed in his rightful claims to the whole of Spain and its dependencies. The British supported the Habsburgs in opposing partition, in part to protect their Mediterranean trade: they were already pressing for the cessation of Menorca and the strategically important Port Mahón for themselves, and they were determined to prevent the Duke of Anjou acquiring Sicily and Naples, thereby limiting French maritime influence in the region. In desperation, therefore, Louis XIV sent the president of the Parlement of Paris, Pierre Rouillé, to meet with Dutch ministers in March 1709 at Moerdijk, confident that they at least were willing to accept some token partition. However, British and Austrian intransigence, and a whole raft of conditions from their allies, scuppered any chance of a compromise. The Dutch, unwilling to treat without British support, were compelled once again to put <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strength of the Grand Alliance.|$|E

Due to Trumka's efforts, the miners were able to keep their spirit and morale up during the strike. He knew that giving into the demands of Pittston would only lead to other mine companies revoking health care benefits. On August 20, 1989 Trumka was questioned by B. Drummond Ayers Jr., a local reporter from the New York Times, about how long he expected the strike to continue. Trumka responded to the question by saying, [...] "People keep asking how long we can hold out. The answer: one day longer than Pittston." [...] The strike continued until February 1990, when a settlement was agreed upon by both parties. The settlement was reached after taking the demands to court several times and after many ratifications were made. The miners of the Pittston Coal Company were able to once again receive health and retirement benefits.|$|E
500|$|The {{imagery in}} Viking metal draws upon the {{material}} culture created during the Viking Age, but — according to Trafford and Pluskowski — it also [...] "encompasses the broad semiotic system favored by many black and death metal bands, {{not least of}} all the exultation of violence and hyper-masculinity expressed through weapons and battlefields". In Viking metal this semiotic system is melded {{with an interest in}} ancestral roots, specifically a pre-Christian heritage, [...] "expressed visually through Viking mythology and the aesthetics of northern landscapes". Extreme and obsessive loathing of Christianity had long been the norm for black and death metal bands, but in the 1990s Bathory and many other bands began turning away from Satanism as the primary opposition to Christianity, instead placing <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vikings and Odin.

500|$|Tender Mercies was {{released}} on March 4, 1983, in only three theaters: one in New York City, one in Los Angeles, and one in Chicago. New York Times critic Vincent Canby observed that it {{was released}} during [...] "the {{time of year when}} distributors usually get rid of all of those movies they don't think are worth releasing in the prime moviegoing times of Christmas and the midsummer months". The simultaneous release of Angelo My Love led to some more publicity for Duvall himself, but was of no help to Tender Mercies. Duvall also believed that Universal's lack of familiarity and comfort with southern culture and the country music genre further reduced <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. When country star Willie Nelson offered to help publicize it, a studio executive told Duvall she did not understand how the singer could contribute to the promotion, which Duvall said was indicative of the studio's failure to understand both the film and the country music genre.|$|E
500|$|The governments led by General Jaruzelski, {{throughout}} their existence (1981–1989), engaged in market economy reforms, {{aimed at improving}} economic performance by eliminating central planning, reducing central bureaucracy, introducing self-management and self-financing of state enterprises and allowing self-government by employee councils. The reform's effects were positive but limited (the process vastly increased general economic literacy {{and some of its}} accomplishments were later claimed by Solidarity governments as their own), because enterprises' self-rule had to compete with the traditional party interference, the authorities shied from subjecting the population to hardships, and Western governments and institutions showed no interest in supporting what was perceived as reform of a communist regime. The government allowed more small-scale private enterprises to function, departing further from the 'socialist' model of economy. Ideological considerations were abandoned and priority was given to pragmatic issues and moves. Searching for ways to improve the economy and conscious of its alienation from the industrial working class, the regime turned toward market reforms with an increasingly significant elite-oriented liberal (from the mid-1980s) component. Marketization, formalized by a 1988 statute on economic activity, was a process that would continue past the mid-1990s. Neoliberal processes may have been initiated by Deputy Prime Minister [...] and the government of Zbigniew Messner, then developed further under Minister Mieczysław Wilczek (author of the statute) and Mieczysław Rakowski's government. [...] "Market socialism" [...] was introduced, as the regime leaders actually lost <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> socialist system and even the nomenklatura managers were threatened by the declining economy. The enterprises were to be made independent, self-financing and self-managed, which included workers' councils that were resistant to restructuring. Owners of private businesses did well in the final years of the People's Republic and the number of such entities increased. Foreign investment was also encouraged, but limited marketization failed to deliver an economic turnaround. The practice of centralized economic decision making had not been overcome, while the newly autonomous enterprises moved toward a rather spontaneous, chaotic partial privatization of dubious legality that included elements of kleptocracy and had a significant middle-level nomenklatura component. On a more basic level, countless ordinary Poles took advantage of the changing attitudes and became involved in a great variety of income-producing activities.|$|E
