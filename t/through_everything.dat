500|$|Mercedes began a {{relationship}} with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace). He proposed marriage to her, but she refused. Mercedes has sex with a stranger; Metcalfe remarked, [...] "Sex usually makes her forget about everything else that's going on. But afterwards she still can't stop thinking about Malachy, so she decides {{to go and see}} him to work out how she feels". Mercedes subsequently accepted Malachy's proposal and they marry. Mercedes found that she did not contract HIV from Malachy, but a Hollyoaks source described the news as [...] "bitter sweet" [...] because it was possible that her husband could die and leave her on her own. The source expanded on this, saying that if Mercedes had contracted HIV then the pair [...] "would be going <b>through</b> <b>everything</b> together".|$|E

Connecting the lyrics with her own childhood, Fantasia said, [...] "I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, I think that the passion, that not feeling pretty and being insecure is where my soul came from.

500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that you have to go <b>through</b> <b>everything.</b> You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all <b>through</b> <b>everything</b> we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} mainly well {{received}} upon release.

On 'Belladonna', Smith's liquid guitar relaxes Sioux {{to the extent that}} she drops a few masks to reveal her vulnerability. When the siren sings 'daylight devours your unguarded hours', she's illuminating her own predicament so acutely it surely can't be coincidence. 'Dazzle', too, is naively daring: Siouxsie's voice, framed alone against the firmament of strings. It could be Lloyd Webber's Cats or something by Vaughn Williams. You can get impressed, wrapped up and lost in this'".|$|E

It is an anthem, {{but not in}} the sense you usually reference in regard to his work. This anthem is an invitation to share everything, to accept everything, to move <b>through</b> <b>everything</b> individually and together." [...] Rolling Stone worried that, [...] "As with 'Born in the U.S.A.', the title ... may mislead some who hear it, particularly those intent on retaliation, which Springsteen himself shows little interest in contemplating. His concern is not with a national uprising but with a rising above: the transcending of ever-mounting losses and ancient hatreds." [...] The New York Times described [...] "The Rising" [...] as a work in which [...] "one man's afterlife is an endless longing for the physical touch of those left behind, and the music climbs toward jubilation as an act of will." ...|$|E

She felt that it is almost like the characters should not be friends, but acknowledged that opposites attracted in this instance. Lynsey is attracted to Mercedes as she sees qualities in Mercedes that she wishes she had herself, such as Mercedes being straight-talking, ballsy and someone who [...] "calls a spade a spade, and sometimes Lynsey wishes she had a bit of that gusto". When Mercedes begins working at the hospital as a cleaner and becomes involved with Doctor Browning (Joe Thompson), Metcalfe explained that the pair gp <b>through</b> <b>everything</b> which is a [...] "real ride of emotions".|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence held {{seemingly}} contradictory {{views on}} feminism. The {{evidence of his}} written works, particularly his earlier novels, indicates an overwhelming commitment to representing women as strong, independent and complex; as noted above he produced major works in which young, self-directing female characters were central. In his youth he supported extending the vote to women, and once wrote, “All women in their natures are like giantesses. They will break <b>through</b> <b>everything</b> and go on with their own lives.” [...] However, a number of feminist critics, notably Kate Millett, have criticised, indeed ridiculed Lawrence’s sexual politics, Millett claiming that he uses his female characters as mouthpieces to promote his creed of male supremacy, and that his story The Woman Who Rode Away showed Lawrence as a pornographic sadist with its portrayal of “human sacrifice performed upon the woman to the greater glory and potency of the male.” Brenda Maddox further highlights this story and two others written around the same time, St. Mawr and The Princess, as “masterworks of misogyny”.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2006, Norwood was {{involved}} in a fatal automobile accident on Los Angeles' San Diego (405) Freeway. The accident claimed the life of the 38-year-old driver of a Toyota that was struck by Norwood's Range Rover. Norwood was neither arrested nor charged with vehicular manslaughter due to insufficient evidence. Nevertheless, multiple lawsuits were filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her civil attorney. Posing an extraordinary hardship for Brandy and her family, Norwood stepped down from her role as a judge on the second season of the amateur talent contest America's Got Talent and went into hiatus. Expanding on dealing with the aftermath of the tragedy, Norwood explained, [...] "I just wanted people to know that this wasn't news. It's not something that should be talked about like it's gossip. You don't like me? Fine. But don't use this situation to try to hurt me, because the guilt of being involved is enough. It's something that I'll never truly, truly get over." [...] While the accident put a halt on the album's production, Norwood soon resumed recording which she found to be therapeutic: [...] "I had to face it and find the strength to move forward.

2500|$|According to Michael Kaminsky in The Secret History of Star Wars, {{the first}} Star Wars film {{was based on}} the 1958 Japanese film The Hidden Fortress, the plot and {{characters}} of which Lucas borrowed so extensively that at one point he considered buying the U.S rights to the film to prevent a copyright violation lawsuit. As a film student, Lucas's favorite filmmaker was Akira Kurosawa, who made a series of films featuring samurai heroes and villains in the 1950s and 1960s, which Lucas has acknowledged as a major artistic influence. Critic Jason Serafino notes that the basic plot of Star Wars is based upon The Hidden Fortress, and that Kurosawa films in general are [...] "...easily the most important cinematic influence on the Star Wars movies". The Hidden Fortress is a jidaigeki (historical adventure) film dealing with a brave samurai who saves a princess in 16th century Japan. In China, there is the concept of the qi (known as the ki in Japan), a mystical life force running <b>through</b> <b>everything.</b> Those who master the qi/ki are capable of superhuman feats, and it is a common plot device in jidaigeki films for those samurai who master the ki to achieve astonishing feats of swordsmanship. The concept of the Jedi knights, whose power is derived from mastering the Force, is based on the samurai and the relationship that jidaigeki films show them as having with the ki. The name Jedi is a tribute to these films. Kaminsky further noted that in 1970s San Francisco, where Lucas was living when he wrote the various drafts for the script that became Star Wars, New Age ideas, which incorporated the concept of the qi and other notions of a mystical life-force were [...] "in the air", being widely embraced in that city. Critic Tim Robley wrote that some of the ideas and characters in Star Wars came from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, with the Force serving the same role as the ruby slippers, the magical entity that sends the protagonist on a quest.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought <b>through</b> <b>everything</b> beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
