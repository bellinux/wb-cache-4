The World Heritage Site covers the area of rock engravings.|$|E
50|$|The private dirt rood {{leading from}} <b>the</b> highway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> has been chained off {{as of the}} summer of 2016. Rumors have it that a man died in <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> due <b>to</b> a heart attack, and the {{property}} owners became concerned about lawsuits arising from trespassers. Previously, the owners permitted free and open access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> without issue. A rise in partiers and garbage left behind likely has also contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> closure. Bathers should seek permission {{from the land owners}} before attempting <b>to</b> visit <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the women would be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> and returned without incident.|$|E
5|$|In the league, Augustinsson played {{every minute}} of the first 30 games, until he was rested for the final two away games when the trophy was already secured {{in the middle of}} May. He {{assisted}} to nine goals throughout the campaign, placing him as tied leader with Nicolaj Thomsen and Rasmus Falk. Ekstra Bladet ranked him as one of the five best players for Copenhagen, awarding 5 of 6 stars for his performance, citing an improvement compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> part of the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1863, Levski {{returned}} to Bulgarian lands after a brief stay in Romania. His uncle Basil reported him as a rebel to the Ottoman authorities, and Levski was imprisoned in Plovdiv for three months, but released due to {{the help of the}} doctor R. Petrov and the Russian vice-consul Nayden Gerov. On Easter 1864, Levski officially relinquished his religious office. From May 1864 until March 1866, he worked as a teacher in Voynyagovo near Karlovo; while there, he supported and gave shelter to persecuted Bulgarians and organised patriotic groups among the population. His activity caused suspicion among the Ottoman authorities, and he was forced to move. From {{the spring of}} 1866 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1867 he taught in Enikyoy and Kongas, two Northern Dobruja villages near Tulcea.|$|E

5|$|RAF Fighter Command {{claims against}} the British main opponents in 1941 and 1942—Jagdgeschwader 26 (Fighter Wing 26) and Jagdgeschwader 2 (Fighter Wing 2) —are very {{difficult}} to verify. Only two of the 30 volumes of War Diaries produced by JG 26 survived the war. Historian Donald Caldwell has attempted to use what limited German material is available to compare losses and air victory claims but acknowledges the lack of sources leave the possibility for error. From June 1941 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring,</b> 1942, Fighter Command claimed 711 enemy aircraft while losing 411. According to available German records, the loss to JG 2 and JG 26 were reportedly 103.|$|E
5|$|The Strachwitz Battle Group annihilated the Soviet 8th Army shock troop wedge at {{the western}} end of the Krivasoo Bridgehead on 26 March. The German battle group {{destroyed}} the eastern tip of the bridgehead on 6 April. Generalmajor Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz von Groß-Zauche und Camminetz, inspired by the success, tried to eliminate the whole bridgehead but was unable to proceed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> thaw that had rendered the swamp impassable for the Tiger I tanks. By the end of April, the parties had mutually exhausted their strengths. Relative calm settled on the front until late July 1944.|$|E
5|$|During its peak, up to 300 people {{visited the}} hot spring daily. On 1 March 2002, {{it was closed}} for two months while {{upgrading}} and improvement works were carried out to {{the area around the}} spring, which had become sodden and muddy. Litter had also become a problem because of the increased numbers of visitors. The former dirt track leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> was paved with cement, and lined with bougainvillea bushes and high fences to ensure the security of the air base. Drainage pipes were also installed. Mindef, which owns the land, allows public access between 7 am and 7 pm daily, free-of-charge. When the spring reopened on 1 May 2002, more than 100 people visited the site despite the afternoon drizzle. At the same time, some new free-hold condominiums were built in the surrounding area; one of the developments, built by the property arm of F in 2001, is called Seletaris after the company's former mineral water.|$|E

5|$|In the Montenotte Campaign, the French won {{victories}} at Montenotte, Millesimo and Dego between 11 and 15 April. In the Battle of Ceva Colli's Sardinians repelled Augereau's attack {{but they}} {{retreated to the}} west when Sérurier's division appeared. Colli detailed Jean-Gaspard Dichat de Toisinge with 8,000 Sardinians and 15 guns to defend San Michele Mondovi against a French attack. On 19 April, Sérurier formed his division into two 3,000-man brigades under Pascal Antoine Fiorella and Jean Joseph Guieu plus a reserve under his personal command. The Corsaglia River was unfordable due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> thaw and the French attack soon stalled. However, some of Guieu's skirmishers found an unguarded footbridge and made a lodgement on the west bank. The French captured San Michele but the unpaid, hungry soldiers went on a looting spree. Led by a company of Swiss troops, Colli organized a counterattack which drove Sérurier's division out of the town, though Guieu's brigade maintained its bridgehead. The repulse cost the French about 600 casualties while the Sardinians lost 300.|$|E
5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. The {{primary purpose of the}} division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spring</b> Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E
25|$|The {{road to the}} Black Spring is near city Dehloran {{and leads}} to the Abgarm natural {{protected}} area. A sign guides visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> via a narrow road. The last few hundred meters of the road is not suitable for vehicles and requires a short walk to reach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring.</b> Visitors will notice the smell of tar as they approach. The spring’s diameter is about 9 meters and hot water full of liquid tar particles flows out of it. There is a fence to protect animals from going nearby and get trapped in the tar.|$|E
