5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{made her}} {{televised}} in-ring debut on the 26 June 2014 episode of NXT, defeating Summer Rae.

5|$|The {{designers}} {{thought that}} Link's appearance should change when Link entered {{a wall and}} the perspective switched from a top-down view to side view. They chose to make Link a mural {{while he was on}} a wall; this {{led to the creation of}} Yuga, the game's antagonist, a sorcerer that can transform himself and others into paintings. Aonuma mentioned that the idea of Link <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mural was inspired by Phantom Ganon jumping into paintings during his encounter in Ocarina of Time. As the game's story takes place long after the events of a A Link to the Past and the player travels between the two worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, the development team chose A Link Between Worlds instead of A Link to the Past 2 for the game's English-language title.|$|E

5|$|The game's story (narrated by Peter Jason) {{follows the}} {{exploits}} of a wanted outlaw named Jericho Cross and his employment in an ancient vampire-hunting order known as the Darkwatch (hence the game's title).

It continues north through a mix of farms and wooded areas with some residential areas, crossing into Clinton Township.|$|E

5|$|Back at home, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who trick their {{grandfather}} into letting them throw their own party. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to go fishing, but Marge wakes up first. Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to understand as he visualizes Marge <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> catfish. Homer takes a walk instead {{of returning to}} bed. On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated.

5|$|Byron's {{attack on}} Skippon's musketeers in the centre also went poorly. Pushing three regiments of foot forward, the force {{suffered}} similarly high casualties {{in an attempt}} to take Round Hill; after the attack stalled, the cavalry had to be called in to force it forward. Despite heavy losses due to the only avenue of advance being a narrow lane lined with Parliamentarian musketeers, this move succeeded in allowing Byron to take Round Hill, forcing the Parliamentarian infantry back to a hedge on the far side. The attack eventually lost momentum, and although Round Hill was taken, Byron was unable to advance any further. On the right flank, William Vavasour attempted to overwhelm the Parliamentary flank with a substantial brigade of foot, which included a small amount of cavalry support. His initial attack was repulsed thanks to the Parliamentarian artillery opening fire, but a subsequent head-on attack forced Skippon's beleaguered force in the centre to send several regiments over to assist, with the fight <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bloody melee. Vavasour's force was eventually forced to retire, with the Parliamentarians failing to give ground.|$|E

5|$|Despite the truce, the chronicler Ibn Wadih {{mentions}} Arab raids into Asia Minor for {{the years}} 783, 784 and 785. If true, then these would probably represent only minor affairs, as the main sources agree that the truce was mutually respected until spring 785. In that year, as Irene had strengthened her hold over the army and was preparing to confront the iconoclasts on the domestic front, she decided to cease payment of the tribute, and hostilities recommenced. In early 786, the Byzantines scored a major success, sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids {{had spent the last}} five years <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions. After the accession of Harun al-Rashid to the caliphal throne in the same year, however, the Abbasids regained the initiative. Arab pressure mounted, and in 798 Irene was forced to ask for a peace treaty that repeated the stipulations of the 782 truce.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} failure of the last Arab attempt to conquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople, regular, almost annual raids were {{undertaken}} by the Caliphate's forces into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 782, a major invasion, led by the Abbasid heir apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), resulted in a humiliating settlement for Byzantium, which was forced to sue for a truce in exchange for an annual payment of 160,000 gold nomismata. In 785, Empress-regent Irene of Athens resolved to cease the payment of the tribute, and warfare recommenced. The Arabs raided the Armeniac Theme, but in early 786 the Byzantines retaliated by sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids had spent the last five years <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions against Byzantium.|$|E

The following week Hardy saved his brother when CM Punk and The Hart Dynasty attacked both Jeff and John Morrison, <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fan favorite again. On the August 21 episode of SmackDown, after apologizing for his past actions towards Jeff and admitting {{that he was not}} behind any of Jeff's accidents, he had his first match back after his injury when he teamed with Jeff and John Morrison to defeat The Hart Dynasty and CM Punk, when Matt pinned Punk.|$|E
