5000|$|<b>Tegaserod</b> (Zelnorm), a {{selective}} 5-HT4 agonist for IBS-C, {{is available for}} relieving IBS constipation in women and chronic idiopathic constipation in men and women. On March 30, 2007, the FDA requested Novartis Pharmaceuticals to voluntarily discontinue marketing of <b>tegaserod</b> based on the recently identified finding of {{an increased risk of}} serious cardiovascular adverse events (heart problems) associated with use of the drug. Novartis agreed to voluntarily suspend marketing of the drug in the United States and in many other countries. On July 27, 2007, the FDA approved a limited-treatment IND program for <b>tegaserod</b> in the US to allow restricted access to the medication for patients in need if no comparable alternative drug or therapy is available to treat the disease. The FDA had issued two previous warnings about the serious consequences of <b>tegaserod.</b> In 2005, it was rejected as an IBS medication by the European Union. <b>Tegaserod,</b> marketed as Zelnorm in the United States, was the only agent approved to treat the multiple symptoms of IBS (in women only), including constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating.|$|E
50|$|A 2007 {{comparison}} {{showed that}} patients suffering from constipation {{had a better}} response to macrogol than to <b>tegaserod.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 30 March 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{requested}} that Novartis withdraw Zelnorm from shelves. The FDA alleges {{a relationship between}} prescriptions of the drug and increased risks of heart attack or stroke. An analysis of data collected on over 18,000 patients demonstrated adverse cardiovascular events in 13 of 11,614 patients treated with Zelnorm (a rate of 0.11%) as compared with 1 of 7,031 patients treated with placebo (a rate of 0.01%). Novartis alleges all of the affected patients had preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors for such, and further alleges that no causal relationship between <b>tegaserod</b> use and cardiovascular events has been demonstrated.On {{the same day as}} the FDA announcement, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada announced that it was suspending marketing and sales of the drug in Canada in response to a request from Health Canada. In a large cohort study based on a US health insurance database, no increase in the risk of cardiovascular events were found under <b>tegaserod</b> treatment. Currently, <b>tegaserod</b> may only be used in emergency situations only with prior authorization from the FDA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tegaserod</b> (brand name Zelnorm) {{was removed}} from the general U.S. and Canadian markets in 2007, due to reports of {{increased}} risks of heart attack or stroke.

50|$|Interestingly {{some other}} {{selective}} 5-HT4 agonists such as mosapride and <b>tegaserod</b> (the only5-HT4 agonists currently licensed {{for use in}} humans) have been found not to reduce respiratory depression. On the other hand, another 5-HT4 agonist, zacopride, does inhibit respiratory depression {{in a similar manner}} to BIMU-8.|$|E
50|$|The drug {{functions}} as a motility stimulant, achieving its desired therapeutic effects through activation of the 5-HT4 receptors of the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract. It also stimulates gastrointestinal motility and the peristaltic reflex, and allegedly reduces abdominal pain. Additionally, <b>tegaserod</b> is a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Cisapride and <b>Tegaserod</b> are 5-HT4 partial {{receptor}} agonist {{that were used}} to treat disorders of gastrointestinal motility.Prucalopride is a highly selective 5-HT4 {{receptor agonist}} {{that can be used to}} treat certain disorders of gastrointestinal motility. Other 5-HT4 agonists have shown potential to be nootropic type drugs via promoting acetylcholine release.|$|E
50|$|For adults, a {{randomized}} controlled trial found PEG (MiraLax or GlycoLax) 17 grams once per {{day to be}} superior to <b>tegaserod</b> at 6 mg twice per day. A randomized controlled trial found greater improvement from two sachets (26 grams) of PEG versus two sachets (20 grams) of lactulose. 17 grams per day of PEG has been effective and safe in {{a randomized}} controlled trial for six months. Another randomized controlled trial found no difference between sorbitol and lactulose.|$|E
5000|$|Velusetrag (INN, USAN; {{previously}} {{known as}} TD-5108) is an experimental drug {{candidate for the}} treatment of gastric neuromuscular disorders including gastroparesis, and lower gastrointestinal motility disorders including chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. [...] It is a potent, selective, high efficacy 5-HT4 receptor serotonin agonist [...] being developed by Theravance Biopharma and Alfa Wassermann. Velusetrag demonstrates less selectivity for other serotonin receptors, such as 5-HT2 and 5-HT3, to earlier generation 5-HT agonists like cisapride and <b>tegaserod.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{suggests}} {{that either the}} anti-respiratory depression action is mediated via a specific subtype of the 5-HT4 receptor which is activated by BIMU-8 and zacopride, but not by mosapride or <b>tegaserod,</b> or alternatively there may be functional selectivity involved whereby BIMU-8 and zacopride produce a different physiological response following 5-HT4 binding compared to other 5-HT4 agonists. Another alternative to {{this is that the}} 5-HT4 agonist currently available for use in humans do not have great enough potency or bioavailability in the brain to elicit the same effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tegaserod</b> is a 5-HT4 agonist {{manufactured}} by Novartis and sold under the names Zelnorm and Zelmac {{for the management}} of irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. Approved by the FDA in 2002, it was subsequently removed from the market in 2007 due to FDA concerns about possible adverse cardiovascular effects. Before then, it was the only drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to help relieve the abdominal discomfort, bloating, and constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Its use was also approved to treat chronic idiopathic constipation.|$|E
50|$|The {{observed}} {{effects are}} exerted via highly selective action on 5-HT4 receptors: prucalopride has >150-fold higher affinity for 5-HT4 receptors than for other receptors. Prucalopride differs from other 5-HT4 agonists such as <b>tegaserod</b> and cisapride, which at therapeutic concentrations also {{interact with other}} receptors (5-HT1B/D and the cardiac human ether-a-go-go K+ or hERG channel respectively) and this {{may account for the}} adverse cardiovascular events that have resulted in the restricted availability of these drugs. Clinical trials evaluating the effect of prucalopride on QT interval and related adverse events have not demonstrated significant differences compared with placebo.|$|E
5000|$|Antacids and {{sucralfate}} {{were found}} to be no better than placebo in a literature review. [...] H2-RAs have been shown to have marked benefit in poor quality trials (30% relative risk reduction), but only a marginal benefit in good quality trials. Prokinetic agents would empirically seem to work well since delayed gastric emptying is considered a major pathophysiological mechanism in functional dyspepsia. [...] They have been shown in a meta-analysis to produce a relative risk reduction of up to 50%, but the studies evaluated to come to this conclusion used the drug cisapride which has since been removed from the market (now only available as an investigational agent) due to serious adverse events such as torsades, and publication bias has been cited as a potential partial explanation for such a high benefit. [...] Modern prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, erythromycin and <b>tegaserod</b> have little or no established efficacy and often result in substantial side effects. [...] Simethicone {{has been found to be}} of some value, as one trial suggests potential benefit over placebo and another shows equivalence with cisapride. [...] So, with the somewhat recent advent of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) class of medications, the question of whether these new agents are superior to traditional therapy has arisen.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Tegaserod,</b> a 5 -hydroxytryptamine- 4 {{receptor}} agonist, enhances gastric emptying, but {{its effects}} on proximal stomach function have not been studied. AIM: To study the effect of <b>tegaserod</b> on gastric compliance, accommodation and perception of distension in humans. METHODS: Nineteen healthy volunteers (10 females; mean age, 23. 9 years) were studied on three separate occasions after 7 days of treatment with placebo, <b>tegaserod</b> 2 mg b. d. or <b>tegaserod</b> 6 mg b. d. in a double-blind, randomized, three-way cross-over design. After {{the introduction of a}} barostat bag, stepwise distensions were performed to determine gastric compliance and sensitivity, and a mixed liquid meal was administered in isobaric mode to assess accommodation. RESULTS: <b>Tegaserod</b> had no effect on the pressures or volumes inducing first perception or discomfort. <b>Tegaserod</b> 6 mg b. d. enhanced fasting gastric compliance compared with placebo. Pre-prandial and post-prandial intra-balloon volumes were significantly higher after 6 mg b. d. than after placebo. Both <b>tegaserod</b> 2 and 6 mg b. d. shortened the time to maximum post-prandial intra-balloon volume. The amplitude of meal-induced gastric relaxation (post-prandial minus pre-prandial volumes) did not differ between the treatment arms. CONCLUSION: In humans, <b>tegaserod</b> allows for larger intra-balloon volumes both before and after a meal. These findings warrant the investigation of the therapeutic potential of <b>tegaserod</b> in dyspeptic patients with impaired accommodation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} with constipation (IBS-C) as {{the predominant}} bowel symptom is a prevalent disorder, characterized by recurring abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and constipation, and imposes a significant socio-economic burden. Traditional treatments generally address {{just one of}} the multiple IBS symptoms. The efficacy and safety profile of <b>tegaserod,</b> a serotonin 5 -HT 4 receptor agonist, has been demonstrated in several randomized, placebo-controlled, and open-label trials. This review discusses the major clinical trials of <b>tegaserod,</b> which have involved 8948 IBS patients. Overall, data reveal that <b>tegaserod</b> is an effective treatment for IBS-C, providing statistically significant relief of overall and multiple individual IBS-C symptoms (abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and constipation) in both placebo-controlled and “real-life” open-label settings. Repeat treatments with <b>tegaserod</b> were also shown to be effective, which is noteworthy given the chronic and episodic nature of IBS. Moreover, <b>tegaserod</b> was associated with improvements in patients’ quality of life and work productivity. Data also indicate that <b>tegaserod</b> is well tolerated over the short-term (4 weeks), long-term (12 months), and repeated treatments.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Tegaserod</b> is {{effective}} in treating IBS patients with constipation, and does not alter gallbladder motility in healthy individuals or in patients with IBS. However, {{it is not known}} if <b>tegaserod</b> affects the biliary tract in gallstone disease, so to this end the effects of <b>tegaserod</b> on bile composition and hepatic secretion of Richardson ground squirrels maintained on an enriched cholesterol diet were examined. Results Animals were fed either a control (0. 03 %) or enriched (1 %) cholesterol diet for 28 days, and treated s. c. with <b>tegaserod</b> (0. 1 mg/kg BID) or vehicle. Bile flow, bile acid, phospholipids and cholesterol secretion were measured with standard methods. <b>Tegaserod</b> treatment or enriched cholesterol diet, alone or combination, did not alter body or liver weights. The enriched cholesterol diet increased cholesterol saturation index (CSI), cholesterol concentrations in gallbladder and hepatic duct bile by ~ 50 % and decreased bile acids in gallbladder bile by 17 %. <b>Tegaserod</b> treatment reversed these cholesterol-induced changes. None of the treatments, drug or diet, altered fasting gallbladder volume, bile flow and bile salts or phospholipid secretion in normal diet and cholesterol-fed animals. However, <b>tegaserod</b> treatment prevented the decreases in bile acid pool size and cycling frequency caused by the enriched cholesterol diet, consequent to re-establishing normal bile acid to concentrations in the gall bladder. <b>Tegaserod</b> had no effect on these parameters with normal diet animals. Conclusion <b>Tegaserod</b> treatment results in increased enterohepatic cycling and lowers cholesterol saturation in the bile of cholesterol-fed animals. These effects would decrease conditions favorable to cholesterol gallstone formation. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Studies {{show that}} <b>tegaserod</b> {{effectively}} relieves {{the symptoms of}} chronic constipation/idiopathic constipation (CC). This pooled analysis assessed the safety and tolerability of <b>tegaserod</b> in a large dataset of CC patients. METHODS: Adverse event (AE) data were pooled from 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials of 12 weeks' duration. Post hoc analysis was conducted for the most frequent AEs (incidence, >or= 3 %). RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-one, 861, and 861 patients received <b>tegaserod</b> 6 mg twice a day, 2 mg twice a day, or placebo, respectively. Most AEs were mild/moderately severe. AE incidence was similar for the <b>tegaserod</b> 6 mg and 2 mg twice a day (57. 1 % and 56. 3 %, respectively) and placebo groups (59. 6 %) and most frequent in the gastrointestinal system (<b>tegaserod</b> 6 mg twice a day, 25. 8 %; 2 mg twice a day, 22. 5 %; placebo, 24. 6 %). Headache, the most common AE, was slightly more frequent {{in the placebo group}} (<b>tegaserod</b> 6 mg twice a day, 11. 0 %; 2 mg twice a day, 10. 1 %; placebo, 13. 2 %). Diarrhea (generally transient and resolved with continued treatment) was the only AE with a statistically significant difference between groups (<b>tegaserod</b> 6 mg twice a day 6. 6 % vs placebo 3. 0 %, P=. 0005). Serious AE incidence (1. 4 % overall) was comparable across treatment groups, although abdominal surgery was less common in the combined <b>tegaserod</b> (0. 5 %) than the placebo group (1. 0 %). Discontinuation as a result of AEs was slightly higher in <b>tegaserod</b> 6 mg twice a day patients (5. 7 %; 2 mg twice a day, 3. 3 %; placebo, 3. 7 %), mainly because of diarrhea.

The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the authors' experience with <b>tegaserod</b> in children. Patients and Methods : Patients treated with <b>tegaserod</b> from 2004 through 2006 were included in this study. Defecation and fecal incontinence frequency and global assessment of relief of symptoms were assessed. Results: Seventy-two patients (44 girls) ranging in age from 1. 1 to 18. 3 years constitute the patient sample of this report. The median age was 10 years and the median follow-up after initiation of <b>tegaserod</b> treatment was 11. 3 months (range 2. 3 - 45. 2 months). Indications to prescribe <b>tegaserod</b> were constipation (58 %) and a variety of other conditions including functional dyspepsia or inflammatory bowel disease (42 %). Defecation frequency increased after <b>tegaserod</b> use (1 vs 7 /week, P < 0. 001) and presence of fecal incontinence decreased (47 % vs 23 %, P < 0. 001) in the constipation group. Parents rated relief of constipation as moderate or significant in 71 % of cases in the constipation group. In the group with other indications to start <b>tegaserod</b> therapy, moderate or significant relief of abdominal pain and bloating was noted in 64 % and 68 % of patients, respectively.

After <b>tegaserod,</b> symptom intensity scores for fullness (AUC 1147  141 vs. 1568  141 mm*min, p< 0. 05), bloating (AUC 825  165 vs. 1352  227 mm*min, p< 0. 05), epigastric pain (AUC 66  42 vs. 133  67 mm*min, p= 0. 05), and epigastric discomfort (AUC 701  50 vs. 1158  203 mm*min, p= 0. 05), were decreased (all ANOVA significant, p< 0. 05), while scores for satiety, belching, heartburn, epigastric burning and nausea were not altered. Conclusion: The 5 -HT 4 receptor agonist <b>tegaserod</b> does not affect meal-induced satiety and nutrient volume tolerance, but <b>tegaserod</b> decreases the intensity of several meal-induced symptoms. These data support a potential benefit of <b>tegaserod</b> in the treatment of meal-induced FD symptoms. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Our group {{previously}} {{demonstrated a}} deficiency of migrating motor complexes in {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS) patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Based on disturbed fasting motility, we tested whether low-dose nocturnal erythromycin or <b>tegaserod</b> can prevent the recurrence of IBS symptoms after successful antibiotic treatment. Methods: 203 patient charts were reviewed to find IBS patients with SIBO, and treatment cycles were assessed to identify subjects with clinical and breath test resolution. The charts of those who met the inclusion criteria were reviewed to determine the method of prevention of symptom recurrence {{and the length of}} remission. The two preventive agents used were erythromycin (50 mg) or <b>tegaserod</b> (2 – 6 mg) orally at bedtime. Results: 64 patients met the inclusion criteria. Subjects receiving no prevention (n= 6) after successful antibiotic treatment experienced symptom recurrence after 59. 7 ± 47. 4 days. Prevention using erythromycin (n= 42) demonstrated 138. 5 ± 132. 2 symptom-free days (P=. 08 vs no prevention) compared to 241. 6 ± 162. 2 days with <b>tegaserod</b> (n= 16; P=. 003 vs no prevention; P=. 004 vs erythromycin). Switching from erythromycin to <b>tegaserod</b> (n= 20) extended resolution from 105. 8 ± 73. 3 days to 199. 7 ± 162. 9 days (P=. 04). Changing from no therapy to erythromycin or <b>tegaserod</b> (n= 6) extended recurrence from 41. 0 ± 44. 8 days to 195. 6 ± 153. 5 days (P=. 06).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the safety/tolerability {{and efficacy of}} <b>tegaserod,</b> a 5 -HT 4 receptor partial agonist, {{in the treatment of}} patients with non-diarrhoea irritable bowel syndrome (non-D-IBS) in Switzerland. METHODS: This was an 8 -week, open-label, prospective, multicentre study. Patients (> or = 18 years old) met the Rome II diagnostic criteria for IBS, excluding those with diarrhoea for > or = 14 days in the previous 3 months. Details of IBS symptoms experienced in the preceding week were recorded at visit 1 (day 1). Eligible patients received 6 mg <b>tegaserod</b> twice daily for 8 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were recorded, along with detailed assessment of diarrhoeal episodes. Efficacy assessments included the overall number and percentage of responders after 8 weeks' treatment. RESULTS: A total of 850 patients (72 % women; mean age, 51. 4 years) were enrolled, and 843 received at least one dose of <b>tegaserod.</b> AEs were reported in 38 % of patients, of which 13 % were drug-related. Diarrhoea occurred early during treatment (13 % in the first week, 7 % thereafter), was mild to moderate in severity, was transient and was resolved with continued treatment. In total, 208 patients left the study early, primarily due to AEs. Diarrhoea accounted for 68 of these discontinuations. Nine serious AEs were reported but these were not related to <b>tegaserod</b> treatment. Sixty-six percent of patients responded to <b>tegaserod</b> on the Subject's Global Assessment of relief after 8 weeks. Benefits were also seen across individual IBS symptoms. CONCLUSION: <b>Tegaserod</b> (6 mg twice daily) appears to be safe, well-tolerated and effective in the treatment of non-D-IBS over 8 weeks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTegaserod {{relieves}} {{overall and}} multiple individual constipation-predominant {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS-C) symptoms. However, mechanisms for the relief of abdominal pain/discomfort are not well understood. The effects of <b>tegaserod</b> on rectal sensitivity to distension were measured by the nociceptive flexion RIII reflex, as evidenced by spinal hyperexcitability (i. e. increase or facilitation of the RIII reflex), in IBS-C patients. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study was performed in 30 women with IBS-C. The effects of slow ramp rectal distension on the RIII reflex, recorded from the lower limb, were measured before [first experimental day (D 1) ] and after 7 days [day 8 (D 8) ] of placebo (n= 15) or 6 mg <b>tegaserod</b> bid (n= 15). Pressure-volume and sensation-volume relationships were measured during distension, and patients reported their IBS symptoms daily. On D 1, rectal distension facilitated the RIII reflex in both treatment groups. On D 8 vs D 1 these facilitatory effects were significantly lower (P< 0. 001, analysis of variance) after <b>tegaserod</b> (mean reduction: - 30. 3 +/- 11. 9 %) than placebo (mean reduction: - 10. 1 +/- 12. 9 %). No {{significant changes in the}} volume-sensation relationship or differences in compliance were observed with <b>tegaserod</b> or placebo. In conclusion, <b>tegaserod</b> reduces the facilitatory effects of rectal distension on the RIII reflex in women with IBS-C...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} the 5 -hydroxytryptamine 4 (5 -HT 4) receptor subtype and investigate the modulating function of those receptors on contractility in intestinal tissues obtained from horses without gastrointestinal tract disease. SAMPLE POPULATION: Smooth muscle preparations from the duodenum, ileum, and pelvic flexure collected immediately after slaughter of 24 horses with no history or signs of gastrointestinal tract disease. PROCEDURES: In isometric organ baths, the contractile activities of smooth muscle preparations in response to 5 -hydroxytryptamine and electric field stimulation were assessed; the effect of <b>tegaserod</b> alone or in combination with 5 -hydroxytryptamine on contractility of intestinal specimens was also investigated. Presence and distribution of 5 -HT 4 receptors in intestinal tissues and localization on interstitial cells of Cajal were examined by use of an immunofluorescence technique. RESULTS: Widespread 5 -HT 4 receptor immunoreactivity was observed in all intestinal smooth muscle layers; 5 -HT 4 receptors were absent from the myenteric plexus and interstitial cells of Cajal. In electrical field-stimulated tissue preparations of duodenum and pelvic flexure, <b>tegaserod</b> increased the amplitude of smooth muscle contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. Preincubation with <b>tegaserod</b> significantly decreased the basal tone of the 5 -HT-evoked contractility in small intestine specimens, compared with the effect of 5 -HT alone, thereby confirming that <b>tegaserod</b> was acting as a partial agonist. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In horses, 5 -HT 4 receptors on smooth muscle cells appear {{to be involved in the}} contractile response of the intestinal tract to 5 -hydroxytryptamine. Results suggest that <b>tegaserod</b> may be useful for treatment of reduced gastrointestinal tract motility in horses...|$|E

Here we explore {{its effects on}} functional dyspepsia symptoms and heartburn during continued proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment. Methods. In this multicenter pilot study, following a 2 -week screening/baseline period, women with functional dyspepsia and persisting heartburn treated with PPIs received add-on open-label <b>tegaserod</b> 6 mg twice daily (bid) for 4 weeks. Treatment responders were then randomized 1 : 1 to continue double-blind <b>tegaserod</b> or placebo therapy for 6 weeks. Efficacy variables included the proportion of days with satisfactory relief of dyspepsia symptoms (early satiety, postprandial fullness and bloating) {{as well as the}} change in individual symptom severity scores for these three cardinal dyspepsia symptoms. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using a validated questionnaire, the Nepean Dyspepsia Index. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored. Results. Of 101 women enrolled, 71 completed open-label treatment, and 70 responders were randomized to double-blind treatment. The proportion of days with satisfactory relief of dyspepsia symptoms (least squares mean, LSM) increased with <b>tegaserod</b> and placebo, to 0. 69 and 0. 62, respectively at study end (P = 0. 366).
