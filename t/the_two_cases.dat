5|$|On 8 March 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II issued summonses {{to appear}} for {{all six of}} the {{suspects}} in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases.</b> As with the decision to authorise the investigation by the Prosecutor, Judge Hans-Peter Kaul dissented and opposed the issuance of summonses.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{with the}} poached elements, both new {{specimens}} represent {{almost the entire}} skeleton of Deinocheirus, as MPC-D 100/127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae, most caudal vertebrae, and the right forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 fills in most gaps of the other skeleton, with nearly all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, the ilium, a partial ischium, {{and most of the}} left hindlimb. In 2014, the specimens were described in the Nature journal by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee Lee, Godefroit, Escuillié, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A similar series of events was reported earlier in 2014 with Spinosaurus, another sail-backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912. Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists, and Spinosaurus was shown to have been quite different from other spinosaurids. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always be safely inferred from close relatives.|$|E
5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E

5|$|However, in 1955, in {{a similar}} case {{involving}} another woman, Mrs. Clarice B. Covert, who had killed her husband in England with an axe, Federal District Court Judge Edward A. Tamm ruled that civilians who accompany military forces overseas could not be imprisoned by military courts. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases,</b> Kinsella v. Krueger and Reid v. Covert, went to the US Supreme Court, which affirmed that military trials of civilians were indeed constitutional, only to reverse itself a year later {{in a review of}} the decisions. Dorothy was released, and went to live with Krueger in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|The Kenyan government's {{attempt to}} defer the cases at the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The Kenyan government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued {{in federal}} court to {{overturn}} those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit consolidated <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> into one and reversed the judgments, remanding the cases for entry of judgments {{in favor of the}} United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on appeal, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E

25|$|The atomic form factor, or {{scattering}} power, of {{an element}} {{depends on the}} type of radiation considered. Because electrons interact with matter though different processes than for example X-rays, the atomic form factors for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> are not the same.|$|E
25|$|The {{solutions}} of Beltrami's equation restrict to diffeomorphisms of {{the upper}} halfplane or unit disk if the coefficient μ has extra symmetry properties; since the two regions are related by a Möbius transformation (the Cayley transform), <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> are essentially the same.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to {{this course}} of action seems strong; when asked, a {{majority}} of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives.

25|$|The {{woman who}} found Kovari's {{body in a}} Churchyard in Barking, found Daniel Whitworth's body just 2 weeks later in {{almost exactly the same}} position.

25|$|Although {{the above}} {{argument}} does not decide between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases,</b> the Gelfond–Schneider theorem shows that √2√2 is transcendental, hence irrational. This theorem states {{that if a}} and b are both algebraic numbers, and a is not equal to 0 or 1, and b is not a rational number, then any value of a'b is a transcendental number (there can {{be more than one}} value if complex number exponentiation is used).|$|E
25|$|He contrasted <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases,</b> {{noting that}} in the earlier case the {{government}} agent had merely supplied an ingredient for the manufacture of methamphetamine that was legal yet difficult to obtain, and one the defendant in that case had demonstrably been able to obtain from other sources than the government undercover agent. As well, in Russell the illegal manufacturing operation had been producing the drug well before the federal operation began.|$|E

25|$|A claim can be {{made that}} the {{difference}} between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, you have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Supreme Court {{consolidated}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases,</b> Andersen v. Sims and Castle v. State, {{for review}} as Andersen v. King County. It heard oral arguments on March 8, 2005. On July 26, 2006, it reversed the trial courts' determinations in a 5-4 ruling. The majority opinion {{focused on the}} constitutionality of the legislature's enactment of the state's Defense of Marriage Act limiting the privileges of marriage to opposite-sex couples. In October 2006, the court refused to reconsider its ruling.|$|E

25|$|He {{looked to}} Ayeni and Wilson v. Layne, {{decided by the}} Supreme Court the year before, as precedents. In the latter case the Court had {{unanimously}} held it was unconstitutional for reporters to accompany federal marshals executing an arrest warrant in a private residence since their presence served no valid law enforcement purpose. Since <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>cases</b> involved private homes with a reasonable expectation of privacy, he distinguished Lauro's by noting the perp walk had occurred on a public street and {{sidewalk in front of}} the police station.|$|E

On 18 July 1994, a bomb exploded in front of the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, killing 86 people and wounding several hundred.
