40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} rhythmic structuring of conversational interaction. Conversational speech requires active co-operation and co-ordination {{of the behavior of}} two or more speakers. Previous research indicates that one of the mechanisms used by speakers to regulate conversational interaction, is close monitoring and adaptation to rhythmic patterns. When this does not function properly, interaction may be adversely affected or even break down. There are reasons to believe that these mechanisms are used universally across languages, but there are also likely to be patterns that are <b>language-specific.</b> <b>The</b> research project, of which the present paper forms a first published report, is an attempt at separating <b>the</b> universal and <b>language-specific</b> aspects of <b>the</b> regulating rhythmic patterns. Although this research is primarily meant to clarify the mechanisms of conversational interaction from a linguistic/phonetic point of view, its applicability to speech technology is evident. Growing interest in dialogue systems for applications to man-machine communication demands more detailed data on all aspects of natural human conversation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The perceptual magnet {{effect is}} one of <b>the</b> {{earliest}} known <b>language-specific</b> phenomena arising in infant speech development.

The model embodies two principal hypotheses supported by considerable experimental and theoretical research from the neuroscience literature: (1) sensory experience guides language-specific development of an auditory neural map, and (2) a population vector can predict psychological phenomena based on map cell activities. These hypotheses are realized in a selforganizing neural network model.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{coordination}} of clauses in Finnish Sign Language (FinSL). Building on conversational data, the paper first shows that linking in conjunctive coordination in FinSL is primarily asyndetic, whereas in adversative and disjunctive coordination FinSL prefers syndetic linking. Secondly, the paper investigates the nonmanual prosody of coordination: nonmanual activity is shown both to mark the juncture of the coordinand clauses and to draw their contours. Finally, the paper addresses certain forms of clausal coordination in FinSL that are sign language-specific. It is suggested that <b>the</b> sign <b>language-specific</b> properties of coordination are caused both {{by the fact that}} signers can use two manual articulators in the production of sentences and by the pervasive iconicity of sign language structure...|$|R

30|$|Other points worth {{highlighting}} about compiling templates and code generation {{concern the}} flexibility and compatibility of the code.

About the compatibility of the compiled codes, this proposal advises the usage of a supporting platform which wraps the generated outputs in order to make them compatible among each other. In the case proposed in this paper, the service refinement cycle takes this role, mixing in a single execution environment the process workflows, policy entitling modules, and underlying systems such as databases.|$|R
