5|$|Administrative or Economic (Polish: gospodarcze) sejmiks oversaw {{voivodeship}} self-government. Often, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>held</b> {{on the day}} {{following the}} deputational sejmik. Their decrees were known as laudas. Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included: dealing with taxation (distribution of national taxes) and tax collectors, managing the local (voivodeship) taxes and treasury, recruiting local military and (from mid-1700s) election of deputies to the Treasury Tribunals. These sejmiks arose in the early 16th century.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{leaves of}} the codex were {{scattered}} in several places of the monastery, from where they were collected on several occasions by people from France, Russia, and Italy. The first was Pierre Séguier (1588–1672), who bought 14 leaves which, known later as Fragmenta Coisliniana, and {{became a part of}} the Fonds Coislin. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>held</b> in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In 1715 Bernard de Montfaucon published text of these 14 leaves. He made a few mistakes corrected by Tischendorf (in 1865). Tischendorf observed in Paris additional passage. Montfaucon used the manuscript for his palaeographical studies.|$|E

Their fate is unknown after Italy's armistice with the Allies, when they presumably came under German control.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time since 2009, Alabama played Kentucky at Lexington, and in the game Alabama {{defeated}} the Wildcats 48–7. Although the Crimson Tide defense opened the game strong and forced Kentucky to punt after they held the Wildcats to a series of three-and-outs on their initial possessions, the Alabama offense did not see the same on-field success. After <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>held</b> to a punt on their first possession, fumbles by Kenyan Drake and T. J. Yeldon on the next two Crimson Tide possessions inside the Wildcats' 15-yard line kept the game scoreless.|$|E
5|$|From 1987 to 1995, various Double Dare live tours visited venues {{around the}} United States.

Gorari was taken and by mid-November the brigade, having suffered 471 battle casualties since the being committed to the fighting around Kokoda, finally reached Wairopi, where the swollen Kumusi River was forded.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>held</b> at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and probably never got closer than 160km north of Pagan. (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At any rate, the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.|$|E

A 27-yard pass from Brumbaugh to Van Sickel got the Gators out of bounds at the 1-yard line. Crabtree ran it in for the touchdown, but Brumbaugh's place kick for the extra point was wide and short. Some sources, such as Peter Golenbock's Go Gators!, claim it was blocked.|$|E
5|$|The press, the radio, and the {{television}} also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>held.</b> Most importantly, this new {{freedom of the press}} and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.|$|E
