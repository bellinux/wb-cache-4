40|$|Abstract. Mesoporous TiO 2 films was {{prepared}} by evaporation-induced self-assembly and dip-coating method. And the pore {{size of the}} TiO 2 films is adjusted by controlling the molar ratio of H 2 O/TiO 2 (H value). Water contact angle was chosen to represent the hydrophilic property, and XRD and AFM were carried out to characterize the films. With the increase of H value, the pore size increased firstly then decreased. And when H is 15, the pore size is the biggest, which hydrophilicity in dark is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>too.</b> With <b>the</b> extention of the non-irridation time, the hydrophilicity is worse. And the reason may be ascribed to the adsorption of organic matter in air...|$|R

We propose a mechanism for achieving this flow which we have found to be powerful and easy to use; we call it Player. Player combines an efficient message protocol with a simple device model. It is implemented as a multi-threaded TCP socket server that provides transparent network access to a collection of sensors and actuators, often comprising a robot.

40|$|Holding their index fingers {{up in the}} air, {{shouting}} “we’re number one! ” {{is symbolic}} for victory by sport fans around the world.

When the World Health Organization announced at its June 21, 2000, press conference that America ranked 37 th out of the 191 countries in the United Nations in overall healthcare delivery systems, 72 nd in overall population health, while number one in overall costs, little was said by the US government officials, the various health asso...|$|R

60|$|As I rode quietly home {{at night}} after the day's bustle, I thought {{a good deal of}} Caddy's {{engagement}} and felt confirmed in my hopes (in spite of the elder Mr. Turveydrop) that she would be the happier and better for it. And if there seemed to be but a slender chance of her and her husband ever finding out what the model of deportment really was, why that was all for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>too,</b> and who would wish them to be wiser? I did not wish them to be any wiser and indeed was half ashamed of not entirely believing in him myself.

6000|$|We want {{to think}} of women not--as their own sex would show them--as Lorleis luring us to destruction, but as good angels beckoning us upward. They have more power for good or evil than they dream of. It is just at the very age when a man's {{character}} is forming that he tumbles into love, and then the lass he loves has the making or marring of him. Unconsciously he molds himself to what she would have him, good or bad. I am sorry to have to be ungallant enough to say that I do not think they always use their influence for <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> <b>Too</b> often <b>the</b> female world is bounded hard and fast within the limits of the commonplace. Their ideal hero is a prince of littleness, and to become that many a powerful mind, enchanted by love, is [...] "lost to life and use and name and fame." ...|$|R

Against <b>the</b> <b>best</b> batsmen, <b>too,</b> Lohmann possessed skill and guile, and he could vary his pace, flight and break deceptively, so as to worry batsmen on better pitches.

He later was a royal poet in the court of Sultan Shihab ud-Dawlah Mas'ud I of Ghazni son of Mahmud of Ghazna. He has left behind a divan.

60|$|Emily's {{mismanagement}} had fostered Ada's carelessness and inattention.

Mistake not this for a commendation of my work; nor conclude, because I was pleased with the doing of it, that therefore I am fondly taken with it now it is done. He that hawks at larks and sparrows has no less sport, though a much less considerable quarry, than he that flies at nobler game: and he is little acquainted with the subject of this treatise--the UNDERSTANDING--who does not know that, as it is the most elevated faculty of the soul, so it is employed with a greater and more constant delight than any of the other. Its searches after truth are a sort of hawking and hunting, wherein the very pursuit makes a great part of the pleasure. Every step the mind takes in its progress towards Knowledge makes some discovery, which is not only new, but <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>too,</b> for <b>the</b> time at least.|$|R
