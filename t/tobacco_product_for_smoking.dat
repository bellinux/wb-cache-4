The competition for the firm was from strong regional brands. The firm offered lower priced beedis compared to the large regional brands. The quality of Sainand Beedis {{was similar to the}} quality of the competing regional brands. The firm provided superior service to channel members and also gave a higher trade commission. The result was a dominant position in the market it served. Its effort at geographical expansion to neighboring areas was affected by the difficulty in recruiting wholesalers. The competitor's distributor exerted its influence on the wholesalers in these new markets to prevent them from stocking Sainand Beedis. The inability to recruit wholesalers and the inability to service retailers directly hampered its growth plan. The large geographical spread of the semi-urban and rural markets intensified the distribution problem. The loyalty of the small town and rural consumer to existing brands was another important issue that hindered its growth. ...|$|R
40|$|Background There is {{on-going}} {{debate about}} the wisdom of substituting smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> <b>for</b> cigarette <b>smoking</b> as a 'harm reduction' strategy. It is generally believed that health risks associated with smokeless tobacco use (ST) are lower than those with cigarette smoking. However, the population attributable risk of <b>smoking</b> is higher <b>for</b> cardiovascular diseases than for any cancers, and few studies or reviews have considered the cardiovascular outcomes of ST use. A systematic review was therefore carried out to highlight the gaps in the evidence base. Methods Electronic databases were searched, supplemented by screening reference lists, smoking-related websites, and contacting experts. Analytical observational studies of ST use (cohorts, case-control, cross-sectional studies) were included if they reported on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, or risk factors. Data extraction covered control of confounding, selection of cases and controls, sample size, clear definitions and measurements of the health outcome and ST use. One or two independent reviewers carried out selection, extraction and quality assessments. Results A narrative review was carried out. Very few studies were identified; only three from Sweden consider CVD outcomes and these are discrepant. There may be a modest association between use of Swedish snuff (snus) and cardiovascular disease (e. g., relative risk= 1. 4, 95...|$|R
40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT o Background Parallel to the {{decrease}} in smoking, snuff is used increasingly among people in Norway, espessially the youth. Aproximatly 180 000 were using snuff regularly in 2005. There has been {{a change in the}} cultural acceptance of snuffuse the last ten years, mainly due to growing concerns for the health effects associated with smoking, heavy anti-smoke-campaigns and the introduction of smoking restrictions to public areas. The trend is not uniqe for Norway, many other countries also see increasing consumption of snuff and smokeless tobacco. o Objectives One has known little about the health effects associated with snuffuse. Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter for helsetjenesten(the National center of knowledge for the healtservice) was given the assignment of evaluating all epidemiological evidence concerning the health effects and dependency associated with snuff consumption, and the role of snuff in smoking initiation and smoking cessation. A systematical review was published in 2005. About the same time, International Agency for Reasearch on Cancer(IARC), the cancerinstitute of the Worlds Health Organisation, published a large review on smokeless tobacco, “IARC Monographs on the Evaluaton of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Vol. 89, Smokeless tobacco and some related nitrosaminer”. Several other studies concerning the healt heffects associated with smokeless tobacco consumption, especially the risk of cancer, and its role in smoking cessation have been published during the last years after the publication of the two reviews. I have compared the two reviews and looked at some later publications and their results and conclusions. o Conclusions Nicotine from snuff has a slower absorption into the bloodstream than from cigarettes, but in aproximately the same degree as when smoking. The most abundant carcinogens in smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> are tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines(TSNA), N-nitrosoamino acids and volantile N-nitrosamines and aldehydes. Scandinavian snuff has shown lower consentrations of carcinogenic nitrosamines than American snuff. Many other smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> have shown high consentrations of carcinogenic nitrosamines. Snuff and other <b>product</b> of smokeless <b>tobacco</b> are addictive. The two reviews conclude differently on use of smokeless tobacco and risk of cancer. IARC refer to all types of smokeless tobacco(included many different types of chewing tobacco) and different consumption around the world. Snuff has shown much lower contents of carcinogenic compounds than many other smokeless <b>tobacco</b> <b>products.</b> IARC has included documentation from animal experiments, the Norwegian review has not. Also other inclusion criterias vary among the two reviews. Epidemiological data from the USA and Asia show a raised risk of oral cancer, but this is not confirmed in northern European countries. There are limited evidence concerning use of smokeless tobacco and cancer of the oesophagus. IARC conclude that there are sufficient evidence that smokeless tobacco causes pancreatic cancer, the Norwegian review says that conclusions cannot be drawn on the sparse epidemiological evidence. A meta-analysis published in 2008 conclude that there are risk of pancreatic cancer. The evidence on cardiovascular disease risk from smokeless tobacco use is limited. Snuff is looked upon as less harmfull than other <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> <b>for</b> <b>smoking,</b> and a debate the last years has discussed wether snuff should be introduced as a <b>product</b> <b>for</b> help in quitting cigarette-smoking. Snuff is forbidden in The European Union(except in Sweden) and several other countries, but these policies has been suggested changed. Some argue that snuff could produce net benefit to health at the population level if the smokers who can’t manage quit smoking, change habit and start using snuff instead. The reviews and studies reveal that the basis of knowledge about healheffects and risks concerning use of snuff and smokeless tobacco still is insufficient, and we will most likely see more studies and reviews on this subject the next few years...|$|R

40|$|Tobacco use is {{considered}} {{the single most important}} man-made cause of cancer that can be avoided. The evidence that nicotine is involved in cancer development is reviewed and discussed in this paper. Both tobacco smoke and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> <b>for</b> oral use contain a number of carcinogenic substances such as polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAH) and tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA) which undoubtedly contribute to tobacco related cancer. Recent studies have shown that nicotine can affect several important steps in the development of cancer, and suggest that it may cause aggravation and recurrence of the disease. TSNA may be formed from nicotine in the body. The role of nicotine as the major addictive component of <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> may have distracted our attention from toxicological effects on cell growth, angiogenesis and tumor malignancy. Effects on cancer disease are important aspects in the evaluation of possible long-term effects from sources of nicotine, such as e-cigarettes and <b>products</b> <b>for</b> nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), which both have a potential for life-long use...|$|R

Because {{the public}} health {{literature}} contains few analytic studies of modifiable behavioral risk factors for dental disease among older community-dwelling populations, the New England Elders Dental Study was undertaken as an epidemiologic study of the oral health status of {{a representative sample of}} older adults living within the six New England states. METHODS. Five dentists conducted comprehensive in-home oral health examinations on 1156 community-dwelling adults aged 70 and older to determine whether lifetime use of <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> was a significant risk factor for tooth loss, caries, and periodontal disease.
