5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>on</b> the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Briton was {{the first}} of the trio to be {{commissioned}} and was assigned to the East Indies Station in 1871. She remained there for four and a half years, mostly engaged on the suppression of the slave trade.

5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>On</b> one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, {{while working}} on his first feature film Ivan's Childhood, Tarkovsky made a {{proposal}} to Mosfilm for a film {{on the life of}} Russia's greatest icon painter, Andrei Rublev. The contract was signed in 1962 and the first treatment was approved in December 1963. Tarkovsky and his co-screenwriter Andrei Konchalovsky worked for more than <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>on</b> the script, studying medieval writings and chronicles and books on medieval history and art. In April 1964 the script was approved and Tarkovsky began working on the film. At the same time the script was published in the influential film magazine Iskusstvo Kino, and was widely discussed among historians, film critics and ordinary readers. The discussion on Andrei Rublev centered on the sociopolitical and historical, and not the artistic aspects of the film.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining {{the same}} {{interval}} {{of three years}} between Germanicus' and Drusus' first and second term as consul, Drusus was given the consulship again in AD 21, which he held with his father.

For Tiberius, Drusus holding the consulship was a welcome sight, and {{with the state of}} his health, he retreated to Campania, leaving Drusus alone in carrying out the obligations of the consulship. Tiberius' retreat lasted about twenty months.|$|E
5|$|No {{work was}} done to the ship over the {{following}} <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>On</b> 18 January 1904, Ottoman negotiators began {{a new round of}} talks with Krupp, demanding a reduction in the cost of the modernization from 282,000lira to 65,000lira; this amount does not cover the preparatory work that had been initially carried out, let alone the reconstruction. In return, the Ottoman government would order a pair of torpedo cruisers—the —from Germaniawerft. With the armament contract still under negotiation, Krupp was forced to concede, despite the significant financial loss the reconstruction deal represented. By April, the armament contract was signed, and so work began slowly on Asar-i Tevfik. Work was completed by late 1906. The reconstructed ship departed Kiel on 19 November, and arrived in Constantinople on 4 January 1907.|$|E
