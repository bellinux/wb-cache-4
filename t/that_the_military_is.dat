25|$|Some {{argue that}} the root problem is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> self-selecting, {{rendering}} the culture a self-perpetuating one. Solutions such as the reinstatement of the draft and a European-style national service obligation have been offered. but none appear to have made any progress toward adoption.|$|E
25|$|Similarly Yang {{rejects the}} constitutionalist notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> to be neutral and nationalized {{under the control}} of {{civilian}} politician. Since it was established by the CPC, and its role in the victory against the Kuomintang, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is unique and should be treated as such.|$|E
25|$|In November 2004, Hunter and Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner {{withheld}} {{their support}} for a bill creating a Director of National Intelligence (DNI) until specific conditions were met. Hunter argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> the biggest consumer of intelligence and any reforms enacted, including {{the creation of a}} DNI, must not endanger the lives of troops on the battlefield. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which created the DNI position, was passed by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush later that year.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of his {{retirement}} in 1995 Leibowitz had published more than 250 articles in scientific journals and had been {{recognized as one of the}} most influential researchers in perception (White, 1987). He was also a tireless advocate for psychological science. Once when offering testimony to a Congressional committee, Leibowitz pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> investing less annually in human factors research than the cost of a single aviation mishap despite <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> blaming many such mishaps on human error.|$|R
50|$|On 7 December 300 villagers {{blocked the}} {{entrance}} to Tavualevu Village, {{in response to a}} rumour <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> coming to arrest Bokini, a rumour the army quickly denied.|$|R
50|$|Taylor and McNamara {{were also}} enlightened by Vietnam's vice president, Nguyen Ngoc Tho (choice of many to succeed Diem should a coup occur), who in {{detailed}} terms obliterated Taylor's information <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> succeeding in <b>the</b> countryside. At Kennedy's insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the NSC considered a strategic fantasy. The final report declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> making progress, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> increasingly unpopular Diem-led {{government was not}} vulnerable to a coup, and that an assassination of Diem or Nhu was a possibility.|$|R
25|$|The film {{opens with}} {{newspaper}} photojournalist Audrey Aimes (Castle) accidentally stumbling upon {{a small town}} (Ludlow, Illinois) which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation {{as a means of}} growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that {{there have been a number}} of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.|$|E
25|$|Mandella, {{with fellow}} soldier, lover, and {{companion}} Marygay Potter, returns to civilian life, {{only to find}} humanity drastically changed. He and the other discharged soldiers have difficulty fitting into a society that has evolved almost beyond their comprehension. The veterans learn that, to curb overpopulation, which led to worldwide class wars caused by inequitable rationing, homosexuality has become officially encouraged {{by many of the}} world's nations. The world has become a very dangerous place due to widespread unemployment and the easy availability of deadly weapons. The changes within society alienate Mandella and the other veterans to the point where many re-enlist to escape, despite the extremely high casualty rate and their recognition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> a soulless construct. Mandella and Potter receive promised postings as instructors on Luna, but upon arrival are immediately reassigned to a combat command.|$|E
25|$|The {{system of}} {{promotion}} in the Austrian military, which offers no incentive for early retirement, means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> top-heavy with senior officers. The New Army Structure, which {{is intended to}} result in many fewer active-duty and reserve commands, compounds the difficulty. Personnel changes can be implemented only gradually, as the surplus of officers shrinks by attrition. In 1991, the army had four officers of general rank, fifty-nine at the rank of brigadier general (one star), 155 colonels, and 254 lieutenant colonels. The education of career officers is conducted at the Maria Theresia Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt, thirty kilometres south of Vienna, {{which was founded in}} 1752. Young men who have completed their university entrance requirements are eligible to compete for places. The three-year course graduated 212 students in 1990. At the National Defence Academy in Vienna, which has a curriculum comparable to those of the National Defence University and the Army War College in the United States, operational and troop commanders of fieldgrade rank study for three years in preparation for general staff and command positions. The NCO school is located at Enns near Linz. Troop schools provide continuous specialized courses for officers and NCOs in artillery, air defence, armour, combat engineering, communications, and the like.|$|E
50|$|On 29 September, Bainimarama reacted {{strongly}} to Downers criticism of <b>the</b> <b>Militarys</b> involvement in politics. Bainimarama said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> <b>was</b> disappointed by Downers remarks, insisting that {{his criticism of}} the bill was security-related.|$|R
25|$|It has <b>been</b> claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{impressed}} {{and asked}} for prototypes for the powered wings, but that Rossy kindly refused <b>the</b> request stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> device was only intended for aviation enthusiasts.|$|R
50|$|On 5 June 2008, Amnesty International {{released}} a report saying that at least thirty people had been evicted from refugee camps. The report also indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> horse-trading aid for physical labour.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the final}} campaign, The Parish, Virgil drops the group off at New Orleans, where the {{military}} {{appears to be}} evacuating civilians across a bridge. On the way there, the four discover the city overrun with Infected, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> actually leaving the city before it is destroyed by an air strike. The group manages to reach the bridge, where they {{make contact with the}} military. Judging from their dialogue, the military pilots suspect the Survivors to be [...] "carriers", similar to the original Survivors of Left 4 Dead. After securing their rescue helicopter, the Survivors lower and cross the bridge, escaping on the helicopter just as the bridge is destroyed. While the Survivors' fate is left unclear after this point, Chet Faliszek, the game's writer, back in 2009 said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> taking survivors to cruise ships in the Caribbean in an attempt to escape the infection.|$|E
2500|$|However, National Public Radio {{published}} an article in its on-line edition, written by Jeff Brady and entitled [...] "’The Soldier’s Bible’ draws fire," [...] which said that the emblems make the Bibles appear to be [...] "official government publications." [...] In addition to the emblems, [...] "inspirational words" [...] {{from a number of}} military leaders are included on the back cover. Barry Lind, representing Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said that the Bibles could give the impression <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> [...] "promoting a particular evangelical religious viewpoint." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morsi declared, in {{a late-night}} {{television}} address, {{that he would}} [...] "defend the legitimacy of his elected office with his life". He added that [...] "there {{is no substitute for}} legitimacy" [...] as he vowed not to resign. Morsi accused supporters of Hosni Mubarak of exploiting the wave of protests to topple the government and fight democracy. SCAF leaders also issued a statement entitled [...] "The Final Hours" [...] in which they said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> willing to shed its blood [...] "to protect the people against terrorists and fools" [...] following Morsi's refusal to step down from his elected office.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2013, it <b>was</b> {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{no longer}} controlling {{the day-to-day operations}} of the airport. It was reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> decision to control the airport had been rescinded by the SANDF.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2008, Bainimarama stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> [...] "the {{executive}} {{authority in}} the appointment of the President", following the suspension of the Great Council of Chiefs. The President would <b>be</b> a <b>military</b> appointee, until a reformed GCC were installed.|$|R
5000|$|Senator Apisai Tora harshly criticized <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> on 23 August for {{opposing}} the legislation. He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> <b>was</b> playing politics and not following democratic procedure, {{and he took}} a dim view of military teams visiting villages to campaign against the bill.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of these {{fluctuations}} in the relationship, there have been two direct coups d’états in 1960 and 1980, the 1971 coup by memorandum, and what later has been labelled a [...] "post modern coup", when Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan from the pro-Islamic Welfare Party stepped down after mounting pressure from the military in 1997. Paradoxically, the military has both been an important force in Turkey’s continuous Westernization {{but at the same time}} also represents an obstacle for Turkey’s desire to join the EU. [...] At the same time, the military enjoys a high degree of popular legitimacy, with continuous opinion polls suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> the state institution that the Turkish people trust the most.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{while many}} groups work to provide Bibles for the military, {{sometimes}} promoting {{their relationships with}} retired or active duty chaplains, the actual use of military symbols—the emblem of the Department of Defense or emblems for one or more branches of the military—on Bibles available for purchase became a source of controversy in 2005. Some of these Bibles—printed and published by civilian publishing houses or churches—bear titles such as [...] "The Soldier’s Bible" [...] or [...] "The Airman’s Bible," [...] which (according to critics) when linked to the symbols might give the impression <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> endorsing (or even [...] "establishing") religion in general, or the specific religion or faith group for whom one particular version of the Bible is considered holy.|$|E
50|$|On March 24, 2010 it was {{revealed}} that Nairn could be facing possible detention and criminal charges in Indonesia for revealing Indonesian Military assassinations of civilian activists.

2500|$|Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer {{has said}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>were</b> [...] "slowly {{trying to take}} control" [...] and {{pressure}} the PM to resign. Other notable Australians have also commented on the situation such as the then Australian Prime Minister John Howard.|$|R
2500|$|On 4 January 2007, Bainimarama {{restored}} Ratu Josefa Iloilo to the Presidency. [...] The President made {{a broadcast}} endorsing {{the actions of}} <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> [...] <b>The</b> next day, Iloilo formally appointed Bainimarama as the interim Prime Minister, indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> still effectively in control.|$|R
50|$|Some {{argue that}} the root problem is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> self-selecting, {{rendering}} the culture a self-perpetuating one.

5000|$|... : Thousands {{of protesters}} {{gathered}} in Suez, Alexandria and Tahrir Square to voice {{frustration with the}} ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces for {{what they called the}} slow pace of change, five months after the revolution, some also feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> to rule Egypt indefinitely.|$|E
5000|$|John E. Pike, head {{of space}} {{policy at the}} Federation of American Scientists, also based in Washington, said the {{admission}} raised questions about other Federal cover-ups involving U.F.O.'s.

50|$|On 15 May, <b>the</b> Syrian <b>military</b> entered <b>the</b> town of Talkalakh, on {{the border}} with Lebanon. There {{followed}} reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> massacring members of the Syrian opposition. The reports were mostly from civilians fleeing over the Kabir River into Lebanon to escape the violence.|$|R
2500|$|Charles Moskos {{developed}} the institutional/occupational hypothesis {{as a means}} to promote comparative historical studies of military organization and military change. This hypothesis evolved into <b>the</b> Postmodern <b>Military</b> Model, which helped predict the course of civil-military relations {{after the end of the}} Cold War. The I/O hypothesis argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> moving away from an institutional model towards one that was more occupational in nature. An institutional model presents <b>the</b> <b>military</b> as an organization highly divergent from civilian society while an occupational model presents <b>the</b> <b>military</b> more convergent with civilian structures. While Moskos did not propose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> ever [...] "entirely separate or entirely coterminous with civilian society", the use of a scale helped better to highlight the changing interface between the armed forces and society.|$|R
50|$|On 23 October, the Army sealed any {{remaining}} smuggling routes into Eastern Ghouta and intensified its blockade over the region. At this point, there <b>were</b> indications <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> preparing {{to start a}} new phase of its offensive, which will target the Western Ghouta area, south of Damascus.|$|R

50|$|One {{reason for}} giving {{commission}} {{to a military}} force to handle matters of civilian police is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>is</b> not allowed to go on strike, contrary to civilian public servants such as the police personnel, which enables the government to always have an instrument of law enforcement at hand.|$|E
5000|$|Admiral Courvosiers second-in-command {{within the}} {{diplomatic}} mission.

50|$|At {{first it}} seemed <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> moving {{to take over}} the {{government}} between January 11-13, with unusual troop and naval deployments around <b>the</b> capital. <b>Military</b> establishments <b>were</b> barricaded and rumours spread <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> preparing to seize power.

50|$|The {{failure of}} <b>the</b> <b>military</b> to prevent <b>the</b> {{destruction}} of Kariu and {{the arrest of}} four Christian police officers accused of firing into the crowd of Muslim aggressors, furthered <b>the</b> belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>were</b> biased towards <b>the</b> Muslim militias.
