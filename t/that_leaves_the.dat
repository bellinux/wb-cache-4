He expresses his gratitude to Rama and cautions him that Malyavan has also set Vali against him.|$|E

25|$|Plasma clouds lose energy through {{conduction}} and radiation. Conduction {{occurs when}} ions, electrons or neutrals impact other substances, typically a {{surface of the}} device, and transfer {{a portion of their}} kinetic energy to the other atoms.

25|$|Diesel {{generators}} commonly provide {{electricity in}} remote areas. About 40%–50% {{of the energy}} output is low-grade heat <b>that</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> engine via the exhaust. Connecting a membrane distillation system to the diesel engine exhaust repurposes this low-grade heat for desalination. The system actively cools the diesel generator, improving its efficiency and increasing its electricity output. This results in an energy-neutral desalination solution. An example plant was commissioned by Dutch company Aquaver in March 2014 for Gulhi, Maldives.|$|E

United States Naval reactors are of this type.|$|E

25|$|During slow {{freezing}}, {{cells are}} placed in a medium which is cooled below the freezing point using liquid nitrogen. This causes an ice mass to form in the medium. As {{the water in the}} medium freezes, the concentration of the sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant increase. Due to osmosis, the water from the cells enters the medium to keep the concentrations of sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant equal. The water <b>that</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> cells is eventually frozen, causing more water to diffuse out of the cell. Eventually, the unfrozen portion—cellular—becomes too viscous for ice crystals to form inside of the cell.|$|E
25|$|Human {{walking is}} {{accomplished}} with a strategy called the double pendulum. During forward motion, the leg <b>that</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> ground swings {{forward from the}} hip. This sweep is the first pendulum. Then the leg strikes {{the ground with the}} heel and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum. The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground. The process of walking recovers approximately sixty per cent of the energy used due to pendulum dynamics and ground reaction force.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary {{budgets are}} a coastal {{management}} tool {{used to analyze}} and describe the different sediment inputs (sources) and outputs (sinks) on the coasts, {{which is used to}} predict morphological change in any particular coastline over time. Within a coastal environment the rate of change of sediment is dependent on the amount of sediment brought into the system versus the amount of sediment <b>that</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> system. These inputs and outputs of sediment then equate to the total balance of the system and more than often reflect the amounts of erosion or accretion affecting the morphology of the coast.|$|E

25|$|Once wasps {{emerge as}} mature adults, they spend the first 2–3 {{days on the}} nest doing very little. After the first 3 idle days, workers can be told from non-workers because workers stay on the nest longer. A wasp <b>that</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> nest for any reason {{immediately}} after those 3 days is considered a non-worker. Lifetime in the nest, then, seems directly dependent on ones role: queens lived an average of 61 days, workers lived about 31 days, non-workers survived for about 5 days, and males only survived about 4.8 days. This is considered evidence that the caste system determines the individual wasp’s life course. Note that these numbers are based entirely {{on the number of}} days that a wasp is seen in the nest. In some cases, including males, the wasps live the majority of their lives outside of the nest.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermodynamic}} process {{might be}} initiated by a thermodynamic {{operation in the}} surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor <b>that</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> system, {{but it will not}} make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|In {{multicellular}} animals {{the same}} principle has been put {{in the service of}} gene cascades that control body-shape. Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product <b>that</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs.|$|E
