40|$|The {{regulation}} of mRNA encoding transforming growth factor beta (TGF- beta) and interleukin 2 (IL- 2) in normal human T cells was explored using novel competitor DNA constructs in the quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} and accessory cell-independent T cell activation models. Our experimental design revealed the following: (a) TGF-beta mRNA and IL- 2 mRNA are regulated differentially in normal human T cells, quiescent or signaled with the synergistic combinations of: sn- 1, 2 - dioctanoylglycerol and ionomycin or anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and anti-CD 2 mAb; (b) the steady-state level of TGF-beta mRNA in the stimulated T cells, in contrast to that of IL- 2 mRNA, is increased by the immunosuppressant cyclosporine (CsA); and (c) the paradoxical effect of CsA on TGF-beta mRNA levels is also appreciable {{at the level of}} production of functionally active TGF-beta protein. Our findings, in addition <b>to</b> <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> of <b>the</b> competitor DNA constructs for the precise quantification of immunoregulatory cytokines, suggest a novel and unifying mechanistic basis for the immunosuppression and some of the complications (e. g., renal fibrosis) associated with CsA usage...|$|R

5000|$|Donald Knuth's {{main purpose}} in {{describing}} Algorithm X was <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> of Dancing Links. Knuth showed that Algorithm X {{can be implemented}} efficiently on a computer using Dancing Links in a process Knuth calls [...] "DLX". DLX uses the matrix representation of the exact cover problem, implemented as doubly linked lists of the 1s of the matrix: each 1 element has {{a link to the}} next 1 above, below, to the left, and to the right of itself. (Technically, because the lists are circular, this forms a torus). Because exact cover problems tend to be sparse, this representation is usually much more efficient in both size and processing time required. DLX then uses Dancing Links to quickly select permutations of rows as possible solutions and to efficiently backtrack (undo) mistaken guesses.|$|E

The year before Lt. James H. Doolittle had flown a DH-4 from Florida to San Diego in a single calendar day, making just one stop in Texas for fuel.

40|$|AbstractThe {{range minimum}} query problem, RMQ for short, is to preprocess a {{sequence}} of real numbers A[1 …n] for subsequent queries of the form: “Given indices i, j, what is the index of the minimum value of A[i…j]?” This problem {{has been shown to}} be linearly equivalent to the LCA problem in which a tree is preprocessed for answering the lowest common ancestor of two nodes. It has also been shown that both the RMQ and LCA problems can be solved in linear preprocessing time and constant query time under the unit-cost RAM model. This paper studies a new query problem arising from the analysis of biological sequences. Specifically, we wish to answer queries of the form: “Given indices i and j, what is the maximum-sum segment of A[i…j]?” We establish the linear equivalence relation between RMQ and this new problem. As a consequence, we can solve the new query problem in linear preprocessing time and constant query time under the unit-cost RAM model. We then present alternative linear-time solutions for two other biological sequence analysis problems <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> of <b>the</b> techniques developed in this paper...|$|R

Initially Philip thought the Navajo language could be used unmodified to transmit military communications, using conversational Navajo. Just before the actual demonstration started, the Navajos received their samples of common military expressions they were to convey to each other. They informed the gathered personnel that in order to send the military messages they would have to use word and letter substitution methods to convey the messages. After some deliberation to agree upon which Navajo words would represent English equivalents the Navajos were divided into two groups and put into separate rooms, where field phones had been installed, at opposite ends of the same building.|$|E
