5|$|Conventions with {{significant}} numbers of fursuiters may offer an event known as the furry games, furry races, or critterlympics. These focus on feats of dexterity suited to multiple players in teams, such as dragging a sled filled with plush toys or other fursuiters around a marked track, or racing back and forth while <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> one another with a hula hoop.|$|E
5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
40|$|Space mission {{scenarios}} {{are presented in}} which tethering is utilized. The technical and cost benefits are considered along with practicality and operational requirements. The mission scenarios considered include: (1) space shuttle delivery of payloads to higher orbits; (2) the downward release of the external tank from a shuttle; (3) space station altitude reboost using shuttle angular momentum; (4) shuttle docking to space station tether; (5) using shuttle based <b>tether</b> <b>to</b> assist launch of upper stage to higher energy orbits; (6) using space station <b>tether</b> <b>to</b> deploy payloads to higher orbits with momentum accumulator; (7) using <b>tethers</b> <b>to</b> discard first stages or apogee motors; and (8) planetary applications of tethers...|$|R

5|$|The {{cover was}} {{designed}} by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> strings, manipulated {{by a pair of}} hands in a blood-red sky. Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album's release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of Ozzy Osbourne. The European leg was canceled after Burton's death in September 1986, and the band returned home to audition a new bassist. Metallica honored the album's 20th anniversary on the Escape from the Studio '06 tour, by playing it in its entirety.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun. A viable infant was spontaneously {{delivered}} unassisted from the woman's body, which was suspended by the neck. The healthy infant {{was found on}} the floor, still <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> the body of the mother by the umbilical cord. The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun prior to death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of postmortem delivery, a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.|$|E

50|$|The {{satellite}} {{split into}} two parts, connected by a 300 m <b>tether,</b> <b>to</b> conduct its experiments which consisted of recording a video of tether deployment and using the <b>tether</b> <b>to</b> deorbit the satellite. The spacecraft consisted of a 5 kg base vehicle, with dimensions of 160 x 160 x 253 mm and a 4 kg vehicle {{at the end of}} the tether measuring 160 x 160 x 158 mm. The electrodynamic tether was made from ultra-thin wires of stainless steel and aluminium.|$|R
5|$|Myers made eleven {{hydrogen}} balloons for the Navy for Admiral Francis J. Higginson in 1902 for {{a military}} exercise. Ten of the balloons were six feet in diameter and used for signaling purposes that troops were nearby. The eleventh balloon of 12,000 cubic feet capacity was twenty-eight-feet in diameter. It was capable of carrying two men and all their associated observation equipment. It {{was used by the}} Signal Corps for a high altitude observation platform to monitor enemy warships. This balloon was <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> and controlled by a Navy ship. The intelligence gleaned about the enemy and its possible intentions could be passed on to the Army.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but {{had been told to}} cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. By the end of the month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing—was still looking to get a permit to start operations in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on “a couple of incidents” that the writers had heard about in which {{troublesome}} children, through alternative sentencing, were <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> their parents. The scene in which Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens {{as part of their}} punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced had to wear certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had not paid taxes. The scene in which Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's police car {{was based on}} one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running police car parked at a Dunkin' Donuts while the police were in the store.|$|E

5|$|To {{strengthen}} the defence further, by 1881, mines were {{laid in the}} waters between the two forts and the eastern entrance of the harbour. The mines were <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> the seabed but floated dangerously {{under the surface of}} the water unseen to any enemy marine vessels. To enable safe passage of ships, a 'friendly safe channel' was created through the minefields. The work involved in the laying of minefields under the narrow channel (just 240 m apart) had actually led to rumours that tunnels running under the channels were constructed to link the two forts. There are, however, no archival records to prove that these tunnels were ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|D. Michael Harris and Jack Grimm {{had failed}} to find Titanic but their expeditions did succeed in {{producing}} fairly detailed mapping of {{the area in which}} the ship had sunk. It was clear that the position given in Titanics distress signals was inaccurate, which was a major expedition difficulty because it increased the search area's already-massive size. Despite the failure of his 1977 expedition, Robert Ballard had not given up hope and devised new technologies and a new search strategy to tackle the problem. The new technology was a system called Argo / Jason. This consisted of a remotely controlled deep-sea vehicle called Argo, equipped with sonar and cameras and towed behind a ship, with a robot called Jason <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> it that could roam the sea floor, take close-up images and gather specimens. The images from the system would be transmitted back to a control room on the towing vessel where they could be assessed immediately. Although it was designed for scientific purposes, it also had important military applications and the United States Navy agreed to sponsor the system's development, on condition that it was to be used to carry out a number of programmes – many still classified – for the Navy.|$|E
5|$|The fate {{of these}} puffs—in particular, whether they remain {{restricted}} to isolated locales or integrated into Ca2+ waves for propagation throughout the cell—is determined {{in large part}} by MAM dynamics. Although reuptake of Ca2+ by the ER (concomitant with its release) modulates the intensity of the puffs, thus insulating mitochondria to a certain degree from high Ca2+ exposure, the MAM often serves as a firewall that essentially buffers Ca2+ puffs by acting as a sink into which free ions released into the cytosol can be funneled.

The ability of mitochondria to serve as a Ca2+ sink is a result of the electrochemical gradient generated during oxidative phosphorylation, which makes tunneling of the cation an exergonic process. Normally, mild calcium influx from cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix causes transient depolarization that is corrected by pumping out protons.|$|E

5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. The balloon is <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon. At the very moment of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand {{into the face of}} one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of life–one of many horses in the movie.|$|E

25|$|The current {{hypothesis}} of calcium-dependent exocytosis at retinal ribbon synapses {{suggests that the}} ribbon accommodates a reservoir of primed releasable vesicles. The vesicles that are in closest contact with the presynaptic plasma membrane {{at the base of}} the ribbon constitute the small, rapidly releasable pool of vesicles, whereas the remaining vesicles <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> the ribbon constitute the large, readily (slower) releasable pool. These regularly aligned rows of synaptic vesicles <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> either side of the ribbon along with the expression of the kinesin motor protein KIF3A at retinal ribbon synapses can move vesicles like a conveyor belt to the docking/release site at the ribbon base.|$|E
