5|$|An {{adaptation}} is an observable {{structure or}} other feature of an organism (for example, an enzyme) generated {{by natural selection}} to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the hypothesis that feathers are adaptations for bird flight. That would require three things: that <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> of having feathers is heritable; that <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> does serve the function of flight; and that <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> increases the fitness of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living birds. However, {{there is also a}} historical question, namely, did <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> arise {{at the same time as}} bird flight? Unfortunately for the hypothesis, this seems not to be so: theropod dinosaurs had feathers, but many of them did not fly. Feathers can be described as an exaptation, having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as insulation. Biologists may describe both the co-option and the earlier adaptation in teleological language.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with <b>the</b> <b>trait,</b> while heterozygous females carry <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented, and media attention on <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} method to perform linkage genome scans for many {{correlated}} <b>traits</b> in <b>the</b> Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 (GAW 15) data. The proposed method has two steps: first, we use a clustering method to find the tight clusters of <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> and use <b>the</b> first principal component (PC) of <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> in each cluster to represent the cluster; second, we perform a linkage scan for each cluster by using <b>the</b> representative <b>trait</b> of <b>the</b> cluster. The results of applying the method to the GAW 15 Problem 1 data indicate that most of <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> in <b>the</b> same cluster have the same regulators, and <b>the</b> representative <b>trait</b> measure, <b>the</b> first PC, can explain {{a large part of}} the total variation of all <b>the</b> <b>traits</b> in each cluster. Furthermore, considering one cluster of traits at a time may yield more linkage signals than considering traits individually...|$|R

5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts {{to hold a}} trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon disruptive selection also acts during transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> {{in more than one}} direction. In particular, if <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to speciation.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord share the same ancestry, and <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the global}} factors were {{developed}} by factor-analyzing <b>the</b> primary <b>traits,</b> <b>the</b> meanings of <b>the</b> global <b>traits</b> were determined by <b>the</b> primary <b>traits</b> which made them up.

5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against <b>the</b> <b>trait.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and <b>the</b> <b>trait</b> eliminated before predators learn to avoid it. If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it would never last in the species long enough to become beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{efforts to}} revive {{interest}} in the breed, numbers steadily declined {{in the years before}} 1988. In 1995, there were 33 stallions in service; in 1996 this number remained the same and by 1998 it had declined to 30. In 2004, there were 111 breeders and 119 Trait du Nord foals were registered. By 2007 and 2008 there were only 17 stallions registered, a number which is exposing the breed to a dangerous increase in inbreeding. To combat this danger, farmers are cross breeding <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord with approved Belgian and Dutch horses. The number of farmers breeding <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord decreased from 150 to 125 in 2002, then to 92 in 2007 and 86 in 2008.

5|$|During World War I, Trait du Nord {{horses were}} among those confiscated by Germans from Belgium and France {{for use in the}} war. In 1919, these horses were {{returned}} to their homeland, allowing the reconstruction of the breed. During World War II, the armed forces used all stocks of fuel, and the draft horse was used to continue agricultural production in France. After the war, farmers quickly equipped themselves with mechanized equipment. The decline in the breeding of <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord became noticeable in the early 1950s, and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely. By the early 1970s, breeding had slowed so much that <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord, along with other French draft breeds, was in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord {{proved a}} {{successful}} breed for the farmers that developed it, and quickly {{spread throughout the}} Netherlands, Belgium and northern France. It was given different names depending on the country, and was often confused with and crossbred with draft breeds from the Netherlands, Brabants and the Ardennes. Breed associations began to organize in the late 19th century, {{and at this point}} blood from the Boulonnais was introduced to bring more elegance to the breed. <b>The</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord gradually began to differ from the Ardennes as they gained size and volume and improved their gaits, and the breed became popular in the north and east of France. In 1855, even before the breed had been differentiated from the Ardennes, veterinarians described the heavy horses bred near Hainaut as superior to Flemish breeds.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord, {{previously}} {{also known}} as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord, is a breed of heavy draft horse developed and bred {{in the area of}} Hainaut in western Belgium and in northeastern France. Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903. Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands, it was bred for size and pulling power for agricultural work. By 1855, the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds. <b>The</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920, with lesser use continuing through the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{research}} and develop alternative assessment methods for tutorial courses in liberal arts education. Nine faculty members from Lawrence University, Macalester College, The College of Wooster and Williams College developed a Shared Assessment Method (SAM) for assessing three groups of traits: Independent Thinker (takes teacher roles; inquiring mind; self-assessment; learning to argue); Intellectual Maturity (ability to work with complexity/uncertainty; takes intellectual chances); and Creativity (idea generation; curiosity; takes multiple perspectives; connects disparate information and ideas).

5|$|The {{pulling power}} of <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord made it popular for {{use during the}} Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In mines, steam engines and internal combustion engines {{could not be used}} due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used in the mines in 1821 and <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the mines and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} Flanders is {{particularly}} conducive to agriculture, {{and in the}} 19th century the draining of the swamps and improved farming techniques led to a major expansion in cultivated areas and farm sizes. As there were no existing horses {{in the area that}} were suitable for plowing, the farmers found it necessary to create a breed of draft horse specifically for their use. From the 1850s on, farmers selected horses that eventually became <b>the</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord. The farmers combined large Belgian breeds adapted to swampy ground with the Ardennes and Dutch breeds for size, weight and strength. The result was a muscular, powerful, and tough breed with long legs that facilitated movement. <b>The</b> <b>Trait</b> du Nord was unique in being selected specifically for farming, as many draft breeds were also bred for use in transport.|$|E
