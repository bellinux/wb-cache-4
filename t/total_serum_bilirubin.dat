5000|$|Gilbert {{syndrome}} (GS) can {{be caused}} by a variety of genetic changes, but in Caucasian and African-American populations, it is most commonly associated with the UGT1A1*28 allele (rs8175347), a homozygous 2-bp insertion (TA) mutation of the TATA box promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. This polymorphism impairs proper transcription of UGT1A1 gene, resulting in decreased transcriptional activity of UGT1A1 by about 70%; the resulting reduced enzyme activity leads to the hyperbilirubinemia characteristic of GS. The *28 polymorphism occurs with a frequency of 26-31% in Caucasians and 42-56% of African-Americans. About 10-15% of these populations are homozygous for the *28 allele, but only 5% actually develop UGT1A1-associated hyperbilirubinemia, so it appears that this mutation alone may be a necessary but not sufficient factor in GS, perhaps acting in combination with other UGT1A1 mutation(s) to increase the chances of developing GS. In Asian and Pacific Islander populations, UGT1A1*28 is much less common, occurring at a frequency of approximately 9-16% in Asian populations and 4% of Pacific Islanders. In these populations, Gilbert's syndrome is more often due to missense mutations in the coding region of the gene, such as UGT1A1*6 (glycine to arginine substitution at position 71 (G71R); rs4148323) [...] A special phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module NR3 region (gtPBREM NR3) helps to increase UDPGT enzyme production, which would make it conceptually possible to medically control the bilirubin level, although this is rarely necessary, particularly in adults (usually the level of <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>bilirubin</b> in Gilbert syndrome patients vary from 1 to 6 mg/dL).|$|E

40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of phenobarbital and phototherapy combination on the <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>bilirubin</b> of the newborn infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease (IHD) and its impact on blood exchange transfusion rates. Patients and Method This single-blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted between March 2013 and December 2014 at the pediatric ward of two Military Hospitals in Jordan. A total of 200 full-term neonates with IHD were divided randomly into two groups: (1) the phenobarbital plus phototherapy group (n = 103), and (2) the phototherapy-only group (n = 97). Infants in group 1 received an oral dose of 2. 5 mg/kg phenobarbital every 12 hours for 3 days in addition to phototherapy. The <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>bilirubin</b> was observed. Results Of the total 200 included newborn infants, 186 infants completed the study: 97 infants were included in group 1 and 89 infants in group 2. The difference between the mean <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>bilirubin</b> levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours after starting the trial was clinically and statistically significant at P < 0. 05. The differences between the two groups were also statistically significant at P < 0. 05. Of the total 186 who completed the study, only 22 underwent blood exchange transfusion [7 from group 1, and 15 from group 2 (P = 0. 0478) ]. Conclusion In a limited-resources setting, phenobarbital in combination with phototherapy may be helpful to newborn infants with IHD, as it results in a faster decline in <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>bilirubin,</b> thus decreasing the need for blood exchange transfusion than phototherapy alone...|$|E

40|$|The present {{studies were}} {{were carried out}} to {{ascertain}} whether endotoxemia can be a possible cause of renal damage in various liver disease. 1) Clinical study : Endotoxin was measured by Limulus assay in peripheral blood from 106 patients with various liver disease. A positive test was obtained in 29 (27. 4 %). Incidence of endotoxemia was especially high in fulminant hepatitis （ 55. 6 %）, liver cirhosis (30. 4 %), and obstructive jaundice (32. 0 %). Endotoxemia correclated well {{with the level of}} <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>bilirubin</b> and the presence of ascites. There was also a correlation between endotoxemia and serum NPN. Renal damage were more frequently associated with endotoxemia in patients with a relatively high <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>bilirubin</b> level (more than 15 mg/dl) than in those with relatively low level (less than 5 mg/dl). ...|$|R
