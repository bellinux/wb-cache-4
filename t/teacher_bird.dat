He stands at the door, too afraid to enter. Eventually a child named Kenny Griffen comes to get him. Charles begins to cry and Kenny leads him in, saying that he made up the tiger. Charles escapes out of the bathroom, and when he forces himself to go back in, he sees the tiger has a torn piece of Kenny's shirt on its claw. Charles decides to relieve himself in the sink, but Miss Bird catches him. She goes around the corner to find Kenny, and Charles leaves the bathroom.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The {{purpose of this}} study is to explore {{strategies}} and resources to support biology <b>teachers</b> in conducting <b>bird</b> studies with their students and to promote place-based education in Turkey. Different strategies and resources, including a bird education trunk, a training workshop, two fieldtrips, and a Facebook group, were implemented to motivate and prepare teachers. In addition, the researcher provided consulting services to the teachers. The instruments for collecting data were a workshop evaluation questionnaire and interviews conducted with six teachers and seven preservice teachers. In addition, during the study period the researcher used reiterative reflection to determine what data was needed to examine the effects of her efforts. Teachers participating in this study reported that the resources and strategies introduced to them motivated them to conduct bird studies with students. Barriers and challenges such as time, curricular requirements, administrative issues, iv difficulties with field studies, suitability of school ground, and student attitudes affected teachers’ sense of preparation. One of the most important findings of this study is that the place-based education approach might help overcome many of these barriers. Through this study, the researcher was able to share her bird watching passion with teachers; ideally motivating teachers to inspire their students to become <b>birding</b> enthusiasts. The <b>teachers</b> expressed appreciation for her efforts and she learned that long-term collaborations will be necessary to support teachers. Can, Özge KeşaplıM. S...|$|R
