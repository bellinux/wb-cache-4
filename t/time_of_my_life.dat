That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{tells the}} story of an {{independent}} woman who was apprehensive about being in a relationship in fears of being rejected, she finally allows herself to break her emotional and communication barriers when she begins to fall in love. Clarkson revealed that she finds herself similar to the titular [...] "Miss Independent". She said, [...] "It's very funny when the song came into play with me ... 'cause at that certain <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I was actually going through that kind of thing," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I've always been real guarded about work and career. It wasn't even with, like, guy relationships, it was just, like, friends and just letting people in, you know? And so it was kinda weird 'cause I was going through that same thing at the same time, so it was very easy for me to write the bridge to the song." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beauty Process marks a {{departure}} from the tough rock style of its predecessors to a slower and more adventorous style. For example, the song [...] "Me, Myself & I" [...] is an acoustic ballad, while [...] "Moonshine" [...] features a romantic and delicate chorus. Similarly, [...] "Bitter Wine" [...] deals with second changes and, according to CMJ New Music Monthly, features [...] "distorted guitars against a eerie soundwash of picked bass, electronic drone and a lost-soul chorus." [...] The single [...] "Off the Wagon" [...] was described by Sparks as the way she feels when she drinks heavily: [...] "It might be the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> or I might end up in tears. But there are always bruises involved." [...] Although the track promotes substance abuse, Jennie Yabroff of Salon considered it to be [...] "heavy on attitude [...] light on substance." ...|$|E

[...] He said at the time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's never been this good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what [...] "started about an eight-year run of off-and-on Opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom".|$|E

2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E
2500|$|According to his autobiography, The <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> (1986), Quine {{grew up in}} Akron, Ohio, {{where he}} lived with his parents and older brother Robert Cloyd.

(also known as [...] "Hattie" [...] according to the 1920 census), was a schoolteacher and later a housewife. He received his B.A. in mathematics from Oberlin College in 1930, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University in 1932. His thesis supervisor was Alfred North Whitehead. He was then appointed a Harvard Junior Fellow, which excused him from having to teach for four years. During the academic year 1932–33, he travelled in Europe thanks to a Sheldon fellowship, meeting Polish logicians (including Stanislaw Lesniewski and Alfred Tarski) and members of the Vienna Circle (including Rudolf Carnap), as well as the logical positivist A.J. Ayer.|$|E

2500|$|Failures in {{both the}} East and the West began a tide of events that was to {{overwhelm}} Asquith's Liberal Government. Strategic setbacks combined with a shattering personal blow when, on 12 May 1915, Venetia Stanley announced her engagement to Edwin Montagu. Asquith's reply was immediate and brief, [...] "As you know well, this breaks my heart. I couldn't bear {{to come and see}} you. I can only pray God to bless you—and help me." [...] Venetia's importance to him is illustrated by a letter written in mid-1914; [...] "Keep close to me beloved in this most critical <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I know you will not fail." [...] Her engagement; [...] "a very treacherous return after all the joy you've given me", left him devastated. Significant though the loss was personally, its impact on Asquith politically can be overstated. The historian Stephen Koss notes that Asquith [...] "was always able to divide his public and private lives into separate compartments (and) soon found new confidantes to whom he was writing with no less frequency, ardour and indiscretion." ...|$|E

Like the history that is behind me, and I'm singing these songs. You know they start playing Dock Of The Bay, and the guys that played it are on the stage. You know the guy who wrote the song with Otis Redding is playing guitar. The same with Midnight Hour and Knock on Wood. All these songs that I keep starting. These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them." [...] During the interview Sebastian said he had just received a message from Dunn saying, [...] "Thank you for inviting me on this tour. I'm having the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and it's an honour to play with you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{spin-off}}, Bianca {{had fallen}} upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky {{embroiled in a}} drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fiancée Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why {{she did not want}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf. But on the other, it convinced me that Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as far as I was concerned, I certainly learned that. Don't get me wrong, I had the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> when I was in EastEnders in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now – the cast has nearly all changed and going back would be worse than foolish." [...] In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to EastEnders and branded the show [...] "rubbish".|$|E
