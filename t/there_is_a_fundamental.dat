5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
25|$|Digestive systems {{take many}} forms. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{distinction}} between {{internal and external}} digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it. In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, {{and some of the}} products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.|$|E
25|$|Some {{proponents of}} Philosophy of Life, Vitalism, Critical realism (in German {{speaking}} countries) argued that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> difference between physical, biological and psychological phenomena. For example, Henri Bergson (1921), who otherwise was {{a proponent of}} special relativity, argued that time dilation {{cannot be applied to}} biological organisms, therefore he denied the relativistic solution of the twin paradox. However, those claims were rejected by Paul Langevin, André Metz and others. Biological organisms consist of physical processes, so {{there is no reason to}} assume that they are not subject to relativistic effects like time dilation.|$|E

25|$|The defense {{moved to}} dismiss the indictments {{on the grounds that}} federal {{obscenity}} statutes violated the constitutional guarantees of privacy and liberty that were protected by the due process clause. Referencing Lawrence v. Texas and Stanley v. Georgia the defense argued <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> right to sexual privacy which includes the right to possess and view sexually explicit material in one's own home. The defense argued that this right was not affected {{by the fact that the}} material does not have any literary or artistic merit, and that since the federal obscenity laws imposed a complete ban on materials which people have the right to possess, they were unconstitutional.|$|E
500|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{difference}} between the balance of energy production in {{the different types of}} supernova. [...] In Type Ia white dwarf detonations, most of the energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and the kinetic energy of the ejecta. [...] In core collapse supernovae, {{the vast majority of the}} energy is directed into neutrino emission, and while some of this apparently powers the observed [...] destruction, [...] 99%+ of the neutrinos escape the star in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse.|$|E
500|$|Jacob Grimm states that, {{though the}} norns and valkyries {{are similar in}} nature, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{difference}} between the two. Grimm states that a [...] can be both norn and a valkyrie, [...] "but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum , they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs ride to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods".|$|E

500|$|Hadley {{found the}} most {{important}} contribution of the theoretical framework laid down in Animal Rights Without Liberation to be {{the application of a}} Razian framework of rights to animals, adding that [...] "assuming that one takes philosophical reasoning seriously, there is little to take issue with in Cochrane's analysis". However, for Hadley, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> tension in Cochrane's theory, as there is in most animal rights literature. In denying that animals possess the psychological capacities to value freedom, Cochrane undermines the challenge to orthodox rights theory that it is not only persons who should possess rights. For Hadley, [...] "only theories that have no truck with commonsense intuitions at all, like Bentham's, are really in a position to place humans and animals on a genuinely equal moral plain. The rest, arguably, are more or less disguised versions of the person-centred orthodoxy masked by rhetorical appeals to cross-species equality." [...] Hadley denies that this tension undermines Cochrane's overall argument, writing that it [...] "ought to give no comfort to opponents of animal rights. [...] reasoning, assuming you accept animals matter at all, is as uncontroversial as his writing is accessible." ...|$|E
500|$|Progressive education, a {{pedagogy}} promoting {{learning through}} real-life experiences, {{was at its}} zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in Progressive Education and other professional journals, and in 1938, the editor of Progressive Education, Gertrude Hartman, published {{a profile of the}} Avery Coonley School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, [...] "isitors {{from all parts of the}} United States and from foreign countries [...] to see the school—sometimes as many as thirty in a day." [...] Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that the most noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades it... <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> philosophy of life and education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the kind of education described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of society than the education of our generation has produced... The method in which those in the school place their faith is the building into the very nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human relations can evolve. Finding Wisdom became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education.|$|E

5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> mistake {{being made}} and that mistake was supposing that {{the healing process}} was the disease, rather than the process whereby the disease is healed. The disease, if any, was the state {{previous}} to the “psychosis.” ... The so-called “psychosis” <b>was</b> <b>an</b> attempt towards spontaneous healing, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> movement towards health, not a movement towards disease.... In some categories it would be called mystical, really a re-owning and discovery of parts of myself.|$|R
5000|$|The Creature Comforts {{advertisements}} {{were produced}} in the period 1990 to 1992 {{and in some ways}} they were indicative of the shape of things to come in British television advertising. Many commentators believe that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> shift in television advertising from the unbridled consumerism and egoism of the 1980s to what <b>is</b> sometimes termed <b>a</b> more [...] "caring" [...] approach in the 1990s.

25|$|The IMF {{sought to}} provide for {{occasional}} discontinuous exchange-rate adjustments (changing a member's par value) by international agreement. Member nations were permitted to adjust their currency exchange rate by 1%. This tended to restore equilibrium in their trade by expanding their exports and contracting imports. This would be allowed only if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> disequilibrium. <b>A</b> decrease {{in the value of}} <b>a</b> country's money <b>was</b> called <b>a</b> devaluation, while an increase {{in the value of the}} country's money <b>was</b> called <b>a</b> revaluation.|$|R
2500|$|Geometrically, {{a quantum}} point contact is a {{constriction}} in the transverse direction which presents a {{resistance to the}} motion of electrons.

2500|$|In the East, a contemplative {{life not}} {{centered}} {{on the idea of}} deities began in the sixth century BCE with the rise of Jainism, Buddhism, and certain sects of Hinduism in India, and of Taoism in China. [...] These religions claim to offer a philosophic and salvific path not involving deity worship. Deities are not seen as necessary to the salvific goal of the early Buddhist tradition, their reality is explicitly questioned and often rejected. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> incompatibility between the notion of gods and basic Buddhist principles, at least in some interpretations.|$|E

2500|$|Livy (30.12.11-15.11) is the {{historical}} source of Sophonisba, however the poetic design {{is based on}} Virgil's Aeneid.

She commits suicide so she does not become Scipio's nor Rome's war prize. [...] Here she shows her love for Massinissa. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> difference between Virgil's Aeneid and Petrarch's Africa.
