5|$|In 1945, SIRT {{purchased}} {{the property of}} the B and merged it with the Staten Island Railway. The line had been worked with B and SIRT equipment since it opened in 1890. By 1949, there were no longer any staffed offices along the line except at Arlington. All of the stations on the line, with the exception of Harbor Road, Lake Avenue, Livingston and Snug Harbor, had waiting rooms and agents. The stations without waiting rooms were flag stops; the train would only stop if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> waiting at the station. The station at Port Ivory, which was used for workers of the Procter & Gamble Plant and was only open for the morning and evening rush hour, closed around the year 1950.|$|E
25|$|The first {{emergency}} services call was reported at 11:43:14 by a student, {{though it was}} initially reported that the victim in question was bleeding from a bump to his head. The operator alerted two ambulances at 11:44:11. During the alert, gunshots were heard in the background, but the operator either did not hear them or was unable to identify them. The caller then tried to inform the operator that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> with a gun, {{but he was in}} a state of panic at the time and the operator couldn't understand the situation. At 11:46, it was finally determined a shooter was involved, and the incident was reclassified as a shooting.|$|E

In one performance, which was watched by her father {{from the back of}} the theatre, O'Hara [...] "sensed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> out front watching me, perhaps critically.

500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E
500|$|Awaking {{from his}} nap, Brian decides {{to drink a}} bottle of scotch that he had stored in his safety deposit box. He offers Stewie a sip, and they both become so drunk that Brian agrees to pierce Stewie's ear with a pin from his sweater, leaving Stewie with a bloody ear {{for the rest of}} the episode. Stewie and Brian discuss The Dog Whisperer and Cesar Millan, and Brian {{explains}} that he is inspired by the philosophy about dogs' instinctive ability to live in the present and with purpose. Stewie, however, points out that Brian himself does not appear to live with any specific purpose. Angered at the implication, Brian begins insulting Stewie, who bitterly retaliates by revealing that he could have gone all day without having his diaper changed, and only thinks of Brian as a passing amusement and [...] "the best of a bad situation". Stewie dares Brian to shoot him with the revolver in the deposit, which Brian earlier said to be bullet-free. It is revealed that Brian lied, and he attempts to shoot Stewie. The two then find a security camera hanging on a wall of the vault. Brian tries to use it to call for help, but Stewie points out if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> out there, they would have been saved. Brian then realizes that the camera has recorded him cleaning Stewie, which amuses the infant, but Brian is upset about gaining a laughingstock reputation. Stewie then prematurely causes the gun to discharge, causing the bullet to randomly ricochet off the vault walls, smashing Stewie's already-broken phone and the bottle of Scotch, and forcing the two under the table.|$|E

The report was also critical of two earlier Garda investigations into the murders, which it described as [...] "inadequate".

2500|$|Shannan Maria Gilbert (October 24, 1986 – May 1, 2010) was {{an escort}} {{who may have}} been a victim of the Long Island serial killer. She left for a client's {{residence}} in Oak Beach after midnight on May 1, 2010. At 4:51 in the morning, 911 dispatchers received a panicked phone call from Gilbert who can be heard saying that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> [...] "after her" [...] and that [...] "they" [...] were trying to kill her. She was last seen a short time later banging on the front door of a nearby Oak Beach residence and screaming for help before running off into the night. After nineteen months of searching, police found Gilbert's remains in a marsh, half a mile away from where she was last seen. In May 2012, the Suffolk County medical examiners ruled that Shannan drowned while she ran through the marsh in a drug induced panic, ruling her death as [...] "death by misadventure" [...] or [...] "inconclusive." [...] Her family believes she was murdered. On November 15, 2012 a lawsuit was filed by Mari Gilbert (Shannan's mother) against the Suffolk County Police Department in the hopes of getting more answers about what happened to her daughter the night she went missing. Due to controversy surrounding the cause of Gilbert's death, in September 2014, famed forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden agreed to conduct an independent autopsy of Shannan Gilbert's remains in hopes of determining a clear cause of death. Upon examination of Gilbert's remains, Baden found damage to her Hyoid bone, suggesting that strangulation may have occurred. Baden also noted that her body was found face-up, which is not common for drowning victims. Despite this, her death is still officially listed as an accident. On July 23, 2016, Gilbert's mother, Mari Gilbert, was murdered in her home in Ellenville, New York. Later that day, Shannan's younger sister, Sarra Elizabeth Gilbert, {{was arrested and charged with}} the murder of her mother.|$|E
