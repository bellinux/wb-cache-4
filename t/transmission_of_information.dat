5|$|The {{attack of}} myelin starts {{inflammatory}} processes, which triggers other immune cells {{and the release}} of soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. Further breakdown of the blood–brain barrier in turn causes a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Inflammation can potentially reduce <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> between neurons in at least three ways. The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} various {{reports in the}} popular press of {{experiments}} on faster-than-light transmission in optics — most often {{in the context of}} a kind of quantum tunnelling phenomenon. Usually, such reports deal with a phase velocity or group velocity faster than the vacuum velocity of light.

25|$|Telecommunications {{engineering}} {{focuses on the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> across a channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; {{this is known as}} modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{had a major}} impact; humans {{began to}} affect the {{environment}} as never before. Surplus food allowed a priestly or governing class to arise, followed by increasing division of labor. This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC. Additional civilizations quickly arose in ancient Egypt, at the Indus River valley and in China. The invention of writing enabled complex societies to arise: record-keeping and libraries served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Humans {{no longer had to}} spend all their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc...). Curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and various disciplines, including science (in a primitive form), arose. This in turn led to the emergence of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations, such as the first empires, which at times traded with one another, or fought for territory and resources.|$|E
25|$|Experience {{had shown}} that it took six hours for orders to pass from corps {{headquarters}} to company commanders and it was now considered of great importance to issue warning orders, to give time for reconnaissance and preparation by the artillery and infantry. It had also been found that corps headquarters had {{become aware of the}} situation from contact-patrol aircrew reports, while brigade headquarters were ignorant of events and arrangements for the swift <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> forwards were made. The signalling system for a larger number of contact-patrol aircraft was established and sites for new signal stations in ground to be attacked were chosen beforehand. If German defences collapsed it was considered impossible to lay cables quickly and that only one telegraph from brigade, to division to corps could reasonably be expected. Relays of runners, cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists were {{to be used as a}} supplement, with messenger-pigeons to be used in an emergency. Wireless stations were attached to infantry brigades but transmission was slow, uncertain, caused interference with other transmitters and was open to German eavesdropping.|$|E

25|$|It {{may be that}} non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, {{but that}} they are simply too far apart for {{meaningful}} two-way communication. If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, {{it is possible that}} one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> from ancient civilizations to the present, and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message, which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.|$|E
500|$|Innis was {{influenced}} by the university's two eminent communications scholars, George Herbert Mead and Robert E. Park. Although he did not attend any of these famous professors' classes, Innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> James W. Carey writes that Mead and Park [...] "characterized communication as the entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence, maintained in time, and sedimented into institutions".|$|E

40|$|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) {{has been}} widely {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important category of networks. One of the applications of WSN is in Emergency Management Systems.

A conventional centralized management system may not be able to cope with huge number of sensors, rapidly changing topology and cannot assure the real-time <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> emergency <b>information.</b> Decentralized System is presented to solve these problems. In Decentralized System, emergency information is distributed to the neighboring routers where each router transmits the emergency information to the sink by mutual coordination.
