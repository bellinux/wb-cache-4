5|$|The matrix is {{the space}} {{enclosed}} by the inner membrane. It contains about 2/3 of the <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> in a mitochondrion. The matrix {{is important in}} the production of ATP with the aid of the ATP synthase contained in the inner membrane.

5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the inner membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the inner membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E

In any case, analogous to the way modern man-made pollution may possess the potential to overwhelm the environment's ability to maintain homeostasis, the recent explosive introduction of high glycemic index and processed foods into the human diet may possess the potential to overwhelm the body's ability to maintain homeostasis and health (as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic).|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} protein {{involved}} in carbohydrate metabolism that {{is worthy of}} mention along with GLUT-4. The enzyme hexokinase phosphorylates a six-carbon sugar, most notably glucose, {{which is the first}} step in glycolysis. When glucose is transported into the cell it is phosphorylated by hexokinase. This phosphorylation keeps glucose from leaving the cell, and by changing the structure of glucose through phosphorylation, it decreases the concentration of glucose molecules, maintaining a gradient for more glucose to be transported into the cell. Hexokinase II transcription is increased in both red and white skeletal muscle upon treatment with AICAR. With chronic injections of AICAR, <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> content of hexokinase II increases in rat skeletal muscle.|$|E

E4 has also been shown to participate in arresting cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.|$|E

25|$|Each plastid creates {{multiple}} {{copies of}} a circular 75–250 kilobase plastome.

25|$|Laboratory {{tests can}} be {{performed}} to assess the cardiovascular status of the patient. Packed Cell Volume (PCV) {{is a measure of}} hydration status, with a value 45% being considered significant. Increasing values over repeated examination are also considered significant. The <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> (TP) of blood may also be measured, as an aid in estimating the amount of protein loss into the intestine. Its value must be interpreted along with the PCV, {{to take into account the}} hydration status. When laboratory tests are not available, hydration can be crudely assessed by tenting the skin of the neck or eyelid, looking for sunken eyes, depression, high heart rate, and feeling for tackiness of the gums. Jugular filling and quality of the peripheral pulses can be used to approximate blood pressure. Capillary refill time (CRT) may be decreased early in the colic, but generally prolongs as the disease progresses and cardiovascular status worsens.|$|E
25|$|That Start transit {{requires}} {{the attainment of}} a threshold cell size directly implies that yeast cells measure their own size, {{so that they can}} use that information to regulate Start. A favored model for how yeast cells, as well as cells of other species, measure their size relies on the detection of overall translation rate. Essentially, since cell growth consists, to a great extent, of the synthesis of ribosomes to produce more proteins, the overall rate of protein production should reflect cell size. Thus, a single protein that is produced at a constant rate relative to <b>total</b> <b>protein</b> production capacity will be produced in higher quantities as the cell grows. If this protein promotes cell cycle progression (Start in the case of yeast), then it will link cell cycle progression to translation rate and, therefore, cell size. Importantly, this protein must be unstable, so that its levels depend on its current translation rate, rather than the rate of translation over time. Furthermore, since the cell grows in volume as well as mass, the concentration of this size sensor will remain constant with growth, so its activity must be compared against something that does not change with cell growth. Genomic DNA was suggested as such a standard early on, because it is (by definition) present in a constant quantity until the start of DNA replication. How this occurs remains a major question in current studies of size control (see below).|$|E
