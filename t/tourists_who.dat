5|$|In 1976 Vainio's Jawohl, jawohl from Kansi kiinni ja kuulemiin ("Shut the Lid and Goodbye") {{was criticized}} for its {{commentary}} about German <b>tourists</b> <b>who</b> visit Lapland. The album also featured a sensitive song, Mä uskon huomispäivään ("I Believe in Tomorrow"). Other well-known songs from the album are Playboy 60 v ("Playboy 60 yrs"), Suomi–Ruotsi ("Finland–Sweden") and Taas lapsuuden maisemiin ("Back Again to Where I Grew Up").|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1927, a {{separate}} restaurant building with place for 700 diners opened. Open only during summer until September, it {{was aimed at}} cruise ship <b>tourists</b> <b>who</b> took the line from Åndalsnes to Bjorli. Operated by Norsk Spisevognselskap, it was highly profitable. However, during the German occupation of Norway in 1940, the building was bombed and burnt down, and was never rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|The major {{legitimate}} businesses on the island, such as {{banking and}} hotels, {{were able to}} thrive {{in large part because}} of the illegal activities. Though many of these business leaders steered clear of direct involvement in the business affairs of the Maceos and the gangs, their relationships were hardly antagonistic. Some, such as financier, hotelier, and insurance executive William Lewis Moody, Jr., actually welcomed illegal gambling because it brought <b>tourists</b> <b>who</b> filled up his hotels. He was even known to make loans to the Maceos' syndicate.|$|E
5|$|By the {{day after}} Hurricane Lane made landfall, most of the {{evacuated}} people returned to their homes to begin the cleanup process. Some <b>tourists</b> <b>who</b> remained {{in the area for}} the storm continued their vacations, while others tried to leave the area. The federal government {{declared a state of emergency}} for nine municipalities in Sinaloa, allowing emergency funds to give relief support to the affected population. Helicopters were used to distribute foods and locate cut-off residents. The government set up three temporary shelters in Mazatlán for 360people and three shelters in Culiacán for about 1,000affected residents. To prevent the spread of Dengue fever, officials sent epidemiologists to 67communities, with 18mobile units and 15Nebulizer units. By a month after the storm, all roads and highways affected by the hurricane were open for transportation.|$|E
5|$|Keate was {{followed}} by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight, 1790). Sotheby's view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of Richard Harris Barham's Ingoldsby Legends (1847) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes fun at the medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun {{in one of the}} vaults and ensuring God’s revenge upon them) and the <b>tourists</b> <b>who</b> crowded contemporary Netley, {{while at the same time}} showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins.|$|E

5|$|The Hotel Polen fire {{occurred}} on 9 May 1977 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The conflagration destroyed the Hotel Polen (Hotel Poland), a five-story {{hotel in the}} centre of the city which had been built in 1891, as well as the furniture store on the ground level and a nearby bookstore. Many of the <b>tourists</b> <b>who</b> stayed at the hotel (of whom the majority were Swedes) jumped to their deaths trying to escape the flames. Upon their arrival, the fire department used a life net to help people escape, but not everyone could be saved. The incident resulted in 33 deaths and 21 severe injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming {{has traditionally been}} the focus of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, as well as the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of <b>tourists,</b> <b>who</b> play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales has struggled to develop or attract high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E
