5|$|For Dominion of the Dark Djinn, the {{development}} <b>team</b> <b>found</b> that the Nintendo DS was {{best suited to}} the game's development. Alongside the launch of Dominion of the Dark Djinn on December 9, 2010, Level-5 also launched {{the first chapter of}} Hotroit Stories, titled , for mobile devices via the Roid service. Wrath of the White Witch was developed for the PlayStation 3. The team planned to bring the game to the console from the beginning of development, but opted to work on the DS version of the game beforehand due to the larger number of DS users in Japan at the time. The <b>team</b> <b>found</b> they could render the game world with great detail, using the hardware to its full potential to present the animation, world and music. Hino felt that the PlayStation 3 version allowed the game's music to accompany the imagery, which was not possible on the DS version.|$|E

5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the <b>team</b> <b>found</b> that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Chelsea {{at home in}} {{the first}} weekend of October. The <b>team</b> <b>found</b> themselves two goals down after 20 minutes, but a converted Dixon penalty and goals from Wright and Campbell turned the score around in their favour. Arsenal came away from Old Trafford with a point against league leaders Manchester United on 19 October 1991. After a midweek European football match, Arsenal beat Notts County by two goals, a result which moved them fourth in the table.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>team</b> <b>found</b> {{success on}} special teams as well. Cincinnati punter Kevin Huber, a first-team All-American, kicked the ball four times, {{averaging}} 45.8 yards per punt. A 56-yard punt {{in the first quarter}} marked the ninth consecutive game he had a kick of at least 50 yards. Virginia Tech placekicker Dustin Keys missed his first field goal attempt of the game but successfully converted his next two kicks, giving him 23 field goals and the Tech single-season record in that category.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, an Apple II {{software}} cracker <b>team</b> <b>found</b> an Easter egg {{hidden by}} the game's creator 33 years prior. Cook had hidden a secret congratulations screen in the game for players who entered a specific keyboard key combination at a specific time and solved the resulting series of substitution ciphered clues. Cook congratulated the cracker team on Twitter. The crackers found the secret while working to preserve the game for the Internet Archive by removing its digital copyright protections. One of the crackers said that while most 1980s games could be cracked by automation, Gumball protections, coded by Roland Gustafsson, were exceptional.|$|E
5|$|Level-5 {{worked with}} {{localization}} company Shloc to translate Wrath of the White Witch for Western regions; the two studios collaborated for many weeks. The <b>team</b> <b>found</b> great difficulty when localizing {{the game for}} Western regions, particularly due to the large amounts of text and audio that required translation. Other {{minor changes to the}} artwork and animation also occurred, such as making Oliver bow in a Western manner. By December 12, 2012, development on the localized version of Wrath of the White Witch stopped as the game was submitted for manufacturing. It was released in North America on January 22, 2013, in Australia on January 31, and in Europe on February 1.|$|E

5|$|Spedding {{recruited}} two chemistry {{professors at}} Ames for his group there, Harley Wilhelm and I. B. Johns. Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking for}} ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was produced {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. The Ames <b>team</b> <b>found</b> that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
5|$|The 60Co {{source was}} {{transferred}} for storage at the OAEP headquarters. Subsequent surveys found radiation in the scrapyard to {{have returned to}} normal background levels. During the same time, the OAEP was informed of the three teletherapy units in the car park, and a separate investigating <b>team</b> <b>found</b> one of the units to have had its drawer assembly missing. This was confirmed to be {{the origin of the}} source, and the three units were removed for temporary storage on 21 February.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Tess was {{originally intended to}} be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the <b>team</b> <b>found</b> it {{difficult to believe that}} Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story. Actress Annie Wersching was impressed by the script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write his own story.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphics}} for the game's {{characters are}} cel-shaded, and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle {{that the camera}} views them from, in order to recreate the 2D, hand-drawn look seen in the show. The development <b>team</b> <b>found</b> it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment. The Wii version has lower-quality graphics than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions due to the console's inferior hardware. There is a different cover for the game on each console.|$|E
5|$|Though Ellie was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} Joel's daughter, the <b>team</b> <b>found</b> this to be too limiting in terms of further character development. The team chose Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson to portray Joel and Ellie, respectively. Providing both the voice and motion capture of the characters, Baker and Johnson assisted the team to develop the characters and help refine the story. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the central focus of the game, and all other elements were developed around it. Various other characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision.|$|E
5|$|While writing The Last of Us, Druckmann had {{a general}} {{idea of the}} events that would shape Ellie's identity; when conceiving the story {{direction}} for Left Behind, he found that these events were suitable. Druckmann felt that omitting the nature of the argument between Ellie and Riley, which took place prior to the events of the game, allowed players to draw their own conclusions. The <b>team</b> <b>found</b> various sections of the game interesting, such as the references to Facebook and Halloween, as the characters are unaware of their meaning.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his <b>team</b> <b>found</b> that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the <b>team</b> <b>found</b> it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The <b>team</b> <b>found</b> difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E
