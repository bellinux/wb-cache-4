25|$|The first Literary Olympics poetry {{anthology}} {{was published}} in 1984 {{to coincide with the}} Games of the XXIII Olympiad held in Los Angeles, and included the work of poets from nine countries. The publication of the second anthology, to coincide with the 1988 Olympic Games held in Seoul, South Korea, grew to represent more than 30 nations. By 1992, coinciding with the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, the Literary Olympics anthology had grown to represent 132 poets from 65 countries and 55 languages. These anthologies shared the intent to recognize and to honor the creative work of the world's leading poets in a way <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> to the original spirit of the Greek Olympic Games. Each volume {{was published in}} a multi-language format, with non-English poems translated into English by well-qualified poetry translators.|$|E

60|$|Now such an {{argument}} {{is not hard}} to follow; and if it <b>is</b> granted <b>that</b> its premisses <b>are</b> <b>true</b> in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion must also <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose it known <b>that</b> if this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> Suppose it also known <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then it follows <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true.' When it <b>is</b> the case <b>that</b> if this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> we shall say that this 'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle states that if this implies <b>that,</b> and this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> In other words, 'anything implied by a <b>true</b> proposition <b>is</b> true', or 'whatever follows from a <b>true</b> proposition <b>is</b> true'.|$|R

Gregory to center. [...] He also brought Willie Heston {{with him from}} California at the halfback position. In a 1952 letter, Heston later recalled: [...] "He brought to Michigan an entirely new brand of football, not known in the Big Ten nor to the Middle West.

Maes adds that, like them, he wanted to produce music that reflected Russian national character but which did so to the highest European standards of quality. Tchaikovsky, according to Maes, came along {{at a time when}} the nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was. Like his country, Maes writes, it took him time to discover how to express his Russianness in a way <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> to himself and what he had learned. Because of his professionalism, Maes says, he worked hard at this goal and succeeded. The composer's friend, music critic Hermann Laroche, wrote of The Sleeping Beauty that the score contained [...] "an element deeper and more general than color, in the internal structure of the music, above all in the foundation of the element of melody. This basic element is undoubtedly Russian." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> {{to the story}} as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{paradox is}} called a {{statement}} which <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and false in the same time.

500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only thing <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> was she nicked stuff from the shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000.
