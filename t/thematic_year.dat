Materials and Methods: Descriptive analytic study on publications registered in Medline/PubMed, EBSCO and EMBASE from 2005 to 2013, 97 related documents were selected and classified into, eight common vari­ables for its study and were analyzed according to the article distribution by <b>thematic</b> core, <b>year</b> of publication and database.

Conclu­sions: Literature recognizes that elements related to family and their immediate environments are essential to ensure participation and independence of people with aphasia. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) should become the rehabilitation log for professionals to guide therapeutic actions, aimed at the inclusion and participation of people with aphasia in different contexts, and mainly to promote a successful return to a productive daily life.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to identify the}} content of tobacco industry smokers' rights publications and to analyze their major themes. METHODS: Fifty-eight issues of smokers' rights publications from 1987 to 1992 were selected at random and analyzed. The number of publications per year, number of mentions (sentences) in different <b>thematic</b> categories per <b>year,</b> and number of mentions per category per publication were examined. RESULTS: The number of smokers' rights publications increased rapidly from 1987 to 1992.

Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews, which were undertaken at discharge and 4 – 6 weeks post discharge.

40|$|Previous {{research}} into young people’s drinking behaviour has studied how social practices influence {{their actions and}} how they negotiate drinking-related identities. Here, adopting the perspective of discursive psychology we examine how, for young people, social influences are bound up with issues of drinking and of identity. We conducted 19 focus groups with undergraduate students in Australia aged between 18 and 24 <b>years.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis of participants’ accounts for why they drink or do not drink was used to identify passages of talk that referred to social influence, paying particular attention to terms such as ‘pressure’ and ‘choice’. These passages were then analysed in fine-grained detail, using discourse analysis, to study how participants accounted for social influence. Participants treated their behaviour as accountable and produced three forms of account that: (1) minimised the choice available to them, (2) explained drinking as culture and (3) described resisting peer pressure. They also negotiated gendered social dynamics related to drinking. These forms of account allowed the participants to avoid individual responsibility for drinking or not drinking. These findings demonstrate {{that the effects of}} social influence on young people’s drinking behaviour cannot be assumed, as social influence itself becomes negotiable within local contexts of talk about drinking. © 2015 Taylor & Franci...|$|R

Methods: A mixed method pre and post study of Year 1 (n = 140) and Year 2 (n = 88) medical students completing a 7 week MBSR course compared student satisfaction ratings.

Since the detailed etiology is unknown, the geographical distribution of defects might suggest likely risk factors. METHODS : The geographical distribution of 5 865 Saudi Arabian nationals with CHD was studied by cross-matching their residential provinces and towns with a geographical information system provided by the General Directorate for Military Survey. Population data {{were obtained from the}} 1413 H census.

Such debates {{tend to focus on}} the role of national leadership in shaping responses to the epidemic, with little attention to local leaders. Yet many of the settings in which HIV/AIDS flourishes are geographically distant from the reach of national leadership and policies. Furthermore local leaders often {{play a key role in}} shaping how national policies and decisions are interpreted and implemented in local areas. Against this background, we present a case study of the impact of the leadership style of a traditional chief on a community-based AIDS programme in a South African rural community, which sought to build community-level 'AIDS competence', using the 'empowerment via participation' approach. The case study involved 134 interviews and 57 focus-groups conducted over three <b>years.</b> <b>Thematic</b> content analysis revealed a number of direct and indirect ways in which his leadership style impacted on project outcomes.

Three focus groups {{were conducted in}} Hindi language with South Asian {{immigrant women}} in Toronto. Twenty-two women participated {{with a mean age}} of 46 years (range 29 - 68 <b>years).</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis was conducted on the transcribed data using constant comparison techniques within and across the groups. We found that three major themes emerged from the discussions: reasons for delayed help-seeking, turning points and talking to professionals. Women expressed delaying help-seeking to the point when "Pani sar se guzar jata he" (water crosses over your head). Their dominant reasons for delayed help-seeking were social stigma, rigid gender roles, marriage obligations, expected silence, loss of social support after migration and limited knowledge about available resources and myths about partner abuse. Women usually turned for help only after experiencing pronounced mental and physical health problems. The findings are interpreted in light of participants' immigration context and the socio-cultural norms of patriarchy, collectivism and familism. Prevention approaches to address partner abuse and delayed help-seeking among South Asian immigrant women should include tailored community education, social services to reduce vulnerability, and cultural competency of professionals. Further research and program evaluation is needed to advance the field. Partner abuse Women South Asian Immigrant Help-seeking Canada...|$|R

The present study was set out to examine practices, attitudes and experiences of CF including the introduction of vegetables amongst French mothers (n = 18, 25 - 39 <b>years).</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis of transcribed focus groups and interviews revealed the perceived importance of the weaning period, as a critical milestone for infants' development but {{with a sense of}} "now or never" for introducing new tastes including vegetables. Flavour exposure and taste discovery during weaning were identified as the beginning of a "taste journey", in which educating the palate with a variety of different foods was considered important for children's later eating habits. Weaning was described as emotional and complex, a transition period in which the baby makes progress away from milk towards the family diet and which goes beyond mere nutrition. Advice was sought from official sources, but adapted to the needs of infants. In agreement with earlier observations of French adults, pleasure and taste development were considered of primary importance.

40|$|Introduction: Retirement {{from work}} is a signiﬁcant life event in Australia. With the baby boomer {{population}} entering retirement, an ageing population and the diversity in the work-to-retirement process, {{there is a need}} to better understand this occupational transition. Enabling active ageing within the retirement process will become increasingly important, as choices need to be made to facilitate changes in lifestyle post work. Aim: This review aimed to identify occupational therapy’s contribution to the work-to-retirement transition process in Australia. Methods: A literature review was undertaken through database searches in August 2014. Inclusion criteria included peer reviewed studies on the contribution of occupational therapy to the work-to-retirement transition process in Australia published in the past 20 <b>years.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis was conducted to determine the relationship of study ﬁndings to an occupational perspective and the role of occupational therapists in clinical practice. The McMaster critical appraisal tools were utilised to determine methodological quality. Results: Eight qualitative studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identiﬁed. No articles on current occupational therapy clinical practice were found. Preliminary themes identiﬁed include: occupational identity, occupational roles and occupational adaptation related to the occupational perspective; and retirement planning and implementation related to the potential occupational therapy role. Preliminary critical analysis ﬁndings include generalisability and data saturation limitations. Conclusion: Occupational therapy’s focus on occupation can assist in understanding the work-to-retirement transition process experience. Occupationaltherapy is well placed to establish a clinical role in facilitating the retirement transition to support a healthy ageing population...|$|R
