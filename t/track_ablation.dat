40|$|Local tumor {{progression}} (LTP) is {{a serious}} complication after local ablation of malignant liver tumors, negatively influencing patient survival. LTP {{may be the result}} of incomplete ablation of the treated tumor. In this study, we determined whether viable tumor cells attached to the needle applicator after ablation was associated with LTP and disease-free survival. In this prospective study, tissue was collected of 96 consecutive patients who underwent local liver ablations for 130 liver malignancies. Cells and tissue attached to the needle applicators were analyzed for viability using glucose- 6 -phosphate-dehydrogenase staining and autofluorescence intensity levels of H&E stained sections. Patients were followed-up until disease progression. Viable tumor cells were found on the needle applicators after local ablation in 26. 7 % of patients. The type of needle applicator used, an open approach, and the omission of <b>track</b> <b>ablation</b> were significantly correlated with viable tumor tissue adherent to the needle applicator. The presence of viable cells was an independent predictor of LTP. The attachment of viable cells to the needle applicators was associated with a shorter time to LTP. Viable tumor cells adherent to the needle applicators were found after ablation of 26. 7 % of patients. An independent risk factor for viable cells adherent to the needle applicators is the omission of <b>track</b> <b>ablation.</b> We recommend using only RFA devices that have <b>track</b> <b>ablation</b> functionality.

30|$|In general, {{virtually}} any solid tumour in a location suitable for percutaneous ablation {{can be treated}} with cryoablation. Hypervascular tumours, however, are likely not good candidates for cryoablation, as iceball formation is limited due to the cold sink effect, {{and the use of}} multiple probes carries a greater risk of vascular complications such as bleeding and arteriovenous fistula. In such cases, heat-based ablation may be more suitable, as the vessels are occluded during heating and <b>track</b> <b>ablation.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audience: Signals such as Complex Fractionated Atrial Electrograms (CFAE) are <b>tracked</b> during <b>ablation</b> {{procedures}} {{to locate the}} arrhythmical substrate regions. Most of CFAE classification tools use fractionation indexes. However, recordings from intracardiac catheter depend on electrode contact quality. This paper investigates the impact of electrode contact area on fractionation indexes. It is assessed through three kinds of arrhythmical activations resulting from a numerical simulation of {{a small piece of}} the cardiac tissue. Bipolar electrograms are extracted corresponding to 25 different contact areas and fractionation indexes (Shannon entropy, non linear energy operator and maximum peak ratio) are computed. Results yield that the Shannon entropy offers a good potential discrimination between arrhythmic scenarios and is less sensitive to the electrode contact variation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that radio {{frequency}} (RF) ablation is a simple, safe and potentially effective treatment for selected patients with liver metastases. Despite all recent therapeutic advancements, however, intra-procedural target localization and precise and consistent placement of the tissue ablator device are still unsolved problems. Various imaging modalities, including ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) have been tried as guidance modalities. Transcutaneous US imaging, due to its real-time nature, may be beneficial in many cases, but unfortunately, fails to adequately visualize the tumor in many cases. Intraoperative or laparoscopic US, on the other hand, provides improved visualization and target imaging. This paper describes a system for computer-assisted RF ablation of liver tumors, combining navigational tracking of a conventional imaging ultrasound probe to produce 3 D ultrasound imaging with a <b>tracked</b> RF <b>ablation</b> device supported by a passive mechanical arm and spatially registered to the ultrasound volume...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Local {{recurrence}} and {{needle track}} seeding are serious complications after local ablation for liver malignancies and potentially affect long-term survival. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the incidence of viable tissue adherent to the needle applicators after ablation to gain insight into the possible mechanisms of local recurrence and needle track seeding. Methods: A total of 40 consecutive patients underwent 59 local liver ablations. Cells and tissue attached to the needle applicators were analysed for morphology (HE, PAP and Giemsa staining) and viability (G 6 PD staining). Results: Macroscopic tissue adherence was visible following 31 of the ablative procedures, all with radiofrequency ablation. Four applications were performed percutaneously and 27 during an open procedure. Morphologically intact tumour cells could be identified in 8 patients (20 %), and viable tumour cells in 5 patients (12. 5 %). Morphologically intact tumour cells or viable tumour cells could only be demonstrated when <b>track</b> <b>ablation</b> was not performed. Conclusion: Viable tumour cells adherent to the needle applicators were found in an alarming 12. 5 % of patients after local ablation. We recommend <b>track</b> <b>ablation</b> not only after the procedure but also during any shifting and (re-) positioning to prevent shedding of viable tumour cells during or after ablation.

40|$|Ultrasound-guided {{percutaneous}} radiofrequency (RF) ablation {{has become}} one of the most promising local cancer therapies for both resectable and nonresectable hepatic tumors. Although RF ablation is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of liver tumors, the outcome of treatment can be closely related to the location and shape of the tumors. There may be difficulties with RF ablation of tumors that are adjacent to large vessels or extrahepatic heat-vulnerable organs and tumors in the caudate lobe, possibly resulting in major complications or treatment failure. Thus, a number of strategies have been developed to overcome these challenges, which include artificial ascites, needle <b>track</b> <b>ablation,</b> fusion imaging guidance, parallel targeting, bypass targeting, etc. Operators need to use the right strategy in the right situation to avoid the possibility of complications and incomplete thermal tissue destruction; with the right strategy, RF ablation can be performed successfully, even for hepatic tumors in high-risk locations. This article offers technical strategies that can be used to effectively perform RF ablation as well as to minimize possible complications related to the procedure with representative cases and schematic illustrations...|$|E
30|$|One {{important}} issue with RFA {{is the problem}} of needle-track seeding, which was reported in one study at a rate of 12.5 % [69], although more recent studies show less alarming rates, ranging from 0.9 % to 4 % [70 – 72]. Needle biopsy before treatment, poor differentiation degree of the tumor, subcapsular lesions, patients treated in multiple sessions, and lesions requiring more than one electrode placement were identified as risk factors. Viable tumor cells adherent to the needle applicators were found in 12.5 % of patients after ablation without <b>track</b> <b>ablation</b> [73]. To prevent tumor seeding as well as to create hemostasis, ablation along the access track is recommended. Despite the risk of needle-track seeding, RFA is considered a curative treatment for small HCC lesions, and there is ongoing debate whether RFA could potentially be considered a first option for operable patients with very early stage HCC (BCLC stage 0) [74, 75]. In a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing percutaneous RFA to surgical resection in 180 patients with solitary HCCs < 5  cm in diameter, no differences in overall survival rates and cumulative recurrence-free survival rates were observed [76].|$|E

This two-centre study evaluated a new automatic computed tom-ography (CT) –fluoroscopy overlay system (EP navigatorw, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) and {{the accuracy of}} different registration methods. Methods and results Fifty-six consecutive patients (age: 56 + 14) with symptomatic AF underwent contrast CT of the LA/PV prior to ablation. Three registration methods were evaluated and validated by comparison with LA angiography: (i) catheter registration: the placement of catheters in identifiable anatomical structures; (ii) heart contour: based on aligning the fluoroscopy heart contours and the 3 D-rendered CT volume; and (iii) spine registration: based on automatically aligning the segmented CT spine on fluoroscopy. Computed tomography segmentation was achieved {{in all but one}} patient due to motion arte-facts. The mean duration of segmentation was 10 min and average registration lasted 7 min. Catheter and heart contour registration were highly accurate (discrepancy of 1. 3 + 0. 6 and 0. 3 + 0. 5 mm, respectively) when compared with spine registration (17 + 9 mm, P, 0. 05). The EP navigator was helpful during trans-septal puncture, gave an internal view of the atria and allowed <b>tracking</b> of <b>ablation</b> lesions.

40|$|Pancreatic insulin-producing beta-cells {{have a long}} lifespan, {{such that}} in healthy {{conditions}} they replicate little during a lifetime. Nevertheless, they show increased self-duplication after increased metabolic demand or after injury (that is, beta-cell loss). It is not known whether adult mammals can differentiate (regenerate) new beta-cells after extreme, total beta-cell loss, as in diabetes. This would indicate differentiation from precursors or another heterologous (non-beta-cell) source. Here we show beta-cell regeneration in a transgenic model of diphtheria-toxin-induced acute selective near-total beta-cell ablation. If given insulin, the mice survived and showed beta-cell mass augmentation with time.

40|$|Acute {{pneumothorax}} is {{a frequent}} complication after percutaneous pulmonary radiofrequency (RF) ablation. In this study we present three cases showing delayed development of pneumothorax after pulmonary RF ablation in 34 patients. Our purpose is {{to draw attention to}} this delayed complication and to propose a possible approach to avoid this major complication. These three cases occurred subsequent to 44 CT-guided pulmonary RF ablation procedures (6. 8 %) using either internally cooled or multitined expandable RF electrodes. In two patients, the pneumothorax, being initially absent {{at the end of the}} intervention, developed without symptoms. One of these patients required chest drain placement 32 h after RF ablation, and in the second patient therapy remained conservative. In the third patient, a slight pneumothorax at the end of the intervention gradually increased and led into tension pneumothorax 5 days after ablation procedure. Underlying bronchopleural fistula along the coagulated former electrode track was diagnosed in two patients. In conclusion, delayed development of pneumothorax after pulmonary RF ablation can occur and is probably due to underlying bronchopleural fistula, potentially leading to tension pneumothorax. Patients and interventionalists should be prepared for delayed onset of this complication, and extensive <b>track</b> <b>ablation</b> following pulmonary RF ablation should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Islet {{transplantation}} {{is being}} offered increasingly for selected patients with unstable type 1 diabetes. Per-cutaneous transhepatic portal access avoids {{a need for}} surgery, but is associated with potential risk of bleed-ing. Between 1999 and 2005, we performed 132 percu-taneous transhepatic islet transplants in 67 patients. We encountered bleeding in 18 / 132 cases (13. 6 %). In univariate analysis, the risk of bleeding {{in the absence of}} effective <b>track</b> <b>ablation</b> was associated with an increasing number of procedures (2 nd and 3 rd pro-cedures with an odds ratio (OR) of 9. 5 and 20. 9, re-spectively), platelets count< 150 000 (OR 4. 4), elevated portal pressure (OR 1. 1 per mm Hg rise), heparin dose ≥ 45 U/kg (OR 9. 8) and pre-transplant aspirin (81 mg per day) (OR 2. 6, p = 0. 05). A multivariate analysis further confirmed the cumulative transplant procedure number (p < 0. 001) and heparin dose ≥ 45 U/kg (p = 0. 02) as independent risk factors for bleeding. Effective mechanical sealing of the intrahepatic portal catheter tract with thrombostatic coils and tissue fibrin glue completely prevented bleeding in all subsequent pro-cedures (n = 26, p = 0. 02). We conclude that bleeding after percutaneous islet implantation is an avoidable complication provided the intraparenchymal liver tract is sealed effectively.

Methods: Using in situ hybridization, we characterized the expression of Semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A) {{in the eye and}} its receptor Neuropilin- 1 (Npn- 1) by neural crest cells in the periocular region during cornea development in chick embryos. Migration of neural crest cells into the eye was <b>tracked</b> after lens <b>ablation</b> or inhibition of Sema 3 A in the lens using quail-chick chimera technique and immunohistochemistry. Results: We show that the lens continuously expresses Sema 3 A during cornea development and neural crest cells express Npn- 1 in the periocular region. Interestingly, only the neural crest cells that down regulate Npn- 1 migrate into the eye to form the cornea. We also show that the lens, which immediately underlies the ectoderm, inhibits neural crest migration into the rudimentary eye since lensectomy results in premature migration and malformation of the cornea. Additionally, inhibiting of Sema 3 A signaling in the lens phenocopies lensectomy. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that lens-derived Sema 3 A regulates periocular neural crest migration into the eye and is necessary for the proper formation of the cornea...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) {{is the most}} {{promising}} method to restore vision after cataract surgery. Several new materials, techniques, and patterns have been studied for forming and etching IOLs to improve their optical properties and reduce diffractive aberrations. This study is aimed at investigating the use of ultrashort laser pulses to ablate the surface of PMMA and intraocular lenses, and thus provide an alternative to conventional techniques. Ablation experiments were conducted using various polymer substrates (PMMA samples, hydrophobic acrylic IOL, yellow azo dye doped IOL, and hydrophilic acrylic IOL consist of 25 % H 2 O). The irradiation was performed using 100 fs pulses of 800 nm radiation from a regeneratively amplified Ti:sapphire laser system. We investigated the ablation efficiency and the phenomenology of the ablated patterns by probing the ablation depth using a profilometer. The surface modification was examined using a high resolution optical microscope (IOLs) or atomic force microscope-AFM (PMMA samples). It was found that different polymers exhibited different ablation characteristics, a result that we attribute to the differing optical properties of the materials. In particular, {{it was observed that}} the topography of the <b>ablation</b> <b>tracks</b> created on the hydrophilic intraocular lenses was smoother in comparison to those created on the PMMA and hydrophobic lens.

40|$|Panulirus versicolor, {{otherwise}} known as the painted crayfish, is a palinurid (spiny lobster) that inhabits coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region, including Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) where it forms an esteemed component of the local recreational spearfishery. At present, management strategies for P. versicolor are based solely on precautionary principles, since prior to this study virtually nothing was known about this species. The broad goal of this thesis was therefore to describe the population biology and fishery ecology of P. versicolor on the GBR, thereby providing a framework {{for the development of}} a comprehensive management scheme for this important fishery resource. To quantify the fishery for P. versicolor, teams of spearfishers conducted 135 hr of recreational fishing activities during 12 trips spread across 15 months and seven reefs. It was found that P. versicolor was the second most abundant component of the catch, after common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was estimated to be 0. 155 ± 0. 025 crayfish hr- 1, which is equivalent to one crayfish for each 6. 4 hr of spearfishing. Assuming this CPUE was representative of the recreational spearfishery as a whole, and given 37, 110 hr as the total annual spearfishing effort on the GBR (Henry and Lyle 2003), the total annual catch of P. versicolor was estimated to be 5, 773 ± 928 individuals (8, 660 ± 1, 530 kg). By world standards, this amount is relatively small. However, because this species is highly sought-after and is not abundant anywhere within its distributional range, fishing pressure on P. versicolor in readily accessible areas of the GBR may still be relatively high. Thus, a comprehensive management scheme should be implemented to ensure this species is not over-exploited. Development of a fishery management scheme requires knowledge of a range of population parameters (e. g. abundance, growth, mortality) which can be estimated by mark-recapture techniques. However, it was first necessary to develop a method of tracking individual crayfish in the wild, since most conventional tagging methods are ineffective due to moulting of the exoskeleton. As such, three unconventional <b>tracking</b> methods (<b>ablation,</b> elastomer implants, photographic identification) were evaluated in the field over periods of 6 – 36 months. Ablation proved to be ineffective due to a high incidence of infection and exoskeletal repair. In contrast, elastomer implants and photographic identification were shown to be highly effective (96. 5...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: X-ray fluoroscopically guided cardiac {{electrophysiology}} (EP) {{procedures are}} commonly {{carried out to}} treat patients with arrhythmias. X-ray images have poor soft tissue contrast and, for this reason, overlay of a three-dimensional (3 D) roadmap derived from preprocedural volumetric images {{can be used to}} add anatomical information. It is useful to know the position of the catheter electrodes relative to the cardiac anatomy, for example, to record ablation therapy locations during atrial fibrillation therapy. Also, the electrode positions of the coronary sinus (CS) catheter or lasso catheter can be used for road map motion correction. Methods: In this paper, the authors present a novel unified computational framework for image-based catheter detection and tracking without any user interaction. The proposed framework includes fast blob detection, shape-constrained searching and model-based detection. In addition, catheter tracking methods were designed based on the customized catheter models input from the detection method. Three real-time detection and tracking methods are derived from the computational framework to detect or track the three most common types of catheters in EP procedures: the ablation catheter, the CS catheter, and the lasso catheter. Since the proposed methods use the same blob detection method to extract key information from x-ray images, the ablation, CS, and lasso catheters can be detected and tracked simultaneously in real-time. Results: The catheter detection methods were tested on 105 different clinical fluoroscopy sequences taken from 31 clinical procedures. Two-dimensional (2 D) detection errors of 0. 50 ± 0. 29, 0. 92 ± 0. 61, and 0. 63 ± 0. 45 mm as well as success rates of 99. 4 %, 97. 2 %, and 88. 9 % were achieved for the CS catheter, ablation catheter, and lasso catheter, respectively. With the tracking method, accuracies were increased to 0. 45 ± 0. 28, 0. 64 ± 0. 37, and 0. 53 ± 0. 38 mm and success rates increased to 100 %, 99. 2 %, and 96. 5 % for the CS, ablation, and lasso catheters, respectively. Subjective clinical evaluation by three experienced electrophysiologists showed that the detection and tracking results were clinically acceptable. Conclusions: The proposed detection and tracking methods are automatic and can detect and <b>track</b> CS, <b>ablation,</b> and lasso catheters simultaneously and in real-time. The accuracy of the proposed methods is sub-mm and the methods are robust toward low-dose x-ray fluoroscopic images, which are mainly used during EP procedures to maintain low radiation dose...|$|R
40|$|The Mg/Ca {{temperature}} proxy {{was applied}} {{for the first time}} to seasonality records in calcitic brachiopod shells, using a laser <b>ablation</b> <b>tracking</b> technique on both Recent and fossil material. Seawater temperature calibrations were established using modern Terebratulina retusa from Scottish waters with annual temperature variations ~ 7 °C, and Liothyrella neozelanica from a water depth transect (168 – 1488 m) off New Zealand. Comparison of intra-shell Mg/Ca with shell δ 18 O confirms a temperature control on brachiopod Mg/Ca. Preliminary temperature calibrations are: T. retusa Mg/Ca= 1. 76 ± 0. 27 e(0. 16 ± 0. 03) T, R 2 = 0. 75 L. neozelanica Mg/Ca= 0. 49 ± 1. 27 e(0. 2 ± 0. 11) T, R 2 = 0. 32. The Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT) is the first time during the Cenozoic that Antarctica was permanently glaciated. Mg/Ca and δ 18 O of brachiopod calcite from two New Zealand sites, one Late Eocene and one Early Oligocene, were sampled to assess seasonality over the EOT. Mg/Ca data identify no statistically significant change in seasonality in this area over the EOT. A 1. 3 ‰ positive excursion in δ 18 O is identified: 0. 6 ‰ is attributed to global change in δ 18 Oseawater and 0. 7 ‰ to regional change in δ 18 Oseawater. Surface currents remained the same around New Zealand across the EOT. Summer Mg/Ca seawater temperatures (~ 21 - 24 °C) in New Zealand are similar to temperatures derived from TEX 86 (Site 1172). The Silurian Ireviken Excursion (~ 428 Ma) is a worldwide δ 13 C and δ 18 O isotopic excursion. Atrypa from Gotland, Sweden was sampled from before and after this Llandovery/Wenlock excursion. Mg/Ca and δ 18 O data indicate no significant change in seawater temperature over this excursion, against a shift of 1. 29 ‰ in δ 13 C. Relative temperature changes between summer and winter Mg/Ca suggest seasonality of 3. 5 – 5. 4 °C. Estimated seawater temperature ~ 37 °C agrees with a recent clumped isotope study. High temperatures obtained in another study may be attributable to sampling that incorporated the outer side half of the secondary layer...|$|R
40|$|Special issue The APLABES Programme: Physical, Chemical and Biological Characterization of Deep-Water Coral Ecosystems {{from the}} Ionian Sea (Mediterranean). [...] 16 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, 2 appendixThe aragonitic skeletons of bathyal cold-water corals {{have a high}} {{potential}} as geochemical in situ archives for paleoceanography. Oxygen isotopes and stable carbon isotopes (δ 18 O and δ 13 C) have been analyzed, as well as trace and minor element compositions (e. g. Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, U/Ca, B/Ca and P/Ca) in Lophelia pertusa, {{one of the most}} important frame-builders at the Santa Maria di Leuca (SML) deep-water coral hotspot in the Central Mediterranean. The Apulian Bank is swept by strong currents of the Adriatic Deep Water Outflow. The temperature of 13. 9 °C is the highest temperature recorded for L. pertusa and provides an important end-member of environmental conditions for geochemical analyses on living Atlantic and Mediterranean cold-water corals. Temperature and salinity (38. 77 PSU) are stable throughout the year, and thus virtually no changes should be observed in the stable oxygen isotope signal-if the coral precipitates its skeleton in equilibrium with seawater. We measured various marine properties, such as the seawater oxygen isotope composition (δ 18 Osw), stable carbon isotope composition (δ 13 CDIC) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations (PO 4, NO 3, NO 2, NH 3 and SiO 2). Bottom water at the coral sites shows a mean oxygen isotope composition of 1. 47 ‰ δ 18 Osw-VSMOW, and δ 13 CDIC showed a mean of 1. 1 ‰ VPDB. A section of a living L. pertusa with a thick theca calcification was probed with a Merchantek MicroMill at a high spatial sampling resolution with 10 samples per 1 mm. This reduced the signal-smoothing inherent to conventional sampling. The δ 18 Oag of coral aragonite ranges between - 2. 0 ‰ and + 2. 8 ‰ VPDB and the δ 13 Cag ranges between - 7. 77 ‰ and + 1. 47 ‰ VPDB. The Gaussian data distribution for both parameters, including heavy equilibrium values, suggests the completeness of the captured isotopic variability. The strict linear correlation of δ 13 C and δ 18 O displays a strong 'kinetic' vital effect. The intercept of the δ 13 C/δ 18 O correlation line with the δ 13 CDIC-composition permits recognition of δ 18 O equilibrium values of aragonite and thus reconstruction of water temperatures despite strong disequilibrium precipitation. Since the environmental parameters (T, S and δ 18 Osw) are stable, the entire isotopic signal of the coral must be driven by biological fractionation and might reflect growth speed variations, potentially related to pH variations and changes in the saturation state of the calcifying fluid or seasonally varying nutrient availability. Laser <b>ablation</b> <b>tracks</b> show a trace element composition dependent to microstructural zones (fibrous aragonite vs. centres of calcification). The parabolic relation of the classical temperature proxies Mg/Ca and U/Ca point to trace element vital effects, rendering them unreliable in L. pertusa. The P/Ca ratio shows similar values as Desmophyllum dianthus, for which a linear dependence with seawater phosphate (DIP) has been previously demonstrated. Consequently L. pertusa might be an additional nutrient recorder at bathyal depths. From the same site we also analysed the stable isotopic composition of the Last Glacial pectinid bivalve Pseudamussium peslutrae, which has been radiocarbon-dated (AMS- 14 C) at 26. 3 ka 14 C yr BP.
