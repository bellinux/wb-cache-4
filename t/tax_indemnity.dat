5000|$|Kinsella {{is alleged}} to have been {{involved}} in entering the $505 million BC Rail <b>tax</b> <b>indemnity</b> (refund) on the books at 255 million.|$|E
50|$|The sale of BC Rail {{involved}} a <b>tax</b> <b>indemnity.</b> This was structured {{so that if}} CN {{would not have been}} refunded $415 million from the Federal Government, then the Province would be required to return this amount to CN. This had the effect of reducing the sale price of BC Rail from $1.05 billion to under $500 million, thereby in essence short-changing taxpayers more than $550 million. (This is in addition to $750 million cash payments and $250 million in direct tax credits, as noted in the section on Patrick Kinsella below.) The BC Rail <b>tax</b> <b>indemnity</b> was taken off the Public Accounts in January 2005, before the May 2005 election, when it was reclassified a contingent liability.|$|E
5000|$|The sale of BC Rail {{included}} a $505 million BC Rail <b>tax</b> <b>indemnity</b> {{on top of}} $750 million cash and $250 million in direct tax credits.

25|$|Mullan did {{not just}} work on land claims. He acted as each state's agent {{on a wide}} variety of issues, {{including}} reimbursement for state expenditures during Indian wars, federal payments to volunteer soldiers during the Civil War, <b>tax</b> overpayments, and <b>indemnities</b> for state underpayments to the federal government. In time, he acted as a kind of lawyer-ambassador, drafting petitions to be presented to Congress and lobbying federal officials. Although Mullan managed to win small settlements for his clients, giving him a solid income, Mullan lived far beyond his means—getting credit and spending money in anticipation of the major payday which awaited him if he could secure the California public lands payment.|$|R
40|$|In the {{broadest}} sense, {{this is an}} article about legal or regulatory uncertainty and the role that private and public insurance can play in managing it. More narrowly, the article is about tax law enforcement and the familiar if ill-defined distinctions between tax evasion, tax avoidance, and abusive tax avoidance. Most specifically, the article is about {{a new type of}} tax risk insurance policy, sometimes called <b>tax</b> <b>indemnity</b> insurance or transactional tax risk insurance that provides coverage against the risk that the Internal Revenue Service (Service) will disallow a taxpayer-insured 2 ̆ 7 s tax treatment of a particular transaction. The question is whether this type of insurance coverage increases incentives for illegitimate tax avoidance or, alternatively, provides needed certainty to taxpayers - certainty that the Service is not able or willing to provide. Should tax insurance be banned? Encouraged? Ignored? To what extent should the government, instead of commercial insurance companies, provide such legal uncertainty insurance directly, either by increasing the use of private rulings or by selling the equivalent of <b>tax</b> <b>indemnity</b> insurance policies? On the question of commercially provided <b>tax</b> <b>indemnity</b> insurance, the article concludes that the appropriate regulatory response is probably (a) to allow the purchase of policies (and perhaps in some situations to subsidize their purchase) but (b) to compel taxpayers who purchase such policies to disclose this fact to the Service. Such a response allows the use of tax risk insurance as a supplement to private letter rulings {{while at the same time}} minimizing the possibility that the insurance will be sold to cover pure 2 ̆ 2 detection risk. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|Uncertainty {{about tax}} results is an ever-present {{obstacle}} to business transactions despite the extensive number of Internal Revenue Code sections and Treasury Regulations. Some insurance companies now provide an insurance product to protect taxpayers against adverse tax consequences from proposed transactions. Ironically, this new insurance product, labeled “tax insurance,” poses uncertain tax consequences itself This Article argues {{that if the}} adverse tax consequences arise (that is, the taxpayer has additional tax liability) and the insurance company is contractually required to cover that liability, the tax insurance proceeds are not includable in the insured’s gross income. As part of the reasoning that underlies this conclusion concerning tax insurance, the Article examines and develops a novel approach that provides a tax policy justification for excluding general liability insurance proceeds from the insured’s income. The Article concludes that the same justification also applies to exclude tax insurance proceeds from the insured’s gross income. The Article also examines whether the premiums paid for tax insurance coverage are deductible business expenses. Finally, the Article examines the appropriate tax treatment {{of other types of}} <b>tax</b> <b>indemnity</b> arrangements...|$|E
