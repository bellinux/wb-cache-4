5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E

5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
5|$|Town Hall (set number 10224) was {{released}} in March 2012 and is the seventh set in the Modular Building line. The set contains 2766 pieces and is recommended for builders 14 and over. It was the largest modular set, taking the title from the Green Grocer. It contains many interior details, such as a working elevator, along with board tables and balconies <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor below. Along with the interior details the set also has many exterior details, such as four pillars on the front step and windows {{at the back of}} the building, and also a clock tower at the top of the building. The date on the building, 1891 represents the birth year of the founder of LEGO and when reversed, it's the birth year of the designer, Astrid (1981). The set was priced at £149.99, $199.99 or €179.99 as released by LEGO on February 16, 2012. There are eight minifigures in the set with a wedding couple. The set had a global discontinuation date of 31 December 2014 and had a much shorter lifespan than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} Standing’s murder lived {{on in the}} life of Rudger Clawson. In 1898, Clawson was {{appointed}} to the church’s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the second highest ecclesiastical body in the church, a position he held until his death in 1943. Clawson’s high profile life in Utah, and among Mormons generally, gave opportunity for commentators <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> events in his life that may have shaped his faith in a God and his commitment to the church. He was regularly asked {{to tell the story of}} Standing’s death, and references were made to the event by church leaders in conferences of the church for decades. The story of Rudger Clawson can not be separated from the story of Standing.|$|E
25|$|The Babylonian Jews {{wanted to}} fight in common cause with their Judean brethren against Vespasian; {{but it was not}} until the Romans waged war under Trajan against Parthia that they acted. To a large extent, the revolt of the Babylonian Jews meant that the Romans did not become masters of Babylonia. Philo speaks of the large number of Jews {{resident}} in that country, a population which was no doubt considerably swelled by new immigrants after the destruction of Jerusalem. Accustomed in Jerusalem from early times <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East for help, and aware, as the Roman procurator Petronius was, that the Jews of Babylon could render effectual assistance, Babylonia became with the fall of Jerusalem the very bulwark of Judaism. The collapse of the Bar Kochba revolt no doubt added to the number of Jewish refugees in Babylon.|$|E

50|$|Temporal {{perspective}} explains crying slightly differently. In temporal perspective, sorrowful crying is due <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{past with}} regret or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future with dread. This illustrated crying {{as a result}} of losing someone and regretting not spending more time with them or being nervous about an upcoming event. Crying {{as a result of}} happiness would then be a response to a moment as if it is eternal; the person is frozen in a blissful, immortalized present.|$|R
25|$|Moltke {{continued}} with the offensive plan, {{after it was}} seen that the enfeeblement of Russian military power had been for a much shorter period than Schlieffen had expected. The substantial revival in Russian military power that began in 1910, would certainly have matured by 1922, making the Tsarist army unbeatable. The end {{of the possibility of}} a short eastern war and the certainty of increasing Russian military power meant that Moltke had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west for a quick victory, before Russian mobilisation had been completed. Speed meant an offensive strategy and made doubts about the possibility of forcing defeat on the French army irrelevant. The only way to avoid becoming bogged down in the French fortress zones, was by a flanking move into terrain where open warfare was possible, where the German army could continue to practice Bewegungskrieg (war of manoeuvre). Moltke (the Younger) used the assassination of Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914, as an excuse to attempt Vernichtungsstrategie against France, before Russian rearmament deprived Germany of any hope of victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1807, the {{legislature}} of the Louisiana Territory passed an updated and expanded Militia Act. The new law had forty-two sections. The maximum age of inhabitants who {{were required to}} serve was reduced from 16–50 to 16–45. Militia officers were now required to wear the same uniform as the United States Army. It increased the frequency that companies were to muster up to 12 times per year, battalions six times, and regiments twice. It created the office of brigade inspector and set the pay of the adjutant general at $150 per year. The procedures for courts martial and the collection of fines and other punishments were significantly expanded; fathers were held liable to pay the fines of sons, up {{to the age of}} 21, who failed to attend muster; officers were required to attend training sessions to be conducted on the Monday before a scheduled muster in order to receive training regarding their duties and on the proper forms of drill. The legislature indicated that where its laws were not detailed enough, militia leaders were <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regulations of Barron Steuben which had been adopted by Congress in 1779.|$|E
25|$|As {{there was}} now nothing the crusaders {{could do in}} Syria, they were forced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south {{if they wanted to}} expand their territory. The capture of Ascalon had already succeeded in cutting off Egypt from Syria, and Egypt had been {{politically}} weakened by a series of very young Fatimid caliphs. By 1163, the caliph was the young al-Adid, but the country was ruled by the vizier Shawar. That year, Shawar was overthrown by Dirgham; soon afterwards, the King of Jerusalem, Amalric I, led an offensive against Egypt, on the pretext that the Fatimids were not paying the tribute they had promised to pay during the reign of Baldwin III. This campaign failed and he was forced to return to Jerusalem, but it provoked Nur ad-Din to lead a campaign of his own against the crusaders in Syria in order to turn their attention away from Egypt. His attack on Tripoli was unsuccessful, but he was soon visited by the exiled Shawar, who begged him to send an army and restore him to the vizierate. Nur ad-Din did not want to spare his own army for a defense of Egypt, but his Kurdish general Shirkuh convinced him to invade in 1164. In response, Dirgham allied with Amalric, but the king could not mobilize in time to save him. Dirgham was killed during Shirkuh's invasion and Shawar was restored as vizier.|$|E

His defense of former PDF soldiers split supporters of the coalition government, and in May 1990, sparked rumors that he and the CDP were attempting a coup while Endara was out of the country.

500|$|Mackenzie left in 1844, and {{although}} he had achieved a great deal, {{the weakness of the}} St Kildans' dependence on external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of Rev. John Mackay. Despite their fondness for Mackenzie, who stayed in the Church of Scotland, the St Kildans [...] "came out" [...] in favour of the new Free Church during the Disruption. Mackay, the new Free Church minister, placed an uncommon emphasis on religious observance. He introduced a routine of three two-to-three-hour services on Sunday at which attendance was effectively compulsory. One visitor noted in 1875 that: [...] "The Sabbath was a day of intolerable gloom. At the clink of the bell the whole flock hurry to Church with sorrowful looks and eyes bent upon the ground.

500|$|This led to Boycott {{being dropped}} from the side and forced to return to England, despite apologising via a note to the England {{dressing}} room. He claimed in his autobiography, however, {{that he went to}} the golf course following medical advice to get fresh air. Later in 1982 he was instrumental in organising, in defiance of a United Nations and a TCCB ban, a so-called [...] "rebel" [...] tour of apartheid South Africa by 13 current and former England Test cricketers, who were almost all nearing the end of their careers. All the players were banned from international cricket for three years as a result. By the mid-1980s, with Boycott in good county form and physical shape, there was speculation that he might return to the England side. David Gower, England captain of the time, stated, however, that [...] "Geoffrey's been a marvellous servant for England but we have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future and, in view of his age, it wouldn't make an awful lot of sense to pick him again." [...] This was confirmed by the return of Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson's 175 against Australia at Leeds, which prompted Botham, who had once remarked that Boycott was [...] "totally, almost insanely, selfish", to sing [...] "Bye-bye Boycott" [...] from the England balcony.|$|E

500|$|The Mongol {{invasion}} of Europe ended in 1242, {{in part because}} of the death of the Great Khan Ögedei, successor to Genghis Khan. When one Great Khan died, Mongols from all parts of the empire were recalled to the capital to decide who should be the next Great Khan. In the meantime, the Mongols' relentless march westward had displaced the Khawarizmi Turks, who themselves moved west, eventually allying with the Ayyubid Muslims in Egypt. Along the way, the Turks took Jerusalem from the Christians in 1244. After the subsequent loss at the Battle of La Forbie, Christian kings began to prepare for a new crusade (the Seventh Crusade), declared by Pope Innocent IV in June 1245 at the First Council of Lyon. The loss of Jerusalem caused some Europeans <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mongols as potential allies of Christendom, provided the Mongols could be converted to Western Christianity. In March 1245, Pope Innocent IV had issued multiple papal bulls, some of which were sent with an envoy, the Franciscan John of Plano Carpini, to the [...] "Emperor of the Tartars". In a letter now called the Cum non solum, Pope Innocent expressed a desire for peace, and asked the Mongol ruler to become a Christian and to stop killing Christians. However, the new Mongol Great Khan Güyük, installed at Karakorum in 1246, replied only with a demand for the submission of the pope, and a visit from the rulers of the West in homage to Mongol power: ...|$|E
