The wolves encounter Quent Yaiden, a former Sheriff of Kyrios who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog Blue. Cheza, the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of Cher Degré. She is awakened by the smell of wolf's blood. As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find her, she is stolen away by Lord Darcia the Third, whose people created Cheza.|$|E
25|$|Fractionation: Through {{the use of}} a {{fractionation}} column, different fractions distilled from {{a material}} can be selectively excluded to modify <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the perfumer more control over their composition process.|$|E
25|$|During the nesting season, {{burrowing}} owls {{will collect}} {{a wide variety}} of materials to line their nest, some of which are left around the entrance to the burrow. The most common material is mammal dung, usually from cattle. At one time it was thought that the dung helped to mask <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> juvenile owls, but researchers now believe the dung helps to control the microclimate inside the burrow and to attract insects, which the owls may eat.|$|E

25|$|Some {{plant species}} co-evolved with a {{particular}} pollinator species, such as the bee orchid. The species is almost exclusively self-pollinating in its northern ranges, but is pollinated by the solitary bee Eucera in the Mediterranean area. The plant attracts these insects by producing a scent that mimics <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female bee. In addition, the lip acts as a decoy, as the male bee confuses it with a female that is visiting a pink flower. Pollen transfer occurs during the ensuing pseudocopulation.|$|E
25|$|Ethyl acetate is used {{primarily}} as a solvent and diluent, being favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, {{it is commonly used}} to clean circuit boards and in some nail varnish removers (acetone and acetonitrile are also used). Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent. It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener. Ethyl acetate is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In perfumes, it evaporates quickly, leaving only <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perfume on the skin.|$|E
25|$|The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), {{a distant}} {{relative}} of the European red fox, is also hunted in North America. It is an adept climber of trees, making it harder to hunt with hounds. <b>The</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gray fox is {{not as strong as}} that of the red, therefore more time is needed for the hounds to take the scent. Unlike the red fox which, during the chase, will run far ahead from the pack, the gray fox will speed toward heavy brush, thus making it more difficult to pursue. Also unlike the red fox, which occurs more prominently in the northern United States, the more southern gray fox is rarely hunted on horseback, due to its densely covered habitat preferences.|$|E

25|$|Nathan of Gaza’s prophecy about Shabbetai Zevi was not {{his only}} mental visualization. On the contrary, as the years passed, he would have many other visions, all of which would aid his {{movement}} and promote the belief in Shabbetai Zevi. His second vision in fact came {{on the evening of}} the Shavu’ot festival in the spring of 1665. Unlike his prophetic awakening, here, Nathan of Gaza was said to have undergone a spiritual possession by a maggid, or a divine spirit. At the moment of this spiritual takeover, he was described as dancing wildly and emitting a special kind of odor. This smell is described in the Zohar and is believed to be associated with <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garden of Eden {{as well as of the}} prophet Elisha and Rabbi Isaac Luria.|$|E
25|$|This {{new version}} of Krypto has all the {{physical}} abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes {{a great deal of}} trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he wanted to go out and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the door with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog's real master. Superman has {{gone to great lengths to}} train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to-eye.|$|E
25|$|From {{this period}} {{there are many}} {{examples}} of formal gardens created for nobles, gentry and lairds. By {{the end of the}} seventeenth century there were at least 141 formal gardens and orchards in Scotland. The gardens of Aberdour Castle were redeveloped along with the building for the regent James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton (c. 1516–81), perhaps as an area for public display. Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries, designed for the entertainment of guests. Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584–1650), planted a herb garden at Seaton House in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century is that at Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?–1610) created an enclosure of Renaissance-style walls, adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him. The change to walled gardens may have been because of a change of attitudes to smells, with the walls helping to intensify <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> herbs and flowers that grew there.|$|E

500|$|Interspecific {{competition}} between the great white shark and the orca is probable in regions where dietary preferences of both species may overlap. An incident was documented on 4 October 1997, in the Farallon Islands off California in the United States. An estimated [...] female orca immobilized an estimated [...] great white shark. The orca held the shark upside down to induce tonic immobility and kept the shark still for fifteen minutes, causing it to suffocate. The orca then proceeded to eat the dead shark's liver. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slain shark's carcass caused all the great whites {{in the region to}} flee, forfeiting an opportunity for a great seasonal feed. Another similar attack apparently occurred there in 2000, but its outcome is not clear. After both attacks, the local population of about 100 great whites vanished. Following the 2000 incident, a great white with a satellite tag was found to have immediately submerged to a depth of [...] and swum to Hawaii. In 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a great white shark off South Australia. In 2017, along the South African coast, four great whites were found washed ashore with their livers removed with what was described as 'surgical precision'. Local scientists claim that pods of orcas in the area were to blame for the attacks.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews.

[...] Helen Bushby from BBC commented that [...] "he book is certainly detailed, and {{will no doubt}} keep Madonna fanatics happy, although it is perhaps more of a reference book than a page-turner. But Morton is a good businessman, and is canny in his choice of subjects." [...] Michael Sneed from Chicago Sun-Times gave a negative review {{of the book and}} felt that Morton's previous works had been better. George Rush from New York Daily News commented: [...] "Despite her best efforts to discourage friends from cooperating with him, Andrew Morton has come forth with a book that portrays Madge as an insecure manipulator so ravenous for affection that she scared off some boyfriends, cheated on most of them and made a lot of foolish choices." [...] In another review, Sherryl Connelly from the same publication was of the opinion that Madonna was mostly similar to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography on her, [...] She added, [...] "At least, it's the story made familiar by Madonna, a woman who has always taken for granted the world's interest in her life." ...|$|E

In June 2013, {{it was announced}} that a limited edition of Heat, titled Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, would be released the same month, inspired by the tour. Speaking about the fragrance, Beyoncé said: [...] "I love my music, I love performing and most of all I love and appreciate my fans. I wanted to give them a special remembrance of this tour and I created this scent to reflect the power, passion and playfulness I put into my performances." [...] The fragrance opens with mangosteen, black pepper and Açaí palm as its top notes and later continues with violet petals, Indian Sambac Jasmine and a Brassia Edua Loo orchid as its middle notes before finishing with bourbon vanilla, Australian sandalwood and vetiver as its base notes.

50|$|Hounding (the method least used today) uses dogs, and {{may include}} a {{fighting}} pack and a tracking pack.

5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations.

Others have developed chemical defences such as <b>the</b> deadly toxins <b>of</b> certain snakes and wasps, or <b>the</b> noxious <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skunk.

Meeting no opposition, Saladin ravaged the countryside of Montreal, whilst Baldwin's forces watched on, refusing to intervene. He arrived in Damascus in June to learn that Farrukh-Shah had attacked the Galilee, sacking Daburiyya and capturing Habis Jaldek, a fortress of great importance to the Crusaders. In July, Saladin dispatched Farrukh-Shah to attack Kawkab al-Hawa. Later, in August, the Ayyubids launched a naval and ground assault to capture Beirut; Saladin led his army in the Bekaa Valley.
