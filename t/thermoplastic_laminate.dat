This paper discusses the influence of the forming pressure and coupler concentration on the mechanical behavior of glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composite laminates. The Design of Experiments’ (DOE) full factorial approach was adopted for conducting the composite laminate fabrication experiments. The <b>thermoplastic</b> composite <b>laminates</b> were fabricated in a hot compression molding machine, using the film stacking technique. This is an innovative approach to develop <b>thermoplastic</b> composite <b>laminates,</b> using the available low cost raw materials, instead of high end prepreg materials.

The Tensile and flexural strengths of the <b>thermoplastic</b> composite <b>laminates</b> were the responses measured to identify the most influencing parameter. The experimental results show that the increase in forming pressure and coupler concentration initially increases both the mechanical properties, and then decreases the properties of the composite laminates.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes an}} efficient process flow for production of one-time deformable electronic devices based on standard circuit board technology and demonstrates multiple devices fabricated using this technique. The described technology {{has the potential}} to streamline and simplify the production of complex user interfaces which typically require extensive mechanical design and many components. The employed technique allows for the production of complex 3 D shapes without the need to modify existing circuit board manufacturing equipment or processes significantly. To achieve this the device is manufactured in a flat state, encapsulated in a thermoplastic polymer laminate and deformed afterwards. This allows the usage of standard electronic components in surface mount packages, which are assembled using lead-free high-temperature solder. The circuit is deformed using a high-volume cost-effective thermoforming approach, where the encapsulating polymer is heated above its glass transition temperature and forced against a mold where it is allowed to cool down again. To enable significant out-of-plane deformations stretchable meandering interconnects are used, which were traditionally developed for dynamically stretchable devices. Fabrication of the circuit starts using a standard flexible copper clad laminate which is processed using the default techniques, the resulting circuit is then attached to a carrier board coated with a reusable high-temperature pressure sensitive adhesive. The interconnect and circuit outline is then defined using laser routing or punching, cutting the flexible circuit without damaging the carrier. The residuals not part of the circuit are removed, in a process akin to protective film removal, and solder paste is stencil printed on the circuit. Afterwards components are placed using a pick-and-place machine and the boards are reflow soldered. After functional testing and repair (if necessary) the circuits are placed in a vacuum press with a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>laminate,</b> consisting of a thermoplastic elastomer and a rigid thermoplastic sheet. During this lamination the components are protected by a highly conforming press pad. Because the adhesion between the elastomer and the circuit far exceeds that between the circuit and the carrier the circuit is released readily as the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>laminate</b> is peeled away. The resulting laminate is built up further using thermoplastic films and sheets, and finally deformed using a vacuum forming machine. The resulting device, which is trimmed to remove the clamping edges, can then be mounted in the final assembly. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated using a series of test vehicles, demonstrating the integration of complex circuits, connectors, and power circuitry. Finally, a series of design considerations that became apparent after initial reliability testing are discussed, together with the resulting design rules...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} technology {{used to produce}} thermoplastically deformable electronics, based on flexible circuit board technology, to achieve low-cost 2. 5 D free-form rigid smart objects. These one-time deformable circuits employ {{a modified version of}} the previously developed meander-based “polymer-last” technology for dynamically stretchable elastic circuits. This is readily achieved by substituting the dynamically stretchable elastomeric materials (e. g. silicone) with thermoplastic polymers (e. g. polycarbonate). Afterwards the circuit is given its final form using widely available thermoforming techniques, such as vacuum forming, where the material is heated above its glass transition temperature and drawn against a forming tool by a strong vacuum. After cooling down the thermoplastic retains its shape without inducing large internal stresses. The presented method allows for the production of these circuits on a flat substrate, using standard printed circuit board production equipment, with deformation only taking place afterwards; eliminating the need for large investments and reducing the cost of fabrication. Potential advantages over competitive methods are reductions in weight and material usage, decrease of mechanical complexity; lower tooling cost, increased resilience, and a higher degree of manufacturer independence due to adhering to standard industrial practices. This is realized by starting production from a flexible circuit board, manufactured by an industrial supplier using polyimide flexible copper clad laminate, which is attached to a temporary reusable carrier board through means of a silicone based high-temperature pressure sensitive adhesive. Through selective laser structuring the meander and island outlines of the flexible circuit are defined, without causing damage to the carrier board or pressure sensitive adhesive. After removing the residual material the circuit is assembled using high-temperature lead-free solder, made possible by the temporary carrier keeping the circuit in place at these elevated temperatures. The circuit is then transferred into a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>laminate,</b> which is deformed into its final shape. After demonstrating the need for stretchable electronics for this application, this contribution describes the method used to design, fabricate, and test the first one-time deformable circuits manufactured using the presented technology. Using the initial set of observations a series of preliminary design rules is established, both for the circuit and choice of materials. The feasibility of this manufacturing method was then demonstrated through a small scale production run using lab scale equipment, where a large quantity of high power LEDs was integrated into a one-time deformable device made out of polystyrene and thermoplastic polyurethane. These devices were then tested by exposing them to real world conditions for several days...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Instrumented drop weight {{impact testing}} {{has been used}} to study the impact {{performance}} of fiber reinforced polymer composites. Deformation processes and fracture mechanisms of thin-plate composite laminates were examined as a function of material parameters, plate thickness, stacking sequence, and impact loading rate. For the lami-nates containing tough fibers, such as high-strength polyethylene, plastic deformation was found to be an important energy absorbing mechanism. High flexibility of these fibers allows the incident energy to be dispersed in a wider area and the impact load to be shared by a greater volume of material. A clean penetration crack was observed in the samples that contain primarily brittle fibers, such as graphite. This failure mode absorbed very lit-tle incident energy. In addition, both matrix-fiber interfacial debonding and interlaminar cracking were shown to be effective in dissipating impact energy. Mechanistic study in-dicated that the impact response of the laminates can be described by an initial stage of elastic deformation, followed by three stages of plastic deformation.
