5|$|The {{transfer}} of {{the headquarters of the}} Company's power to Bombay largely eliminated <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Deputy Governor. In spite of the change, the title continued to be borne by the second member of the Executive Council of the Governor. It fell into disuse sometime between 1720 and 1758.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E
25|$|The role of Reverend Paul Coates {{was written}} with actor Arthur Darvill {{in mind and}} was the first role cast. The role of DS Ellie Miller was second, as actress Olivia Colman was Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and the role was offered to her without <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audition. DI Alec Hardy was the third role cast, and the part was offered to David Tennant without <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audition.|$|R

5|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} locating {{the site of}} a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak without <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E
5|$|An {{impression}} of the Great Seal of a state (or its coat of arms) has long been required on official documents ranging from deeds to legislative acts. It was the emblem that certified the authenticity of a given document or that {{the authority of the}} state was invested in said document. Judicial decisions upheld <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> valid seal and/or coat of arms on notarized documents.|$|E
5|$|Anti-vivisectionists {{commissioned}} a bronze {{statue of the}} dog as a memorial, unveiled on the Latchmere Recreation Ground in Battersea in 1906, but medical students were angered by its provocative plaque—"Men and women of England, how long shall these Things be?"—leading to frequent vandalism of the memorial and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 24-hour police guard against the so-called anti-doggers. On 10 December 1907, 1,000 medical students marched through central London waving effigies of the brown dog on sticks, clashing with suffragettes, trade unionists and 400 police officers, {{one of a series}} of battles known as the Brown Dog riots.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{possibility}} of a low work-function material, calcium aluminate electride, being used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> coating on a bare electrodynamic tether system. Analyses suggest that the coating would eliminate <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> active cathodic device like a hollow cathode and, consequently, eliminate <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> expellant to <b>the</b> hollow cathode, thus resulting in an electrodynamic tether system that requires no consumables. Applications include on-orbit power generation and deorbiting debris from low Earth orbit in a simple and trouble-free manner...|$|R

5|$|As Bristol {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new station to serve the outskirts grew, and on 29 August 1927, the Great Western Railway opened a station at Parson Street, named Parson Street Halt. There were two platforms, {{one on each side}} of the two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms were made of wood, with access from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, {{due to the}} proximity {{to the entrance of}} Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Burnside, {{against the}} advice of the president, prematurely {{launched}} an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk about <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> military dictatorship.|$|E

5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble stems from <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several {{of the most successful}} catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E
5|$|Crucibles used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> crucible.|$|E
