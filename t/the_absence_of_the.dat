5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Halo 4s {{music and}} the soundtrack was generally positive.

5|$|During the 1950s more {{dangerous}} criminal elements {{took advantage of}} Galveston's lax law enforcement and <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maceo brothers' influence.

5|$|In 1659, {{shortly before}} the {{restoration}} of the monarchy, the Protector's Council was abolished.

5|$|Abandoned or rebellious villages were {{destroyed}} by Ibrahim Pasha's troops, which prevented their inhabitants from returning. Ibrahim's army razed 16 villages before taking Nablus. He also forced {{the heads of the}} Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. <b>The</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional local leadership due to exile or execution left Palestine's urban population to be financially exploited by both the government and its local opponents. The imprisoned headmen of villages were replaced by their sons, although Ibrahim Pasha demoted them as nawatir (watchmen) instead of the higher-ranking title of mukhtar. Qasim's son Mahmud replaced him and the popularity of his father among the peasantry compelled the rural chiefs of Jabal Nablus to request from the government that Mahmud replace Sulaiman Abd al-Hadi as mutasallim of Nablus.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{most of the}} 2nd Division's {{units were}} sent to the United Kingdom in August 1940, {{although}} the Iceland garrison remained in place until 31October. <b>The</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mont Royals allowed Odlum to reassign the Calgary Highlanders to the 5th Brigade in September, in an attempt to ethnically mix the brigades of the division. By late December 1940, the 2nd Canadian Division was joined with the 1st to form the Canadian Corps (later renamed to I Canadian Corps).|$|E
5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. <b>The</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E

5|$|At {{the demand}} of the sultan, Transylvania troops {{assisted}} Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia. The sultan also ordered Sigismund to pay {{double the amount}} of the yearly tribute. Balthasar Báthory murdered Sigismund's secretary, Pál Gyulai, on 10December 1592. He also persuaded Sigismund to order the execution of Gálffy on 8March 1593. That summer, Sigismund went to Kraków in disguise to start negotiations regarding his marriage with Anna, the sister of SigismundIII of Poland. The Holy See had proposed the marriage, which could have enabled Sigismund to rule Poland during <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king, who was also King of Sweden, but the plan came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the Empire of Brazil was the richest and most {{powerful}} nation in Latin America. It thrived under democratic institutions and a constitutional monarchy, and prided itself on <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudillos, dictators and coups d'état which were common across the rest of the continent. During the minority of emperor PedroII in the 1830s, however, there had been internal rebellions driven by local disputes for power within a few provinces. One of these, the Ragamuffin War, had been led by Gonçalves, as noted above.|$|E

Toghon Temür (the last Mongol ruler of the Yuan dynasty in China before their retreat to Mongolia to form the Northern Yuan dynasty) sent an embassy including Genoese Italians to Pope Benedict XII in 1336, requesting a new archbishop. The pope answered by sending legates and ecclesiastical leaders to Khanbaliq in 1342, which included Giovanni de Marignolli.|$|E
5|$|In 1513 James IV {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} England, attempting {{to take advantage of}} <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at Flodden Field; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, James V, was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, Mary I. Once again, a regency was established.|$|E
5|$|In Kirkland's initial {{description}} of Eolambia, he considered {{it to be}} a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by David B. Weishampel, David B. Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paraquadrate foramen, which separates the quadrate and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surangular foramen on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the top margin of the scapular blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to missing material. Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae – the two primary branches of hadrosaurids – and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a single edge, or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus.|$|E
