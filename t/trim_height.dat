5000|$|By 1966 Australia was {{described}} as BMC's leading world market. The 1800 was introduced in Australia in November 1965 as the Austin 1800, with a Mark II version being introduced in 1968. Australian-produced vehicles {{started out with a}} claimed local content of 65-70% along with an undertaking from the manufacturers to raise the level to 95% in line with government requirements by the end of 1968. [...] Initially the cars were generally identical to their British contemporaries, however the local production was quickly modified to suit the harsher roads and climate of Australia. Modifications to the British Mark I design included raised suspension <b>trim</b> <b>height,</b> the provision of a large, heavy sump guard and better sealing against dust. The Australian Mark II was notable in retaining the lower final drive ratio of the Mark I's manual transmission (but not the lower second gear), and, {{with the exception of the}} initial production run, was fitted with a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system manufactured locally by Paton's Brake Replacements (PBR) Pty. Ltd. Despite offering the safety of a dual-circuit system, it was generally held to be inferior in performance to the earlier Girling equipment. The Australian Mark II was also originally fitted with an alternator manufactured locally by Electricity Meter & Allied Industries Limited (EMAIL), a company better known for its kilowatt-hour meters and household appliances. In the event of failure, most EMAIL alternators were replaced by Australian-made Lucas units.|$|E
50|$|Originally of German Regal size (a {{standard}} {{used at the}} time), {{the height}} of the folios indicate they have been only slightly <b>trimmed.</b> Their <b>height</b> range from 405 mm to 415 mm and the width ranges from 268 mm to 280 mm. The manuscript has twenty-one gatherings. Ten of these are perfect (meaning that no leaves were removed or were added to the gathering), implying they were copied by professional copyists. The remaining eleven gatherings are now imperfect with diverse structures (meaning that leaves were removed or added). The outer leaves of all the gatherings show greater wear than the inner leaves, indicating that the gatherings were originally separate and used independently. Only later were they brought together and bound to create an aggregate volume.|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the normal position of the third phalanx (P 3) and the distal sesamoid bone {{in relation to the}} size and shape of the hoof capsule in sound horses is helpful in the diagnosis of equine foot lameness. Some measurements on radiographs used to define the position of the pedal bone within the hoof capsule are significantly influenced by hoof <b>trimming</b> and the <b>height</b> of the withers. In this study, the front hooves of 40 Warmblood horses were radiographed twice, eight weeks apart, both before and after their hooves were trimmed by an experienced farrier. Using the software programme Metron PX, 22 parameters on the lateromedial view and 16 parameters on the dorsopalmar view were measured and the effect of hoof <b>trimming</b> and <b>height</b> of the withers were calculated, respectively. Some of the hoof parameters showed mild positive correlation with the height of the withers. In 70 % of the horses the left hoof capsule and P 3 were significantly larger than the right. Hoof trimming had a remarkable influence on hoof conformation, especially for parameters in the toe region. Of all the measurements that describe the position of the third phalanx (P 3) in relation to the hoof capsule, the distances between the distal tip of P 3 to the solar surface of the foot, P 3 to the tip of the toe and P 3 to the point of break-over showed the greatest differences before and after trimming. The database of the present study can be used by farriers and veterinarians as a guideline for routine and corrective shoeing of Warmblood horses...|$|R

25|$|Collecting bonsai {{consists}} of finding suitable bonsai material {{in its original}} wild situation, successfully moving it, and replanting it in a container for development as bonsai. Collecting may involve wild materials from naturally treed areas, or cultivated specimens found growing in yards and gardens. For example, mature landscape plants being discarded from a building site can provide excellent material for bonsai. Hedgerow trees, grown for many years but continually <b>trimmed</b> to hedge <b>height,</b> provide heavy, gnarled trunks for bonsai collectors. In locations close to a tree line (the line beyond which trees do not grow, whether due to altitude, temperature, soil moisture, or other conditions), aged and naturally dwarfed survivors can be found.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to hedge laying is trimming using a tractor-mounted flail cutter or circular saw, or a hedge <b>trimmer</b> [...] The <b>height</b> of the cutting {{can be increased}} a little every year. Trimming a hedge helps to promote bushy growth. If a flail cutter is used, then the flail must be kept sharp {{to ensure that the}} cutting is effective on the hedge. The disadvantage of this is that the hedge species takes a number of years before it will flower again and subsequently bear fruit for wildlife and people. If the hedge is trimmed repeatedly at the same height, a 'hard knuckle' will start to form at that height - similar to the shape of a pollarded tree.|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the issues of}} measurement of secondary cold work embrittlement (SCWE) of an IF steel in deep-drawn parts using laboratory tests, and its correlation with real part fracture. It aimed at evaluating {{the influence of the}} steel chemistry and processing condition, microstructure, and test conditions, on SCWE as well as the effect of SCWE on fatigue properties. Size 6 -in. cups produced with various draw ratios or <b>trimmed</b> at different <b>heights</b> were tested to determine the ductile-to-brittle-transition temperature (DBTT) as a function of strain. The 2 -in. cup/expansion test, bend test and fracture of notched specimens were also used to generate information complementary to that provided by the 6 -inch cup/expansion test. The relationship between laboratory tests and fracture in real parts was established by testing large-scale parts. The fatigue behavior was investigated in the as-rolled and deep drawn (high stain) conditions, using prestrained specimens taken from the wall of a formed part...|$|R
30|$|The {{resection}} of the deviated {{portions of}} the septum {{at the time of}} Le Fort I osteotomy would be also beneficial for breathing and sinus drainage. The recontouring of the anterior nasal spine is indicated when the patients have preoperative good nasal tip projection and need to perform large advancement or impaction of the maxilla. Patients also have constricted and asymmetric pyriform rims and nasal floor and deviated anterior nasal spine; thus, after Le Fort I osteotomy, the recontouring of these areas are necessary to open the airway and improve nasal esthetics. Alar cinch suture is often suggested to control the nasal soft-tissue envelope and indicated when reduction of the anterior extent of the piriform rim, the anterior nasal spine, and <b>trimming</b> of the <b>height</b> of anterior nasal floor. The alar cinch suture is utilized to prevent nasal base widening after undergoing advancement and/or superior impaction of the maxilla. The alar base width is measured with calipers and the measurement recorded before the beginning of surgery. The alar base width is again measured postoperatively and compared with the preoperative value to ensure that proper surgical control of the alar base width has been maintained [11].|$|R
40|$|Three on-orchard {{treatments}} to reduce postharvest rots of avocados were evaluated on two orchards, one organic orchard in the Bay of Plenty {{and the other}} conventional orchard in Whangarei. The treatments were applied in a split plot factorial design. Calcium {{was applied to the}} soil under trees for one treatment, dead branches were removed from the canopy and the lower branches were <b>trimmed</b> to a <b>height</b> of 1 m for the second treatment, and trees were irrigated and treated with phosphorous acid for the third treatment. Mulch was applied instead of phosphorous acid in the organic orchard to improve root health. Irrigation in combination with controlling root rots by injecting with phosphorous acid reduced both body rots and stem-end rots in fruit from the Whangarei orchard, but irrigation in combination with application of mulch did not reduce rots in fruit from the Bay of Plenty orchard. The application of calcium to trees reduced body rots in fruit from both orchards. The removal of dead wood from the canopy reduced rots in fruit from the Bay of Plenty orchard, but not in fruit from the Whangarei orchard...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to design a hydrofoil system without a <b>trim</b> and ride <b>height</b> control system and investigate the change in resistance of a representative hull across a typical speed range {{as a result of}} the addition of the hydrofoil system, while retaining adequate stability. The secondary objectives were as follows: Find a representative hull of sailing catamarans produced in South Africa, and to establish an appropriate speed range for that hull across which it is to be tested. Test and explain the drag characteristics of this hull. Find a suitable configuration of lifting foils for this hull that would not require any form of <b>trim</b> or ride <b>height</b> control to maintain stability throughout the speed range. Test and compare the resistance characteristics with and without the assistance of lifting foils. Test and explain the effects of leeway and heel on the total hydrodynamic resistance both with and without lifting foils. A representative hull (RH 1), based on a statistical analysis of sailing catamarans produced in South Africa and an existing hull design of suitable size, was designed. A speed range was then established (0 – 25 knots) based on the statistics of the original (existing) design. A scaled model (of RH 1) of practical and suitable dimensions was designed and manufactured, and its characteristics determined through towing tank testing. A hydrofoil system was then designed and during testing, was adjusted until a stable configuration was found. This resulted in a canard type configuration, with the front foil at the bow and the main foil between the daggerboards. Although a stable configuration was achieved, it was noted that any significant perturbation in the trim of the boat would result in instability and some form of trim control is recommended. The {{main objective}} was achieved. The experimental results concluded that a canard configuration was found to be stable for the RH 1 (foil positioning already mentioned) and the addition of the hydrofoils provided a significant improvement only above a displacement Froude number of 2, which for our full scale prototype, is equivalent to approximately 14. 2 knots. This is in agreement with the results of several other research projects that investigated hydrofoil supported catamarans with semi‐displacement type demi‐hulls. Below displacement Froude number of 2, a significant increase in total hydrodynamic resistance was observed. Since the speed of sailing craft is dependent on wind speed, there will often be conditions of relatively low boat speed (below displacement Froude number of 2). So it was recommended that a prototype design would have a retractable hydrofoil system which could be engaged in suitable conditions (sufficient boat speed). The effects of leeway and heel on the total hydrodynamic resistance were determined experimentally, but it was found that these trends were affected by the resulting changes in wave interference resistance. Since wave interference depended strongly on the hull shape, it was therefore concluded that no universal trends can be determined regarding the effects of heel and leeway on the total hydrodynamic resistance. These effects were determined for RH 1 and it was shown that these effects are drastically altered by the addition of the lifting foils...|$|R

In continuous BGT the bamboos can be cut at any time, however, the robot needs time to move from one bamboo to the next one and this time is defined by a weighted network of connections.

40|$|The {{degree and}} time of canopy {{trimming}} can alter phenology, rates of increase or decrease in berry components during grape ripening, and may influence yield and its components. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the extent to which reducing canopy size, by mechanical trimming post-flowering, changed Vitis vinifera L. 'Pinot noir' fruit yield and composition. Vines were mechanically trimmed to three different canopy heights at fruitset: 1000 mm (100 % canopy height), 600 mm (60 % canopy height relative to the control treatment) and 300 mm (30 % canopy height relative to the control treatment). Total soluble solids concentration and content, titratable acidity, pH and fresh berry mass were measured throughout ripening, and yield and leaf area were measured at harvest. Reduced canopy size via trimming to 30 and 60 % of the control treatment height slowed total soluble solids accumulation and in some cases increased titratable acidity and increased pH. The total soluble solids-titratable acidity ratio was therefore reduced throughout ripening by these trimming treatments relative to the full canopy <b>height.</b> <b>Trimming</b> to reduce canopy size had two effects on the source-sink ratio; it reduced the source (canopy) but increased fruit yield, an important sink. Therefore, the time of trimming is an important management consideration because it can delay and slow ripening due to reduced source leaves but could potentially accentuate the delay via increasing yield (sink). This technique may represent a way to offset the acceleration of phenology and grape ripening that has been observed to occur as a result of warmer seasons...|$|R
