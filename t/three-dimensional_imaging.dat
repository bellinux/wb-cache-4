5|$|Following initial {{interest}} in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use {{declined in the}} middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>imaging</b> modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today.|$|E

25|$|Image-guided {{radiation}} therapy (IGRT) {{is the process}} of frequent two and <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>imaging,</b> during a course of radiation treatment, used to direct {{radiation therapy}} utilizing the imaging coordinates of the actual radiation treatment plan. The patient is localized in the treatment room in the same position as planned from the reference imaging dataset.

IGRT would also include matching planar kilovoltage (kV) radiographs or megavoltage (MV) images with digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from the planning CT. These two methods comprise the bulk of IGRT strategies currently employed circa 2013.|$|E
500|$|Liquid argon {{is used as}} {{the target}} for {{neutrino}} experiments and direct dark matter searches. The interaction between the hypothetical WIMPs and an argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is detected by photomultiplier tubes. Two-phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP–nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield (about 51 photons/keV), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and {{is relatively easy to}} purify. Compared to xenon, argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile, which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils. [...] On the other hand, its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to [...] contamination, unless one uses argon from underground sources, which has much less [...] contamination. Most of the argon in the Earth’s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long-lived [...] ( [...] + e− → [...] + ν) present in natural potassium within the Earth. [...] The [...] activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction (n,2n) and similar reactions. [...] The half-life of [...] is only 269years. [...] As a result, the underground Ar, shielded by rock and water, has much less [...] contamination. [...] Dark-matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include DarkSide, WArP, ArDM, microCLEAN and DEAP. [...] Neutrino experiments include ICARUS and MicroBooNE, both of which use high-purity liquid argon in a time projection chamber for fine grained <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>imaging</b> of neutrino interactions.|$|E

AO-OCA enables in vivo high-resolution and high-contrast micro-vascular imaging by detecting Doppler frequency shifts. Using this technique, the retinal and choroidal vasculatures of healthy subjects were imaged. The results show that both intensity and Doppler power images have sufficient contrast to discriminate almost all vasculatures from the static tissue. However, the choriocapillaris, pre-arterioles, and post-venules in the Sattler layer were more contrasted by the Doppler technique.
