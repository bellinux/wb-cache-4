5|$|In early 1965, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon {{wrote to}} President Lyndon Johnson, {{opposing}} the dollar and {{pointing out that}} the coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana or anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, the coins would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams hoped to avoid striking the silver dollars, but wanted to keep the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol {{arrived in}} Bucharest {{and made his}} way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol's return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol's return as the return of the Prodigal Son. However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> not go well. Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.|$|E
5|$|At the Magic Box, Giles {{recognizes that}} he must stand aside if Buffy is to face her {{responsibilities}} in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds {{a picture of the}} forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").|$|E

5|$|At {{the urging}} of Butler's father, in 1924, the newly elected mayor of Philadelphia W. Freeland Kendrick asked {{him to leave the}} Marines to become the Director of Public Safety, the {{official}} in charge of running the city's police and fire departments. Philadelphia's municipal government was notoriously corrupt and Butler initially refused. Kendrick asked President Calvin Coolidge to intervene. Coolidge contacted Butler and authorized him to take the necessary leave from the Corps. At the request of the president, Butler served in the post from January 1924 until December 1925. He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> change while he was in charge. He replaced corrupt police officers and, in some cases, switched entire units from one part of the city to another, undermining local protection rackets and profiteering.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

25|$|There, {{they meet}} {{a woman named}} Alexandra (Mayumi Yanagisawa/Jeannie Elias). She tells them she {{is the owner of}} the Palace, and the moon-person they fought is called Sirus, and is only a child; an orphan whom Alexandra adopted. However, because of the evil inside him, he has {{forgotten}} that time. She asks them to restore the garden of the Palace to try to remind Sirus of his old life. They do so, and confront Griffon, who experiences a memory of Sirus lamenting how humans have nearly destroyed the world fighting for the atlamillia, and musing <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> be better if humans didn't exist. These memories weaken Griffon, and Max and Monica defeat him. He turns back into Sirus, and a Dark Element (Hiroshi Iwasaki/Cam Clarke) rises out of his body, calling the Star of Oblivion. The Element reveals that it was born from Sirus's hatred for humans, and plans to rule over the destroyed planet. Max and Monica defeat the Element, helped by Sirus, who is mortally wounded. Before he dies, he remembers who he really is – the Guardian of the Stars, with the power to stop the Star of Oblivion. He does so, and Alexandra appears, telling him he has done well. He thanks Max and Monica for saving him, and then dies, re-joining Alexandra in the garden. Max and Monica discuss how Griffon never really existed, but was instead an evil created in the heart of humans. At Kazarov, they say goodbye, vowing never to forget one another. Elena also says goodbye to Max as Paznos returns to its own time.|$|E

She said the U.S. was also spending {{millions of dollars to}} aid Pakistan's capacity building through renovation and repair of the Tarbela dam and others that would add over 500MW to the national grid. [...] "There is no short-term solution to end the gap between electricity consumption and generation, which was currently around 5,000MW," [...] she said, adding <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> better during the years to come should Pakistan start work on power generation projects. Dismissing the notion that the U.S. was only giving all this assistance to change public perception in Pakistan as inaccurate, she stated that [...] "The US wants to help Pakistan meet its energy needs. The process of assistance was started years ago on public request. Before that the US had been providing only military assistance to Pakistan." ...|$|E

500|$|In Australia’s tour matches at The Oval, the pacemen {{had been}} effective, and Hassett and Morris thought <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> be {{similar in the}} Tests. As a result, leg spinner Ring was omitted. Hassett made 53 as Australia made 275 batting first. England then took a 31-run lead and Hassett was out for only 10 in the second innings as Australia fell for only 162, as the local spinners Jim Laker and Tony Lock cut down the Australians on a turning surface. The hosts then reached the target safely with eight wickets in hand to claim a 1–0 victory, thus winning the Ashes {{for the first time}} since the infamous Bodyline tour of 1932–33. Hassett was in fine form after the Tests, scoring 148 against Somerset, 65 against Kent, 106 against South, and 74 and 25 against TN Pearce's XI in the {{remaining}} first-class matches in England. Australia managed to win the matches against Kent and South by an innings, but it was too late to save the Ashes. Nevertheless, Harte said that [...] "Hassett’s leadership throughout had been sparkling".|$|E
500|$|In March 1968, McCain was {{put into}} solitary confinement, where he {{remained}} for two years. Unknown to the POWs, in April 1968, Jack McCain was named Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC) effective in July, stationed in Honolulu and commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater. In mid-June, Major Bai, commander of the North Vietnamese prison camp system, offered McCain a chance to return home early. The North Vietnamese wanted to score a worldwide propaganda coup by appearing merciful, and also wanted to show other POWs {{that members of the}} elite like McCain were willing to be treated preferentially. McCain turned down the offer of release, due to the POWs' [...] "first in, first out" [...] interpretation of the U.S. Code of Conduct: he would only accept the offer if every man captured before him was released as well. McCain's refusal to be released was remarked upon by North Vietnamese senior negotiator Lê Đức Thọ to U.S. envoy Averell Harriman, during the ongoing Paris Peace Talks. Enraged by his declining of the offer, Bai and his assistant told McCain <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> get very bad for him.|$|E
2500|$|Betsy Chasse, {{one of the}} producers, directors, and screenwriters for What the Bleep Do We Know!? interviewed Paul Harrington, the co-producer of The Secret.

2500|$|The philosopher John Taurek {{also argued}} {{that the idea of}} adding {{happiness}} or pleasures across persons is quite unintelligible and that the numbers of persons involved in a situation are morally irrelevant. Taurek's basic concern comes down to this: we cannot explain what it means to say <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>would</b> be five times worse if five people die than if one person dies. [...] "I cannot give a satisfactory account of the meaning of judgments of this kind," [...] he wrote (p.304). He argues that each person can only lose one person's happiness or pleasures. [...] There isn't five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die: [...] who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure? [...] "Each person's potential loss has the same significance to me, only as a loss to that person alone. because, by hypothesis, I have an equal concern for each person involved, I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss" [...] (p.307).
