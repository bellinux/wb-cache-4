5|$|Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who {{had taken}} over command from Gamelin, were still {{determined}} to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated their intentions to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened {{what remained of the}} Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; such a move would have overstretched them. Without consulting the French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>the</b> gap and abandon any offensive operations further south.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>the</b> main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot undermined by the villain and some poor dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 7 April, the Germans {{launched}} an attack through the level plain between Lake Doiran and the mountains, but was repelled and retreated north of Mouries. On the same day, however, news of the collapse of the Yugoslav front to the north opened the possibility that German forces would outflank TSAM through the Vardar River valley, and TSAM ordered the 19th Division <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>the</b> gap by extending its front to the west up to the Vardar. The division took over the troops of the 11th Border Sector as well, while the remainder of the 1st Security Battalion (further two infantry companies and MG squads) and three 3.7cm Flak guns were sent as reinforcements, denuding Thessaloniki of virtually any military unit. The 19th Reconnaissance Group was also ordered to move to the division's support. Arriving after a 85km night march at the village of Metalliko {{in the early hours of}} the next day, it formed the division's only reserve.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{planned to}} use the 2nd Panzer Division <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>the</b> gap but on 10 June, {{the bulk of the}} 2nd Panzer Division was strung out between Amiens and Alençon and not {{expected}} to arrive in strength for another three days. General Hans Freiherr von Funck of XLVII Panzer Corps rushed the divisional reconnaissance battalion to Caumont, with orders to hold the high ground. The I SS-Panzer Corps commander Sepp Dietrich, ordered his only reserve Schwere SS-Panzer-Abteilung 101, to move behind the Panzer-Lehr and 12th SS-Panzer divisions, to cover the open left flank. The 2nd Company, , under the command of Michael Wittmann and with five operational Tiger tanks, was ordered to a position south of Point 213 on the Villers-Bocage ridge and arrived on 12 June, after a five-day drive from Beauvais.|$|E
5|$|German forces {{continued}} their counterattacks on Übach, suffering heavy casualties to American artillery and infantry fire. Although {{the inability to}} retake Übach persuaded German commanders that they had insufficient forces to properly defend the approaches to Aachen, the counterattacks did tie down American troops which could have otherwise continued the advance. On 4 October, the Allied advance was limited, with only the towns of Hoverdor and Beggendorf taken, the Americans having lost roughly 1,800 soldiers {{in the past three}} days of combat. Better progress was made on 5 October, as the 119th Regiment of the 30th Infantry Division captured Merkstein-Herbach. The following day the Germans launched another counterattack against Übach, again failing to dislodge the Americans. German armor was unable to cope with the overwhelming numerical superiority of the American tanks, and as a last-ditch effort to halt the advance the Germans began concentrated attacks on American positions with what artillery and aircraft they could muster. They found themselves severely hamstrung by lack of reserves, although General Koechling was able to deploy a Tiger detachment to the town of Alsdorf in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>the</b> American penetration of Aachen's northern defenses.|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} {{automatically}} verifying {{the connections between}} terminals of a patchboard is described.

50|$|Termination of modular {{connector}} cables is very similar, {{regardless of}} the number of positions and contacts in <b>the</b> <b>plug.</b> <b>To</b> prevent damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> (and <b>the</b> expensive crimp die-set), the crimp tool must be carefully matched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> being attached. For example, termination of a cable with an 8P8C plug involves using a hand crimper or crimp machine containing an 8P8C die-set or an A67T standard die-set. An 8P8C crimp die-set usually looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around <b>the</b> 8P8C <b>plug.</b> As <b>the</b> die compresses, these teeth force <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> contacts down into the conductors of the cable being terminated, permanently attaching <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cable.|$|R

Bach-Zalewski himself was temporarily relieved of command and sent to Germany for recuperation. The regiment was dissolved in mid-1942, with Police Battalions 307, 316 and 322 retaining their designations.|$|E

25|$|All DRM to date can {{therefore}} be bypassed by recording this signal and digitally storing and distributing it in a non DRM limited form, by anyone who has the technical means of recording the analog stream. Furthermore, the analog hole cannot be overcome without the additional protection of externally imposed restrictions, such as legal regulations, because the vulnerability is inherent to all analog means of transmission. However, the conversion from digital to analog and back is likely to force a loss of quality, particularly when using lossy digital formats. HDCP is an attempt <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>the</b> analog hole, although it is largely ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{distress}} to tissue causes capillaries {{to break}} under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up. As time progresses, blood seeps {{into the surrounding}} tissues, causing the bruise to darken and spread. Nerve endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, {{may be perceived as}} pain or pressure or be asymptomatic. The damaged capillary endothelium releases endothelin, a hormone that causes narrowing of the blood vessel to minimize bleeding. As the endothelium is destroyed, the underlying von Willebrand factor is exposed and initiates coagulation, which creates a temporary clot <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>the</b> wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.|$|E
