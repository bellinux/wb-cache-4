40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{paradoxical}} {{phenomenon of}} the coexistence of overweight and underweight individuals in the same household, referred to as <b>the</b> "dual <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> malnutrition", is a growing nutrition dilemma in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). AIMS: The objectives {{of this study were}} (i) to examine the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> across different provinces in Indonesia and (ii) to determine how gender, community social capital, place of residency and other socio-economic factors affect the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition.</b> METHODS: <b>The</b> current study utilized data from the fourth wave of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) conducted between November 2007 and April 2008. The dataset contains information from 12, 048 households and 45, 306 individuals of all ages. This study focused on households with individuals over two years old. To account for the multilevel nature of the data, a multilevel multiple logistic regression was conducted. RESULTS: Approximately one-fifth of all households in Indonesia exhibited <b>the</b> dual <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> which was more prevalent among male-headed households, households with a high Socio-economic status (SES), and households in urban areas. Minimal variation in <b>the</b> dual <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> was explained by the community level differences (< 4 %). Living in households with a higher SES resulted in higher odds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> but not among female-headed households and communities with the highest social capital. CONCLUSION: To improve household health and reduce the inequality across different SES groups, this study emphasizes the inclusion of women's empowerment and community social capital into intervention programs addressing <b>the</b> dual <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition...</b>|$|R

Here we used a zebrafish model of diet-induced obesity to analyze the impact of dietary intake on fertility and the phenotype of the next generation. Over an eight-week period, one group received 60 mg of food each day (60 mg arm), while another received 5 mg (5 mg arm). At {{the end of the}} diet, the body mass index of the 60 mg arm was 1. 5 fold greater than the 5 mg arm. The intervention also had a marked impact on fertility; breeding success and egg production in the 60 mg arm were increased 2. 1 - and 6. 2 -fold compared to the 5 mg arm, respectively. Transcriptome analysis of eggs revealed that transcripts involved in metabolic biological processes differed according to dietary intake. The progeny from the differentially fed fish were more likely to survive when the parents had access to more food. An intergenerational crossover study revealed that while parental diet did not influence weight gain in the offspring, the progeny of well-fed parents had increased levels of physical activity when exposed again to high nutrient availability.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Households from {{vulnerable}} groups experiencing epidemiological transitions {{are known}} to be affected concomitantly by under-nutrition and obesity. Yet, it is unknown to what extent this double burden affects refugee populations dependent on food assistance. We assessed the double burden of malnutrition among Western Sahara refugees living in a protracted emergency. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We implemented a stratified nutrition survey in October-November 2010 in the four Western Sahara refugee camps in Algeria. We sampled 2, 005 households, collecting anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference) in 1, 608 children (6 - 59 mo) and 1, 781 women (15 - 49 y). We estimated the prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM), stunting, underweight, and overweight in children; and stunting, underweight, overweight, and central obesity in women. To assess <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> within households, households were first classified according to the presence of each type of malnutrition. Households were then classified as undernourished, overweight, or affected by the double burden if they presented members with under-nutrition, overweight, or both, respectively. The prevalence of GAM in children was 9. 1 %, 29. 1 % were stunted, 18. 6 % were underweight, and 2. 4 % were overweight; among the women, 14. 8 % were stunted, 53. 7 % were overweight or obese, and 71. 4 % had central obesity. Central obesity (47. 2 %) and overweight (38. 8 %) in women affected a higher proportion of households than did GAM (7. 0 %), stunting (19. 5 %), or underweight (13. 3 %) in children. Overall, households classified as overweight (31. 5 %) were most common, followed by undernourished (25. 8 %), and then double burden-affected (24. 7 %). CONCLUSIONS: The double burden of obesity and under-nutrition is highly prevalent in households among Western Sahara refugees. The results highlight the need to focus more attention on non-communicable diseases in this population and balance obesity prevention and management with interventions to tackle under-nutrition.

Furthermore, a suitable screening tool has not been validated for this vulnerable patient group. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> understand its impact, and validate a malnutrition screening tool for Indigenous Australian inpatients. Methods This project involves cross-sectional, prospective cohort and diagnostic validation methodologies to assess the burden and impact of malnutrition and to validate a malnutrition screening tool. A target of 752 adult Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian inpatients will be recruited across three different public hospitals in the Northern Territory and far north Queensland of Australia. Cross-sectional data collection will be used to determine the prevalence of malnutrition using the Subjective Global Assessment and to stratify participants based on the International Consensus Guideline Committee malnutrition aetiology-diagnostic framework. Subjects will then be followed prospectively to measure short and long-term health outcomes such as length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, 30 -day and 6 -month readmission rates. Finally, the utility of a new screening tool, the Australian Nutrition Tool, will be assessed against an existing screening tool, the malnutrition screening tool, used in these settings and the malnutrition reference standard, the Subjective Global Assessment. Discussion Indigenous Australians continue to experience poorer levels of health than non-Indigenous Australians and issues such as food insecurity, poor diet, and a disproportionate burden of chronic disease play a key contributing role for malnutrition in Indigenous Australians. To improve the health and hospital outcomes of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, it is important that patients are routinely screened using a validated screening tool. It is also imperative that the burden and impact of malnutrition is properly understood, and fully appreciated, so that early and appropriate nutritional management can be provided to this group of hospital patients...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in Food and Nutrition Bulletin [© 2014 United Nations University Press] and the definite version is available at: [URL] acute malnutrition (SAM) is a common condition that kills children and intellectually maims those who survive. Close to 20 million {{children under the age}} of 5 years suffer from SAM globally, and about 1 million of them die each year. Much of this burden takes place in Asia. Six countries in Asia together have more than 12 million children suffering from SAM: 0. 6 million in Afghanistan, 0. 6 million in Bangladesh, 8. 0 million in India, 1. 2 million in Indonesia, 1. 4 million in Pakistan, and 0. 6 million in Yemen. This article is based on a review of SAM burden and intervention programs in Asian countries where, despite the huge numbers of children suffering from the condition, the coverage of interventions is either absent on a national scale or poor. Countries in Asia have to recognize SAM as a major problem and mobilize internal resources for its management. Screening of children in the community for SAM and appropriate referral and back referral require good health systems. Improving grassroots services will not only contribute to improving management of SAM, it will also improve infant and young child feeding and nutrition in general. Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), the key to home management of SAM without complications, is still not endorsed by many countries because of its unavailability in the countries and its cost. It should preferably be produced locally from locally available food ingredients. Countries in Asia that do not have the capacity to produce RUTF from locally available food ingredients can benefit from other countries in the region that can produce it. Health facilities in all high-burden countries should be staffed and equipped to treat children with SAM. A continuous cascade of training of health staff on management of SAM can offset the damage that results from staff attrition or transfers. The basic nutrition interventions, which include breastfeeding, appropriate complementary feeding, micronutrient supplementation, and management of acute malnutrition, should be scaled up in Asian countries that are plagued with <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition.</b> Publishe...|$|E

This study aimed to: a) {{determine}} temporal {{trends in the}} prevalence of underweight, stunting, and at risk of overweight/ overweight or obesity in Indonesian children aged 2. 0 - 4. 9 years; and b) examine associated risk factors. A repeated cross-sectional survey. This is a secondary data analysis of waves 1, 2, 3, and 4 (1993, 1997, 2000, and 2007) of the Indonesian Family Life Survey, which includes 13 out of 27 provinces in Indonesia. Height, weight and BMI were expressed as z-scores (2006 WHO Child Growth Standards). Weight-for-age-z-score + 1, >+ 2, >+ 3 as at-risk, overweight and obese, respectively. There are 938, 913, 939, and 1311 separate children in the 4 waves, respectively. The prevalence of stunting decreased significantly from waves 1 to 4 (from 50. 8 % to 36. 7 %), as did the prevalence of underweight (from 34. 5 % to 21. 4 %). The prevalence of 'at-risk'/overweight/obesity increased from 10. 3 % to 16. 5 % (all P< 0. 01). Stunting and underweight were related to lower birth weight, being breastfed for 6 months or more, having parents who were underweight or had short stature, and mothers who never attended formal education. Stunting was also higher in rural areas. Being at-risk, or overweight/obese were closely related to being in the youngest age group (2 - 2 · 9 years) or male, having parents who were overweight/obese or having fathers with university education. <b>The</b> double <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> occurs in Indonesian children.

40|$|The {{region of}} Latin America and the Caribbean can boast a {{successful}} {{track record in}} the process of eradicating hunger: it is the only region in the world that has halved both the proportion of people who suffer from hunger (the target set in the Millennium Development Goals) and their absolute number (the target set at the World Food Summit of 1996). This publication aims to provide the region’s countries with up-todate and timely information on the status of food and nutrition security; on the role in eradicating hunger played by the different areas such as agriculture, agrifood trade and natural resources management; and on the possibility of successfully addressing <b>the</b> twin <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> in a context where the effects of climate change could threaten the progress achieved in Latin America and the Caribbean thus far. The CELAC Plan for Food and Nutrition Security and the Eradication of Hunger 2025 is a cross-cutting tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; and it thus encourages the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to redouble their efforts to identify key policy areas that will make it possible to speed up and consolidate the process of eradicating hunger and tackle <b>the</b> twin <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> in <b>the</b> region, in which overweight and obesity are increasingly adding to that scourge.

3000|$|Malnutrition {{in infants}} during weaning has been {{attributed}} to inappropriate complementary feeding practices and it underlies more than one-third of child mortality in Nigeria. Thus, addressing the influence of complementary feeding practice on nutritional status may be an important approach to reducing <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> child <b>malnutrition.</b> This cross-sectional study investigated the association between complementary feeding practices among mothers and nutritional status of their infants in Akpabuyo Local Government Area, Nigeria. The study enrolled 330 mother–child pairs from 10 randomly selected out of 32 Health Facilities in Akpabuyo. Socio-demographic information, child and maternal characteristics were obtained using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Complementary feeding practices were assessed with World Health Organization infant and young child feeding indicators. Nutritional indicators wasting, underweight and stunting were determined.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background Child {{malnutrition}} is a known {{risk factor}} for a myriad childhood diseases and causes of death, including intestinal infectious diseases, acute respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and protein-energy malnutrition. The nutrition literature lacks estimates of deaths and disease burden attributable to each malnutrition indicator over time and at the country level. In order {{to make informed decisions}} on interventions, policymakers {{need to be aware of}} the magnitude and trends of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition.</b> Methods and Findings After using all available data to generate time series of wasting, stunting, and underweight, we employed the comparative risk assessment method to calculate death and disease burden attributable to these three indicators of malnutrition. Deaths attributable to stunting declined from a peak of 3. 89 (95 % confidence intervals: 3. 19 - 4. 76) million in 1980 to 1. 34 (1. 11 - 1. 59) million in 2011, and deaths attributable to underweight experienced a similar decrease from 3. 22 (2. 62 - 4. 00) million in 1980 to 1. 01 (0. 83 - 1. 22) million in 2011. Deaths from wasting declined from 2. 06 (1. 62 - 2. 64) million in 1980 to 726 (588 - 896) thousand in 2011. DALYs attributable to stunting decreased from 278 (237 - 328) million in 1990 to 125 (105 - 148) million in 2010. DALYs attributable to wasting declined from 150 (122 - 186) million in 1990 to 70 (58 - 86) million. Finally, DALYs attributable to underweight experienced a large decrease from 226 (191 - 271) million in 1990 to 97 (78 - 116) million. At the regional level, Latin America has seen improvements, but the majority of the decrease in deaths can be attributed to changes in South Asia, driven primarily by India. While progress in sub-Saharan Africa on the whole has been small, some countries have still enjoyed large decreases. Conclusions There have been encouraging declines between 1980 and 2011 in the burden of deaths and DALYs attributable to malnutrition at the global level. At the regional-level, Asia has experienced much improvement, but there has been a discouraging stagnation of progress in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries such as China, Brazil, and Botswana have commendably reduced burden attributable to malnutrition over the past 3 decades, and the global community should examine these cases to apply lessons from these success stories to other settings...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In any community, Mothers and Children {{constitutes}} {{not only}} priority group, {{but they are}} also a “Vulnerable” or “Special-risk Group”. Similarly in India our biggest problem is malnutrition among under five year old children. To break the vicious cycle of malnutrition, morbidity reduced learning capacity and mortality India launched the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme in 1975. It is the foremost symbol of India’s commitment to her children Rationale: Forty percent of the world's severely under-nourished under-five children live in India so the present study was conducted to assess the nutritional status of children availing the services under Integrated Child Development Service Scheme in Uttarakhand. Objective: To estimate the level of nutrition in children attending Anganwadi centers of Doiwala block. Methods: Out of these Seven ICDS project areas, Doiwala Block was chosen for the study purpose since it is also the field practice area of Department of Community Medicine, HIMS. 19 AWC was selected by using Simple Random Sampling technique in Doiwala block. All the children aged between 3 - 6 years attending Anganwadi centers were included in community based, cross sectional study. Predesigned pretested anthropometric survey tool with local adaptability and minor modification for local suitability was adopted to collect information pertaining to growth monitoring of the children [Adopted from WHO child growth standard 2006]. Children were weighed, and their height and MUAC were recorded. Weight for age, height for age and MUAC for age was calculated using WHO growth references. Nutritional status according to the WHO Child Growth Standards was analysed using WHO Anthro statistical software. Results: 200 children were surveyed. From the total population 110 are males and 90 are females. After the analysis of weight for age with anthro software it was found that 20. 9 % of children lie within - 2 SD with a mean of - 0. 98 and SD of 1. 14. In case of height for age 30. 9 % of children lie within - 2 SD with a mean of - 0. 92 and SD 1. 87. BMI for age 25. 8 % of children lie within - 2 SD with a mean of- 1. 58 and SD 1. 3. MUAC for age 30 % of children lie within - 2 SD.   Conclusion : As per anthropometric calculation <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> was high among children attending Anganwadi centers. This raises concern about the children who are not allowed to attend the Anganwadi centers on regular basis due to various reasons. Burden of malnutrition among children attending Anganwadi centers can be tackled by enhancing the quality of mid-day meal programme especially on high protein and caloric intake. </p...|$|E
40|$|Few, if any, tribulations in {{the field}} of public health have managed to transcend the {{epidemiological}} transition from acute to chronic disease as malnutrition has. Officially, malnutrition is a category of diseases that includes micronutrient deficiency, under-nutrition (calories/protein), as well as excessive nutrition. The World Food Program estimates that 842 million people worldwide {{do not have access to}} enough food, approximately 146 million of which are children. The most serious types of hunger are known as Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM), with 20 million and 35 million respective cases each year occurring in children less than 5 years of age. While MAM is serious in its own right, when left untreated a child can develop SAM, and suffer from severe wasting of their fat and muscle tissues. Despite current global food production being sufficient for almost twice the world’s population of 7 billion, approximately 15 % of all people are under-nourished, the majority of which live in developing nations. If no intervention occurs, the complications associated with malnutrition may disrupt the body’s fundamental processes, leading to potentially irreversible physical and mental deficits. Both SAM and MAM have also been associated with an increased susceptibility to external pathogens such as Malaria or Tuberculosis; Malaria alone claims the lives of 3000 - 4000 children every day. Furthermore, the consequences of these complications tend to exacerbate the circumstances that create the initial risk of malnourishment, e. g. disease and developmental deficiencies. In other words, the effects of malnutrition can result in an individual being unable to either work or go to school, leaving them less capable of earning enough money to afford food or education, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty. Using a local non-profit organization named Edesia as both a model and a resource, I examined the current policies and procedures in place to alleviate <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> in developing nations. Edesia is part of a network of small organizations known as Plumpyfield, which specializes in the production of a line of ready to use therapeutic foods (RUTFs). Edesia and their counterparts design RUTFs to treat SAM and MAM, as well as supplement local diets in an effort to minimize the effects of malnutrition. International aid organizations such as UNICEF purchase these RUTFs from Edesia and distribute them based on need, which is typically determined by natural disasters or famine due to seasonal crop shortages. Plumpyfield’s mission statement cites prevention by means of reducing the number of people affected as the ultimate goal of their interventions. While their products have been shown to effectively treat the symptoms of malnutrition, the data has not indicated a significant decrease in incidence as an outcome of using RUTFs. As a result, I began to examine the challenges faced by international aid organizations working to reduce global hunger by exploring the following questions: What constitutes an appropriate treatment or intervention? In what ways do these types of programs support or hinder prevention as previously defined? What types of interventions are similar organizations implementing in comparison with the work of Edesia and the rest of Plumpyfield...|$|E
