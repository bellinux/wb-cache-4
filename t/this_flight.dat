5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. <b>This</b> <b>flight</b> occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|All of the Lancasters had {{completed}} their attacks by 11:07am GMT, and the 21 bombers began the return journey to Yagodnik. The Force A aircraft {{which had not}} been able to bomb brought their Tallboys back. <b>This</b> <b>flight</b> proved uneventful, and all 27 Lancasters landed at Yagodnik in the evening. The Film Unit aircraft flew directly from Kaafjord to the United Kingdom, and arrived at its home station after a fifteen-and-a-half hour flight; this was the longest operational Lancaster mission of World War II.|$|E
5|$|American Airlines Flight 191 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight operated by American Airlines from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Los Angeles International Airport. A McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 used for <b>this</b> <b>flight</b> on May 25, 1979, crashed moments after takeoff from Chicago. All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed, {{along with two}} people on the ground. It is the deadliest aviation accident to {{have occurred in the}} United States.|$|E

5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that <b>this</b> <b>flight</b> crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, the United States Naval Research Laboratory group {{launched}} an Aerobee 150 rocket {{equipped with a}} pair of Geiger counters. <b>This</b> <b>flight</b> discovered seven candidate X-ray sources, including the first extragalactic X-ray source; Virgo X-1 was designated as the first X-ray source detected in Virgo. A later Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range on July 7, 1967, yielded further evidence that the source of Virgo X-1 was the radio galaxy M87. Subsequent X-ray observations by the HEAO 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the X-ray emission.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Loring was {{assigned}} to the 22nd Fighter Squadron, 36th Fighter Group, Ninth Air Force at Losey Army Airfield in Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico. The unit flew anti-submarine patrols as part of a force defending the Panama Canal and Caribbean Sea areas. During this time, Loring primarily flew P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawk fighter and ground attack aircraft. After a stint of this duty, the 36th Fighter Group returned to the United States to Charleston Army Airfield in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Loring and the other pilots of the unit trained with the P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft. It briefly moved to Scribner, Nebraska as part of <b>this</b> <b>flight</b> training.|$|E

5|$|In early 1964 Alan Shepard was {{grounded}} {{after being}} diagnosed with Ménière's disease and Grissom was designated command pilot for Gemini 3, the first manned Project Gemini flight, which flew on March 23, 1965. This mission made him the first NASA astronaut to fly into space twice. <b>This</b> <b>flight</b> made three revolutions of the Earth and lasted for 4 hours, 52 minutes and 31 seconds. Grissom {{was one of the}} eight pilots of the NASA paraglider research vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The CSM for <b>this</b> <b>flight,</b> number 012 {{built by}} North American Aviation (NAA), was a Block I version {{designed}} before the lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with the Lunar Module. This {{was incorporated into}} the Block II CSM design, along with lessons learned in Block I. Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the Moon landing flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{first flight}} by an RAAF C-17 to Antarctica was {{conducted}} in November 2015. The aircraft transported supplies for the Australian Antarctic Division from Hobart to Wilkins Runway, and its crew practised evacuating casualties from Wilkins after the cargo was unloaded. <b>This</b> <b>flight</b> {{was reported to have}} been the first time the RAAF had flown missions to the Australian Antarctic Territory since the Antarctic Flight was withdrawn in 1963. Further flights occurred in early 2016. A trial winter airdrop was also conducted at Casey Station in June that year. In September 2017 air-to-air refuelling was used to enable a Globemaster to drop supplies at Davis Station.|$|E

5|$|After a one-month {{hospital}} stay, Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld {{was promoted}} to Major and made Geschwaderkommodore of Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG5) on 20 February 1944. He and his crew, Oberfeldwebel Josef Renette and Unteroffizier Kurt Röber, {{were killed in a}} flying accident on 12 March 1944 on a routine flight from Parchim to Athies-sous-Laon. Above Belgium, they seem to have encountered a bad weather zone with low clouds and a dense snowstorm and it was assumed that the aircraft hit the high Ardennes ground after being forced to fly lower because of ice forming on the wings. The exact circumstances of <b>this</b> <b>flight</b> may never be known, the Bf 110 G-4 C9+CD (Werknummer 720 010—factory number) crashed into the Ardennes mountains near St. Hubert where the completely burned-out wreck was found the following day. The funeral service was held in the city church of Linz on 15 March 1944. Prinz Egmont zur Lippe-Weißenfeld and Prinz Heinrich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein are buried side by side at Ysselsteyn in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for <b>this</b> <b>flight</b> lies first with history {{and with the}} giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, a C-130H {{became the}} first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at McMurdo Sound. In January–February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian and other foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. During April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with aerial firefighting equipment acquired from the United States Forest Service for trials purposes; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires. On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules performed a formation flight over Sydney; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in <b>this</b> <b>flight</b> but was diverted to conduct a search-and-rescue task. The Hercules' twelve-hour endurance and ability to drop survival equipment over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions. In 1986, No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles during John PaulII's tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a Murray Grey stud bull presented to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archaeological exhibits from China.|$|E

5|$|K5054 {{was fitted}} with a new propeller, and Summers flew the {{aircraft}} on 10 March 1936; during <b>this</b> <b>flight</b> the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. After the fourth flight, a new engine was fitted, and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants, Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. They soon discovered that the Spitfire {{was a very good}} aircraft, but not perfect. The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just 330mph (528km/h), little faster than Sydney Camm's new Merlin-powered Hurricane. A new and better-shaped wooden propeller allowed the Spitfire to reach 348mph (557km/h) in level flight in mid-May, when Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE). Here, Flight Lieutenant Humphrey Edwardes-Jones took over the prototype for the RAF. He had been given orders to fly the aircraft and then to make his report to the Air Ministry on landing. Edwardes-Jones' report was positive; his only request was that the Spitfire be equipped with an undercarriage position indicator. A week later, on 3 June 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires, before any formal report had been issued by the A&AEE. Interim reports were later issued on a piecemeal basis.|$|E
