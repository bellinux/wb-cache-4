50|$|Control for the {{solenoids}} and {{stepper motors}} {{can be either}} closed loop or open loop. Closed loop systems rely on feedback from a manifold pressure sensor to meet a predetermined boost pressure. Open loop systems have a predetermined control output where control output is merely based on other inputs such as <b>throttle</b> <b>angle</b> and/or engine RPM. Open loop specifically leaves out a desired boost level, while closed loop attempts to target a specific level of boost pressure. Since open loop systems do not modify control levels based on MAP sensor, differing boost pressure levels may be reached based on outside variables such as weather conditions or engine coolant temperature. For this reason, systems that do not feature closed loop operation are not as widespread.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) {{controls}} the position {{of one or more}} air control valves based on input signals from <b>throttle</b> <b>angle</b> and engine RPM. The vacuum switching valve (VSV) which controls the vacuum supply to the actuator is normally closed and passes vacuum to the actuator when it is energized by the ECU. By energizing the VSV vacuum is passed to the actuator, closing the air control valve. This effectively lengthens the intake manifold run. By de-energizing the VSV, vacuum to the actuator is blocked and trapped vacuum is bled off of the actuator diaphragm. Toyota ACIS is an On/Off system. The valve (or valves in newer models with multiple valves to create more than 2 lengths) is either fully opened or fully closed.An example of early single-valve ACIS programming would be the 3.0L 3VZ-FE engine. The ECU actuates the VSV to close the valve when the throttle position is 60% or greater and engine speed is 3,900 RPM or more.|$|E

40|$|The {{mean value}} engine model (MVEM) is a {{mathematical}} model derived from basic physical principles such as conservation of mass and energy equations. Although the MVEM is based on some simplified assumptions and time averaged combustion engine parameters, it models the engine with a reasonable approximation and gives a satisfactory amount {{of information about the}} physics of the fluid energy passing through an engine system. MVEM can predict an engine’s main external variables such as crankshaft speed and manifold pressure, and important internal variables, such as volumetric and thermal efficiencies. Usually, the differential equations used in MVEM will predict fuel film flow, manifold pressure, and crankshaft speed. Because of its simplicity and short simulation time, the MVEM is widely used for engine control development. A mean value engine based on mathematical and parametric equations has recently been developed in the new MapleSim software. The model consists of three main components: the throttle body, the manifold, and the engine. The new MVEM uses combinations of causal and acausal components along with lookup tables and parametric equations. Adjusting the parameters allows the model to be used for new engines of interest. The model is forward-looking and so benefits from both Maple’s powerful mathematical tool and Modelica’s modern equation-based language.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a basic architecture of an intelligent {{driver warning system}} which embodies an adaptive driver model for indirect collision avoidance. In this study, the driver modelling objective is focused only on longtitudinal car-following, and the model inputs are chosen to be the past history of <b>throttle</b> <b>angle,</b> controlled vehicles's speed, range and range rate to the front vehicle whereas the model output is chosen to be the current <b>throttle</b> <b>angle.</b> An artificial neural network called CMAC and a conventional linear model are independently applied to model the real driver data taken from test track and motorway environments. The CMAC model is chosen because of its nonlinear modeling capability, on-line learning convergence and minimum learning interference characteristics, whereas the linear model is chosen as a control benchmark to examine the nonlinear characteristics of the driver's behaviour. The modeling capabilities are then evaluated based on one-step ahead prediction error performances over the training and testing sets, learning curves and correlation based model validation techniques. Modeling {{results suggest that the}} past history of the throttle dynamics plays a critical role in reducing the deviation of the error correction, which in turn suggest that the throttle dynamics is generally slow for road driving. Also, the time scale dependency of the model on the driver's behaviour varies significantly from the test track to motorway environment. In the driver modeling expermient, the time scale was chosen such that the deviation of the error correlation was minimised. The test track results suggest that the chosen inputs are indeed relevant variables for modeling the driver's behaviour. Unlike that of the CLM, the degree of error deviation was found to be acceptable for the test track scenario, implying a significant nonlinear coupling of the throttle output with the speed, range and range rate data. Whereas for the motorway data, the modeling performance for both models is comparable, and the time scale of the driver model is approximately three times longer than that used in the test track data...|$|E
