5|$|City of Death was {{broadcast}} on BBC1 over four consecutive Saturdays beginning on 29 September 1979. At this time, industrial action had blacked out rival broadcaster ITV {{and as a}} result, the serial scored very high ratings, averaging 14.5 million viewers over the four episodes; 16.1 million watched the fourth episode, the largest audience ever recorded for an episode of Doctor Who. The story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from <b>Tuesday</b> <b>to</b> Friday, 12 - 15 August, 1980, achieving viewing figures of 6.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.9 million viewers respectively.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} {{predominantly}} live from Studio 1 of the BBC's Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The episodes were rehearsed from <b>Tuesday</b> <b>to</b> Saturday, usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with camera rehearsals {{in the morning}} and afternoon of transmission. Not every scene was live; a significant amount of material was on 35 mm film and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set on location or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at Ealing Studios, acquired by the BBC in 1955, where Cartier worked with the cinematographer A. A. Englander. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological dig at Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed {{that would not have been}} possible in an all-live production.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. Until 1983, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a two-week break each Christmas. The BMRB used motorcycle couriers to collect the sales figures taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. This data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>to</b> be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Music Week. On 4 January 1983, the chart was taken over by Gallup who expanded the chart from the Top 75 to the Top 100 and began the introduction of computerised tills which automated the data collection process. The chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday, due to the new automated process.|$|E

5|$|The James Edgar and Jean Jessop Hervey Public Library {{opened in}} 2003, {{replacing}} {{a much smaller}} public library. The new library, built by Conwell Shonkwiler & Associates, was partly funded by a donation via the San Diego Foundation from the Hervey family, who had {{close ties to the}} area. Jean Jessop Hervey in particular used to visit the old Point Loma Library every <b>Tuesday</b> <b>to</b> read with her children. The library, located at 3701 Voltaire Street, is over 25,000 square feet and holds over 80,000 books. It includes a kitchen area, a community meeting room, and outdoor sitting patios. The lower floor is the largest children's library in the City of San Diego, featuring a simulated ship, reading desks shaped like surfboards, an art space and a Story Time Zone. In connecting to the place of Point Loma, the library's architectural style features a nautical theme. There is even an operating periscope, salvaged from a U.S. Navy submarine, through which visitors can see the surrounding neighborhood. The floor in the entry lobby features a terrazzo map of the Point Loma Peninsula. The library holds scheduled events such as story time for children, Thursday after school movies, and arts and crafts demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and Record Retailer to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>to</b> be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures.|$|E
