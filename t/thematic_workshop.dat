40|$|The <b>Thematic</b> <b>Workshop</b> {{entitled}} “Cyberlaw, Cyber Security Law, Internet of Things and Emerging Global Trends” will aim {{to examine}} {{the current status of}} Cyberlaw as emerging discipline as also the emergence of cyber security law as prominent sub-discipline emerging within the Cyberlaw umbrella. More and more countries are increasingly coming up with new cyber security legislations and policies which have a direct impact upon all stakeholders. The advent of Internet of Things and increasing cyber security breaches means that various legal, policy and regulatory concerning the Internet of Things need to be appropriately addressed. This <b>Thematic</b> <b>Workshop</b> will also look at emerging global trends in the context of Cyberlaw and Cyber Security Law and what further {{needs to be done to}} strengthen the cyber ecosystem. The <b>Thematic</b> <b>Workshop</b> will also examine the contribution of global events like International Conference on Cyberlaw, Cybercrime & Cybersecurity for the purposes of identifying Cyberlaw and Cyber Security trends. The <b>Thematic</b> <b>Workshop</b> will also examine the current global Cyberlaw responses that need to be evolved, pursuant to the Wannacry ransomware attacks and Adylkuzz miniming malware attacks. He further highlighted the lack of a focused approach adopted by younger generation in not understanding the significance and relevance of cyber security and their ultimate contribution towards strengthening the cyber ecosystem. He further highlighted the challenges that youth of the world are currently facing and highlighting the significance of younger generation for the further growth of Internet. Saakshar Duggal highlighted that there is a need for various stakeholders including nations and legislatures to keep in mind the specific expectation of the younger generation, while they go ahead and legislate about various issues and activities in cyberspace. He further highlighted the need for proactive and tremendous capacity building and awareness programmes to be undertaken amongst the youth on emerging paradigm in Cyberlaw, Cyber Security Law, Internet of Things and other emerging technologies. Mr. Alfredo Ronchi, Secretary General, EC MEDICI Framework gave holistic approach that is emerging in the European context towards Cyberlaw and Cyber Security Law. He called for far more harmonization of existing conflicting and somewhat contradictory trends that are beginning to emerge concerning cyber security regulation. He pointed out that we live in a world in which there are already countless sensors and smart objects around us, all the time and thus, the concept of “private” becomes far more ephemeral. He further highlighted that this is not enough, what it is not collected by APPs it will be collected in a seamless mode by IoT; of course IoT will add a lot to our life but this will cost us a significant part of our privacy. He highlighted the need for consultation with all stakeholders for the purposes of going forward in the area of Cyberlaw, Cyber Security Law and Internet of Things. Other debated issues included the following:-  “Appification” of society  Information ownership  Information property  Data protection  Ethics in cyber society  Sensitive data and Privac...|$|E

30|$|The parental {{influence}} is strong on gender roles and stereotyping (see Booklet for Career Counsellors, IFAC project) {{in relation to}} the cultural milieu and the socialization perspectives that conspire to turn girls away from science-related careers towards careers that are considered more ‘convenient’ for family, less demanding, and which require fewer educational prerequisites. As it has been emphasized during the first <b>thematic</b> <b>workshop</b> of the IFAC project (see Artzmann and John 2008), parents and especially mothers influence their girls to their educational choices because studies, in their perception, are not necessarily associated with the employment, with the exception of certain fields such as medicine. Furthermore, when they encourage the girls to study mathematics and physical sciences, they perpetuate negative information problems of reconciling family and working life, glass-ceiling, male-dominated industry, etc. which, in effect, discourage girls from further pursuing relevant career choices or higher positions.|$|E

40|$|INTERDYNAMIK <b>thematic</b> <b>workshop</b> on {{vegetation}} dynamics Workshop rationale The {{geographical distribution}} of dominant land plant forms is mainly controlled by climate. If climate alters, the vegetation cover closely follows {{the change in}} the climatic patterns. In turn, changes in spatial distribution and composition of terrestrial vegetation alter the climate through modifications of heat and water fluxes, atmospheric gas and aerosol composition. Biogeochemical and biogeophysical mechanisms form numerous feedbacks between biosphere and climate that were active during the Earth’s geological past, continue to operate at present, and will be important in the future. Analysis of climate-biosphere feedbacks and their role in the climate system dynamics during Quaternary is a new, rapidly developing scientific field that relies on climate system modeling and proxy data analysis. Within INTERDYNAMIK, many projects (COIN, DAMOCLES, GLUES, HOBIMED, HOLOPARC, MISO, Veg-Clim-Man) use coupled climate-vegetation models which are applied to different questions including a role of vegetation cover in climate change during interglacials. Several dynamic vegetation models are used in these projects: two differen...|$|E
40|$|Rice is a profligate user of water. It takes 3, 000 – 5, 000 liters {{to produce}} 1 {{kilogram}} of rice, {{which is about}} 2 to 3 times more than to produce 1 kilogram of other cereals such as wheat or maize. Until recently, this amount of water has been taken for granted. Now, however, the water crisis threatens the sustainability of the irrigated rice ecosystem. In Asia, 17 million ha of irrigated rice areas may experience ‘physical water scarcity’ and 22 million ha ‘economic water scarcity’ by 2025. To safeguard food security and preserve precious water resources, ways must be explored to grow rice using less water. IRRI, together with Plant Research International of Wageningen University and Research Centre, organized a <b>thematic</b> <b>workshop</b> on Water-Wise Rice Production held 8 - 11 April 2002 at IRRI, Los Baños, Philippines.

40|$|Will {{there be}} enough plant {{nutrients}} {{to feed a}} world of 9 billion in 2050 ? is the central question addressed by a JRC study. This exercise was based on consultations with experts and a <b>thematic</b> <b>workshop</b> focused on three areas of interest: 1) the demand for fertilizers to sustain crop production necessary to feed the world in 2050; 2) perspectives on the supply of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) to world agriculture and 3) the role of innovation and technology in changing the match between demand and supply of fertilizers. Implications of the main findings for current EU and international policies were addressed. Overall, analysis of existing literature and discussions with major experts and stakeholders led {{to the conclusion that}} while the situation is currently not critical with respect to the production and availability of plant nutrients, it is important to remain vigilant. The question of reserves (P and K), access, changing geopolitical conditions, economic development, energy costs (mainly for N) and environmental constraints (N and P) could lead to shortfalls and possibly crisis situations in some regions of the world. The situation of Africa deserves particular attention as production, access and use of fertilizers represent key limiting factors in boosting food production in that continent. JRC.
