5|$|Bivalves {{developed}} at <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> of Lake Cahuilla. These include Anodonta californiensis and possibly Pisidium casertanum. Anodonta shells are sometimes found {{within their own}} tunnels. They were probably used by inhabitants as a food source or to make shell beads. Gastropods identified include Amnicola longinqua, Gyraulus parvus, Helisoma trivolvis, Physella ampullacea, Physella humerosa and Tryonia protea. These taxa were relatively abundant at <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> of the lake. Ostracods include Cypridopsis vidua, Cyprinotus torosa and Limnocythere ceriotuberosa. Sponges {{have been identified in}} fossil deposits as well. One mammal found in the lake was the muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus.|$|E

5000|$|To {{someone on}} a vessel, <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> to lee {{of the vessel}} is <b>the</b> lee <b>shore,</b> and since that is <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>the</b> wind reaches first, to someone on <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> it is <b>the</b> {{windward}} <b>shore.</b> [...] "Lee" [...] historically means [...] "shelter". Standing on the leeward side of the vessel, a sailor observes being blown towards an exposed shoreline by the wind. Here again the reference point from which a shore is viewed determines whether it is <b>the</b> lee <b>shore</b> or a leeward shore. On a lake, the reference point is a body of water, so <b>the</b> windward <b>shore</b> is upwind {{of the center of}} the lake. On an island, the reference point is a landmass, so <b>the</b> windward <b>shore</b> is <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> upwind (most to windward) of the center of the island. On a vessel, however, the windward rail is the one the wind is hitting first, or the one most upwind.

5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off <b>the</b> <b>shores</b> of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster harvesting and cod fishing was reestablished, most fishermen found that the lobster and cod had migrated away from <b>the</b> <b>shores.</b>|$|E
