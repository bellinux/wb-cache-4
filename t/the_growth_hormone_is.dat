The application of two different crystalline preparations of growth substance, auxin B and Hetero-auxin, to decapitated Pisum shows these to be at least as active in causing inhibition as the impure preparation from Rhizopus, when used in the same growth substance concentrations. A third crystalline compound, auxin A, which had lost most of its growth-promoting activity produced no inhibition.

40|$|This {{study was}} made to {{investigate}} the main cause which the scape of Taraxacum officinale inclinated after the flowering and standed up again at {{the stage of the}} fruit ripening. The scape elongation, the angle of inclination of the scape, and the flower head weight were measured during the flower development. Moreover, experiments were done to determine the source of the growth hormone for the scape elongation, and the osmotic pressure of the epidermis at upper, center, and lower parts of the scape was also measured. We concluded from these results that the change in the head weight and the osmotic pressure are closely related to the inclinating and standing up, and the fact obtained from the experiments strongly suggests that the source of <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>is</b> not the flower head but the roots...|$|E
30|$|Cholestasis is {{a common}} {{clinical}} problem associated with bile duct obstructed diseases such as choledocholithiasis, periampullary cancer, and hepatocellular carcinomas. EGF and HGF have beneficial effects on liver injury and hepatic regeneration (Holmes et al. 2007; Noguchi et al. 1991; Berlanga et al. 1998). HGF, a potent mitogen for hepatocytes, is increased in various liver diseases. HGF has beneficial effects on hepatic cholestatic fibrosis (Li et al. 2007; Xia et al. 2006). Recent evidence has indicated that <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>is</b> involved in liver regeneration. In liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomized mice, liver-specific IGF type 1 receptor knockout caused {{a significant decrease in}} hepatocyte proliferation in males (Desbois-Mouthon et al. 2006). TGF-beta 1 plays a role in the liver cell regeneration and atypical bile duct proliferation and in areas of rapidly progressing atypical bile duct proliferation (Takiya et al. 1995). Serum HGF levels decreased gradually after biliary drainage in patients who showed decreased serum bilirubin levels (Higaki et al. 1999).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the growth hormone of plants have {{indicated}} its very wide distribution in both the plant and animal worlds. Its function in promoting growth by cell elongation, while {{so far as we}} know confined to plant tissues, is, nevertheless, of a completely nonspecific nature. Coleoptiles of Gramineae, stems of Cornmelinaceae, flower stalks of Compositae, stems of Legumiuosae and the gynostemia of some orchids are all subject to the influence of the hormone, and, so far as cell elongation is concerned, are probably completely dependent upon it. Nevertheless, the presence and quantity of the growth hormone in many plant tissues is difficult to establish, largely because, although soluble in water, the substance appears not to be extracted on grinding the tissues with water. Thus,. Went (1928) was able to extract growth substance from coleoptiles of Arena by placing them on agar but not by grinding with water. In the course of various attempts to determine the growth substance in plant tissues, it was found that in general only small amounts could be extracted on grinding with water, while extraction with organic solvents often yielded considerable amounts of the hormone. Furthermore, it was shown in Part I of this series (Dolk and Thimann, 1932) that <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> <b>is</b> a relatively strong acid, of pK = 4. 75, and hence it follows that in order to extract it in organic solvents the aqueous tissue must be brought to a hydrogen ion concentration of at least 10 [...] 8.
