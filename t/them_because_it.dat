5|$|However, others {{note that}} the former Dadaist leader would often show himself a {{follower}} of political guidelines. As early as 1934, Tzara, together with Breton, Éluard and communist writer René Crevel, organized an informal trial of independent-minded Surrealist Salvador Dalí, {{who was at the}} time a confessed admirer of Hitler, and whose portrait of William Tell had alarmed <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> shared likeness with Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. Historian Irina Livezeanu notes that Tzara, who agreed with Stalinism and shunned Trotskyism, submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of socialist realism. At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public. This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.|$|E

For example, in Jinhua, Zhejiang, in China, it is said that a cat, after having been raised for three years by humans, would then start bewitching <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> is said that cats with white tails are especially good at this, there arose the custom of refraining from raising white cats. Since it is said that their ability to bewitch humans comes from taking in the spiritual energy of the moon, it is said that when a cat looks up at the moon, whether its tail has been cut or not, it should be killed on the spot.|$|E

25|$|Fictitious {{forces can}} be {{considered}} to do work, provided that they move an object on a trajectory that changes its energy from potential to kinetic. For example, consider {{a person in a}} rotating chair holding a weight in their outstretched hand. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, {{from the perspective of the}} rotating reference frame, they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let go, it spontaneously flies outward relative to the rotating reference frame, because the centrifugal force does work on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can be different in a non-inertial frame than an inertial one.|$|E

Kang and Kodos kidnap both Dole and Clinton, placing them in suspended animation tubes and assuming their forms through [...] "bio-duplication" [...] to ensure {{that one of them}} will become the next leader. Before returning Homer to Earth, the aliens soak him in rum, so nobody will believe him. As the election nears, the impostor candidates are seen to be acting strangely, holding hands in public and making bizarre declarations in unhumanlike monotone. Later on, Homer stumbles upon the badly hidden spaceship and tries to save Dole and Clinton, with both candidates agreeing they should join forces to defeat the aliens; however, Homer accidentally ejects them into space. On the day before the election, Homer crashes the spaceship into the Capitol and reveals the candidates' real identities. However, despite being exposed, Kang and Kodos declare to the people that they still have to choose one of <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is too late to get new candidates. Kang is subsequently elected president and enslaves all of humanity.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{took more}} than two years to develop. Sierra {{officials}} said this was because it was so different from anything that had been done previously, in both the Hollywood or computer game industries, and the new challenges led to complexities. Roberta Williams said: [...] "It took a full year just to get people to understand what I wanted to do." [...] The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released. It was originally planned that the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994, with Sierra saying it would come out no later than the fall of 1994. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994, where it was announced the release date had been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs. The game ultimately required seven discs. The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994, and then February 1995, before Sierra said it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live-action video. It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995, but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games, Phantasmagoria was not among <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was not ready yet.|$|E
