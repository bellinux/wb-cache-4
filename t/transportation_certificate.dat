5|$|Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005. Once the {{new owners}} were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel {{submitted}} the required U.S. Department of <b>Transportation</b> <b>certificate</b> application on December 9, 2005. Unfortunately, despite significant {{public support for the}} new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.|$|E
50|$|The airline did {{not possess}} a Department of <b>Transportation</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Public Convenience and Necessity and was {{receiving}} scrutiny from DOT about the proposed Braniff. During January, 1990, the DOT {{made it clear}} to BNAir that DOT did not believe that Braniff's management team, headed by Scot Spencer, was capable of conducting airline operations. Their belief was based on the conduct of Spencer while employed with BIA's successor Braniff, Inc., and his lengthy criminal history.|$|E

40|$|Multimodality {{defines the}} ability to travel {{with a choice of}} {{different}} transportation modes. This report combines different approaches and methods to analyze multimodality and inform about integration of multiple transportation modes with cities. It assesses three methods: green building and sustainable neighborhood certification systems (LEED, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), accessibility indexes (Walk Score, [URL] and travel forecasting tools (Trafikverket’s Trafikalstring, Swedish Transportation Administration’s Trip Generation Tool, [URL] It also proposes instituting Multimodal <b>Transportation</b> Performance <b>Certificates</b> (MTPC) as a hybrid method. The focus is on urban form, physical integration of transportation systems in cities and on urbanism that can make multimodality possible. Accordingly, MTPC measures physical integration of different transportation systems (walking, cycling, public transportation and private car) with cities. Its indicators include design elements (streets, buildings, building façades, building heights, bike racks, parking lots, bus stops, subway exits, etc.), place characteristics (density, diversity, etc.) and accessibility (network access to local and regional destinations) that have indirect, but profound effect on travel.

40|$|The {{demand for}} skilled {{transportation}} professionals that possess a breadth of interdisciplinary backgrounds including planning, public policy, and finance is higher {{now than ever}} before in the U. S. However, there are few educational programs that address the field of transportation in a comprehensive and interdisciplinary manner. <b>Transportation</b> <b>certificate</b> programs that offer professional training in transportation planning can play a crucial role by providing a substantive base of knowledge through required and elective coursework delivered on campus or online. This paper shares insights and observations from Texas A&M University’s interdisciplinary <b>transportation</b> <b>certificate</b> program, offered both through an existing degree program and online for non-degree seeking students. In addition to discussing curriculum development, certificate implementation, and marketing and recruiting efforts, this paper shares insights on implementing a distance learning <b>transportation</b> <b>certificate.</b> This study also evaluates the <b>transportation</b> <b>certificate</b> program by analyzing data on student characteristics, graduation and retention rates, and job placement. Specific recommendations and guidelines for implementing a <b>transportation</b> <b>certificate</b> program are offered that may be of value to other universities and institutions seeking to develop a similar program...|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{sustainability}} {{has become}} one of the fundamental goals of many urban transportation systems in the past two decades. The emerging concept of sustainability has developed enormous interests among researchers and practitioners to develop a sustainable transport system. While many have focused on developing an appropriate definition of a sustainable transport by measures and indicators of sustainability to assess if a transport system is moving towards or away from sustainability, many others have put forward different strategies to make a transport system sustainable. Defining sustainable transport and identifying indicators are important to make this concept more correct, focused, and measurable. This study tries to measure and monitories urban transportation sustainability from viewpoint of anÿurban planner. The question comes out from the relation between urban transportation sustainability and usage of public transportation. How these two facts link to each other? Are there any logical relations between usage of public transportation and sustainable development? How we can define specific indicator for measuring sustainability of transportation or on the other words, how can we standardized indicator to measure and monitor the urban sustainable transportation? For response, exceeding questions two cities are selected which have a similarity and differences in structure and data sets. Our approach is to draw upon a raft of suitable analytical techniques to find out the approach base for comparison of structure between different cities, and then to apply the examples to examine the degree to which specified policy targets might be met in the future. The analytical framework includes Descriptive statistics, correlation and Regression analysis, and application of sustainable transportation indicator for case studies distributions. The techniques proposed to provide a starting point for that dialogue toward more appropriate policies and their monitoring. It can be concluded that the new approach of sustainable transportation indicator for measuring sustainability of transportation is highly correlated with selected variables, which indicates that the new indicator has meaningful applicability to be used as indicator for <b>transportation</b> <b>certificate</b> system. This methods can be used for measuring, monitoring, and evaluating the sustainability of urban transportation for different areas and used the results as a standardize indicator for <b>transportation</b> <b>certificate</b> system for comparing and ranking the transportation sustainability of different cities. In addition, the result of this study can be used as for monitoring and assessment of plan for (SUMP) Sustainable urban mobility planning...|$|E

On May 28, 2015, Eastern launched charter flights with a Boeing 737-800 aircraft from Miami International Airport (MIA) to José Martí International Airport in Havana and back to MIA. Two days later, the airline flew as part of Honor Flight, flying 60 veterans to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport outside of Washington, D.C. Scheduled service was planned to follow 12 to 18 months later.|$|R
2500|$|America West Airlines and the US Airways merged FAA {{certificates}} on September 25, 2007. Former America West employees (including pilots, fleet service personnel, flight attendants) {{remained on}} their original America West union contracts {{and did not}} fully combine work forces with their pre-merger US Airways counterparts. Until October 2008, former America West aircraft flew with their respective crews and used the call sign [...] "CACTUS", while the pre-merger US Airways crews primarily flew with their respective aircraft and used the call sign [...] "US AIR". In October 2008, the company began operating under a single operating certificate (that of the former US Airways). This required operation under a single call sign and identifier, and that of America West ("CACTUS" [...] and [...] "AWE") were chosen {{as a sign of}} the company lineage. In addition, flights operated using former America West aircraft and crews were numbered 1–699, whereas flights operated by pre-merger US Airways aircraft and crews were numbered 700–1999. (Flights numbered 2000–2199 were shuttle services and those 2200 and higher were operated by express subsidiaries.) Aircraft operated by pre-merger US Airways crews or former America West crews flew under two different United States Department of <b>Transportation</b> operating <b>certificates</b> until September 25, 2007. However, until pilot and flight attendant union groups from both sides successfully negotiated a single contract, each group of crewmembers would fly only on its pre-merger airlines' aircraft and the flights would be marked accordingly.|$|R
