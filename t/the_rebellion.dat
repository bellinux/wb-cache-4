5|$|An {{expedition}} to Ross by King William {{and his brother}} Earl David in 1179 may have been related to Harald's activities. Two years later <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> of Domnall, son of Máel Coluim mac Uilleim, broke out in Ross and Moray, and it is presumed that Earl Harald {{played a part in}} this. <b>The</b> <b>rebellion</b> was not finally suppressed until 1187.|$|E

5|$|According to Baladhuri, al-Jarrah {{was born}} in Jordan, and {{probably}} followed Sufyan ibn al-Abrad al-Kalbi and Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Hakami to Iraq in 696. In 701, he fought against <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> of Ibn al-Ash'ath.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of <b>the</b> <b>rebellion,</b> most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, from where they hoped to head north to German territory. Chilembwe was seen by a patrol of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other rebels were captured; 300 were imprisoned following <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> and 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> did {{not itself}} achieve lasting success, it is {{commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. <b>The</b> <b>rebellion</b> had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E

Mutual reasons for all three rebellions were loss of support of Gustav I among the Dalecarlian peasantry because of the economic crisis, the increased royal power and the unpopular Swedish Reformation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{inherently}} conservative {{nature of}} all three rebellions, but particularly those of 1549, is emphasised, as is their protagonists focus on local issues and avowed subservience to Edward VI (cries of [...] "God Save the King" [...] were heard among the Kett rebels in August 1549). The class antagonisms underlying <b>the</b> <b>rebellions</b> {{are considered to be}} exaggerated, and, in any case, what antagonisms existed merely weakened <b>the</b> <b>rebellions.</b> On a practical level, <b>the</b> <b>rebellions</b> were marred by chaos and blunder. They never, then, in any way directly challenged the state.|$|R

However, Isa dissuaded Sunqur from joining the Ilkhanids' army, and was dismissed {{from his post}} when Qalawun's forces suppressed <b>the</b> <b>rebellion.</b> Isa was reinstalled by 1280, and in the following year, played a decisive role as a commander in the Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanate at the Second Battle of Homs. After his death, Isa was succeeded by his son Muhanna, and throughout the 14th century, Isa's direct descendants held the office of amir al-ʿarab with occasional interruption.|$|E
5|$|In the Bishop's Wars castles {{that held}} out for the king against the Covenanters, {{including}} Caerlaverock and Threave in 1640, were slighted, with their roofs removed and walls breached to make them uninhabitable. Tantallon {{was used as a}} base for Scottish attacks on Oliver Cromwell's advancing army in 1651. As a result, it was pounded into submission by the New Model Army's siege train, losing its end towers and ceasing to be a residence from that point. The sequence of Jacobite risings from 1689 threatened the Crown in Scotland, culminating in <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> in 1745. Stirling was able to withstand the Jacobite attack in 1745 and the siege of Blair Castle, at the end of <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> in 1746, was the final castle siege to occur in the British Isles. In the aftermath of the conflict Corgaff and many others castles were used as barracks for the forces sent to garrison the Highlands. Kildrummy, Huntly and Doune were destroyed {{as a result of their}} part in <b>the</b> <b>rebellion.</b>|$|E

In it, Albert Gallatin joins <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> in 1794 to benefit the farmers, rather than the fledgling US Government as he did in reality. This results in <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> becoming a Second American Revolution. This eventually leads to George Washington being overthrown and executed for treason, the abrogation of the Constitution, and Gallatin being proclaimed the second president and serving as president until 1812.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Republican Army who {{had come}} from Indonesian Hizbullah felt betrayed by the Indonesian Government. In May 1948, they {{declared}} a break-away regime, the Negara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State), better known as Darul Islam. Led by an Islamic mystic, Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo, Darul Islam sought to establish Indonesia as an Islamic theocracy. At the time, the Republican Government did not respond, as they were focused on the threat from the Dutch. Some leaders of Masjumi sympathised with <b>the</b> <b>rebellion.</b> After the Republic regained all territories in 1950, the government took the Darul Islam threat seriously, especially after some provinces declared that they had joined Darul Islam. <b>The</b> <b>rebellion</b> was put down in 1962.|$|E

25|$|Even {{if she was}} not {{the chief}} queen, Hla Wun quickly became the king's most trusted confidant and adviser. Chronicles recount several {{instances}} when she advised the king (even if he did not always take her advice). Her first key advice was to recall Yazathingyan to put down <b>the</b> <b>rebellions.</b> <b>The</b> king, who had just exiled the old minister, grudgingly agreed to her advice in 1258.

5|$|Situated on the River Medway and Watling Street, Rochester {{served as}} a {{strategically}} important royal castle. During the late medieval period it helped protect England's south-east coast from invasion. The first castle at Rochester was founded {{in the aftermath of}} the Norman Conquest. It was given to Bishop Odo, probably by his half-brother William the Conqueror. During <b>the</b> <b>Rebellion</b> of 1088 over the succession to the English throne, Odo supported Robert Curthose, the Conqueror's eldest son, against William Rufus. It was during this conflict that the castle first saw military action; the city and castle were besieged after Odo made Rochester a headquarters for <b>the</b> <b>rebellion.</b> After the garrison capitulated, this first castle was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk was the {{dominant}} magnate in the East Anglia region. When the region's peasants revolted in 1381, {{he became a}} central figure in their repression. While in Bury St Edmunds, he was taken by surprise by the rebels while eating dinner. The rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster, attempted to force Suffolk to join <b>the</b> <b>rebellion,</b> hoping to lend legitimacy to the cause. When this failed, Litster turned to other prominent men. Suffolk then fled disguised as a groom, reaching London by way of St Albans. He soon returned to Bury with a force of 500 lances, and met little resistance. Much of the work suppressing <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> had been undertaken by Henry Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, leaving Suffolk to apprehend the remaining rebels for trial. In <b>the</b> <b>rebellion</b> Suffolk suffered financially: the peasants plundered property worth £1,000 from his castle at Mettingham.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians now {{ended their}} {{alliance}} with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved {{to be anything but}} the easy prey that Aristagoras had described. However, the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians did not seem to follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join <b>the</b> <b>rebellion.</b> Furthermore, seeing the spread of <b>the</b> <b>rebellion,</b> the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.|$|E
