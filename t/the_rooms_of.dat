5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, over 100 western {{movies were}} filmed in nearby Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon. The Hotel Monte Vista in Flagstaff hosted many film stars during this era, {{including}} Jane Russell, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, and Bing Crosby. A {{scene from the}} movie Casablanca was filmed in one of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the hotel.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Frets {{is located}} on the fourth terrace of the Acropolis. The south facade of the palace is {{decorated}} with four large stepped frets. On {{the east side of the}} palace a stairway leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco. One of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the palace contains a stucco decoration representing feathered serpents and crossed bones.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{has also}} been used in other styles of architecture. For instance, Leonardo da Vinci sketched this shape as the plan for a fortification. A modern high-rise building, the Kölntriangle in Cologne, Germany, was built with a Reuleaux triangle cross-section. Together with the circular shape of its core, this gives varied depths to <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the building.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundations}} of the last mansio built at the site, and its associated bath-house, were uncovered by archaeologists in 1912–13. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> both the mansio and bath-house were emptied and the stone foundations were exposed. This work left, in some lower stratified levels, traces of the two earlier wooden mansiones.|$|E
5|$|All five {{floors are}} {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike stair in the south-west. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the upper floors have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E
5|$|Back at Berkeley from Johns Hopkins, Stratton {{stayed in}} the {{philosophy}} department as its second faculty member and first psychology specialist until the psychology department broke off in 1922. The new department started with four people: Stratton as chair; Edward Chace Tolman, with a Harvard degree, and an initiator of rodent experiments soiling <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the philosophy department and hastening the split of the psychology division; Brown, Stratton's earlier student and Berkeley faculty member from 1908 onward; and Olga Bridgman, the first Berkeley psychology PhD awardee, albeit from the philosophy department. Before the split Stratton had set up Berkeley's first psychology lab in the philosophy department and taught psychology courses with Brown. The courses included sensation, perception, emotion, memory, and applications of psychology to professions such as law, medicine, schooling and clerical work by priests.|$|E
30|$|Thermophoretic forces {{between the}} gas and surface lining are greatly {{dependent}} on the burning regime of the fire. In {{the early stages of}} a fire and through fuel-controlled conditions, the production of the incomplete combustion byproducts (HCN, CO, UHCs) is typically minor. The production increases substantially as the compartment fire becomes ventilation-limited. The higher temperatures and higher velocities of smoke cause greater collection of soot deposits to form in certain locations within the compartment. As the temperatures are higher in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> origin it is expected that an upper layer will be affecting those surfaces higher in elevation. Conversely, as the smoke moves away from <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> origin <b>the</b> temperatures will decrease, which causes the smoke to descend within the compartment causing lighter soot to deposit across the entire elevation of wall surfaces. Therefore, it is expected that soot deposition on wall surfaces to be greatest in thickness and higher in elevation closer to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> origin and lesser in thickness and lower in elevation as one moves away from <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> origin. Often times the soot deposited within <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> origin will be higher in elevation with distinct lines of demarcation and thick soot deposits. Soot deposited in <b>rooms</b> away from <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> origin have a fairly uniform soot deposition on all surfaces extending from floor to ceiling (Wolfe et al. 2009).|$|R

5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the status}} of its builder, Doune {{reflected}} current ideas of what a royal castle building should be. It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the Lord and his family, and a separate tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms. The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century, with only minor repairs carried out in the 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 Hope-Weir's {{grandson}} James Hope-Vere (1785–1843) asked Thomas Brown {{to provide}} designs for an attic extension, although this was never carried out. Ten years later, William Burn was commissioned {{to design a}} new north wing, incorporating a dining room, with new kitchens below and bedrooms above. The front of this extension was topped by a pediment matching Bruce's original, complete with pineapples, although this too was removed in the 1950s. The rear is bowed, with a curved stair led down to the garden at the rear. Plans for a matching wing to the south were never carried out. Burn also remodelled the interior, creating a large drawing room from <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the south apartment.|$|E

5|$|Later, Jack asks Liz {{about her}} {{relationship}} with her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon), an airline pilot. She tells him that during the summer break the two met twice a month in a hotel. Jack does not believe that the relationship is serious since Carol never stays at Liz's apartment. He decides to force Carol to stay with Liz and reserves all <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the hotel that Liz and Carol stay in when he is in New York. During his stay with Liz, Carol bursts into tears and asks her where their relationship is heading as he believes that she is resisting him, which she denies. The next day, Carol decides to leave New York early, but tells Liz that they need to work on their relationship. The two go their separate ways and agree to meet again on October 14.|$|E
5|$|The Musée {{des arts}} décoratifs (Museum of Decorative arts) {{is on the}} ground floor. It was {{established}} in its current form in the years 1920–1924, when the collections of the Kunstgewerbe-Museum Hohenlohe, originally established in 1887, were relocated in the stables wing adjacent to the palace apartments. The collections had previously been in the Renaissance former municipal slaughterhouse Grandes Boucheries or Große Metzig, which now hosts the Musée historique de Strasbourg.) The Musée des arts décoratifs suffered in the World War II bombing raids of 1944 but the building has since been restored and the collections replenished. Besides the furniture and decoration of the cardinals' apartments, the collections focus on the local production of porcelain (Strasbourg faience), silver-gilt, and clockmaking, with original parts of the medieval Strasbourg astronomical clock including the automaton rooster from 1354. The reconstructed living room of a former hôtel particulier, the 1750s Hôtel Oesinger, displays 18th-century furniture in situ on a more intimate scale than <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the palace.|$|E
5|$|When {{paying a}} state visit to Britain, foreign {{heads of state}} are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are {{allocated}} a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated {{at the foot of}} the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane. A second corridor in the suite has Gothic-influenced cross-over vaulting. The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle LéopoldI, first King of the Belgians. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King EdwardVIII.|$|E

5|$|To {{enter the}} ride, guests {{walk through the}} gates of Hogwarts and begin their journey in the dungeons where they see items {{featured}} in the movies and books. Passengers enter through the castle doors, go to the lockers, queue outside in the green house and then enter the back castle doors. Objects recognizable from the series include the Mirror of Erised, the Hogwarts House Jewels, and talking portraits. As guests proceed throughout the hallways, they encounter replicas of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> Hogwarts castle, including the Headmaster's office, the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom and the Gryffindor common room. In the Headmaster's office, Professor Dumbledore extends a warm welcome to all Muggles, informing them that Professor Binns is hosting a lecture {{on the history of}} the school. In the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear from under the Invisibility Cloak, urging guests to meet them in the Room of Requirement in order to sneak everyone down to a Quidditch match. Ron tries to cast a spell, which goes wrong, and one of several special effects, such as falling snow, is triggered. Before continuing on, visitors receive a safety reminder from the Sorting Hat and several paintings in the next two rooms.|$|E
5|$|When Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13thcentury, new walls {{surrounding}} the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, {{with a narrow}} gap between them {{in the west and}} south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.|$|E
