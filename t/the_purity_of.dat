5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected <b>the</b> <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism.

5|$|Enthusiasts claim {{descent from}} the horses {{painted on the}} cave walls of Lascaux, though {{this has not been}} {{verified}} by scientific studies. Horses have been recorded in the area since at least the 10th century, and the regional type was preferred by magistrates and clergy in medieval times. The Poitevin breed as it is known today began to take shape in the early 17th century, as engineers began draining the French marshes and brought with them their draft horses, which were crossed with native horses. Since early in its history, the Poitevin has been used extensively for the breeding of mules, and although commonly called a draft horse, was not favored for agricultural purposes. During the 19th century, the population of the Poitevin increased, reaching 50,000 pure and crossbred mares by 1867. Crossbreeding with other draft breeds led to concerns about <b>the</b> <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the Poitevin population, but a small group of breeders worked to preserve the remaining purebred population.|$|E

40|$|In China, Poacynum hendersonii is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} substitute for Apoacynum venetum L (Luobuma), which is a famous traditional Chinese medicine. Quercetin- 3 - 0 -sophoroside and isoquercitrin are two major flavonoids in Poacynum hendersonii leaves. In this work, a suitable method was established for the large-scale preparation of quercetin- 3 - 0 -sophoroside (QOS) and isoquercitrin (ISO) from Poacynum hendersonii leaves using macroporous resin combined with Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography. The adsorption/desorption capacities and desorption ratios of six macroporous resins were evaluated using static experiments. The HPD- 300 resin had the best adsorption performance because it had the largest surface area, and was selected for further study. Compared with pseudo -first-order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models, the pseudo -second-order model could better fit the adsorption kinetics of both QOS and ISO on the HPD- 300 resin. In addition, the adsorption isotherms of the two compounds on the HPD- 300 resin were fitted well to the Langmuir model. Under optimal conditions, <b>the</b> <b>purities</b> <b>of</b> QOS and ISO in the product were increased from 2. 16 % and 1. 26 % to 21. 34 % and 10. 70 % with recovery yields of 82. 1 % and 77. 3 %, respectively.
