5|$|Budgeted at £300,000 – an {{increase}} of one fifth over Thunderbirds Are Go – in their approach to writing the sequel the Andersons decided to script a more light-hearted adventure to counter <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the original.

5|$|Egyptian air {{and naval}} forces began bombing and {{shelling}} raids in the Saudi southwestern city of Najran and the coastal town of Jizan, which were staging points for royalist forces. In response, the Saudis purchased a British Thunderbird air defense system and developed their airfield in Khamis Mushayt. Riyadh also attempted to convince Washington to respond on its behalf. President Kennedy sent only a wing of jet fighters and bombers to Dhahran Airbase, demonstrating to Nasser <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> American commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Brown {{was briefly}} hospitalized for hypertension, {{and near the}} end of his term, he {{underwent}} quadruple bypass surgery.

He had no pulse for a period of time, and one of his lungs partially collapsed. Brown's office tried to conceal <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> his condition, drawing fire from the press.

5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> {{the situation on}} Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for {{the movement of the}} rest of the 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E
5|$|The first Native Americans {{to become}} Orthodox were the Aleuts living {{in contact with}} Siberian fur traders in the mid 18th century. They had been baptized mostly by their Orthodox trading {{partners}} or during occasional visits by priests serving aboard exploring vessels of the Russian navy. Russian colony in Alaska was established in 1784 by merchant Grigory Shelikhov. Shelikhov's attempt to colonize Kodiak Island was met with resistance by the native population. He returned to Russia and installed Alexandr Baranov {{as director of the}} colony. In order to convince the Russian imperial court of <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> his colonial ambitions, Shelikhov recruited volunteers from the Valaam, an environment that appears strikingly similar to the Kodiak archipelago's landscape, and Konevitsa monasteries to travel to the new colony.|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E

40|$|The {{market for}} {{environmentally}} friendly products in Turkey is growing, and marketing experts {{are trying to}} understand the behavior of the consumers in this market with the help of variables such as demographic factors, information, attitudes, values and life styles. This study analyzes the effects of environmental activism, environmental knowledge and <b>the</b> perceived <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> environmental problems on green buying behavior. The study involved 516 Turkish consumers, over eighteen years of age. The results show that environmental activism, environmental knowledge and <b>the</b> perceived <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> environmental problems are all meaningful factors in environmentally friendly buying behavior. It was found that the most explanatory variables are environmental activism for proactive environmentally friendly buying behavior and <b>the</b> perceived <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> environmental problems for optional environmentally friendly buying behavior. The study is significant since it will offer insights for green marketing experts who especially target specific segments as activists, voluntary simplifiers or green consumers in Turkey...|$|R
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> this loss, {{it was in}} Asia Minor {{that the}} empire's {{greatest}} disaster would take place. The Seljuk Turks, although mainly concerned with defeating Egypt under the Fatimids, nevertheless {{conducted a series of}} damaging raids into Armenia and eastern Anatolia– the main recruiting ground for Byzantine armies. With imperial armies weakened by years of insufficient funding and civil warfare, Emperor Romanos Diogenes realised that a time of re-structuring and re-equipment was necessary. Consequently, he attempted to lead a defensive campaign in the east until his forces had recovered enough to defeat the Seljuks. However, he suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of Alp Arslan (Sultan of the Seljuk Turks) at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Romanos was captured, and although the Sultan's peace terms were fairly lenient, the battle in the long term resulted in the total loss of Byzantine Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1884, Grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late October when he learned it was cancer, {{possibly}} caused by his frequent cigar smoking. Grant chose not to reveal <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> his condition to his wife, who soon found out from Grant's doctor. Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; {{it would be his}} last public appearance. In March of the following year, the New York Times announced that Grant was dying of cancer and a nationwide public concern for the former president began. Knowing of Grant and Julia's financial difficulties, Congress sought to honor him and restored him to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay (Grant's assumption of the Presidency in 1869 had required that he resign his commission and forfeit his pension).|$|E
5|$|Political {{activism}} in American gay communities was {{transformed by the}} arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used direct action tactics. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups Queer Nation, Pink Panthers and the Lesbian Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.|$|E

Isaac and Miria make up their minds to ask the Rail Tracer to leave, oblivious to <b>the</b> <b>seriousness</b> <b>of</b> the situation and how dangerous the Rail Tracer is. They find Czeslaw's body underneath the train in their search for the monster. When trying to rescue him, Isaac cuts himself, revealing their immortality to Czeslaw. Believing they are trying to devour him, the boy decides to devour them first, but changes his mind after they rescue him and promise to be his family. After the train arrives in Manhattan, they realize they never bought Ennis a present and tell her their gift is Czeslaw, who will be her younger brother.|$|E
