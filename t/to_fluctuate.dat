5|$|By 1882, Castle {{contained}} some 79 undergraduates out of 205 at {{the university}} as a whole. Despite the university largely failing to gain recognition and prestige, {{a number of other}} colleges had opened {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century. Of these, Cosin's Hall failed to become financially viable and was absorbed into University College in 1864. Enrolment numbers continued <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate.</b>|$|E

When {{run on a}} finite array of cells with periodic boundary conditions, starting from a small seed of random cells centered within a larger empty neighborhood, it tends <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate</b> between ordered and chaotic states. However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E

5|$|HD 205739 b is a Jupiter-size planet. The {{estimated}} minimum mass is 1.37 {{times the}} mass of Jupiter. The planet {{has been found to}} orbit its host star every 279.8 days at a distance of 0.896 AU, which is approximately 89.6% of the mean distance between the Sun and the Earth. HD 205739 b has a mildly elliptical orbit, given its orbital eccentricity of 0.27. The planet's elliptical orbit is typical with respect to discovered planets whose orbits are longer than twenty days and have not grown circular because of tidal forces. According to its discoverers, HD 205739 b's elongated orbit causes its surface temperature <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate</b> by up to 100 K.|$|E
5|$|Soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic, but {{insoluble}} thulium salts {{are completely}} nontoxic. When injected, thulium can cause degeneration {{of the liver}} and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate.</b> Liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice than female mice. Despite this, thulium has {{a low level of}} toxicity. In humans, thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver, kidneys and bones. Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year. The roots of plants do not take up thulium, and the dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium. Thulium dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions. Radioactive thulium isotopes can cause radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The East Riding is characterised {{by a high}} {{employment}} rate and a relatively low unemployment level.

Unemployment levels tend <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate</b> {{over the course of}} the year with lower levels during the summer months due to increased employment in the tourism and food production sectors. A major year-round employer in the East Riding is the Defence School of Transport at RAF Leconfield, which trains 14,000 personnel from the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines each year and provides more than 1,000 civilian jobs.|$|E
40|$|Postprandial {{hyperglycemia}} is implicated as a {{risk factor}} predisposing to vascular complications. This {{study was designed to}} assess recurrent short-term increases in glucose on markers of renal fibrogenesis. Human renal cortical fibroblasts were exposed <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> short-term (2 h) increases to 15 mM D-glucose, three times a day over 72 h, on a background of 5 mM D-glucose. To determine whether observed changes were due <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> osmolality, identical experiments were undertaken with cells exposed to L-glucose. Parallel experiments were performed in cells exposed to 5 mM D-glucose and constant exposure to either 15 or 7. 5 mM D-glucose. Fluctuating D-glucose increased extracellular matrix, as measured by proline incorporation (P < 0. 05), collagen IV (P < 0. 005), and fibronectin production (P < 0. 001), in association with increased tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) (P < 0. 05). Sustained exposure to 15 mM D-glucose increased fibronectin (P < 0. 001), in association with increased MMP- 2 (P = 0. 01) and MMP- 9 activity (P < 0. 05), suggestive of a protective effect on collagen matrix accumulation. Transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) mRNA was increased after short-term (90 min) exposure to 15 mM glucose (P < 0. 05) and after 24 -h exposure to 7. 5 mM ? (P < 0. 05). Normalization of TGF-beta(1) secretion occurred within 48 h of constant exposure to an elevated glucose. Fluctuating L-glucose also induced TGF-beta(1) mRNA and a profibrotic profile, however, to a lesser extent than observed with exposure <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> D-glucose. The results suggest that exposure <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> glucose concentrations increases renal interstitial fibrosis compared with stable elevations in D-glucose. The effects are, in part, due to the inherent osmotic changes...|$|R
40|$|Archaeological {{bones are}} an irreplaceable resource, {{especially}} with interest in newer molecular study techniques. Whilst burial environments predictably affect mineral and protein contents and physical integrity (“preservation state”) of retrieved bones, effects of post-retrieval environment {{are not well}} characterised, and curatorial guidelines are non-specific. The established Oxford histological Index (OHI) was used with a novel application of a mechanical competence test to link preservation state of archaeological bones <b>to</b> responses <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> relative humidity (RH) in a simulated post-retrieval environment. Archaeological ovine metapodials were classified as physically “poor”, “medium” and “well” preserved. Resin-embedded thin sections of each bone were examined histologically; neighbouring segments were subjected to low force hardness (Vickers “micro-hardness”) testing. Adjacent segments were then exposed <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> RH in a controlled environment, after which histology and micro-hardness testing were again performed. Initial preservation states reflected collagen retention, with “best preserved” bones having most collagen. The ability <b>to</b> withstand <b>fluctuating</b> RH was inversely related to collagen-retention, with cracking (gross and micro-) more likely in better preserved bones. Similarly, micro-hardness tended to decrease in better preserved bones after exposure <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> RH; an effect not echoed by poorer preserved bones. The differing resilience of the bones may relate to hygroscopicity of collagen, also to facilitation of microbiological growth by fluctuating RH in better preserved bones. This project is part of ongoing investigations into post-retrieval deterioration of archaeological bone and {{in the longer term}} aims to aid curators to provide optimal environments for bones in their care...|$|R
40|$|A recent pupillometry {{study on}} adults with normal hearing {{indicates}} that the pupil response during speech perception (cognitive processing load) is strongly affected {{by the type of}} speech masker. The current study extends these results by recording the pupil response in 32 participants with hearing impairment (mean age 59 yr) while they were listening to sentences masked by fluctuating noise or a single-talker. Efforts were made to improve audibility of all sounds by means of spectral shaping. Additionally, participants performed tests measuring verbal working memory capacity, inhibition of interfering information in working memory, and linguistic closure. The results showed worse speech reception thresholds for speech masked by single-talker speech compared <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> noise. In line with previous results for participants with normal hearing, the pupil response was larger when listening to speech masked by a single-talker compared <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> noise. Regression analysis revealed that larger working memory capacity and better inhibition of interfering information related to better speech reception thresholds, but these variables did not account for inter-individual differences in the pupil response. In conclusion, people with hearing impairment show more cognitive load during speech processing when there is interfering speech compared <b>to</b> <b>fluctuating</b> noise. © 2014 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate</b> or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Villa {{were one}} of the {{founding}} members of the Premier League in 1992, and finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season. For the rest of the Nineties however Villa went through three different managers and their league positions were inconsistent, although they did win two League Cups and regularly achieved UEFA Cup qualification. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost 1–0 to Chelsea in the last game to be played at the old Wembley Stadium. Again Villa's league position continued <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate</b> under several different managers and things came to a head in the summer of 2006 when David O'Leary left in acrimony. After 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38%), Doug Ellis finally decided to sell his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health. After much speculation it was announced the club was to be bought by American businessman Randy Lerner, owner of NFL franchise the Cleveland Browns.|$|E
5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate</b> within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend <b>to</b> <b>fluctuate.</b> Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
