40|$|Unemployment {{insurance}} {{programs are}} standard {{mechanisms by which}} governments protect their constituencies {{from the consequences of}} becoming unemployed. Since workers are averse to fluctuations in income, they typically welcome having such a safety net. Most unemployment insurance programs imply <b>temporary</b> <b>allowances</b> that represent a fraction of past wages. They are financed through mandatory worker contributions into a common pool. Economists have long argued that such a mechanism, while providing important insurance to workers, may suffer from moral hazard, in the sense that some individuals may not search as strongly or may choose to refuse job offers and still collect unemployment insurance benefits. Shirking of this sort would not matter quantitatively if unemployment insurance agencies could perfectly monitor the behavior of jobseekers. Monitoring, however, can never be perfect and is costly. It is thought that about 20 % of those who abusively file for unemployment insurance benefits succeed in obtaining those benefits. Indeed, it is virtually impossible for the agency to have perfect information on the possible offers received by a candidate or on the actual efforts of this candidate to generate job interviews. Because of this imperfect monitoring of shirkers, moral hazard may weigh heavily on the desirability of the program. This {{is due to the fact}} that workers contributing to the common pool need to contribute more than optimal to finance the benefits of those who manage to fool the agency. To discourage shirking, past research in this area has shown that it was socially optimal to reduce the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits to levels quite far from full insurance. Also, in part because of this moral hazard problem, the private provision of unemployment insurance is not viable and has to be supplied by the government under mandatory participation. Another way to proceed, however, would be to design an unemployment insurance program that does not rely on the common pool. Some countries, such as Chile and Brazil, have begun to experiment with such new forms o...|$|E

In particular, we investigate {{the effects of a}} <b>temporary</b> expensing <b>allowance</b> on investment in partial and general equilibrium and challenge the conventional view, advanced by Auerbach and Summers (1979) and Judd (1985), that partial-equilibrium analyses overstate the calculated impact of such policies. We also explore two additional questions. First, we investigate a claim noted by Auerbach and Summers and analyzed by Christiano (1984) that such incentives can be destabilizing. Second, we consider the relative impact of two types of tax-based investment incentives: a <b>temporary</b> partial-expensing <b>allowance</b> and a <b>temporary</b> reduction in capital taxes.

6000|$|Arthur Weldon's {{nature was}} a queer {{combination}} of weakness and strength. He was physically brave but a moral coward. The motherless {{son of a}} man wholly immersed in business, he had been much neglected in his youth and his unstable character was largely {{the result of this}} neglect. On leaving college he refused a business career planned for him by his father, who cast him off with scornful indifference, and save for a slim <b>temporary</b> <b>allowance</b> promised to disinherit him. It was during this period that Arthur met Louise and fell desperately in love with her. The girl appeared to return the young fellow's devotion, but shrewd, worldly Mrs. Merrick, discovering that the boy was practically disinherited and had no prospects whatever, forbade him the house. Louise, until now but mildly interested in the young-man, resented her mother's interference and refused to give him up. She found ways to meet Arthur Weldon outside her home, so that the situation had become complicated and dangerous when Uncle John seized his three nieces and whisked them off to Europe. Young Weldon, under an assumed name, followed and attached himself to the party; but John Merrick's suspicions were presently aroused and on discovering the identity of the youth he forbade him or Louise to [...] "make love" [...] or even speak of such a thing during the remainder of the trip.|$|R

The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits.

Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced. From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added “for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled.” Redundancy payments were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment, and earnings-related benefits for maternity, unemployment, sickness, industrial injuries and widowhood were introduced in 1966, followed by the replacement of flat-rate family allowances with an earnings-related scheme in 1968.

From July 1966 onwards, the <b>temporary</b> <b>allowance</b> for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks. Increases were made in pensions and other benefits during Wilson's first year in office that were the largest ever real term increases carried out up until that point. Social security benefits were markedly increased during Wilson's first two years in office, as characterised by a budget passed in the final quarter of 1964 which raised the standard benefit rates for old age, sickness and invalidity by 18.5%. In 1965, the government increased the national assistance rate to a higher level relative to earnings, and via annual adjustments, broadly maintained the rate at between 19% and 20% of gross industrial earnings until the start of 1970. In the five years from 1964 up until the last increases made by the First Wilson Government, pensions went up by 23% in real terms, supplementary benefits by 26% in real terms, and sickness and unemployment benefits by 153% in real terms (largely {{as a result of the}} introduction of earnings-related benefits in 1967).|$|R

After each newspaper opened its own fund, they and national donations by September 1935 totalled £565,000. The sum was divided equally split between the Lord Mayor of London's [...] "Mansion House Fund" [...] and the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire's [...] "Denbighshire Fund." [...] The local committee which met in Wrexham took monies from both funds, and appointed a visitor to ensure that immediate relief was distributed {{in the form of}} grants and <b>temporary</b> weekly <b>allowances.</b> The two funds were amalgamated in July 1935, under the provision of a trust deed to form the Gresford Colliery Disaster Relief Fund, with three trustees: the Lord Mayor of London, the Governor of the Bank of England and the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire. They devolved power to a local administration committee, who paid monies via an honorary actuary.

The Retired Persons’ Family Allowances Act of November 1950 established a special allowance for pensioned public servants with children, a law of November 1950 extended compulsory health insurance to cover other groups, such as old-age and invalidity pensioners, and a law of December 1956 introduced health insurance with special low contributions for old-aged pensioners below a certain income ceiling. A law of August 1950 established equal rights for illegitimate children, and introduced an allowance for disabled {{children between the ages of}} 16 and 20. The <b>Temporary</b> Family <b>Allowances</b> Act for the Self-employed of June 1951 entitled self-employed persons with low incomes to family allowance for the first and second child, and a law of February 1952 introduced an allowance for studying and for disabled children until the age of 27. In 1950, works councils were established, and in 1957 the dismissal of female civil servants upon marriage was abolished.|$|R
40|$|I {{have made}} {{interviews}} {{with a teacher}} and with pupils from the lower grades in a school dominated by pupils with Swedish as their second language, about the role and effects of assessment with particular focus {{on the subject of}} mathematics. I have also studied the policy documents (“kursplanen”) for the subjects of Swedish and mathematics. The formulations of the learning goals in Swedish are differentiated, so that the demands are somewhat lower for pupils with Swedish as their second language. In mathematics, however, the learning goals are the same for all pupils, and they include the ability to communicate mathematical concepts in meaningful and relevant situations. The language of this communication is supposed to be Swedish, and the cultural code necessary to find the situation meaningful and relevant is often Swedish. The textbooks in mathematics for the early grades are oriented towards the learning goals, and contain many problems formulated in plain Swedish language, and with meaning and relevance often oriented to assumed fruit distribution habits among culturally Swedish children. This creates a problem with assessments in mathematics for many pupils with Swedish as their second language. They often feel that the assessments in mathematics are unfair, if they already know the numerical system and could have solved the problem, had it been given to them in a more simplified language. There is a risk that these pupils give up on the subject of mathematics too early, and for linguistic and cultural reasons. My research has shown that some of these pupils even question the mathematical ability of their teacher, because they can so easily check the numerical results on their pocket calculators, {{and at the same time}} find the verbal explanations of the teacher so difficult to understand. The problems resulting from the discrepancy between the learning goals in Swedish and mathematics, are aggravated by the recently introduced national tests in the third grade, witch give an official stamp on the use of summative assessment in the form of mathematical tests that includes verbally and culturally demanding problems. What the individual teacher in mathematics can do under these circumstances, is exploiting the rights and demands for individualization of learning to the outmost for pupils with Swedish as their second language. Children who in the future are going to use their mathematical skills and abilities professionally in the Swedish society certainly have to learn the appropriate words, as well as the cultural codes for the Swedish way of formulating mathematical problems. But their roads to achieving these particular goals in the national learning plan for mathematics, will in various ways be different from that of pupils with Swedish as their first language. The advent of national tests in mathematics in the third grade makes it even more important for the teacher to focus on the use of formative assessments, that make <b>temporary</b> <b>allowance</b> for the pupils present shortcomings in the linguistic and cultural understanding of mathematics, while at the same time setting up personal and individualized learning goals, aimed at overcoming these shortcomings...|$|R
