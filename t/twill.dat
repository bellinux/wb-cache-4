5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and on the plain was in flood. The black soil plain, hard and firm during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot {{during the day and}} pleasant at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in their summer uniform of <b>twill</b> shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a Greatcoat), this gear gave little protection from the driving rain and bitter chill.|$|E

50|$|The fewer interlacings in <b>twills</b> as {{compared}} to other weaves allow the yarns to move more freely, and therefore they are softer and more pliable, and drape better than plain-weave textiles. <b>Twills</b> also recover from creasing better than plain-weave fabrics do. When there are fewer interlacings, the yarns can be packed closer together to produce high-count fabrics. With higher counts, including high-count <b>twills,</b> the fabric is more durable, and is air- and water-resistant.|$|R

25|$|The summer service uniform was a two-piece {{green and}} white outfit made of {{washable}} seersucker material. It had two pieces, a skirt and a short-sleeved jacket with a V-neck. The cap was green and decorated with a white cord, buttons were white, chevrons were green, and emblems were bronze. The shoes were brown, the gloves were white, and the handbags were light green. The summer dress uniform was made of white <b>twill.</b> It had short sleeves and a V-neck, worn with gilt buttons on the jacket and cap, with dress emblems and white pumps. The officers could choose between three summer dress uniforms. The first was the white one worn by enlisted women, but with added green shoulder straps. The other two were made of white <b>twill</b> or palm-beach material. One was a short-sleeved blouse, {{and the other was}} long sleeved and collarless.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{fragments}} of a burial shroud from the 1st century {{were discovered in}} a tomb near Jerusalem, believed to have belonged to a Jewish high priest or member of the aristocracy.

Based on this discovery, the researchers stated that the Turin Shroud did not originate from Jesus-era Jerusalem.|$|E

2500|$|New {{types of}} looms and weaving {{techniques}} {{also played a}} part. Plain-woven or tabby silks had circulated in the Roman world, and patterned damask silks in increasingly complex geometric designs appear from the mid-3rd century. Weft-faced compound <b>twills</b> were developed not later than 600, and polychrome (multicoloured) compound <b>twills</b> became the standard weave for Byzantine silks {{for the next several}} centuries. Monochrome lampas weaves became fashionable around 1000 in both Byzantine and Islamic weaving centres; these fabrics rely on contrasting textures rather than colour to render patterns. [...] A small number of tapestry-woven Byzantine silks also survive.|$|R

The looser twist of the yarn {{may be one of the}} reasons that the replica sections are less well-preserved.|$|E

The two parts were connected by a rolled waist seal held in place by a rubber cummerbund. Sizes available were small, medium, large short and large.|$|E
25|$|The burial chamber {{was evidently}} rich in textiles, {{represented}} by many fragments preserved, or by chemicals formed by corrosion. They included quantities of <b>twill,</b> possibly from cloaks, blankets or hangings, and {{the remains of}} cloaks with characteristic long-pile weaving. There appear to have been more exotic coloured hangings or spreads, including some (possibly imported) woven in stepped lozenge patterns using a Syrian technique in which the weft is looped around the warp to create a textured surface. Two other colour-patterned textiles, near the head and foot of the body area, resemble Scandinavian work of the same period.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the canvas}} has shown {{that it was a}} type favored by Veronese, with an {{arrangement}} of threads creating a diagonal <b>twill</b> pattern. While he often preferred to paint on lightly colored grounds, for The Family of Darius before Alexander, as with many of his larger paintings, Veronese prepared the canvas only with plain gesso. Though he routinely made numerous preparatory sketches, Veronese made major revisions while working on The Family of Darius before Alexander, including painting out a balcony with figures directly behind the main group, and adding lightly sketched horses and figures to the left background, perhaps as an afterthought.|$|E

25|$|Yarns {{from these}} fibers are woven into {{a variety of}} {{different}} weaves, the most notable of which include broadcloth, with double the number of warp to weft threads, giving a smooth, formal shirting; <b>twill,</b> where the tucks of the weft do not line up, giving a diagonal pattern, a weave used for most country checked (e.g. Tattersall) shirtings; poplin, with a heavier warp than weft, giving more formal fabric; and Oxford weaves. Plain Oxford or pinpoint Oxford weaves are popular as casual fabrics, so are generally used in combination with a button-down collar, while royal Oxford is versatile enough to be used on both sporty and formal shirts. There are many other weaves or variations on these, including end-on-end patterns, where alternate white and coloured threads are used, giving a mottled appearance, or more exotic weaves, including voile and batiste, which are extremely light fabrics only used for summer shirts or on the unseen parts of formal shirts.|$|E
500|$|The neckerchief is a {{universal}} symbol of Scouting and its Maclaren tartan represents Wood Badge's ties to Gilwell Park. The neckerchief, called a [...] "necker" [...] in British and some Commonwealth Scouting associations, is a standard triangular scarf made of cotton or wool <b>twill</b> with a taupe face and red back; a patch of Clan MacLaren tartan is affixed near the point. The pattern was adopted in honor of a British Scout commissioner who, as a descendant of the Scottish MacLaren clan, donated money for the Gilwell Park property on which the first Wood Badge program was held.|$|E
500|$|Sets of bed hangings {{embroidered}} in crewel wools {{were another}} characteristic {{product of the}} Stuart era. [...] These were worked on a new fabric, a natural <b>twill</b> weave from Bruges with a linen warp and cotton weft. [...] Crewel wools of the 17th century were firmly twisted unlike the soft wools sold under that name today, and were dyed in deep rich shades of green, blue, red, yellow, and brown. Motifs of flowers and trees, with birds, insects, and animals, were worked at large scale {{in a variety of}} stitches. [...] The origins of this work are in the polychrome embroidery on scrolling stems of the Elizabethan era, later blended with the Tree of Life and other motifs of Indian palampores, introduced by the trade of the East India Company.|$|E
