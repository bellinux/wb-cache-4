Its main part is located between the villages of Vikos and Monodendri and attains a depth of about , with a southeast-northwest direction. [...] The landscape of the [...] long gorge, [...] which belongs to the park's core zone, presents a diverse relief and is characterized by abrupt changes in altitude. [...] At one point the gorge measures [...] deep and [...] wide from rim <b>to</b> <b>rim,</b> and as a result is listed by the Guinness Book of Records as the deepest canyon in the world in proportion to its width, though some gorge lobbyists contest that claim. Steep slopes and precipitous rocky cliffs dominate in the middle and higher zones respectively. Numerous gullies dissect both sides of the gorge and the weathering action of water down its walls creates extended screes.|$|E

The canyons upstream at Cedar Grove are also more than [...] deep. Although the geology and topography of Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley are similar to that of Yosemite Valley, the park does not have waterfalls as high and spectacular as those in Yosemite. There are several powerful, but short waterfalls including Mist Falls, Roaring River Falls and Grizzly Falls in the Cedar Grove area. The backcountry is home to some much higher falls.

2500|$|Goethe Basin {{is a large}} {{circular}} {{depression that}} measures approximately [...] in diameter from rim crest <b>to</b> <b>rim</b> crest. [...] Goethe is bounded on its north and east sides by a gently sloping wall and discontinuous, low, hummocky rim material that may consist of ejecta deposits. These materials {{are similar to those}} occurring around the Caloris Basin in the Tolstoj quadrangle (Schaber and McCauley, 1980). On its west side, Goethe is bounded by at least three subparallel ridges or tilted blocks, which are separated by narrow troughs partly filled with smooth plains material. Hilly and hummocky remnants resembling basin deposits and ejecta protrude above the gently sloping basin wall. They extend southwest and north of the basin beyond a much subdued, low, barely perceptible rim crest for a distance of one-half to one-third of the basin radius. Goethe is older than the smooth plains material by which its wall, rim crest, and most of its ejecta were partly buried. The Goethe impact basin may be older than some intercrater plains material and large craters nearby. It is also much older than the Caloris Basin. (McCauley and others, 1981).|$|E

40|$|RIMs are {{presynaptic}} {{active zone}} proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release. We describe two related genes that encode proteins with identical C-terminal sequences that bind to the conserved PDZ domain of RIMs via an unusual PDZ-binding motif. These proteins were previously reported separately as ELKS, Rab 6 -interacting protein 2, and CAST, leading us {{to refer to}} them by the acronym ERC. Alternative splicing of the C terminus of ERC 1 generates a longer ERC 1 a variant that does not bind <b>to</b> <b>RIMs</b> and a shorter ERC 1 b variant that binds <b>to</b> <b>RIMs,</b> whereas the C terminus of ERC 2 is synthesized only in a single RIM-binding variant. ERC 1 a is expressed ubiquitously as a cytosolic protein outside of brain; ERC 1 b is detectable only in brain, where it is both a cytosolic protein and an insoluble active zone component; and ERC 2 is brain-specific but exclusively localized to active zones. Only brain-specific ERCs bind <b>to</b> <b>RIMs,</b> but both ubiquitous and brain-specific ERCs bind to Rab 6, a GTP-binding protein involved in membrane traffic at the Golgi complex. ERC 1 a and ERC 1 b/ 2 likely perform similar functions at distinct localizations, indicating unexpected connections between nonneuronal membrane traffic at the Golgi complex executed via Rab 6 and neuronal membrane traffic at the active zone executed via RIMs...|$|R
