5|$|Manchester City started sprightly, {{managing}} {{to create some}} chances which forced saves from Stoke goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen and steady defending to keep Stoke City in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half. Yaya Touré unleashed a 30-yard strike in the 11th minute which went only inches wide of the top corner of the goal, while Mario Balotelli had a curling shot {{from the corner of}} the penalty area in the 24th minute which was destined for the goal but for a strong, one-handed save from Sørensen.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2014, Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda was {{believed}} to have been using pine tar in a Yankee-Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium. This was never brought to the umpires attention, therefore it was never tested and no actions were taken. On April 23, 2014, at a Yankee Red Sox game in Fenway Park, John Farrell noticed that Pineda was using pine tar again. Farrell walked to the home plate umpire and got Pineda ejected from <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2nd inning.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} {{have joined the}} 300win club: Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{last decade of the}} 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened {{year for the first time}} in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E

5|$|The McKeesport Olympics, a {{team from}} McKeesport, Pennsylvania, was the All-Americans next opponent.

The final score of the game came when Shelton caught a receiving touchdown in the fourth quarter from Hughitt.|$|E
5|$|The Red Sox {{had lost}} in the {{previous}} season's American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees.
