5|$|During <b>this</b> <b>session,</b> the Native Hawaiian legislators {{attempted}} to pass new {{laws in the}} interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They promoted the use and study of the Hawaiian language, especially in the government and courts. Ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature, <b>this</b> <b>session</b> was conducted in both Hawaiian and English with the aid of an interpreter. Many of the territorial legislators in <b>this</b> <b>session</b> did not speak English. They also created the first county bill, which would have created five counties named after former Hawaiian aliʻi.|$|E

5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice on the Senate floor in 1828. A consistent opponent of internal improvements and tariffs, even those that would benefit his own constituents, he voted against a measure allocating federal funds {{for the construction of}} a road connecting the cities of Lexington and Maysville. The vote was ill-received by the people of the state, and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan voted for it only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in <b>this</b> <b>session,</b> but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|From 1890 to 1893 White {{served two}} terms {{as a member}} of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Hawaiian legislature, for the {{district}} of Lahaina on the island of Maui. In his first term, he initially ran {{as a member of}} the Reform Party against the National Reform Party candidate J. Nazareta. In 1887, the Reform Party (consisting of many descendants of American missionaries and Hawaiian conservatives) had become the established governmental party following King Kalākaua's coerced signing of the Bayonet Constitution. White was opposed to the constitution, and may have switched allegiance at a later point to the National Reform Party, which was established in opposition to the Reform Party in <b>this</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} <b>this</b> <b>session</b> was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E

5|$|On November 27, 1950, Clements {{resigned}} {{to accept a}} seat in the U.S. Senate, elevating Wetherby to governor. One of his first actions was to call a special legislative session to convene on March 6, 1951 for the purpose of allocating the state's $10million budget surplus. Among the expenditures approved in the special session were increases in teachers' salaries and state benefits for the needy and government employees. Wetherby's popularity soared as a result of <b>this</b> <b>session,</b> and he seriously considered running for the Senate seat vacated by the death of Virgil Chapman in 1951. Instead, after talking with Clements and other Democratic leaders, he decided to seek a full, four-year term as governor.|$|E

5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during <b>this</b> <b>session</b> of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The exact nature of the argument is not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E

5|$|The Provisional Legislature met for two {{sessions}} in late 1848 and early 1849. The first session, from December 5 to December 13, never formally organized {{as so many}} of the representatives had traveled south for the California Gold Rush. Beginning on February 5, a session was organized that conducted the final business of the Provisional Government. The session lasted until February 16. During <b>this</b> <b>session</b> a law forbidding the sale of firearms and supplies to Native Americans was repealed, and a law was passed to authorize the minting of gold coins. The law concerning the coins allowed for the creation of the Beaver Coins, which had a higher gold content than United States minted coins. Less than a month later, when the new territorial governor Joseph Lane arrived, however, he rescinded the law as unconstitutional and the coins were collected and removed from circulation. For the legislative session Ralph Wilcox was chosen as speaker, but he resigned from the post. Stephen Meek served as the doorkeeper, William G. T’Vault as a clerk, and William Holmes as sergeant at arms.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During <b>this</b> <b>session</b> the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
