25|$|Located {{under the}} castle terrace, the collegiate church was {{constructed}} between 1535 and 1539 {{at the request}} of Louis Adhémar. The Renaissance façade is flanked by two square towers and a beautiful Gothic rose window. Inside is an impressive 17th-century altar and organ loft. On <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the altar is a marble funerary stone marking the sealed entrance to the tomb of Madame de Sévigné.|$|E

Girls offer prayers to the images made out of white clay painted with white dots. They take a vow by tying a thread dipped in turmeric paste on their right wrist and offer prayers. An image of snake is drawn on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the house and milk is offered as oblation. On the night previous to the festival they keep complete fast or take a salt free diet. After the pooja, a food feast is held.|$|E
25|$|The rear {{portion of}} the omah consist of three {{enclosed}} rooms called senthong. The western senthong is used as storing rice and other agricultural produce, while the eastern senthong is used to store farming equipment. The central senthong is typically very small, build with a raised floor, lavishly decorated, and often curtained off from the house proper; resembling an enclosed bed than a room. Traditionally the central senthong was the abode of Sri herself. It is the room where incense is burnt for ceremonies, and in some areas the first rice grains of the harvest are placed here. In wealthy village houses in Central Java, the central senthong is flanked {{by a pair of}} mirrors and a pair of cabinets for holding important textiles. On <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the senthong is the loro blonyo, a statue of male and female in bridal attire, representing Sri and her male companion Raden Sadono. Also decorating the front of the central senthong are paired spittoons, textiles, and Madura wooden geese. The central senthong is also used as a sleeping room for newly married couples.|$|E

A great glass case at the end underneath a stylish black and white photograph contained a selected few hundred {{of the thousands of}} condolence books the Spencer received from around the world, designed to give a [...] "final sense of scale to the impact of Diana's life and of her death". A sleek, silk-bound copy of the incendiary address that her brother Charles delivered at Diana's funeral was available for £25.|$|E
500|$|The present {{building}} is rectangular, using rubble masonry dressed with freestone; the roof uses slates and stone copings. The 19th-century {{part of the}} church is wider and higher than the 1988 extension. [...] The bellcote {{is in the middle of}} the roof, at the join between the two sections. [...] There is an annexe including a vestry at the western end of the north side of the extension. [...] The nave has three bays and the roof timbers are exposed. The sanctuary is marked off by a step and a rail, and there is a 17th-century gravestone set into <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the sanctuary. The extension has two bays, and the two parts are divided by an arcade of three round arches. The church and annexe have separate entrances.|$|E
500|$|Lucius Caecilius Metellus, a {{military}} tribune, despaired {{so much of}} the Roman cause as to suggest that everything was lost, and called the other tribunes to sail overseas and hire themselves into the service of some foreign prince. Afterwards, he was forced by his own example to swear an oath of allegiance to Rome for all time. The survivors of Cannae were reconstituted as two legions and assigned to Sicily {{for the remainder of the}} war as punishment for their humiliating desertion of the battlefield. In addition to the physical loss of her army, Rome suffered a symbolic defeat of prestige. A gold ring was a token of membership in the upper classes of Roman society; Hannibal and his men collected more than 200 from the corpses on the battlefield, and sent this collection to Carthage as proof of his victory. The collection was poured on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Punic Senate, and was judged to be [...] "three and a half measures." ...|$|E

500|$|Coming to Singapore, Nico Rosberg {{was forced}} to change his power unit after his engine failure at the {{previous}} race in Italy. Using his fourth unit of the season, Rosberg was one power unit change away from a possible grid penalty. Alexander Rossi made his Formula One debut after signing a five-race deal to replace Roberto Merhi at Manor Marussia. Acting as race stewards at the Grand Prix were Garry Connelly from Australia and Vincenzo Spano from Venezuela, who assisted driver steward Martin Donnelly in his first appearance in this position since the 2014 Malaysian Grand Prix. Sauber brought a [...] "heavily-updated car" [...] to the Grand Prix, featuring a shorter nose and revised front and rear wings {{as well as a}} new engine cover and brake ducts. Toro Rosso also came to Singapore with new parts, bringing a revised front wing. Red Bull introduced a new component as well: Daniil Kvyat's car was equipped with new turning vanes installed to improve the airflow under the car and therefore create more downforce. The feature would be run by both cars at the following Japanese Grand Prix. Further updates included changes to the diffuser, rear wing, brake ducts and bodywork of the Force India VJM08B and modifications to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the rear wheels of the Ferrari SF15-T.|$|E

2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, [...] "he open book is Plato, reread too late".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a patron}} entered the front doors, {{he would have}} {{found himself in a}} lobby with two {{stairwells}} leading up to the balcony, a manager's office, and a smoking room. [...] Upon stepping through the terracotta leather covered and gold trimmed wooden doors into the auditorium, a patron would have been softly bathed in the shimmering glow of 94 gas lights. [...] These lights, were crafted of polished brass and fitted with etched glass globes. [...] The stage itself was equipped with 174 gas lights. [...] All the lights in the entire theatre were controlled from the stage by means of a pipe system, allowing the stage manager to ignite or extinguish any or all of these brilliant lights in an instant. [...] Beneath a dome resplendent with painted cherubs, a large chandelier, known as an [...] "Opal glass reflector", scattered sparkles of reflected light over all. [...] Elegant red Brussels' carpet softened patrons' steps, and grand opera chairs, upholstered in dark Cardinal plush awaited to seat them. [...] These chairs were engraved with the monogram, B.S.T., Barton Tibbits' initials, and many of these chairs offered foot rests and hat and umbrella racks. [...] Amazingly the auditorium originally held 1,000 seats for patrons. [...] The seating area was divided into the parquet and the parquet circle – two separate areas on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the orchestra pit. [...] The walls of the auditorium, colored in cameo tints and dashes of cardinal, green, and gold color in [...] "conventional figures" [...] produced [...] "a warm, sunny effect and [...] the auditorium a bright and airy appearance which is very pleasing." [...] Dominating the scene was a grandly ornate -wide by -long proscenium stage with elegant opera boxes situated within the massive tin and plaster arch.|$|E

2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
