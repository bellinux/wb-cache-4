25|$|Wicca is a neo-pagan {{religion}} {{focused on}} nature, {{guided by the}} philosophy of Wiccan Rede that advocates Harm None, Do As Ye Will. The concept of karmic return in Wicca states that our deeds return to us threefold, or multiple times to <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> lessons (The Threefold Law), whether in this lifetime or the next. Reincarnation therefore is an accepted part of the Wiccan faith. Wiccans also believe in death and afterlife as important experiences for the soul to transform and prepare for future lifetimes.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they are}} easy to keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms, and were among the first life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but as many genes, introns, and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> little about the origins of animals in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasized the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the Eumetazoa. An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously assumed. Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the house mouse (Mus musculus), laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio).|$|E

25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

During the bidding process, Sikorsky attacked the US101 for its foreign origins; in December 2004, Sikorsky VXX programme manager Nick Lappos derided the bid as: [...] ""What is a socialist country and a socialist company going to <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> about competition?". The selection was originally to occur in April 2004, however programme officials decided to postpone their decision for a further eight months to conduct more analysis on the bids.|$|E

[...] However, the Cayuse party was imprisoned and transported to Oregon City. When the group was asked why they offered themselves to the militia, Tiloukaikt stated [...] "Did not your missionaries <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> that Christ died to save his people? So die we to save our people." [...] At a military court Tiloukait and the four other Cayuses, Tomahas, Klokamas, Isaiachalkis, and Kimasumpkinhese, were found guilty and hanged on June 3, 1850, at Oregon City.|$|E

He wrote the following in explication:"This is ... the move of God in which God is bringing forth a many-membered manchild to govern the world, through whom Christ will govern the world during the millennium that is to come. Therefore, we are in God's school of Divine Government, and God is training us as one many-membered man, <b>teaching</b> <b>us,</b> training us, preparing us to be the government through whom the Spirit of Christ will govern the world. The way that he is <b>teaching</b> <b>us</b> and training us is by letting us practice on one another, by <b>teaching</b> <b>us</b> to govern {{one another and to}} be governed by one another after the order of Melchisedec, which is a theocratic spirit government order." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene in the}} episode, Hawking and Homer are seen {{discussing}} the universe in Moe's tavern. Scully stated that the scene was included because it [...] "was {{a chance to get}} the world's smartest man and the world's stupidest man in the same place". In the scene, Hawking tells Homer [...] "Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing... I may have to steal it." [...] In his book What's science ever done for us?: what The Simpsons can <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> about physics, robots, life and the universe, Paul Halpern wrote that in mathematics, a [...] "donut-shape", the three-dimensional generalization of a ring, is referred to as a torus. The generalization of a torus, any closed curve spun in a circle around an axis, is called a toroid. According to Halpern, Hawking's line references {{the fact that there are}} [...] "genuine" [...] scientific theories that the universe is toroidal.|$|E
500|$|However, in {{the face}} of the loss of his daughter, Mac learns, in Briley's words, that [...] "his life as a Christian is no more {{sheltered}} from this world's tragedies than it was before." [...] Before finding redemption, Sledge questions why God has allowed his life to take the path it has and, in particular, why his daughter was killed instead of him. Commentators have described this as a prime example of theodicy, the question of why evil exists that is commonly faced by Christians. Scholar Richard Leonard writes, [...] "For all believers, the meaning of suffering is the universal question.... No answer is completely satisfying, least of all the idea that God sends bad events to <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> something." [...] Following the death of his daughter, Mac moves forward with uncertainty as the film ends. Jewett writes of this conclusion, [...] "The message of this film is that we have no final assurances, any more than Abraham did. But we can respond in faith to the tender mercies we have received." ...|$|E
500|$|University of the Sciences in Philadelphia {{physics and}} {{mathematics}} professor Paul Halpern discusses the episode {{in his book}} What's Science Ever Done for Us?: What the Simpsons Can <b>Teach</b> <b>Us</b> About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe, and quotes Homer's admonition to Lisa: [...] "Lisa, in this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!" [...] {{at the beginning of}} Halpern's section on [...] "Mechanical Plots". Halpern describes Lisa's efforts to build a perpetual-motion machine while bored during the teachers strike, and comments that though it is absurd in reality to order someone to obey the laws of thermodynamics, he acknowledges that [...] "physicists sometimes don't know the proper arena within which certain laws apply". In the July 26, 2007 issue of Nature, the scientific journal's editorial staff listed [...] "The PTA Disbands" [...] among [...] "The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons", writing: [...] "Lisa gets so bored by a lack of schooling she builds a perpetual motion machine. Homer is not pleased: 'Lisa, in this house we OBEY the laws of thermodynamics.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|In ancient India, women {{occupied}} {{a very important}} position, in fact a superior position to, men. It is a culture whose only words for strength and power are feminine -"Shakti means [...] "power and [...] "strength. All male power comes from the feminine. Literary evidence suggests that kings and towns were destroyed because a single woman was wronged by the state. For example, Valmiki's Ramayana <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> that Ravana and his entire clan was wiped out because he abducted Sita. Veda Vyasa's Mahabharatha <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> that all the Kauravas were killed because they humiliated Draupadi in public. Elango Adigal's Sillapathigaram <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> Madurai, {{the capital of the}} Pandyas was burnt because Pandyan Nedunchezhiyan mistakenly killed her husband on theft charges.|$|R

Lee then begins shoving a The Thing action figure into the Batmobile, effectively destroying it. This scene pokes fun at the DC vs. Marvel rivalry (Batman's Batmobile of DC Comics and The Thing a property of Marvel Comics). Another scene in the episode references Danish physicist Niels Bohr. In his book What's Science Ever Done For Us: What the Simpsons Can <b>Teach</b> <b>Us</b> About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe, Paul Halpern wrote [...] "In the episode , one of Homer's favorite TV shows is preempted by the program The Boring World of Niels Bohr. Homer is so upset that he clutches an ice-cream sandwich, aims it at the screen like it's a remote control, squeezes out its contents, and splatters Bohr's image. In contrast to Homer's reaction, most physicists heap nothing but accolades upon Bohr, whose revolutionary ideas shaped the modern concept of the atom." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin {{presented}} Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the Légion d'honneur, at {{a ceremony}} at the French Embassy in London. [...] De Villepin praised Pinter's poem [...] "American Football" [...] (1991) stating: [...] "With its violence and its cruelty, {{it is for me}} one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence." [...] In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. [...] M. de Villepin concluded: [...] "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> how to live." [...] He said that Pinter received the award particularly [...] "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [...] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that [...] "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".|$|E
500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is {{a cautionary}} tale {{on the dangers of}} censorship. It uses the {{execution}} of Terrance and Phillip as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse. Cartman's use of foul language helps to avert the disaster. Parents and [...] "lazy child rearing" [...] come in for particularly sharp criticism. On their way to see Terrance and Phillip, the boys sing that [...] "movies <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> what our parents don't have time to say!" [...] During [...] "Blame Canada" [...] a couple are seen abandoning their baby in their enthusiasm to join Mothers Against Canada. The song ends with: [...] "We must blame them and cause a fuss / Before somebody thinks of blaming us!" [...] Much of the film's satire and many of the songs are concerned with the refusal of people to accept responsibility for failure and their tendency to look for scapegoats (some of the songs are also parodies of musical theatre, but this is usually secondary to furthering the satire). Movies, government, society, foreigners and Satan are all blamed, leading Kyle to remark: [...] "whenever I get in trouble, you go off and blame everybody else. But I'm the one to blame. Deal with me." [...] The movie is also self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrance and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience to see the movie.|$|E
