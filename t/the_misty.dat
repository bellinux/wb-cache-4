5|$|The {{others were}} called Eldar, the People of the Stars by Oromë, {{and they took}} Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as their leaders, and became {{respectively}} the Vanyar, Noldor and Teleri.

They turned back and stayed in the vales of the Anduin, and became the Nandor; these were led by Lenwë.|$|E
5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton {{that his wife}} could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford. Every CMPC movie was from that time forward {{intended to be a}} star vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of <b>the</b> <b>Misty</b> Pool all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of the}} year to be completed. Faust wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Marguerite Henry {{released}} the children's book Misty of Chincoteague, {{the first in}} a series of novels that made the Chincoteague breed internationally famous. The real Misty was foaled on Chincoteague Island in 1946, and was purchased as a weanling by Henry. In 1961, the publicity was increased even more when the film Misty was made, based on the book. The publicity generated by the books assisted the Chincoteague Fire Department and the breed in remaining viable into the 21st century. While fictionalized, the books were based on a real horse and ranch on Chincoteague Island, and <b>the</b> <b>Misty</b> of Chincoteague Foundation was established in 1990, to preserve the Beebe Ranch and establish a museum with memorabilia from the series. Model horse company Breyer Animal Creations has created models of Misty and five of her descendants. As of 2001, there were around 40 surviving descendants of Misty worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Originally Allen & Unwin {{planned to}} {{illustrate}} the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water, The Trolls, The Mountain Path, <b>The</b> <b>Misty</b> Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate, Beorn's Hall, Mirkwood, The Elvenking's Gate, Lake Town, The Front Gate, and The Hall at Bag-End. All {{but one of the}} illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.|$|E
5|$|The group travels {{into the}} wild, where Gandalf saves {{the company from}} trolls and leads them to Rivendell, where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. Passing over <b>the</b> <b>Misty</b> Mountains, they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets {{separated}} from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum, who engages him {{in a game of}} riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers invisibility, Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and Wargs give chase, but the company are saved by eagles before resting in the house of Beorn.|$|E

5|$|Gorkil {{continues}} marching {{west and}} besieges Fornost, the fortified {{ruins of the}} ancient capitol of Arnor. The defenders, consisting of the Dúnedain and Dwarves led by Glóin, crumble under the relentless Goblin attacks, and Eriador falls under Goblin control. Sauron launches a concurrent campaign east of <b>the</b> <b>Misty</b> Mountains. The orcs from Dol Guldur eliminate the Elves and the Ents that guard the Forest Road in Mirkwood, defeating the Elven lord Thranduil. After the fall of Mirkwood, the Mouth of Sauron leads his horde to Withered Heath to recruit the Dragon Lord Drogoth, after destroying the Dwarves in the area. To finally rid Sauron and Middle Earth of the Dwarves, The Mouth of Sauron attacks the human city of Dale and the Dwarven stronghold of Erebor, led by King Dain. For the final battle against the Good factions in the North, the Goblin horde and Sauron's forces from Mordor converge at Rivendell, the last surviving stronghold against Sauron in Middle-earth. Eagles, the Dead Men of Dunharrow, Galadriel and her surviving Elves, and {{the remnants of the}} Fellowship of the Ring arrive to help Arwen and Elrond, but Sauron (having attained full power through recovering the One Ring from the dead Frodo) and all his gathered forces enter the battle and completely destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.|$|E

50|$|Beebe Ranch is an American horse {{ranch and}} museum located at 3062 Ridge Road, Chincoteague, Virginia. The museum closed in 2010. Six years later Beebe Ranch re-opened on July 27, 2016. The museum focused on two Chincoteague Ponies, Misty and her foal Stormy, {{featured}} in <b>the</b> novels <b>Misty</b> of Chincoteague (1947) and Stormy, Misty's Foal (1963) by Marguerite Henry. Misty and Stormy resided {{at the ranch}} and now their taxidermically preserved figures are displayed at <b>the</b> museum. <b>Misty</b> had stayed in {{the house at the}} ranch during the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, a major winter storm that struck the coast and became the basis for <b>the</b> book Stormy, <b>Misty's</b> Foal.|$|R
25|$|The Anduin {{began as}} two {{different}} streams near where <b>the</b> <b>Misty</b> Mountains met the Grey Mountains. These were called the Langwell and the Greylin by the Éothéod when {{they lived in}} the triangle of land formed by it. Their old capital Framsburg was built at the confluence of these streams where the Anduin proper began. The Langwell had its source in <b>the</b> <b>Misty</b> Mountains, close to Mount Gundabad and the Greylin began in the westernmost heights of the Grey Mountains.|$|E

Early free updates added Lake Evendim, Annúminas, and Forochel. The Mines of Moria expansion also added Eregion.

40|$|Abstract. MISTY 1 is a {{block cipher}} {{designed}} by Matsui in 1997. It was well evaluated and standardized by projects, such as CRYPTREC, ISO/IEC, and NESSIE. In this paper, we propose a key recovery attack on <b>the</b> full <b>MISTY</b> 1, i. e., {{we show that}} 8 -round MISTY 1 with 5 FL layers does not have 128 -bit security. Many attacks against MISTY 1 have been proposed, {{but there is no}} attack against <b>the</b> full <b>MISTY</b> 1. Therefore, our attack is the first cryptanalysis against <b>the</b> full <b>MISTY</b> 1. We construct a new integral characteristic by using the propagation characteristic of the division property, which was proposed in 2015. We first improve the division property by optimizing a public S-box and then construct a 6 -round integral characteristic on MISTY 1. Finally, we recover the secret key of <b>the</b> full <b>MISTY</b> 1 with 263. 58 chosen plaintexts and 2121 time complexity. Moreover, if we can use 263. 994 chosen plaintexts, the time complexity for our attack is reduced to 2107. 9. Note that our cryptanalysis is a theoretical attack. Therefore, the practical use of MISTY 1 will not be affected by our attack...|$|R
25|$|In The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien {{wrote that}} mithril is {{found only in}} the mines of Moria beneath <b>the</b> <b>Misty</b> Mountains, where it was mined by the Dwarves. Unfinished Tales alleges that it {{is also found in}} Númenor.|$|E

The fellowship set out, attempting to cross <b>the</b> <b>Misty</b> Mountains vis the Pass of Caradhras.
