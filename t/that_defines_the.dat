5|$|In {{the sources}} {{considered}} so far, Troilus' only narrative function is his death. The {{treatment of the}} character changes in two ways {{in the literature of}} the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes an important and active protagonist in the pursuit of the Trojan War itself. Second, he becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than the passive victim of Achilles' pederasty. By the time of John Dryden's neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida it is the ultimate failure of his love affair <b>that</b> <b>defines</b> <b>the</b> character.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition <b>that</b> <b>defines</b> <b>the</b> metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the well-preserved rocks of the dry, {{central part of the}} Andes, the record <b>that</b> <b>defines</b> <b>the</b> southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E
5|$|The same {{experimental}} data shows that time {{as measured by}} clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The metric tensor <b>that</b> <b>defines</b> <b>the</b> geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).|$|E

25|$|There exist two {{underlying}} {{models in}} each OT system: the data model <b>that</b> <b>defines</b> <b>the</b> way data objects in a document are addressed by operations, and the operation model <b>that</b> <b>defines</b> <b>the</b> set of operations {{that can be}} directly transformed by OT functions. Different OT systems may have different data and operation models. For example, the data model of the first OT system is a single linear address space; and its operation model consists of two primitive operations: character-wise insert and delete. The basic operation model has been extended to include a third primitive operation update to support collaborative Word document processing and 3D model editing. The basic OT data model has been extended into a hierarchy of multiple linear addressing domains, which is capable of modeling {{a broad range of}} documents. A data adaptation process is often required to map application-specific data models to an OT-compliant data model.|$|E

25|$|A {{constraint}} condition implies a restriction in the kinematical {{degrees of freedom}} {{of one or more}} bodies. The classical constraint is usually an algebraic equation <b>that</b> <b>defines</b> <b>the</b> relative translation or rotation between two bodies. There are furthermore possibilities to constrain the relative velocity between two bodies or a body and the ground. This is for example the case of a rolling disc, where the point of the disc that contacts the ground has always zero relative velocity with respect to the ground. In the case that the velocity {{constraint condition}} cannot be integrated in time in order to form a position constraint, it is called non-holonomic. This is the case for the general rolling constraint.|$|E
