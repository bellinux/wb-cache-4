He denied being under significant pressure, though <b>the</b> <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> label—"Richo, {{have you got a}} single? Do you have singles?

Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to be creative. In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand {{to get away from the}} distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

5|$|After it {{had been}} {{previously}} forecast to turn northwestward and track along the northeastern Florida coast, the forecast shifted 24hours prior to moving ashore to a landfall point in the east-central portion of the state; the change was due to <b>the</b> <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge to its north. The hurricane moved over Grand Bahama Island, and in the Bahamas it produced wind gusts of up to 130mph (210km/h). As it approached the Florida coastline it did not strengthen much further, due to an eyewall replacement cycle; this is the process in which an outer eyewall forms, causing the original eye to shrink and dissipate {{due to lack of}} moisture. At 0400UTC on September 26, Jeanne made landfall with peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) on the southern end of Hutchinson Island near Stuart, Florida, with an eye 50mi (85km) in diameter. The hurricane moved ashore in almost the same location as Hurricane Frances, which made landfall 21days prior.|$|E

25|$|In the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube on 27 February, Schwarzenberg {{attacked}} Oudinot by surprise, inflicting 3,060 {{casualties on}} the French while sustaining 2,400 casualties. Once the action started, Kellermann {{crossed to the}} east bank of the Aube River. Jacquinot's division charged the Russian Lubny Hussars, mauling the regiment and driving off the Pskov Cuirassiers. Ismert's dragoon brigade charged a large Russian artillery battery three times. This foolhardy attack was repulsed and the 4th and 16th Dragoons suffered 400 killed and wounded between them. Nevertheless, Schwarzenberg was alarmed at <b>the</b> <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French attacks and proceeded with caution. During the withdrawal {{there was a brief}} panic when the infantry rearguard fled through the ranks of Kellermann's cavalry, but order was soon restored. After their defeat, the French withdrew to the west.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{a longer}} {{expansion}} – cutting {{at a higher}} frequency – corresponds in the frequency domain to widening the brick-wall, which in the time domain corresponds to narrowing the sinc function and increasing its height by the same factor, leaving the integrals between corresponding points unchanged. This is a general feature of the Fourier transform: widening in one domain corresponds to narrowing and increasing height in the other. This results in the oscillations in sinc being narrower and taller and, in the filtered function (after convolution), yields oscillations that are narrower and thus have less area, but does not reduce the magnitude: cutting off at any finite frequency results in a sinc function, however narrow, with the same tail integrals. This explains <b>the</b> <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overshoot and undershoot.|$|E
25|$|Drag hunting, an equestrian sport which {{involves}} dragging an object {{over the ground}} to lay a scent for the hounds to follow, can also be popular, either instead of, or in addition to, live quarry hunting. Drag hunts are often considered to be faster, with followers not having to wait while the hounds pick up a scent, and often covering an area far larger than a traditional hunt, which may even necessitate a change of horses halfway through. A non-equestrian variation, hound trailing, is practised in the Lake District. Since the UK hunting ban, hunts are using a mixture of an odoriferous substance with an oil {{in order to improve}} <b>the</b> <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scent trail, and then to lay the scent about 20minutes in advance of the hunt. Bloodhounds are also used to hunt a human runner in the sport of Hunting the Clean Boot.|$|E

25|$|The Battle for Longueval and Delville Wood, {{had started}} with a charge by the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division between Longueval and High Wood and {{two weeks after the}} wood was cleared, tanks went into action for the first time. A number of {{important}} tactical lessons were learned from the battle for the village and wood. Night assembly and advances, dawn attacks after short, concentrated artillery barrages for tactical surprise, defensive lines built on the fringes wooded areas, because tree roots in woods prevented digging and to avoid shells which detonated in branches, showering troops with wood splinters. Troops were relieved after two days, as longer periods exhausted them and consumed their ammunition, bombs and rations. <b>The</b> <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British attacks during July and August, helped to preserve Franco-British relations, although Joffre criticised the large number of small attacks on 11 August and tried to cajole Haig into agreeing to a big combined attack.

This narrative technique, which fuses the narrator very closely with the consciousness and point of view of the central characters of the plot, was original for its period. Franks notes that his identification, through Dostoyevsky's use of the time shifts of memory and his manipulation of temporal sequence, begins to approach the later experiments of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce.

500|$|With news of {{the planned}} Rochdale Canal link into Manchester, the company {{proposed}} to extend the canal from Bury through Littleborough, and {{to connect with the}} Rochdale Canal at Sladen.

[...] The company also considered links to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. [...] These plans would have substantially increased the trans-Pennine traffic using the company's canal, and caused a potential loss of traffic and revenue on the nearby Bridgewater Canal.

500|$|The crucial {{difference}} between the shamans and their European counterparts {{lies in the fact}} that the ecstasy of the former was public, while that of the latter was always private. Historian Carlo Ginzburg asserts that [...] "his divergence stands starkly against a homogeneous background." [...] Ginzburg regards all of them as mediators with the realm of the dead, who are the [...] "ambiguous dispensers of prosperity"; the ecstasy represents a temporary death. The accounts in which the figures fly or fight materially rather than in spirit, are attempts [...] "to describe an ecstatic experience perceived as absolutely real". Ginzburg argues, adopting a diffusionist approach, that the shamanistic elements of the European folkloric figures have their original source in the shamanism of Siberian nomads, and their diffusion was possibly mediated by the Scythians. Another possibility is that the shamanistic beliefs are derived from a common source. Their nucleus could have developed in a remote past from cultural interactions between the Proto-Indo-Europeans, speakers of the Proto-Uralic language, and ancient populations of the Caucasus. A third possibility is derivation from structural characteristics of the human mind. This is suggested by <b>the</b> <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shamanistic phenomena over a long period, and their dispersion over a large area in culturally disparate societies. These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive.|$|E
