5000|$|France {{confirmed}} the electoral {{system of the}} former Ottoman Mount Lebanon province in setting up a Representative Council for Greater Lebanon in 1922. <b>Two</b> <b>stage</b> <b>elections,</b> universal adult male suffrage, and multimember multi-communal constituencies continued the situation that prevailed in Mount Lebanon up to 1914. Women in Lebanon gained suffrage in 1952, only five years after men did in the new Republic (in the year 1947). The Lebanese constitution — specifically Article 7, proclaimed that [...] "All Lebanese are equal under the law, enjoying equally civil and political rights, and performing duties and public responsibility without any discrimination among them." [...] This however did not protect against gender discrimination and thus women were not equally protected. Women were refused {{the right to vote}} by early Lebanese government until they organized and began petitioning for equal rights. In 1952 the Women's Political Rights Agreement came about and guaranteed that women would be able to vote. Women gained the right to vote but with a limitation, they had to have an elementary education. Women had to have documents that could prove that they had received at least an elementary level education. This limitation was lifted five years later in 1957 without much discourse or a fight.|$|R
40|$|Campaigns in the U. S. are {{two-stage}} {{events in}} which candidates must {{succeed in the}} primary {{in order to move}} on to the general election. We argue that the strategies employed by candidates in <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> <b>elections</b> depends on the electoral circumstances they face; candidates facing competitive primary elections must try to please their primary electorate before they shift their focus to the preferences of the median general election voter. Candidates who do not face competitive primaries, on the other hand, are free to run a single campaign designed to appeal to the entire electorate across both elections. We use advertising data from four U. S. Senate elections from 2002 and 2004 and show that candidates engaged in competitive primary elections respond to the advertising of their primary election opponents but not to that of their eventual general election opponents. We further find that the losing primary candidates also respond to their primary opponents. Candidates who face noncompetitive primaries, on the other hand, do not respond to the advertising behavior of their eventual general election opponents during primary campaigns, suggesting that they pursue a different strategy entirely. ∗This paper was prepared for presentation at the 12 th Annual State Politics and Policy Conference, Houston, Texas, February 16 - 18, 2012.

40|$|In this paper, I {{assess the}} {{determinants}} {{and validity of}} citizens' perceptions of election quality. First, I suggest that citizens' evaluation {{of the performance of}} election-related institutions is the most crucial determinant of their election quality perceptions; however, citizens' personal experience with electoral irregularities, and affiliation with electoral winners also matter. Second, I argue that citizens' election quality perceptions are generally indicative of prevailing trends within different <b>stages</b> of the <b>election</b> <b>process.</b> I expect citizens' perceptions to be correlated with other non-perception-based indicators of election quality. I test these hypotheses {{in the context of the}} 2007 Nigerian elections, using survey data from the Afrobarometer and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems along with original data coded from petitions filed in Nigerian Election Tribunals. The findings provide robust support for the hypotheses and underscore the importance of gauging citizens' perceptions of electoral quality. Most importantly, the results indicate that Nigerians were critical of the quality of the 2007 elections and demand electoral institutions with impartiality and professionalism...|$|R
40|$|The {{courts in}} Malawi {{have played a}} {{prominent}} role in political life since the democratic transition in 1993, which came about after three decades of repressive authoritatian rule. Whilst the quality of electoral politics have deteriorated, the courts have become increasingly central. In the 2004 elections they were involved at every <b>stage</b> of the <b>election</b> <b>process.</b> In this paper we argue that the Malawian judiciary has assumed four politically significant functions in the electoral process: it performs an accountability function, acts as a safety-valve, plays the role of an internal arbiter for the political parties; and functions as a source of political leverage. Furthermore, we argue that in order to understand this increasing politicisation of Malawian politics, it is important both to look at what has prevented the government from reigning in the judiciary, what has motivated judges to take up such a role, and what has motivated the parties to lodge political cases in the courts...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} a growing {{literature}} focuses on {{how and why}} some <b>election</b> <b>processes</b> are viewed as having integrity while others lack it. Some scholars examine how a state's characteristics (e. g. its economic development, the education levels of its citizens, and their experience with elections) shape the voting process while others study how individual voters view the process and their role in it. The relative importance of election dynamics themselves {{and the process of}} their evaluation, however, remain unclear. What <b>stages</b> of the <b>election</b> <b>process</b> are most important when people evaluate elections? We argue that {{a better understanding of how}} election dynamics shape perceptions of election integrity is crucial because theoretically this process is at the heart of democratic representation and because from a policymaking standpoint these dynamics vary more over time than individual and state-level factors. This paper explains why certain parts of the election cycle are critical to determining how an election is judged—especially the fairness of election laws and media access, the conduct of election authorities, and the use of political violence. Empirical results using new data on 121 elections held in 109 countries during 2013, 2014, and the first half of 2015 are supportive of our argument. No Full Tex...|$|R

For each major <b>stage</b> of the <b>election</b> <b>process,</b> this report discusses (1) changes to election systems since the 2000 election, including steps taken to implement HAVA, and (2) challenges encountered in the 2004 election.

40|$|Integrity of {{elections}} relies on fair procedures at different <b>stages</b> of the <b>election</b> <b>process,</b> and fraud {{can occur in}} many instances and different forms. This paper provides a general approach {{for the detection of}} fraud. While most existing contributions focus on a single instance and form of fraud, we propose a more encompassing approach, testing for several empirical implications of different possible forms of fraud. To illustrate this approach we rely on a case of electoral irregularities in one of the oldest democracies: In a Swiss referendum in 2011, one in twelve municipalities irregularly destroyed the ballots, rendering a recount impossible. We do not know whether this happened due to sloppiness, or to cover possible fraudulent actions. However, one of our statistical tests leads to results, which point to irregularities in some of the municipalities, which lost their ballots: they reported significantly fewer empty ballots than the other municipalities. Relying on several tests leads to the well known multiple comparisons problem. We show two strategies and illustrate strengths and weaknesses of each potential way to deal with multiple tests...|$|R
