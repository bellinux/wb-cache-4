Experimental design. The authors investigated the effect of a novel, defined PFE consisting of both fermented juice and seed oil on the NF-kB pathway, which is constitutively active in aggressive breast cancer cell lines. The effects of the PFE on NF-kB–regulated cellular processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and invasion were also examined. Results. Analytical characterization of the bioactive components of the PFE revealed active constituents, mainly ellagitannins and phenolic acids in the aqueous PFE and conjugated <b>octadecatrienoic</b> <b>acids</b> in the lipid PFE derived from seeds.

We investigated early {{responses of}} the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to attack from the generalist grasshopper herbivore, Schistocerca gregaria (Caelifera). When compared with wounding alone, S. gregaria attack {{and the application of}} grasshopper oral secretions (GS) to puncture wounds elicited a rapid accumulation of various oxylipins, including 13 -hydroperoxy <b>octadecatrienoic</b> <b>acid,</b> 12 -oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), jasmonic acid, and jasmonic acid-isoleucine. Additionally, GS increased cytosolic calcium levels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK 3 and MPK 6) activity, and ethylene emission but not the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Although GS contain caeliferin A 16 : 0, a putative elicitor of caeliferan herbivores, treatment with pure, synthetic caeliferin A 16 : 0 did not induce any of the observed responses. With mutant plants, we demonstrate that the observed changes in oxylipin levels are independent of MPK 3 and MPK 6 activity but that MPK 6 is important for the GS-induced ethylene release. Biochemical and pharmacological analyses revealed that the lipase activity of GS plays {{a central role in the}} GS-induced accumulation of oxylipins, especially OPDA, which could be fully mimicked by treating puncture wounds only with a lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus. GS elicitation increased the levels of OPDA-responsive transcripts.

40|$|Plant oxylipins are a {{large family}} of {{metabolites}} derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. The characterization of mutants or transgenic plants affected in the biosynthesis or perception of oxylipins has recently emphasized {{the role of the}} so-called oxylipin pathway in plant defense against pests and pathogens. In this context, presumed functions of oxylipins include direct antimicrobial effect, stimulation of plant defense gene expression, and regulation of plant cell death. However, the precise contribution of individual oxylipins to plant defense remains essentially unknown. To get a better insight into the biological activities of oxylipins, in vitro growth inhibition assays were used to investigate the direct antimicrobial activities of 43 natural oxylipins against a set of 13 plant pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi. This study showed unequivocally that most oxylipins are able to impair growth of some plant microbial pathogens, with only two out of 43 oxylipins being completely inactive against all the tested organisms, and 26 oxylipins showing inhibitory activity toward at least three different microbes. Six oxylipins strongly inhibited mycelial growth and spore germination of eukaryotic microbes, including compounds that had not previously been ascribed an antimicrobial activity such as 13 -keto- 9 (Z), 11 (Z), 15 (Z) - <b>octadecatrienoic</b> <b>acid</b> and 12 -oxo- 10, 15 (Z) -phytodienoic acid.

40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of the wound response pathway in tomato indicates that systemin and its precursor protein, prosystemin, are upstream components of a defensive signaling cascade that involves the synthesis and subsequent action of the <b>octadecatrienoic</b> <b>acid</b> (18 : 3) –derived plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA). The suppressor of prosystemin-mediated responses 2 (spr 2) mutation, which was isolated previously as a suppressor of (pro) systemin-mediated signaling, impairs wound-induced JA biosynthesis {{and the production of}} a long-distance signal for the expression of defensive Proteinase inhibitor genes. Using a map-based cloning approach, we demonstrate here that Spr 2 encodes a chloroplast fatty acid desaturase involved in JA biosynthesis. Loss of Spr 2 function reduced the 18 : 3 content of leaves to < 10 % of wild-type levels, abolished the accumulation of hexadecatrienoic acid, and caused a corresponding increase in the level of dienoic fatty acids. The effect of spr 2 on the fatty acyl content of various classes of glycerolipids indicated that the Spr 2 gene product catalyzes most, if not all, ω 3 fatty acid desaturation within the “prokaryotic pathway” for lipid synthesis in tomato leaves. Despite the reduced levels of trienoic fatty acids, spr 2 plants exhibited normal growth, development, and reproduction. However, the mutant was compromised in defense against attack by tobacco hornworm larvae. These results indicate that jasmonate synthesis from chloroplast pools of 18 : 3 is required for wound- and systemin-induced defense responses and support a role for systemin in the production of a transmissible signal that is derived from the octadecanoid pathway...|$|R

In the present study, we further investigated the stimulation of the oxylipin pathway: metabolites and enzymes of the pathway were analyzed to understand {{the fate of the}} 13 -HPOT in ISR. Actually the stimulation began upstream the LOX: free linolenic acid accumulated faster in P. putida BTP 1 -treated plants than in control. Downstream, the LOX products 13 -fatty acid hydroperoxides esterified to galactolipids and phospholipids were more abundant in bacterized plants than in control before infection. These metabolites could constitute a pool that will be used after pathogen attack to produce free fungitoxic metabolites through the action of phospholipase A 2, which is enhanced in bacterized plants upon infection. Enzymatic branches which can use as substrate the fatty acid hydroperoxides were differentially regulated in bacterized plants in comparison to control plants, so as to lead to the accumulation of the most fungitoxic compounds against B. cinerea. Our study, which is the first to demonstrate the accumulation of an esterified defense metabolite during rhizobacteria-mediated induced systemic resistance, showed that the oxylipin pathway is differentially regulated. It suggests that this allows the plant to prepare to a future infection, and to respond faster and in a more effective way to B. cinerea invasion. Peer reviewe...|$|R
