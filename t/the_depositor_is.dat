50|$|This {{means that}} even healthy banks are {{potentially}} vulnerable to panics, usually called bank runs. If a depositor expects all other depositors to withdraw their funds, {{then it is}} irrelevant whether the banks' long term loans {{are likely to be}} profitable; the only rational response for <b>the</b> <b>depositor</b> <b>is</b> to rush to take his or her deposits out before the other depositors remove theirs. In other words, the Diamond-Dybvig model views bank runs as a type of self-fulfilling prophecy: each depositor's incentive to withdraw funds depends on what they expect other depositors to do. If enough depositors expect other depositors to withdraw their funds, then they all have an incentive to rush to be the first in line to withdraw their funds.|$|E
50|$|A {{deposit slip}} {{is a form}} {{supplied}} by a bank for a depositor to fill out, designed to document in categories the items included in the deposit transaction. The categories include type of item, {{and if it is}} a cheque, where it is from such as a local bank or a state if the bank is not local. The teller keeps the deposit slip along with the deposit (cash and cheques), and provides the depositor with a receipt. They are filled in a store and not a bank, so it is very convenient in paying. They also are a means of transport of money. Pay-in slips encourage the sorting of cash and coins, are filled in and signed by the person who deposited the money, and some tear off from a record that is also filled in by the depositor. Deposit slips are also called deposit tickets and {{come in a variety of}} designs. They are signed by the depositor if <b>the</b> <b>depositor</b> <b>is</b> cashing some of the accompanying check and depositing the rest.|$|E
40|$|Non‐maturing liabilities, such as savings accounts, lack both {{predetermined}} {{maturity and}} reset dates {{due to the}} fact that <b>the</b> <b>depositor</b> <b>is</b> free to withdraw funds at any time and that the depository institution is free to change the rate. These attributes complicate the risk management of such products and no standardized solution exists. The problem is important however since non‐maturing liabilities typically make up a considerable part of the funding of a bank. In this report different modeling approaches to the risk management are described and a method for managing the interest rate risk is implemented. It is a replicating portfolio approach used to approximate the non‐maturing liabilities with a portfolio of fixed income instruments. The search for a replicating portfolio is formulated as an optimization problem based on regression between the deposit rate and market ratesseparated by a fixed margin. In the report two different optimization criteria are compared for the replicating portfolio, minimizing the standard deviation of the margin versus maximizing the risk‐adjusted margin represented by the Sharpe ratio, of which the latter is found to yield superior results. The choice of historical sample interval over which the portfolio is optimized seems to have a rather big impact on the outcome but recalculating the portfolio weights at regular intervals is found to stabilize the results somewhat. All in all, despite the fact that this type of method cannot fully capture the most advanced dynamics of the non‐maturing liabilities, a replicating portfolio still appears to be a feasible approach for the interest risk management.

40|$|The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on March 3, 2016 {{came out}} with master {{directions}} on ‘interest rate on deposits’. These directions over rule all the existing instructions on the subject and applies to all deposits accepted by banks based on the rules prescribed hitherto. In the master directions, for savings deposits, RBI has mandated that banks pay interest at quarterly or shorter intervals. Savings Bank (SB) deposits and Term deposits amount to more than Rs 90 lakh crore at present. In {{the absence of any}} regulation on interest application frequency to such deposits, till now most of the banks were paying interest on the SB deposits, that accounts for {{more than a quarter of}} the total deposit pie, at an interval of six months. Under the prevailing SB interest of 4 % per annum, the new regulation would benefit the SB depositors to the tune of Rs 500 crore or more from the next financial year. Though this is a major step in favour of the depositors, a disparity compared to loans is still left unattended. For loans taken from the banks, the interest is computed at monthly rests. In other words, if a borrower defers payment of interest by two months, the banks charge two months’ interest on the delayed interest. Though RBI has deregulated rates of interest on Term deposits, SB deposits and loan accounts, it still regulates the interest application frequency on such products, disharmoniously. The regulator provides no rationale on why interest application frequencies on deposit accounts (quarterly or shorter intervals) are different from those for loan accounts (monthly intervals), both of which are to the benefit of the banks and detrimental to the interest of the borrowers and, even more so, depositors. RBI has a responsibility to bring in standards and transparency in interest application frequency, in the interests of the depositors. RBI has also left to the banks the method that they may adopt for computing interest. Absence of regulation gives banks the freedom to decide, in a non-transparent fashion, the effective annualised returns on deposits held by them. With this, the depositors are burdened with the problem of shopping among banks for the most attractive methodology used in their interest application and computation procedures. <b>The</b> <b>depositor</b> <b>is</b> neither capable to make such comparisons nor aware that such matters affect his return. And depositors’ ignorance is a big asset for banks. In the annual monetary and credit policy for the year 2002 - 2003, there was a proposal that banks should provide information on deposit interest rates for various maturities along with the effective annualised yield. However, RBI neither came up with any formal directions to implement the proposal nor explained how absence of accounting standards will help the real stake holders, that is, the depositors. Unlike some of the global best practices, lack of basic accounting standards in India gives administrative convenience to banks and the regulator and thrusts responsibilities to the depositors to read between the lines. Is it not too unrealistic for the regulator to expect (i) the depositors to ask the banks to show their method of computing interest, (ii) the banks to have a comprehensive and easy to understand document for the same, and finally, (iii) the depositors to understand the method and then have the ability to compare banks? It needs to be appreciated that this is too much of expectation from depositors since there are ground level limitations. While trying to ensure that the depositors’ earnings are derived in a transparent and comprehensible manner using prudent accounting/computing standards, through this paper we attempt to reiterate the need to address the skew in the present interest computation setup that is disadvantage to the depositors. Some recommendations are made to address the concerns...|$|E

The third sweep (MCS 3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS 4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, and the fifth sweep (MCS 5) in 2012 - 2013, when they were eleven years old. Sub-sample studies : Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see SN 5614).

MCS web pages : Further information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. MCS Health Visitor Survey : The dataset is derived from a survey of health visitors undertaken as part of the MCS. The Health Visitor Survey was prepared at the same time as the MCS 1 fieldwork, and conducted soon after the MCS 1 survey was completed. This time the focus was not on individual MCS participants, but on local services for young families in the MCS electoral wards. It was felt that health visitors might be well placed to provide an expert overview of what was available in the local area, especially given their role in needs assessment. The idea was to provide a snapshot of information about the neighbourhoods in which MCS children would be growing up, so as to help explain health inequalities and ultimately improve the services available to those children. Main Topics : Topics covered include: Childcare available: e. g. local authority/private/employer-provided; Health facilities: e. g. psychologist, speech therapist, physiotherapist; Family support: Family Service Units, National Childbirth Trust etc.; Leisure facilities: open spaces, play areas, pools, sports facilities; Statutory initiatives – Housing (or Education) Action Zone, Sure Start, etc. </ul...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This project dealt with the phonetic details of intonation in Dutch and English. It focused on the alignment of intonational targets (e. g. local peaks and valleys) with the vowels and consonants in speech. Limited past research had suggested that this is systematic, but the factors that affect it are not well understood. The depositor's earlier research suggested {{that in many cases}} intonation targets are anchored to specific sounds (e. g. the beginning of the vowel following a stressed syllable). This kind of precision was rather unexpected, because investigators have concentrated on more variable effects (e. g. the closer a target is {{to the end of a}} word, the earlier it is aligned). The main goal of this project was to determine how general this anchoring is, what kind of landmarks (consonants, vowels, word ends, etc.) can serve as anchors, and how much the alignment of anchored targets can be affected by more variable factors. One practical motivation for this research was to provide the basic knowledge for improvements to synthetic speech. Most of the empirical research of the proposed project consisted of experiments in both English and Dutch, in which carefully selected sentences were read aloud and detailed acoustical measurements made of the speech. The depositor also studied short (5 - 10 minute) dialogues spoken under somewhat controlled conditions these are the Map Task dialogues deposited in this dataset. English and Dutch were chosen because their sound structures are similar enough that conclusions can be generalised from one language to the other, yet different enough that certain kinds of experimental controls can be used in one language which would be impossible in the other. Also, both languages support important speech technology industries. Main Topics : This corpus of natural Dutch conversation was collected as part of a project primarily concerned with the phonology and phonetics of intonation. The Map Task procedure for collecting spontaneous speech was used. The Map Task is a widely used tool in the study of dialogue, because it allows researchers to study conversations which are completely spontaneous and yet remarkably predictable and consistent. The task works as follows: the two participants to the conversation each have a map showing a variety of pictured landmarks with names like shepherd's hut or Green Mountain. The maps may differ slightly in detail; crucially, one map (the instruction giver's map) has a route marked on it; and the other (the instruction follower's map) does not. Neither speaker can see the other's map, and in some versions of the task (but not this one) the speakers cannot see each other. The task is for the instruction giver to explain to the instruction follower where the route passes, referring to the various landmarks along the way, accurately enough that the instruction follower can reproduce the route on his or her own map. The basic reference on the Map Task is Anderson et al, (1991), The HCRC Map Task Corpus, Language and Speech 34, 351 - 366. Further information on the Map Task is available at: [URL] The point of using the Map Task was to obtain natural productions of certain intonation patterns (e. g. various kinds of question intonation) which are difficult to obtain in reading experiments without explicitly instructing the speakers how to speak (and sometimes not even then). The most important manipulation of the maps was to select landmark names that manifested the phonological structures that the depositor was interested in, and that contained consonant types which would permit easy analysis of pitch patterns. However, the basic conversational task was unaffected by these manipulations, and conversations in the corpus are entirely comparable to those recorded in various languages elsewhere. So far as <b>the</b> <b>depositor</b> <b>is</b> aware, no other Map Task corpus exists in Dutch. The conversations were recorded at the phonetics laboratory of the University of Nijmegan on 5 February 1999 (day 1) and 8 February 1999 (day 2). In both cases a complete quad (4 speakers, 8 conversations) was recorded. The speakers were all students at the university. The maps were based on maps from the original HCRC Map Task. The distribution of the landmarks and the route on the giver's map were identical to the originals, but the actual names of the landmarks were in Dutch and in most cases the pictures had to be adapted as well...|$|E

Birth Registration and Maternity Hospital Episode Data, 2001 - 2003 : The health questions included in the main MCS covered topics such as the mother's health during pregnancy, birth and delivery, and the baby's health immediately after birth. However, the time constraints on the MCS interview limited the number of health-related questions included in the questionnaire. Furthermore, mothers may not have been able to recall accurately some of the information on pregnancy and delivery when the nine-month interview was conducted. Mothers responding to the nine-month interview were therefore asked to give written consent to the following records being added to the survey: birth registration records, containing personal and demographic information about baby and parents at birth registration centrally collected hospital records: these data contain information about the mother's stay in hospital, including details of any operations performed or any diagnoses that were made during the hospital stay and the length of stay in hospital Coded hospital of birth data are also included in the dataset (see file hospanon_ns).

MCS 4 Physical Activity Data, 2008 The MCS 4 Physical Activity Data study surveyed levels and patterns of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) among the MCS cohort. Children who took part in MCS 4 (around age 7), were assessed using accelerometers issued to consenting child participants. These measurements were obtained primarily to understand the determinants and consequences of children's PA and SB in the context of the longitudinal biological, social, psychological, behavioural and environmental information collected earlier and to be collected subsequently at MCS home visits. Subsequently, an additional study investigating seasonal variation in levels and patterns of PA and SB was carried out in a sample of MCS children who had participated in the main accelerometer study during winter 2008 / 09. Repeat accelerometer measurements were obtained from these children during each of the three subsequent seasons during a single calendar year. For further information see the documentation and the main MCS 4 survey, held at the UK Data Archive under SN 6411. Main Topics : The interviewers invited all children surveyed at age 7 years to wear an accelerometer or 'activity monitor'. Activity was measured using the Actigraph GT 1 M uni-axial accelerometer (Actigraph, Pensacola, Florida); a small (38 x 37 x 18 mm) and lightweight (27 g) device. The MCS children were asked to start wearing their accelerometer the morning after they received it on their right hip for seven consecutive days during all waking hours, but to remove it during aquatic activities as the accelerometers are not waterproof. Children received either a 26 " or 32 " sized belt based on their waist size, which was measured at the home interview. Families were asked to complete the timesheet for all days the accelerometer was worn, to cover duration of wear and periods when not worn, as well as whether the week was a 'typical' one. Families were asked to return their accelerometer (attached to the belt) and the completed timesheet as soon as possible after the monitoring period...|$|E

Background : The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were: to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born {{at the start of}} the 21 st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will require to provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229) to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and development to focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may be to emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhood to investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when available Additional objectives subsequently included for MCS were: to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion) to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom The first sweep (MCS 1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS 2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS 3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS 4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, and the fifth sweep (MCS 5) in 2012 - 2013, when they were eleven years old. Sub-sample studies : Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see SN 5614). Weighting : Users should note that the weighting section in the 'Guide to the Datasets' document recommends analysis in Stata, as SPSS is not currently able to weight the data using the survey design factors. <b>The</b> <b>depositor</b> <b>is</b> working on a solution for SPSS, but this is not yet available. A Stata version of the dataset is available for download by registered users, alongside the SPSS and tab-delimited versions. MCS web pages : Further information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. Further objectives for MCS 2 were as follows: to chart continuity and change since the age of nine months in the child's family and parenting environment to chart the child's transitions and adaptations to settings and relationships outside the immediate home and family to assess key aspects of the child's physical, cognitive, social and emotional development to maximise longitudinal potential for predicting and explaining future development to 'recapture' information not collected at the first sweep Latest edition: For the eighth edition (December 2012), an updated version of the derived variables dataset was added to the study. Syntax was also run on the parents' dataset to remove some variables that had been updated and moved to the derived variables dataset - see list in the READ file for details. A new oral fluid collection data file was also added. A new version of the Derived Variables User Guide, an updated Guide to the Datasets and a new document covering the oral fluid collection, have been added to the documentation. Main Topics : Information was gathered from the cohort members' parents or guardians by Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) interview, a Computer Aided Self-completion Interview (CASI), and a self-completion questionnaire. In addition there were four assessments of the cohort child. The Main Respondent questionnaire included a 'Household Module' covering the parental situation, parenting activities, child's health, child care, grandparents and friends, parents' health, self-completion questions, employment, income and education, housing and local area, other matters, employment history and new families. The Partner Respondent questionnaire included questions on the parental situation, parenting activities, grandparents and friends, parents' health, and self-completion questions on employment, employment history, income and education. The questionnaire given to proxy respondents covered the parental situation, grandparents and friends and parents' health. The Child Assessments conducted included British Ability Scales, the Braken Basic Concept Scale, height and weight. An older sibling self-completion questionnaire was also used where appropriate. Users should note that the MCS 2 dataset currently includes data from the Main Questionnaire, longitudinal data files covering Household Grid and Family Level Information for linkage between MCS 1 (held under SN 4683) and MCS 2, and CAPI documentation for the Main, Partner and Proxy Respondents only. <br...|$|E

A new version of the Derived Variables User Guide and an updated Guide to the Datasets have been added to the documentation. Main Topics : Interviews were conducted with the baby's mother (or other main carer) and father (or other partner of main carer). The mother or main carer interviews covered ethnicity and language, the baby's father, lone parenthood, pregnancy, labour and delivery, baby's health and development, childcare, grandparents, friends and social support, parental health, education and training, employment and earnings, housing, community and local services, time with and without the baby and other interests. The interview also included a self-completion element covering baby's temperament and behaviour, relationship with partner, previous relationships, domestic tasks, previous pregnancies, mental health, attitudes to relationships, parenting, work, etc. The father's or main carer's partner interviews covered ethnicity and language, father's involvement with the baby, lone parenthood, baby's mother (if not resident), grandparents and friends, parental health, education and training, employment and earnings, time with and without the baby and other interests. The self-completion element of the father's/main carer's partner interview covered baby's temperament and behaviour, relationship with partner, previous partners, previous children, mental health and attitudes to marriage, parenting and work. Either parent or carer could answer the household module questions, which covered household composition and relationships, children, employment status, caring responsibilities for the baby born in 2000 and language spoken at home. Standard Measures: Subsets and adaptations of the following measures were used: Denver Developmental Screening Test Carey Infant Temperament Scale Condon Maternal Attachment Questionnaire Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State Malaise Inventory Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory (RSE) Other variables were based on questions used in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (not currently held at the UKDA) and the National Child Development Study (NCDS) (held under GN 33004).

MCS web pages : Further information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. MCS 5 : The fifth sweep took place when the children were aged around 11 and in their last year of primary school. Fieldwork started in January 2012 and finished in February 2013. Interviews were conducted with the main carer (typically the child's parent) and their co-resident partner (typically the child's other parent). The cohort children had measurements taken of their height, weight and body fat; participated in three cognitive assessments and completed a self-completion questionnaire. A survey of class teachers was also conducted but only in England and Wales, and consent was collected from the parent and children to contact the teacher. For the second edition (August 2015), the following changes were made: a previously-unavailable geographically linked dataset has been added; an updated version of the cm_capi file was deposited with variables EPELIG 00 and EPRESP 00 added and variables EDEMOT 00, EDCOND 00, EDHYPE 00, EDPEER 00, EDPROS 00 and EDEBDTAA moved to the cm_dvs file; the variable EHPSEX 00 has been added to the hh_grid dataset; variable EPROOW 00 has been removed from the parent interview file; some corrections have been made to some of the derived variable datasets where errors were found; and two new documents have been added – a CAPI variables list and a guide to MCS 5 derived variables. Main Topics : The files currently included in the MCS 5 study comprise data from the main Parent Interview, the Household Grid, Child Measurement and Assessment and the Cohort Member self-completion questionnaire. The Parent Interview file comprises data from the Main Respondent, Partner Respondent and Proxy Respondent questionnaires, which covered household information; family context; education, schooling and childcare; child and family activities; parenting activities; child's health; parent's health; employment, income and education; housing and local area; and other matters. The Household Grid file comprises demographic data on households and additional derived variables. The Child Assessments and Measurement files include cognitive and physical measurements, including verbal similarities; a memory task (officially named the Spatial Working Memory task); a decision-making task (officially named the Cambridge Gambling task); height; weight; and waist circumference and body fat measurement. The Cohort Member paper self-completion was given to all participant children. The Teacher Survey data covered information about the child (ability, attitude, behaviour, Special Educational Needs, friends); the child's parents; streaming and setting, the child's class; and basic demographics about the teacher. <br...|$|E

MCS 4 : The objectives of MCS 4 were the same as MCS 3, namely: to continue tracking the child's physical, cognitive and behavioural development to chart continuity and change in the child's family circumstances and physical environment up to age seven to record the child's transition to primary school and their experience of the first years at school to track the child's previous experience of early education and day-care, along with current out-of-school care arrangements record the progress of the child's older siblings to re-contact families who had participated in at least one of the earlier surveys but who may not have participated in all sweeps to ask the children directly about their thoughts and experiences at age seven The first edition of MCS 4 was released in April 2010. For the second edition (November 2010), some extra materials were deposited: the MCS 4 geographically-linked data file, the main MCS 4 Technical Report and Appendix, the Teacher Survey questionnaires for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Teacher Survey technical report.
