5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is off to}} Philadelphia to {{interview}} at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) new company, Athlead, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) decides to come along, since office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is still not back from his sailboat excursion. She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E
5|$|While still {{popular with}} the Rhodesian Front members, he was criticised at the 1972 Party Congress for his lack of success in {{improving}} Rhodesia's image around the world; however, he retained the confidence of Ian Smith and was kept on in a government reshuffle on 24 May 1973. That winter saw him promote a new Broadcasting Bill to transfer control of the monopoly Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation. Allan Savory, then the lone white opposition MP, criticised the Bill for {{the composition of the}} proposed board, which was dominated by strong supporters of the Rhodesian Front. Van der Byl insisted, somewhat unsuccessfully to foreign observers, that the government was not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E
25|$|E-mails and flyers repeating {{allegations}} about Obama and other candidates {{were distributed to}} voters in Iowa and South Carolina just before they went to vote for presidential candidates. In Iowa, Obama told his supporters: “You have e-mails saying that I’m a Muslim plant that’s <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> America. If you get this e-mail from someone you know, set the record straight.” Sen. Clinton's campaign fired at least two campaign volunteers for forwarding related e-mails about Obama.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{opinion was}} soon behind Maga instead of Apithy. Maga began {{to form an}} {{alliance}} with Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin, especially after Apithy {{voted in favor of}} joining the short-lived Mali Federation, an idea that Maga opposed. In response, the premier added more U.D.D. deputies to his government in a January 1960 cabinet reshuffle. However, they became more vocal in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> Dahomey. Maga began to ally with Chabi Mama and Arouna Mama, who became his closest colleagues.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding {{his general}} support for Milošević in this period, Bajatović {{ultimately}} became aligned with a reformist faction in the Socialist Party led by Ivica Dačić. He remarked in September 2002 that the party's relationship with Milošević {{would need to}} become more reciprocal, noting that some of Milošević's recent communications to the party could be perceived as dictates. He accused Milošević's wife Mirjana Marković of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> and radicalize the party, and he opposed Milošević's efforts to place Bogoljub Bjelica into a position of party leadership.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Carrera {{decided to}} return to Guatemala and did so {{entering}} by Huehuetenango, where he met with the native leaders and told them that they must remain united to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started developing a new Indian identity under Carrera's leadership. In the meantime, {{in the eastern part of}} Guatemala, the Jalapa region became increasingly dangerous; former president Mariano Rivera Paz and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the Corregidor office in 1849.|$|E
25|$|The Top 20 list also {{reportedly}} {{played a}} part in the death of Sydney criminal Jacky Steele, who was shot in Woollahara in November 1965. Steele — who had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> protection rackets controlled by McPherson — survived for almost a month before dying from his wounds, but before he died he told police that McPherson had ordered his execution because Steele had bought multiple copies of OZ and had made great play of the fact that McPherson was not number 1. Oz revealed this in a subsequent issue, which contained extracts from the minutes of a confidential meeting of Sydney detectives, held on 1 December 1965, which had been leaked to the magazine by an underworld source.|$|E

25|$|Still, in {{contrast}} to 250 years of political fragmentation that followed Pagan’s collapse, this interregnum proved brief. As ephemeral as the overextended Toungoo Empire was, the underlying forces that underpinned its rise were not. By 1622, {{a branch of the}} fallen house (known retrospectively as the Restored Toungoo Dynasty or Nyaungyan Dynasty) had succeeded in reconstituting a major portion of the First Toungoo Empire, except for Siam, Lan Xang and Manipur. The new dynasty did not overextend itself by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> Siam or Lan Xang. This was a more “realistic and organic” polity that would last until the mid-18th century. The new dynasty proceeded to create a political and legal system whose basic features would continue under the Konbaung dynasty (1752–1885) well into the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Packer {{was often}} the centre of controversy. One of the {{earliest}} incidents occurred on 7 June 1960, {{when his father was}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the Anglican Press, a small publisher run by Francis James. According to author Richard Neville, Frank Packer was angered by James' refusal to sell the Anglican Press, so he sent Kerry and some burly friends to pressure him into selling. They forced their way in and reportedly began vandalising the premises, but James was able to barricade himself in his office and call his friend Rupert Murdoch, Packer's most powerful rival. Murdoch quickly dispatched his own team of 'heavies', who threw Kerry and friends out. Not surprisingly, the Murdoch press had a field day with the news that the son of Australia's biggest media tycoon had been caught brawling in the street.|$|E
25|$|An {{invasion}} scare in 1859 led to {{the creation}} of the Volunteer Force and huge enthusiasm for joining local Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). The 1st Surrey RVC or South London Rifles was one of the first such units formed, being based on the existing Peckham Rifle Club and recruiting many other members from the Hanover Sports Club at Peckham. The first officers were commissioned into the unit on 14 June 1859, and the headquarters was established in Camberwell. The following year it absorbed the 3rd Surrey RVC (first commissions 26 August 1859), also based at Camberwell, which became No 2 Company. The 1st Surrey RVC was active in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> other South London groups: in November 1859 it made an unsuccessful approach to a new sub-unit formed in Putney (which actually joined the 9th Surrey RVC in Richmond). By the end of 1860 the strength of the 1st Surrey (South London) RVC was eight companies, recruited across Camberwell, Peckham and Clapham, under the command of Lt-Col John Boucher, formerly of the 5th Dragoon Guards. The uniform was Rifle green with red facings. An affiliated Cadet Corps was formed at Dulwich College in 1878.|$|E

500|$|Isiah Thomas, who was President of the Players' Union from 1988 to 1994, blasted Falk {{by saying}} that [...] "he's been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the union for years," [...] and many saw Falk as the {{controlling}} influence in the union's negotiations. [...] Falk's involvement in the 1998 lockout also led to Mike Lupica famously dubbing Falk [...] "Rasputin off the bench" [...] in a New York Daily News article, [...] "the rare person who could make a writer root for a sports owner." [...] The lockout finally ended just 29 hours before the cancellation of the entire NBA season after the players overwhelmingly ratified the latest deal put forward, 179-5.|$|E
500|$|Already {{skeptical of}} Napolitano's support of [...] "Brasco", Massino was deeply {{disturbed}} by the breach of security when he learned of the agent's true identity.

[...] In his own testimony, Massino instead claimed Napolitano was targeted for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the Bonannos himself. On August 17 the former renegade Frank Lino and Steven Cannone drove Napolitano to the house of Ronald Filocomo, a Bonanno family associate, for a meeting. Napolitano was greeted by captain Frank Coppa, then thrown {{down the stairs to the}} house's basement by Lino and shot to death. [...] Napolitano's body was discovered the following year.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} {{scene in}} the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech seems {{to have come from}} two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over.</b> The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur Ivan Boesky (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, [...] "Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself." ...|$|E

She is also in on the secret that Ben's mother, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), faked her own death ten years ago and wants to return to Walford. Before returning to Portugal, Peggy visits the Queen Vic and meets its new landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), who tells her to [...] "get out of my pub".|$|E
500|$|Stuntman Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the {{recommendation}} of special make-up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Before the producers contacted him, Mears had already heard about {{the production of a}} new Friday the 13th and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role. He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers. The studio worried that Mears' pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character, but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role. According to Mears, [...] "They were like, 'You're really nice...are you {{going to be able to}} switch over, right?' I was like, 'I cage fight..and I've got a lot of dad issues. So yeah.'". Mears said he related to [...] "Jason the victim" [...] when he was growing up, and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film. To Mears, Jason represents people who were bullied in high schoolspecifically those with physical deformitiesfor being outcasts. Jason is unusual because he exacts his revenge on those <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> his territory at Crystal Lake.|$|E
