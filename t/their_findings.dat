5|$|All {{daughter}} isotopes (decay products) of element 117 {{were previously}} unknown; therefore, their properties {{could not be}} used to confirm the claim of discovery. In 2011, when one of the decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit a claim for <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{unable to}} find any {{evidence}} of a fort in the area, the soldiers went back down Fishing Creek to Bloomsburg.

5|$|In 1948, Eric Dingwall, K. M. Goldney and Trevor H. Hall, {{three members}} of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), two of whom had been Price's most loyal associates, {{investigated}} his claims about Borley. <b>Their</b> <b>findings</b> were published in a 1956 book, The Haunting of Borley Rectory, which concluded that Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.|$|E

One 2014 study revealed that pseudosemiglabrin extracted from the aerial parts of Tephrosia apollinea had an antiproliferative effect on cancer cell lines.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare <b>their</b> <b>findings,</b> should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} {{the morale of the}} Muslim fighters.

5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that dry berthing was physically possible for the ship, it was necessary to make a preliminary evaluation of the engineering viable ways in which dry berthing could actually be accomplished.

50|$|In 1955 and in 1973, Itigilov's {{body was}} {{examined}} by Buddhist monks, who were astonished to observe {{no signs of}} decay. They were too reluctant to divulge <b>their</b> <b>finding</b> to the anti-religious authorities of the Soviet Union and the body remained in situ until 2002.|$|R
5|$|The group later {{noticed that}} tablet K {{was a close}} {{paraphrase}} of the recto of G. Kudrjavtsev wrote up <b>their</b> <b>findings,</b> which were published posthumously.

5|$|Wallace and Bates {{spent most}} of their first year {{collecting}} near Belém do Pará, then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss <b>their</b> <b>findings.</b> In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist Richard Spruce, along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from yellow fever), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.|$|E

5|$|After {{travelling}} to the Himalaya {{the first}} time, the Workmans became entranced with climbing and mountaineering. Over {{a span of}} 14 years, they traveled eight times to the area, {{which at the time}} was almost completely unexplored and unmapped. Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment, freeze-dried foods, sunblock, or radios. On each expedition, they explored, surveyed, and photographed, ultimately reporting on <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> and creating maps. The couple shared and alternated responsibilities; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, {{containing}} the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, iwi Te Arawa lodged a claim {{with the}} Waitangi Tribunal for Haane Manahi {{to have his}} award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal {{upgraded}} to a Victoria Cross.

Instead, {{it was decided that}} Manahi would be recognised by the presentation of an altar cloth, a personal letter from Queen Elizabeth II acknowledging his gallantry and a sword. The award was presented to Manahi's son by The Duke of York on 17 March 2007 at a ceremony in Rotorua.|$|E
