5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into opposition to <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution,</b> with fears that Darwinism {{had led to}} German militarism and {{was a threat to}} religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting to <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> in public schools. Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v.

A challenging question about whether <b>the</b> exclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> Darwinian <b>Evolution</b> would harm the scientific progress was asked to a Brazilian population sample. In general, the results showed a rejection of the above question. Among the religious respondents, Spiritualists were those showing higher acceptance of the proposed statement whereas the Evangelicals were those less agreeing with the proposed question and with a considerable percentage of disagreement; Catholics were in a median position, agreeing with the question and a few rejecting it. The more educated the respondents were the higher acceptance of the question.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> was {{gradually}} introduced into {{more and more}} public high school textbooks in the United States after 1900, but {{in the aftermath of}} the First World War the growth of fundamentalist Christianity gave rise to a creationist opposition to such teaching. Legislation prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> was passed in certain regions, most notably Tennessee's Butler Act of 1925. The Soviet Union's successful launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 sparked national concern that the science education in public schools was outdated.

25|$|Before Darwin's {{argument}} and {{presentation of the}} evidence for evolution, Western religions generally discounted or condemned any claims that diversity of life {{is the result of}} an evolutionary process, as did most scientists in the English scientific establishment. However, evolution was accepted by some religious groups such as the Unitarian church and the liberal Anglican theologians who went on to publish Essays and Reviews. as well as by many scientists in France and Scotland and some in England, notably Robert Edmund Grant. Literal or authoritative interpretations of Scripture hold that a supreme being directly created humans and other animals as separate Created kinds, which to some means species. This view is commonly referred to as creationism. From the 1920s to the present in the US, there has been a strong religious backlash to <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> theory, particularly by conservative evangelicals.
