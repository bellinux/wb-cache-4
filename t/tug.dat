50|$|During the Second World War, <b>tugs</b> were {{seconded}} to the US Navy {{to fight}} in the Pacific. <b>Tugs</b> were needed to help the Navy in the South Pacific; in the North Pacific with the Aleutian Campaign; in Alaska with the Alaska Highway. <b>Tugs</b> were needed in the logging industry, a vital war commodity. <b>Tugs</b> were needed to build bases, move ships, build ships around the Sound as the State geared up for war. More <b>tugs</b> were built in the emergency program (over 850 <b>tugs</b> were built nationwide for the navy) and these became available for civilian use after the war.|$|R

5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch <b>tug</b> Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another <b>tug</b> made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the <b>tug</b> began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E

During the invasion of Saipan, which began on June 15, 1944, Valentin R.

The second Games featured a greatly expanded range of events from the first, up from 43 to 95. Among the events added in 1900 was the <b>tug</b> of war. Two <b>tug</b> of war teams were entered for the Paris tournament; Racing Club de France represented the host nation, along with a team from the United States which was composed of six athletes that were taking part in various other events during the Games. The American team withdrew from the competition, as they discovered that the <b>tug</b> of war was scheduled {{at the same time as}} the hammer throw which three of their team were competing in. A Scandinavian team was accepted as a late-entry by the organisers, comprising a mix of Swedish and Danish athletes competing at the Games. Various reports assign the credit for the formation and entry of this team to different sources; a Danish account claimed that it was one of the Danish pullers, Eugen Schmidt who was responsible, while a Swedish record attributed it to their representative at the Games, Lieutenant Bergh.|$|E
