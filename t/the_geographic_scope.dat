25|$|New Brunswick {{was one of}} {{the four}} {{original}} provinces of Canada that entered into Confederation in 1867. The Charlottetown Conference of 1864 had originally been intended only to discuss a Maritime Union of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, but concerns over the American Civil War as well as Fenian activity along the border led to an interest in expanding <b>the</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> of the union. This interest arose from the Province of Canada (formerly Upper and Lower Canada, later Ontario and Quebec) and a request was made by the Canadians to the Maritimers to have the meeting's agenda altered.|$|E

The two subsequent drafts included much more substantial amendments: {{the first in a}} late August draft by Lord Milner – one of the original five members of Lloyd George's War Cabinet as a minister without portfolio – which reduced <b>the</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> from all of Palestine to [...] "in Palestine", and the second from Milner and Amery in early October, which added the two [...] "safeguard clauses".|$|E

A concurrent use application may not be filed based on a party's intent to use a mark, but must rely on actual use in commerce.

Instead of making the usual assertion that no other party {{has the right to}} use the mark, the applicant must assert that no other party [...] "except as specified in the application" [...] has such a right.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of studies have {{demonstrated}} that proximity effects from knowledge spillovers, network externalities and other forms of knowledge transfers among like firms are geographically bounded. However, only a few studies have measured <b>the</b> strength and <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> of such externalities and even fewer have done so for firms in very close proximity. In this study, we examine <b>the</b> size and <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> of proximity effects among all life science firms that have received Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants in the US over a 23 -year period while controlling for relevant regional and firm characteristics. From our empirical analysis, we conclude that proximity effects among nearby small life science firms are strong within one-tenth of a mile distance and are exhausted within a radius of 1. 5 miles. By examining the location of all firms in the sample, we offer possible explanations for <b>the</b> narrow <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> of <b>the</b> measured proximity effects. We also explain the significance of such findings for academic research that seeks {{to understand the nature of}} spatial externalities and for public policy...|$|R

2500|$|Prior to {{designing}} a distribution system, the planner needs {{to determine what}} the distribution channel is to achieve in broad terms.

The process of setting out a broad statement of the aims and objectives of a distribution channel is a strategic level decision.|$|E
2500|$|John Williams {{composed}} {{and conducted}} the film's musical score, the second score composed {{the same year}} by Williams for Spielberg after The Adventures of Tintin. [...] Williams took inspiration by visiting a horse farm in California and observing horses and their behavior, elaborating that [...] "I got {{in the habit of}} watching the horses in the morning, and I began to see how they connect to each other and how they became curious about me. That's when I really began to get the sense that horses are very special creatures. They have been magnificent and trusted friends {{for such a long time}} and have done so much for us with such grace." [...] Williams was also influenced by <b>the</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> of the film's story. In regards to that approach, Williams stated; [...] "This was a very rich opportunity musically because it is both about humans and animals and it takes place in three different countries. It starts out in a more intimate way, on the farm with the bonding of Joey and Albert. Then, the eruption of war changes the scale, and the music does a 180-degree turn. From this bucolic, gentle, even sentimental music, you move into the music of battle surges and gripping struggles. It's a musical journey full of dimension and emotional content, and I tried also to create an atmosphere reflective of that period, which was lyrical, poetic and tragic." [...] The score was recorded by a 90-piece orchestra, with Williams comparing the recording sessions more to a concert piece rather than a traditional film score, as it relied more on the individual performance of the musicians.|$|E

50|$|The main {{differences}} between the Charter-Agenda and the European Charter lie, on the one hand, in <b>the</b> different <b>geographic</b> <b>scope</b> of each document (one is global, while the other is European) and, on the other hand, in the agenda or local action plan that the Charter-Agenda contains.

30|$|The link-local {{multicast}} capability emulation {{is achieved}} by relying on the geo-multicast/geo-broadcast capabilities provided by the ETSI GN layer. In particular, {{in order to be}} link-local multicast capable, an IP link must provide symmetric reachability [3], which is normally not accomplished by virtual links spanning multiple physical links {{due to the lack of}} reference boundaries. Link-local multicast packets are forwarded with geographical knowledge, so that a node processes a packet only if it was addressed to the area where the node is located. <b>The</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>scoping</b> provides non-variable virtual link boundaries which enable symmetric reachability. For RAs, this means that RAs must be delivered to--and only to--the nodes that are part of the same IPv 6 link, nodes that are actually connected via multiple wireless hops. If a multi-hop path exists, all the nodes within the area will receive a copy of the RA, and the IPv 6 instance running above the geonetworking will process the message as if the node was directly connected to the access router that issued the message.|$|R
