40|$|AIM: Assessment of peri-implant tissues around single implant-supported single fixed crown restorations {{can follow}} {{different}} protocols. The {{aim of this}} study was to asses peri-implant hard and soft tissues according to clinical periodontal parameters, modified for implant standard, and to radiographic parameters, and to test correlations between clinical parameters and historical bone loss. METHODS: Forty-two Brànemarks implants (implant-supported single fixed crown restorations positioned between two natural <b>teeth)</b> <b>inserted</b> in 24 patients were assessed according to clinical and radiographic parameters, without removing the prosthetic crown. RESULTS: All implants were judged successful according to published criteria. Results of some clinical parameters differed between smokers and non-smokers. Radiographic measurements of peri-implant bone loss were in line with published data. Bone loss also correlated with the distance between adjacent teeth and implants. CONCLUSION: Radiographic parameters were found to be the most appropriate for evaluation of successful implants. While clinical parameters proved useful for distinguishing immediately between swollen and healthy tissues, they did not indicate a negative prognosis for osseointegration nor for potential complications affecting peri-implant soft tissues...|$|R

5|$|The cat skull {{is unusual}} among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a {{powerful}} and specialized jaw. Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine <b>teeth,</b> <b>inserting</b> them {{between two of the}} prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae. The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair {{on each side of the}} mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication. Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective To compare periapical {{radiograph}} (PR) and cone-beam {{computed tomography}} (CBCT) {{in the diagnosis}} of alveolar and root fractures. Material and Methods Sixty incisor teeth (20 higid and 40 with root fracture) from dogs were inserted in 60 anterior alveolar sockets (40 higid and 20 with alveolar fracture) of 15 macerated canine maxillae. Each fractured socket had a root fractured <b>tooth</b> <b>inserted</b> in it. Afterwards, each maxilla was submitted to PR in two different vertical angulation incidences, and to CBCT imaging with a small field of view (FOV) and high-definition protocol. Images were randomized and posteriorly analyzed by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists two times, with a two-week interval between observations. Results Sensitivity and specificity values were good for root fractures for PR and CBCT. For alveolar fractures, sensitivity ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 90 for PR and from 0. 50 to 0. 65 for CBCT. Specificity for alveolar fractures showed lower results than for root fractures for PR and CBCT. Areas under the ROC curve showed good results for both PR and CBCT for root fractures. However, results were fair for both PR and CBCT for alveolar fractures. When submitted to repeated measures ANOVA tests, there was {{a statistically significant difference}} between PR and CBCT for root fractures. Root fracture intraobserver agreement ranged from 0. 90 to 0. 93, and alveolar fracture intraobserver agreement ranged from 0. 30 to 0. 57. Interobserver agreement results were substantial for root fractures and poor/fair for alveolar fractures (0. 11 for PR and 0. 30 for CBCT). Conclusion Periapical radiograph with two different vertical angulations may be considered an accurate method to detect root fractures. However, PR showed poorer results than CBCT for the diagnosis of alveolar fractures. When no fractures are diagnosed in PR and the patient describes pain symptoms, the subsequent exam of choice is CBCT...|$|R

Seventy incisors were inserted into TSB medium, sterilized and contaminated with E. faecalis. Culture medium was replaced each 24 h and incubated at 37 oC for 72 h. After chemo-mechanical preparation, root canals {{were filled with}} Calen or PMCC-Calen (7 or 14 days). Pastes were removed and <b>teeth</b> were <b>inserted</b> into test tubes containing Enterococcosel broth. Calen paste (maintained for 7 and 14 days) induced 70 % elimination of enterococci and PMCC-Calen 100 % elimination only after maintenance for 14 days. These medications were significantly more effective (p< 0. 001) than chemo-mechanical protocol alone and PMCC-Calen maintained for 7 days, both incapable to eliminate the viability of enterococci. Calcium hydroxide pastes demonstrated important adjuvant effects in the elimination of enterococci during chemo-mechanical preparation of root canal systems. When associated with PMCC, calcium hydroxide pastes should be maintained for at least 14 days...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: (a) To {{determine}} the force-time trace {{that occurs when}} a spring mounted simulated upper jaw is impacted; (b) to examine if mouthguards of variable quality have significant influence on such force-time traces; (c) to attempt to relate physical events to {{the profile of the}} force-time traces recorded. - Methods: A simulated jaw, consisting of ceramic <b>teeth</b> <b>inserted</b> into a hard rubber arch reinforced with a composite jawbone, was fitted with various mouthguards as part of a previous round robin study. A clinical assessment distinguished good, bad, and poor mouthguards, and these were each fitted to the jaw, which was then submitted to instrumental impact tests under conditions expected to produce tooth fractures. The force-time trace was recorded for such impact events. - Results: The spring mounting method caused two distinct peaks in the force-time trace. The initial one was related to inertia effects and showed an increase in magnitude with impactor velocity as expected. The second peak showed features that were related to the differences in the mouthguards selected. - Conclusions: The use of a force washer within a conical ended impactor enabled force-time traces to be recorded during the impact of a spring mounted simulated jaw fitted with mouthguards of variable quality. The spring mounting system causes an initial inertial peak followed by a second peak once the spring mount has fully compressed. Good fitting guards, which keep most teeth intact, result in high stiffness targets that in turn generate high reaction forces in the impactor. If the spring mounting is omitted, the two peaks are combined to give even higher reaction forces. The force-time trace offers some potential for assessing both overall mouthguard performance and individual events during the impact sequence. Mouthguards with good retention to the jaw remained attached during the impact event and helped to preserve the structural integrity of the target. This in turn developed high forces {{in the second part of}} the force-time trace. Guards that detached during impact and allowed tooth fractures showed lower forces in the second part of the test. The force profile measured offered some quantitative support to, and agreement with, the observed clinical quality of the mouthguards...|$|R
50|$|Mating in {{the horn}} shark occurs in December or January, on a {{possibly}} annual reproductive cycle. The male chases the female to indicate interest; once she is ready both sharks {{settle on the}} bottom, where the male grips the female's pectoral fin in his <b>teeth</b> and <b>inserts</b> one of his claspers into her cloaca.

Not including the flanges, the case measures 10 - 12 cm long and 3 - 4 cm wide; sharks from the Channel Islands produce longer egg cases than those from mainland California, suggesting that they are separate populations.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} ex vivo {{study was}} to compare the {{accuracy}} of radiographic and electronic root canal length determination methods, compared with actual root canal length obtained with stereomicroscope. Materials and Methods: Thirty extracted single-rooted permanent teeth were used for this study. After access preparation, actual length (AL) of the root canal were determined for each <b>tooth</b> by <b>inserting</b> a # 15 file until {{the tip of the}} file was visible at the apical foramen under a stereomicroscope. The radiographic working length determination was determined with a digital radiographic system and for the electronic measurement all teeth were embedded in an alginate model to test apex locator in-vitro. Data was analyzed using the descriptive statistic and intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: No significant difference was found between the radiographic and electronic root canal working length determination (P> 0. 05). The percentage of electronic measurements within ± 0. 5 mm to the apical constriction was 93. 34 % and 90 % for radiographic methods within ± 0. 5 mm of all cases compared with AL.

5|$|By {{the age of}} 22, Evans {{moved out}} of wheel-making and became a {{specialist}} in forming the fine wire used in textile cards, which were used to comb fibers {{in preparation for the}} spinning process to make thread or yarn. A desire to increase the efficiency of this process led him to his first invention—a machine which would bend wire into teeth and cut them off rapidly to aid the assembly of cards. George Latimer, then a justice of the peace in Newport, saw its potential and tasked a blacksmith with creating the machine, which became one of Evans's early successes when it was introduced in 1778. Evans wished to go further in mechanizing the production of textile cards by developing a machine which could puncture the leather into which the wire <b>teeth</b> were <b>inserted.</b> His invention greatly speeded the card manufacturing process, producing around 1,500 teeth every minute, though Evans himself was unable to find financial backing to commercialize his invention. Nevertheless, {{over the next two decades}} card manufacturing innovations inspired by Evans's led to the development of automated textile card production, then in great demand due to the growth of the Southern cotton industry. Early pioneers of mechanized textile-card production, including Giles Richards and Amos Whittemore, are thought to have borrowed heavily from his original designs.|$|R

Removal of filling material was performed with Reciproc, Mtwo and ProDesign Logic 50 /. 01 files. The <b>teeth</b> were <b>inserted</b> in a silicone mould, which was placed in a metal muffle, and split to visualize the residual filling material. The samples were divided into two groups (n = 11) according to the irrigation protocol: Passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI group) with 3 activations of 20 seconds and EasyClean (Easy Equipamentos Odontológicos, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) (EC group) used in continuous rotation with 3 activations of 20 seconds, both using NaOCl and EDTA. Environmental scanning electron microscopic images of the apical, middle, and cervical thirds were taken before and after the irrigant activation. The Kappa test was used to determine interexaminer agreement. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis, Mann–Whitney, and Wilcoxon tests (p 0. 05). No significant difference was observed in the removal of filling material in the apical, middle, and cervical thirds in both groups (p > 0. 05).

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the sealing ability of amalgam and C&BMetabond against coronal microleakage of Entrococcus Faecalis. Materials & Methods: In this experimental in vitro study, 54 premolar teeth were randomly dividedto two groups of 24 teeth and for each the access cavities were prepared. The pulp chamber floorobturated with amalgam or C & B Metabond in two test groups. A further two groups of three teethserved as negative and positive controls. The external surface of each root, except the apical region,was covered with two layers of nail varnish.

Materials and Methods : Root canal treatment was performed on all 30 maxillary central incisors. Post space was prepared and samples were divided into three groups of 10 each. The <b>teeth</b> were <b>inserted</b> with pre-fabricated stainless steel, carbon fiber and ceramic post and cemented using adhesive resins, core fabricated and crowns placed. Mode of failure {{was carried out by}} immersing the teeth in black ink for 12 h and then sectioning them mesio-distally.

Statistical Analysis : Fracture strength was measured using a universal testing machine. Data were evaluated statistically using the Kruskal Wallis test and the Mann Whitney " U "-test. Mode of failure was evaluated statistically using the chi-square test. Results : There was a statistically significant difference showing that the stainless steel post had a better fracture resistance when compared with the other two posts and the carbon fiber showed a statistically more favorable fracture when compared with the other two posts. Conclusions : Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the pre-fabricated stainless steel post exhibited a significantly higher fracture resistance at failure when compared with the carbon fiber post and the ceramic post.

Four hundred and eighty simulated lateral canals were created in 80 single rooted cleared <b>teeth</b> by <b>inserting</b> 06 K-files at 2, 4. 5 and 6 mm of working length. Samples were mounted on clear silicon to simulate the presence of surrounding periodontal tissues and its effects on fluid dynamics and then randomly assigned to four experimental groups: 1 (n = 20) 5. 25 % NaOCl + sonic activation; 2 (n = 20) 5. 25 % NaOCl + ultrasonic activation; 3 (n = 20) 5. 25 % NaOCl + 17 % EDTA + sonic activation and 4 (n = 20) 5. 25 % NaOCl + 17 % EDTA + ultrasonic activation. Sonic activation was delivered using the Endoactivator® inserted 2 mm short of working length and activated for 1 minute. Ultrasonic activation was performed with a stainless steel ultrasonic file inserted 2 mm short of working length and passively activated for 3 cycles of 20 seconds each. Samples were evaluated by direct observation of the images recorded under the operating microscope and by radiographic evaluation after irrigation with a contrast solution. Sonic and ultrasonic activation resulted in a better irrigation of the lateral canals at 4. 5 and 2 mm from working length compared to traditional needle irrigation alone. Traditional needle irrigation alone demonstrated significantly less penetration of irrigant into the lateral canals and was limited to the level of penetration of the needle. In conclusion, the addition of EDTA did not result in better penetration of irrigants into the lateral canals.

40|$|Introduction: Coronal microleakage is {{the major}} cause of failure of root canal treatments. The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the sealing ability of white MTA, C&B Metabond and cavit against coronal microleakage of Enterococcus faecalis for four months. Methods and Materials: Ninety extracted single–rooted human teeth were selected. Root canal instrument-tation and abturation with gutta-percha was performed. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 20 teeth each, plus two control groups consisting of 5 teeth. Three millimeters of gutta-parcha was removed from the coronal aspect of the root canals in the groups I, II, III and replaced with C&B Metabond, cavit and white MTA, respectively. The teeth in group IV did not receive an intraorifice barrier. The external surface of each root, except the apical region, was covered with two layers of nail varnish. All <b>teeth</b> were <b>inserted</b> in the designed system for this experiment. The whole system was sterilized and then transferred in a BHI culture. A fresh solution of E. faecials was injected in to the system every 3 days. The samples were evaluated daily for 120 days and the time of culture contamination with E. faecalis was registered in each case. Statistical tests of Variance and Duncan were used to analyze the results. Results: All the samples in positive control group were infected after 24 hours. None of the negative control samples were infected after 120 days. Group I (C&B Metabond) and group II (cavit) had no significant difference with group III (White MTA). But groups I, II were significantly different from group IV (without barrier). Group III wasn’t significantly different with group IV. Conclusion: The obturated root canals that received a C&B Metabond or cavit orifice plug leaked significantly less than the obturated, unsealed group. Therefore, to prevent coronal microleakage this material can be recommended as a intraorifice barrier before restorative treatment is initiate...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the special}} anatomy of the {{deciduous}} dentition carious lesions in the proximal spaces of primary molars often elude the diagnosis by clinical inspection. As {{a recognition of the}} disease in the initial stage is particularly important the use of other diagnostic tools is necessary. KaVo offers the DIAGNOdent pen 2190 to detect caries in the interdental space using the laser fluorescence technique. The present study investigates the performance of the DIAGNOdent pen in the approximal area {{between the first and second}} primary molars. The results are compared with the visual and tactile inspection after separation of the teeth. In 58 patients, aged 3 - 11 years, a total of 218 approximal surfaces with the DIAGNOdent pen were examined. Both with the standard proximal detection tip and with a gracile designed research probe three measurements were made by oral and vestibular. The measurements were repeated after separation of the <b>teeth</b> by <b>inserting</b> an orthodontic rubber ring. This was followed by visual and tactile inspection of the meanwhile accessible tooth surfaces, which formed the basis for the final diagnosis. With the recommended threshold value of 7, which differs a caries-free from an initially diseased tooth surface, the device achieved a sensitivity of 41. 4 % for the conventional probe and 45. 7 % for the research probe. The specificity was 96. 1 % and 97. 1 %, respectively. The positive predictive value (92. 3 % and 94. 6 %, respectively), negative predictive value (59. 0 % and 61. 1 %, respectively) and kappa coefficient (0. 361 and 0. 413, respectively) were determined. The ROC analyses suggest that a more sensitive classification for an early caries detection in the primary dentition could be useful. Cumulative effects of adjacent teeth with caries were not found. A valuation of the surface state of a lesion can be drawn to some extent. But it can not be reliably concluded by the measurements on the constitution of the lesion. These conclusions must be considered critical and should be done with the involvement of all caries risk factors of the patient. According to Spearman's coefficient (0. 479 and 0. 347, respectively) there is a weak correlation between DIAGNOdent value and lesion depth. In conclusion the DIAGNOdent pen 2190 is a valuable addition for proximal caries diagnosis in deciduous molars, but without making other methods unnecessary. The critical interpretation of the measured values can provide valuable information in the examination of proximal surfaces of primary molars without giving a disadvantage for the patient. In combination with other diagnostic procedures the dentist may obtain a higher therapeutic safety with the help of the DIAGNOdent pen...|$|R
