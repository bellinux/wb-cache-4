5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

25|$|Herbicide — Asulam (also {{known as}} Asulox) is {{selective}} for ferns; glyphosate is not; but {{the latter has}} the advantage that the effects can be seen soon after application.

25|$|Dry bone {{exhibits}} some piezoelectric properties. Studies of Fukada et al. showed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{due to the}} apatite crystals, {{which are}} centrosymmetric, thus non-piezoelectric, but due to collagen. Collagen exhibits the polar uniaxial orientation of molecular dipoles in its structure and {{can be considered as}} bioelectret, a sort of dielectric material exhibiting quasipermanent space charge and dipolar charge. Potentials are thought to occur when a number of collagen molecules are stressed in the same way displacing significant numbers of the charge carriers from the inside {{to the surface of the}} specimen. Piezoelectricity of single individual collagen fibrils was measured using piezoresponse force microscopy, and it was shown that collagen fibrils behave predominantly as shear piezoelectric materials.|$|E

25|$|However, {{reprogramming}} {{allows for}} the creation of pluripotent cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, from adult cells. It is important to note <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> adult stem cells, but adult cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein transcription factors, pluripotent stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have been derived. The first demonstration of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells was conducted by Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues at Kyoto University. They used the transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells. Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells. Junying Yu, James Thomson, and their colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Madison used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human foreskin. However, they were able to replicate Yamanaka's finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.|$|E
25|$|Howard Robinson is {{a philosopher}} who has {{concentrated}} his research within {{the philosophy of}} mind. Taking what has been through {{the latter part of}} the last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of sense-data he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. His books (particularly Matter and Sense and Perception) are characterized by the thoroughness with which he deals with the arguments of opposing philosophers, thus setting a professional example that it would be well for his opponents to follow (for there has been a tendency to take for granted that the theory of sense-data is wholly obsolescent). In one of his most recent articles he takes the physicalist to task for ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example (phosphenes are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain—as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 the {{scholars}} Philip J. Cook and Jens Ludwig published a report finding that blacks do not face any stronger social pressures than whites {{to succeed in}} school, nor do they have greater feelings of alienation towards education in general.

2500|$|Less common are {{unilateral}} {{contracts in}} which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer {{are not required to}} communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> contractual offers but merely an [...] "invitation to treat" [...] (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions.

2500|$|A {{strongly}} derived condition {{show the}} phalanges, small disc-shaped elements positioned in long rows. Sometimes, {{the number of}} fingers is reduced, to as low as two. This is a rather common phenomenon within the Tetrapoda. Unique, however, for derived tetrapods, {{is the fact that}} some species show nonpathological polydactyly, the number of fingers being higher than five. Some species have ten fingers per hand. These fingers again, can have an increased number of phalanges, up to thirty, a phenomenon called hyperphalangy, also known from Plesiosauria, mosasaurs, and Cetacea. The high number of elements allows the flipper to be shaped as a hydrofoil. When a high number of fingers is present, their identity is difficult to determine. It is usually assumed that fingers were added at both the front and at the rear, perhaps to a core of four original fingers. If fingers are added, often the number of metacarpals and carpals is also increased; sometimes even an extra lower arm element is present. Earlier, it was common to divide ichthyosaurs into [...] "longipinnate" [...] and [...] "latipinnate" [...] forms, according to the long or wide shape of the front flippers, but recent research has shown <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> natural groups, ichthyosaur clades often containing both species with and without elongated forelimbs.|$|E

[...] Scarr was equally critical of Eysenck's hypotheses, {{one of which was}} the supposition that slavery on plantations had selected African Americans as a less intelligent sub-sample of Africans. Scarr also criticised another statement of Eysenck on the alleged significantly lower IQs of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek immigrants in the US relative to the populations in their country of origin. [...] "Although Eysenck is careful to say <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> established facts (because no IQ tests were given to the immigrants or nonimmigrants in question?" [...] Scarr writes that the careful reader would conclude that [...] "Eysenck admits that scientific evidence to date does not permit a clear choice of the genetic-differences interpretation of black inferiority on intelligence tests," [...] whereas a [...] "quick reading of the book, however, is sure to leave the reader believing that scientific evidence today strongly supports the conclusion that US blacks are genetically inferior to whites in IQ." [...] Some of Eysenck's later work was funded from the Pioneer Fund, an organization often criticised for allegedly promoting scientific racism, However, Eysenck himself was vehemently opposed to racism.

He now moves from [...] "upbuilding (Edifying) discourses" [...] to [...] " [...] discourses", however, he still maintains <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> [...] "sermons". [...] A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks.

Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one's might-but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God-for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do-only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness.
