5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E
5|$|While this happens, Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy are {{imported}} into the datascape by an avatar of the journal's uncorrupted data, which {{takes the form}} of a virtual Riku, to better assist Data-Sora in debugging the journal. They discover that Pete and Maleficent have also entered the datascape to use it in their latest attempt at world domination. After Data-Sora has made significant headway into his mission, Maleficent destroys his Keyblade and kidnaps Data-Riku, but he continues through the datascape with the help of Donald and Goofy until he regains the ability <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> the Keyblade. He then confronts Pete at the top of Hollow Bastion.|$|E

60|$|Lee Schoenstein was {{standing}} at the table, and by his side an expectant youth with a small moustache and pince-nez. Sally got up, and the next moment Ginger was alone, gaping perplexedly after her as she vanished and reappeared in the jogging throng on the dancing floor. It was the nearest thing Ginger had seen <b>to</b> a <b>conjuring</b> trick, and at that moment he was ill-attuned <b>to</b> <b>conjuring</b> tricks. He brooded, fuming, at what seemed to him the supremest exhibition of pure cheek, of monumental nerve, and of undiluted crust that had ever come within his notice. To come and charge into a private conversation like that and whisk her away without a word...|$|R

5|$|Wild men or savages—usually {{depicted}} carrying staves or clubs, living {{beyond the}} bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for man without God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who danced to firelight either <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E

25|$|Lintel 24 is the {{designation}} given by modern archaeologists {{to an ancient}} Maya limestone carving from Yaxchilan, in modern Chiapas, Mexico. The lintel dates to about 725 CE, placing it within the Maya Late Classic period. The text of Maya hieroglyphics indicates that the scene depicted is a bloodletting ritual that took place on 5 Eb 15 Mac, 709 CE. The ruler, Shield Jaguar, holds a torch while his consort, Lady Xoc, pulls a rope studded with what are now believed to be obsidian shards through her tongue in order <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> a vision serpent.|$|E

25|$|Although the GCFC bid team met all the {{criteria}} during their {{presentation to the}} AFL Commission, several stadium issues continued to delay the process. Initially, the Government of Queensland intended to uphold a contract clause that stated a second AFL team in Queensland must play all home games at the Gabba until 2016. The clause was later loosened and the AFL sought out joint funding for the redevelopment of Carrara Stadium. The AFL was able <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> up the funds needed for the redevelopment but it would all hinge on whether the Queensland Labor Party would be re-elected in the 2009 state election.|$|E

She possesses powerful pheromones that make people susceptible to mind control, as well as the ability <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> sentient plants that can attack and restrain enemies. Eventually, it was revealed that she only joined the group in order to manipulate them into fulfilling her own dark agenda, and she left upon being exposed and defeated by the other members.|$|E
25|$|The Sorting Hat {{has shown}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> the Sword of Gryffindor from under its brim, as shown on two instances. Both times {{it is used to}} kill snakes; in Chamber of Secrets, it {{provides}} the sword to Harry to kill the Basilisk, and in Deathly Hallows, it delivers the sword to Neville. Dumbledore makes it clear in Chamber of Secrets that only a true Gryffindor can summon the sword in this fashion. In Deathly Hallows the Sorting Hat is set on fire by Voldemort, although it appears the hat was not destroyed, as Neville was able to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from it immediately after and behead Voldemort's snake Nagini. In the epilogue at the end of Deathly Hallows, the Hat's survival is confirmed, as Harry tells his youngest son that the Hat would take his preference into consideration.|$|E

5000|$|In linguistics, an epithet {{only can}} be a metaphor, {{essentially}} a reduced or condensed use of apposition. Epithets are sometimes attached to a person's name or appear in place {{of his or her}} name, as what might be described as a glorified nickname or sobriquet. An epithet is linked to its noun by long-established usage. Not every adjective is an epithet. An epithet is especially recognizable when its function is largely decorative, such as if [...] "cloud-gathering Zeus" [...] is employed other than in reference <b>to</b> <b>conjuring</b> up a storm. [...] "The epithets are decorative insofar as they are neither essential to the immediate context nor modelled especially for it. Among other things, they are extremely helpful to fill out a half-verse", Walter Burkert has noted.|$|R

25|$|After the war Beith {{continued}} to write novels, {{but they did}} not achieve the great popularity of his earlier books. He became interested in the theatre, and wrote a succession of plays, several of which had notably long runs. The Times remarked that as a playwright Ian Hay was a name <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> with. Between the First and Second World Wars, Beith had eight plays produced of which he was the sole author, and a further eleven written in collaboration with others. His co-authors were Anthony Armstrong, Guy Bolton, Seymour Hicks, Stephen King-Hall, A E W Mason, Edgar Wallace and P. G. Wodehouse. His longest running plays in the inter-war years were Tilly of Bloomsbury (1919; 414 performances), Good Luck (with Seymour Hicks, 1923; 262 performances), The Sport of Kings (1924; 319 performances) and Housemaster (1936; 662 performances).|$|E

25|$|Back at UNIT, Captain Mike Yates and Sergeant Benton were {{watching}} {{the end of the}} broadcast as it went dead. In the morning they arrive at the village just as a heatwave engulfs the village. The Brigadier finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is an invisible dome-shaped barrier, 10 miles in diameter and one mile high, surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up and burst into flame. The barrier is centred on the church. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig where they find a small spaceship in the mound, which has been condensed. From this, the Doctor realises that the Master is trying <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> up an ancient and all-powerful demon, who is seen on Earth to be the Devil, but actually an alien. The Doctor explains that the Dæmons have influenced Earth throughout its history, becoming part of human myth, and see the planet as a giant experiment. The Master has called the Dæmon up once, and right now, it is so small as to be invisible. The third summoning, however, could signal the end of the experiment, and the world.|$|E
