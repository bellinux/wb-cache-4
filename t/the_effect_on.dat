5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Australians {{were far}} more circumspect. The nation's {{involvement}} cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work {{as a result of their}} injuries. The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well. Financially it was very costly, while <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E

In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Dammasch State Hospital {{was closed}} {{by the state}} of Oregon, and the site was then {{proposed}} as a location for what became the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, which opened in 2001 at a different site {{to the north of the}} old hospital grounds. In protest of the construction of the prison, specifically <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> property values, Larry Eaton began erecting school buses on his property. The former grounds of the state hospital are, as of 2009, under development as Villebois, a primarily residential complex. Also in 1995, Wilsonville High School opened as part of the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, the first high school in the city's history. In 1998, lack of an adequate long-term water supply forced the city to suspend adding any new developments to the city. A new water treatment plant on the Willamette River opened in 2002 to address this need.|$|E

5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans.

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{establishment}} of the crusader states in the east helped ease Seljuq pressure on the Byzantine Empire, which had regained some of its Anatolian territory with crusader help, and experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity in the 12th century. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the Muslim dynasties of the east was gradual but important. In the wake of the death of Malik Shah I in 1092, political instability and the division of the Great Seljuq Empire prevented a coherent defence against the Latin states. Cooperation between them remained difficult for many decades, but from Egypt to Syria to Baghdad there were calls for the expulsion of the crusaders, culminating in the recapture of Jerusalem under Saladin later in the century when the Ayyubids had united the surrounding areas.|$|E
