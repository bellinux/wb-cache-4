Beattie, a Halo fan, wrote the script between other {{projects}} in the hope <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> read it and agree to produce the film but as of May 2008 {{there are no plans}} to do so.|$|E
5|$|For many years, {{the islanders}} had {{no means of}} {{contacting}} the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and hoping <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> see them. A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in {{the centre of the}} island, symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. It is still there today, though no longer in use.|$|E
5|$|The issue went {{to court}} in September 1883, when Eddy complained that her student Edward Arens had copied parts of Science and Health in a pamphlet, and Arens counter-claimed that Eddy had copied it from Quimby in the first place. Quimby's son was so unwilling to produce his father's manuscripts that he sent {{them out of the}} country (perhaps fearing {{litigation}} with Eddy or <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> tamper with them), and Eddy won the case. Things were stirred up further by Eddy's pamphlet Historical Sketch of Metaphysical Healing (1885), in which she again called Quimby a mesmerist, and by the publication of Julius Dresser's The True History of Mental Healing (1887).|$|E
50|$|The Roman army under Marcus Atilius Regulus {{was based}} at Tunis. Faced by the resurgent Carthaginian army Regulus was keen to gain another victory {{rather than risk}} the chance <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> get the glory of {{eventual}} victory.|$|R
5|$|Universal {{wanted a}} sequel to Jaws early into {{the success of the}} {{original}} film. Producers Brown and Zanuck realized <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> produce the film if they did not, and preferred {{to be in charge of}} the project themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Jim {{went around}} town bragging {{of his latest}} prank, telling {{everyone}} (except Doc Stair, who he figured would be angry); however, Paul told Doc what happened and Doc promised to make Jim suffer. Notably, Doc tells Paul <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> who <b>would</b> pull such a prank [...] "ought not to be let live".|$|R
25|$|Houses, {{cars and}} {{businesses}} were abandoned by those evacuating. Some locked their front doors, some did not, reasoning <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> break {{the door to}} get in anyway. Some gave away pets, others just released them, many put them down. Some gave away furniture and belongings, some gave it to someone for safe storage, others simply walked away, leaving dirty {{dishes in the sink}} and food on the table. The withdrawal of cash from banks was limited to £20 per person. People could take just one suitcase.|$|E
25|$|Although Hulme {{would claim}} {{third place in}} the 1970 Mexican Grand Prix, the race was marred by the immense crowd of over 200,000. The crowd proved almost {{uncontrollable}} and almost forced the cancellation of the race. They were crammed {{in front of the}} guard-rails, sat at the trackside and ran across the track itself. The drivers were concerned <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> be killed. During qualifying Hulme missed some children by inches. They were playing a game of chicken to see who got nearest to the cars as they hurtled past.|$|E
25|$|Polanski {{returned}} to the United States, and was contracted {{by the head of}} Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, to direct and write the screenplay for Rosemary's Baby, which was based on Ira Levin's novel of the same name. Polanski later admitted that he had wanted Tate to star in the film and had hoped <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> suggest her, as he felt it inappropriate to make the suggestion himself. The producers did not suggest Tate, and Mia Farrow was cast. Tate reportedly provided ideas for some of the key scenes, including the scene in which the protagonist, Rosemary, is impregnated. A frequent visitor to the set, she was photographed there by Esquire and the resulting photographs generated considerable publicity for both Tate and the film.|$|E
5000|$|On Day 43 after Diana's eviction, it was {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> leave the House then. [...] "A Voz" [...] automatically nominated Alexandra and Joana for being the two last housemates to enter the House, {{and all the other}} housemates had to vote for who they wanted to evict. Joana P. received the most votes, and was ejected.|$|R

50|$|The studio {{ordered a}} sequel early into {{the success of}} Jaws. The success of The Godfather Part II and other sequels meant that the {{producers}} were under pressure to deliver a bigger and better shark. They realized <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> produce the film if they didn't, and they preferred {{to be in charge}} of the project themselves. Spielberg declined to be involved in the sequel.|$|R
25|$|The secret {{agreement}} was concluded without any Japanese text {{so that it}} could be plausibly denied in Japan. Since only the American officials recorded the oral agreement, not having the agreement recorded in Japanese allowed Japan's leaders to deny its existence without fear <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> leak a document to prove them wrong. The arrangement also made it appear that the United States alone was responsible for the transit of nuclear munitions through Japan. However, the original agreement document turned up in 1969 during preparation for an updated agreement, when a memorandum was written by a group of U.S. officials from the National Security Council Staff; the Departments of State, Defense, Army, Commerce and Treasury; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Central Intelligence Agency; and the United States Information Agency.|$|E
25|$|Nkrumah never {{returned}} to Ghana, but he continued to push for his vision of African unity. He lived in exile in Conakry, Guinea, as the guest of President Ahmed Sékou Touré, who made him honorary co-president of the country. Nkrumah read, wrote, corresponded, gardened, and entertained guests. Despite retirement from public office, {{he felt that he}} was still threatened by Western intelligence agencies. When his cook died mysteriously, he feared <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> poison him, and began hoarding food in his room. He suspected that foreign agents were going through his mail, and lived in constant fear of abduction and assassination. In failing health, he flew to Bucharest, Romania, for medical treatment in August 1971. He died of prostate cancer in April 1972 at the age of 62.|$|E

In 2011 (taking into account inflation and purchasing power), the equivalent amounts for the United States, Australia and United Kingdom are US$1.50, A$2 and £1 respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1983, Sudirman sang a {{song for}} the late Puan Sri Saloma titled [...] "Mama".

2500|$|Edward Burne-Jones had dreaded <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> unsympathetic <b>would</b> attempt his biography, and {{had asked}} {{his wife to}} take up the task. Georgiana, now aged 58, began work within months of Edward's death, reveling in memory. In a letter to F. G. Stephens, she wrote, [...] "There are so few left now who can recall those early days when Gabriel [...] was in his glory and Edward and Morris sat at his feet and rejoiced in his light".|$|R
500|$|Giffords and {{her husband}} had spoken dozens of times about how risky her job was. She was afraid <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> come up to her at a public event with a gun.

Gabrielle Giffords is too tough to let this beat her." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1969, Mosley {{was invited}} to {{represent}} March at the Grand Prix Constructors' Association (GPCA), which negotiated joint deals on behalf of its member teams. Although the new March organisation was not popular with the established teams, Mosley has said that [...] "when they went along to meetings to discuss things such as prize money, they felt they ought to take me along because I was a lawyer". He was unimpressed with the standard of negotiations: [...] "our side all went in a group because no-one trusted anyone else and all were afraid <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> break ranks and make a private deal." [...] In 1971, British businessman Bernie Ecclestone bought the Brabham team, and Mosley recalls that: ...|$|E
500|$|The creators {{also had}} to address why Lex Luthor would socialize with young people. They created a {{loneliness}} in the character which they felt would drive him {{to reach out to}} the teenagers, a loneliness echoed in Clark and Lana. Gough and Millar wanted a parallel to the Kents and created Lionel Luthor, Lex's father, whom they saw as conducting an [...] "experiment in extreme parenting." [...] They wanted a younger Kent couple, to be involved in Clark's life and help him on his journey. Chloe Sullivan (another character created for the series) was considered the [...] "outsider" [...] the show needed to ensure <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> notice the strange happenings in Smallville rather than a [...] "precursor to Lois Lane".|$|E
50|$|The {{children}}'s infant brother, the Lamb, is {{the victim}} of two wishes gone awry. In one, the children become annoyed with tending their brother and wish <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> want him, leading to a situation where everyone wants the baby, and the children must fend off kidnappers and Gypsies. Later, they wish that the baby would grow up faster, causing him to grow all at once into a selfish, smug young man who promptly leaves them all behind.|$|R
50|$|Waiting for {{publication}} was highly stressful for Morgan, who feared <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> {{be the first}} to publish the evolutionary scheme that he considered his main intellectual contribution. Overall, Morgan was not pleased with Henry's editorship, and he considered his demands of peer review and many rounds of revisions to be excessive. Morgan, a lawyer by profession, estimated that the effort of researching, writing, and producing the book cost him 25,000 dollars in expenses and lost profits.|$|R

500|$|Soon {{after his}} appointment, Peale began {{to engage in}} a private {{business}} on the Mint's premises. [...] He did this by designing, striking and selling medals for private commission, using government property and labor, and the Philadelphia Mint's facilities. Peale's enterprise was very profitable, as his expenses were minimal. [...] This activity took place with the knowledge of the other officers of the Philadelphia Mint, most of whom were Peale's friends and relatives. Clients included corporations as well as one couple celebrating a 50th wedding anniversary. According to Robert E. Wright in his history of Philadelphia as an early financial center, the legality of Peale's business was unclear, but [...] "the uncertainty of the situation made it almost inevitable <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> make a stink on [...] Chestnut Street." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{had been}} {{unlikely}} that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher. He {{was unable to}} make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He {{failed to make the}} Bowling Green State University team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). [...] After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind Dwight Gooden) career ERA among active pitchers, he believed <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, [...] "I think someone's going to break it from me because I know I'm not any big deal".|$|E
500|$|Scotland Yard {{published}} facsimiles of the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] {{letter and}} the postcard on , in the ultimately vain hope <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> recognise the handwriting.

[...] On [...] 1888, George R. Sims in the Sunday newspaper Referee implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist [...] "to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high". Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the [...] "Dear Boss" [...] letter and the postcard. The journalist was identified as Tom Bullen in a letter from Chief Inspector John Littlechild to George R. Sims dated [...] 1913.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{importance}} of preserving a psychological dimension in addressing the treatment of psychology's relationship to the social. The fact <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>would</b> not have responded in quite this way forces to posit an internal world, Vince's psychological reality that is not simply reducible to social discourses, even though it can only be understood through, and in relation to, such discourses, i. e. psychosocially.

500|$|Ned Flanders, who was {{designed}} by Rich Moore, {{first appeared in the}} season one episode [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". The episode was the series premiere, but not the first episode produced. The first episode in which Flanders and his family were prominent is season two's [...] "Dead Putting Society", which also contained the first appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders. The character was named after Flanders Street in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. Groening described the inspiration for Flanders as [...] "just a guy who was truly nice, that Homer had no justifiable reason to loathe, but then did". It was not until after the first few episodes that it was decided Flanders would be a faithful Christian. Mike Scully noted that Flanders is [...] "everything Homer would love to be, although he'll never admit it". Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but Harry Shearer used [...] "such a sweet voice" [...] and Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> prefer to live next to over Homer. Flanders is known for his nonsensical jabbering. His first use of the word [...] "diddly" [...] was in [...] "The Call of the Simpsons".|$|E
500|$|Viewership did drop {{significantly}} in Season 2, and Carnivàle was cancelled in 2005 after {{two of six}} planned seasons. In a post-cancellation interview, Daniel Knauf was positive <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> let him finish his story someday, if not as a television series, then possibly {{as a series of}} features or graphic novels. Knauf approached Marvel Comics to continue the future Carnivàle storyline that he had kept to himself. They seemed interested, but HBO, who own the show and the characters, would not confer their rights. During the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, Knauf stated that [...] "an idiosyncratic show like Carnivàle would never be greenlit today," [...] and claimed that present-day television included a high percentage of [...] "talking heads" [...] with [...] "the vast majority of television writers [...] visual storytellers." [...] Enjoying his creative freedom as graphic storyteller, he has considered directing his efforts away from television series creation. Meanwhile, the mythology of Carnivàle remains in the public conscience. In 2008, Alessandra Stanley of the Australian newspaper The Age remembered Carnivàle as a [...] "smart, ambitious series that move unusual characters around an unfamiliar setting imaginatively," [...] while A.V. Club called the show [...] "a fantastically rich series with a frustratingly dense mythology".|$|E
500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>would</b> want to give me her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E
