5|$|In 1960, after {{completing}} only 12 test fights {{in a new}} role as a <b>transonic</b> research platform, the last IAe 33 prototype was retired and placed into storage, bringing the Pulqui II project to a culmination. The remaining factory tooling and incomplete airframes were summarily destroyed soon after.|$|E
5|$|Almost every fighter {{project in}} the postwar era {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters in the late 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved <b>transonic</b> performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Canada CF-103 was a {{proposed}} Canadian interceptor, designed by Avro Canada {{in the early}} 1950s as a development, and possible replacement of the company's CF-100 Canuck, that was entering service at the time with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Although intended {{to be capable of}} flying at <b>transonic</b> speeds, the CF-103 only proffered a moderate increase in performance and capability over the CF-100; subsequently, the aircraft never progressed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis {{were not as}} {{successful}} as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended on. Work on the skis and legs improved this situation somewhat, but {{they were unable to}} resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic speed in level flight with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher <b>transonic</b> drag.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of <b>transonic</b> and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at <b>transonic</b> speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
5|$|By early 1988 both No.3 and No.77 Squadrons had {{successfully}} converted to the F/A-18, and No. 79 Squadron {{was no longer}} required. Preparations to return the unit's Mirages to Australia {{took place during the}} first months of 1988, and on 3May they departed Butterworth. As the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornet squadrons were to be based in Australia, this marked the end of the permanent deployment of RAAF fighters to Butterworth that had begun in mid-1958. No.79 Squadron's aircraft commemorated the occasion by conducting a spectacular low-altitude flypast of the base, the first leg of which commenced at <b>transonic</b> speed. The aircraft were flown to Woomera in central Australia to be placed in storage via Paya Lebar, Bali, Darwin and RAAF Base Tindal. Most of No.79 Squadron's ground crew returned to Australia in late May, and the squadron was formally disbanded at Butterworth on 30June 1988.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the flow}} over the suction {{side of a}} <b>transonic</b> wing is {{accelerated}} to a supersonic speed, the resulting re-compression can be by either Prandtl-Meyer compression or by {{the formation of a}} normal shock. This shock is of particular interest to makers of <b>transonic</b> devices because it can cause separation of the boundary layer at the point where it touches the <b>transonic</b> profile. This can then lead to full separation and stall on the profile, higher drag, or shock-buffet, a condition where the separation and the shock interact in a resonance condition, causing resonating loads on the underlying structure.|$|E
25|$|These shocks appear {{when the}} flow over a <b>transonic</b> body is {{decelerated}} to subsonic speeds.|$|E

25|$|Flow {{is highly}} {{non-linear}} in the <b>transonic</b> regime, dominated by moving shock waves. It is mission-critical for aircraft that fly through <b>transonic</b> Mach numbers. The role of shock waves was first analyzed by Holt Ashley. A phenomenon that impacts stability of aircraft known as 'transonic dip', {{in which the}} flutter speed can get close to flight speed, was reported in May 1976 by Farmer and Hanson of the Langley Research Center.|$|E
25|$|Cryogenic tunnels: Here {{test gas}} is cooled down to {{increase}} the Reynolds number. The European <b>transonic</b> wind tunnel uses this technique.|$|E
25|$|While many flows (e.g. flow {{of water}} through a pipe) occur at low Mach numbers, many flows of {{practical}} interest in aerodynamics or in turbomachines occur at high fractions of M=1 (<b>transonic</b> flows) or in excess of it (supersonic or even hypersonic flows). New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in <b>transonic</b> flow, shock waves for supersonic flow, or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately.|$|E

25|$|Following {{flight testing}} of the X-48C in April 2013, Boeing and NASA {{announced}} future plans to develop a larger BWB demonstrator capable of <b>transonic</b> flight.|$|E
25|$|Heavy gas tunnels: Heavier gases like freon and R-134a {{are used}} as test gases. The <b>transonic</b> {{dynamics}} tunnel at NASA Langley {{is an example of}} such a tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Compressible flow {{accounts}} for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density {{is assumed to}} be constant. <b>Transonic</b> and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.|$|E
25|$|For flight speeds {{near the}} speed of sound (<b>transonic</b> flight), {{airfoils}} with complex asymmetrical shapes are used to minimize the drastic increase in drag associated with airflow near {{the speed of}} sound. Such airfoils, called supercritical airfoils, are flat on top and curved on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|These videos {{detail the}} Active Aeroelastic Wing {{two-phase}} NASA-Air Force flight research program {{to investigate the}} potential of aerodynamically twisting flexible wings to improve maneuverability of high-performance aircraft at <b>transonic</b> and supersonic speeds, with traditional control surfaces such as ailerons and leading-edge flaps used to induce the twist.|$|E
25|$|These {{problems}} were eventually solved as jet aircraft reached <b>transonic</b> and supersonic speeds. German scientists in WWII experimented with swept wings. Their research was applied on the MiG-15 and F-86 Sabre and bombers {{such as the}} B-47 Stratojet used swept wings which delay the onset of shock waves and reduce drag.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the project}} was {{eventually}} cancelled, the research was used to construct an unmanned missile that went on to achieve a speed of Mach 1.38 in a successful, controlled <b>transonic</b> and supersonic level test flight; this was a unique achievement at that time which validated the aerodynamics of the M.52.|$|E
25|$|A partial reheat (20% thrust boost) was {{installed}} {{to give the}} required take-off thrust. It was also used for <b>transonic</b> acceleration from just below Mach 1 up to Mach 1.7; the engine supercruised above that speed and at cruise the thrust through the engine mounts contributed 8% of the thrust from the complete propulsion system.|$|E
25|$|The new fighter {{may have}} a {{significantly}} longer fuselage than other fifth generation fighter designs, such as the F-22, for reduction of <b>transonic</b> and supersonic drag. A trapezoidal wing may be implemented for reduction of drag and radar signature. Use of an 's'-shaped air inlet and boundary layer separation system would greatly reduce radar signature.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} YF-102 {{made its}} first flight on 23 October 1953, at Edwards AFB, but was lost in an accident nine days later. The second aircraft flew on 11 January 1954, confirming a dismal performance. <b>Transonic</b> drag was much higher than expected, and the aircraft was limited to Mach0.98 (i.e. subsonic), with a ceiling of 48,000ft (14,630m), far below the requirements.|$|E
25|$|Following on {{from the}} Delta 1, the Ministry of Supply {{requested}} that Fairey conduct a further model programme {{for the purpose of}} <b>transonic</b> investigations. However, Fairey did not find this proposal attractive, believing that a piloted aircraft would be mandatory if the project was to produce any worthwhile data. Fairey commenced work on a highly swept twin-engine aircraft; however, the Ministry lacked enthusiasm for the twin-engine configuration, largely due to an existing rival project underway to produce a twin-engine supersonic aircraft - this would become the English Electric Lightning. In February 1949, it was suggested that Fairey examine the prospects for a single-engine <b>transonic</b> aircraft as an alternative; {{by the end of the}} year, the company had produced their new project, out of which the Fairey Delta 2 (FD2) would directly originate. Accordingly, the Ministry issued Air Ministry Specification ER.103 for the project, ordering that a pair of prototype aircraft be produced.|$|E
25|$|In aerodynamics, {{the sound}} barrier usually {{refers to the}} point at which an {{aircraft}} moves from <b>transonic</b> to supersonic speed. On October 14, 1947, just under a month after the United States Air Force had been created as a separate service, tests culminated in the first manned supersonic flight where the sound barrier was broken, piloted by Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager in the Bell X-1.|$|E
25|$|The Lavochkin La-168 first flew on April 22, 1948. (The American F-86 Sabre {{had first}} flown in October 1947.) It was {{designed}} {{to use the new}} turbojet based on the Rolls-Royce Nene in response to a 1946 request for an advanced swept-wing jet fighter capable of <b>transonic</b> performance. The engine was placed behind the pilot, but with a high-mounted wing and T-tail compared to the similar MiG-15.|$|E
25|$|His {{test flying}} was {{instrumental}} in proving the Lockheed P-38 Lightning design. He and chief engineering test pilot Milo Burcham alternated flying dive tests to observe the design's performance at <b>transonic</b> speeds. To demonstrate {{the reliability of the}} design {{in the hands of a}} skilled pilot, he performed aerobatic shows for students at the Polaris Flight school at War Eagle Field in nearby Lancaster.|$|E
25|$|Another {{critical}} addition {{was the use}} of a power-operated stabilator, {{also known}} as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilot's control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early <b>transonic</b> flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail {{is considered to be a}} minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the <b>transonic</b> barrier safely without a loss of pilot control. The M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since gone on to be universally applied upon high-speed aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Three {{pre-production}} F-111A {{were provided}} to NASA for various testing duties. The 13th F-111A was fitted with new wing {{designs for the}} <b>Transonic</b> Aircraft Technology and Advanced Fighter Technology Integration programs in the 1970s and 1980s. It was retired to the United States Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1989. The remaining unconverted F-111As were mothballed at Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in June 1991.|$|E
25|$|Leading edge {{extensions}} {{and body}} lift are incorporated to enhance {{performance in a}} canard layout. This combination is said by the designer to generate 1.2 times the lift of an ordinary canard delta, and 1.8 times more lift than an equivalent sized pure delta configuration. The designer claims such a combination allows {{the use of a}} smaller wing, reducing supersonic drag without compromising <b>transonic</b> lift-to-drag characteristics that are crucial to the aircraft's turn performance.|$|E
25|$|A {{supercritical}} airfoil is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay the}} onset of wave drag on aircraft in the <b>transonic</b> speed range. Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional airfoil shapes. The {{supercritical airfoil}} was invented and designed by NASA aeronautical engineer Richard Whitcomb in the 1960s. Testing successfully commenced on a United States Navy Vought F-8U fighter through wind tunnel results in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>Transonic</b> {{refers to}} a range of flow {{velocities}} just below and above the local speed of sound (generally taken as Mach 0.8–1.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the critical Mach number, when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become supersonic, and a higher speed, typically near Mach 1.2, when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{design criterion}} for the J-20 describes high instability. This requires sustained pitch authority {{at a high}} angle of attack, in which a conventional tail-plane would lose effectiveness due to stalling. On the other hand, a canard can deflect opposite to the angle of attack, avoiding stall and thereby maintaining control. A canard design is also known to provide good supersonic performance, excellent supersonic and <b>transonic</b> turn performance, and improved short-field landing performance compared to the conventional delta wing design.|$|E
25|$|The design's {{potential}} for supersonic performance and reduced <b>transonic</b> drag stirred {{interest in the}} U.S. Navy. By 1953, redesigns led to a completely new aircraft bearing {{no more than a}} familial resemblance to the Cougar. The new wing had full-span leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps with roll control achieved using spoilers rather than traditional ailerons. For storage on aircraft carriers, the F-11 Tiger's wings manually folded downwards. Anticipating supersonic performance, the tailplane was all-moving. The aircraft was designed for the Wright J65 turbojet, a license-built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire.|$|E
