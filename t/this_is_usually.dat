5|$|At {{least two}} subspecies, T. m. merula and T. m. nigropileus, will mimic {{other species of}} birds, cats, humans or alarms, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> quiet and hard to detect.|$|E
5|$|Ab initio phasing {{or direct}} methods – <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> {{the method of}} choice for small {{molecules}} (<1000 non-hydrogen atoms), and has been used successfully to solve the phase problems for small proteins. If {{the resolution of the}} data is better than 1.4 Å (140 pm), direct methods can be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.|$|E
50|$|A grippli <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> {{neutral in}} alignment. Those that deviate from <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> good; an evil grippli is rare.|$|R

5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, implying a surface gravity of 140 m/s², which is {{about half of the}} gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Sun (274m/s²).|$|E
5000|$|For connection-oriented {{communication}}s, communication parties {{usually have}} different roles. One party <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> waiting for incoming connections; <b>this</b> party <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> {{referred to as}} [...] "server". Another party is the one which initiates connection; <b>this</b> party <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> referred to as [...] "client".|$|R
5000|$|The pioneers' slogan was Für Frieden und Sozialismus seid bereit - Immer bereit" [...] ("For {{peace and}} {{socialism}} be ready - always ready"). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> shortened to [...] "Be ready - always ready". <b>This</b> <b>was</b> recited at {{the raising of}} the flag. One person said the first part, [...] "Be ready!": <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> the pioneer leader, the teacher or {{the head of the}} local pioneer group. The pioneers all answered [...] "Always ready", stiffening their right hand and placing it against their forehead with the thumb closest and their little finger facing skywards.|$|R
50|$|From their inception, {{regional}} stations GLV and BCV provided {{local news}} bulletins within their respective markets. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> supplemented by a relay {{of one of}} the Melbourne-based bulletins.|$|R
5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Faisalabadi cuisine is {{very much}} Punjabi cuisine, with {{influences}} from the realms of the Mughal and Colonial empires. Key ingredients include rice or roti (flatbread) served with a vegetable or non-vegetable curry, a salad consisting of spiced tomatoes and onions, and yogurt. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> accompanied {{by a variety of}} South Asian sweets such as jaggery, gajar ka halwa, gulab jamun, and jalebi. Tandoori barbecue specialties consist of a variety of naan bread served with tandoori chicken, chicken tikka or lamb shishkebab served with a mint chutney.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the Last Sonata, in B-flat major, is a farewell work in which Schubert faces his own death (somewhat analogous to the myths surrounding Mozart's Requiem); <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> ascribed to the relaxed, meditative character which dominates the two opening movements. Death scenes are also associated, somewhat more explicitly, with the more tragic C minor Sonata; Charles Fisk, for example, mentions ghosts and a 'dance of death', in the outer movements. However, when judging from a biographical point of view, the notion that Schubert felt his imminent death {{at the time of}} composing the last sonatas is questionable.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} borne {{in mind that}} the {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> not true of the sections at either end, which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become, since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|E

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds {{that human beings are}} cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> deferred until 24–48hours after admission, when the patient is stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but may need to happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which happens in 15% of cases).|$|E
5|$|The least weasel mates in April–July {{and there}} is a 34- to 37-day {{gestation}} period. In the Northern Hemisphere, the average litter size consists of 6 kits and these reach sexual maturity in 3 to 4 months. Males may mate during their first year of life, though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> unsuccessful. They are fecund in February–October, though the early stages of spermatogenesis do occur throughout the winter months. Anestrus in females lasts from September until February.|$|E

50|$|It {{may also}} have been placed in Proterocosma, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> {{considered}} a subgenus of Stagmatophora in earlier times. As it seems, though, Proterocosma is not particularly closely related to either Stagmatophora or Anatrachyntis.|$|R
5000|$|Intermediate-sized igloos {{were for}} semi-permanent, family {{dwelling}}. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> {{a single room}} dwelling that housed one or two families. Often there were several of these in a small area, which formed an Inuit village.|$|R
5|$|The {{second step}} is a Teach/Learn session where the {{instructor}} begins to present information {{based on what}} the participants don't already know. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> prefixed with a written statement describing in behavioral terms the objectives that the participant will complete during the session. The instructor may utilize more advanced members to help less skilled members. The instructor often tries to elicit information from the participants' experience by asking questions.|$|E
5|$|Aliens do not {{feature in}} the series, as Grant and Naylor decided {{very early in the}} process that they did not want aliens involved. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> {{addressed}} with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' (GELF), an artificially-created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.|$|E
5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E
