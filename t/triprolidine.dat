40|$|<b>Triprolidine</b> {{hydrochloride}} (C 19 H 22 N 2 ·HCl·H 2 O) (TPH) is {{a well-known}} antihistamine drug which is reported as being photosensitive. The thermal stabilities of TPH and of 1 : 1 molar and 1 : 1 mass ratio physical mixtures of TPH with β-cyclodextrin (BCD) and with glucose have been examined using DSC, TG and TG-FTIR, complemented by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) studies. Thermal studies of the solid TPH/BCD mixtures indicated that interaction between the components occurs {{and it is possible}} that the TPH molecule may be least partially accommodated in the cavity of the BCD host molecule.

40|$|Background: Since all antihistamines {{are capable}} of {{crossing}} the blood-brain barrier, they may also cause sedation which may impair daily activities such as driving a car. The purpose of this review {{was to examine the}} effects of antihistamines on driving ability. Method: A literature search revealed 18 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that applied the on-road highway driving test. In this test, subjects are instructed to drive 100 -km on a public highway with a steady lateral position and a constant speed (95 km/h). Primary outcome measure is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP, cm), i. e. the weaving of the car. Results: The literature search yielded 18 clinical trials. At therapeutic doses, a single dose of diphenhydramine, emedastine and hydroxizine impaired driving comparable or greater than the effects of BAC 0. 08 %. Clemastine, <b>triprolidine,</b> mizolastine, acrivastine, dexchlorpheniramine CR and mequitazine impaired driving performance to the same extent as BAC 0. 05 %. For mizolastine significant impairment was only seen after higher than therapeutic doses. Results for cetirizine were mixed, illustrating the drug has the potential to impair driving performance, especially in sensitive subjects. Terfenadine, loratadine levocetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, bilastine fexofenadine and rupatadine showed no driving impairment in the standard driving test after acute administration of their recommended dose. Several studies examined subchronic effects of antihistamines on driving performance. After 4 days of daily treatment significant driving impairment was found for emedastine (2 and 4 mg bid), diphenhydramine (50 mg), clemastine (2 mg bid), <b>triprolidine</b> (5 mg bid), after 5 days of ebastine (30 mg), and after 8 days of hydroxyzine (50 mg). Mixed results were found for cetirizine (10 mg), terfenadine (120 mg) and loratadine (20 mg). No significant differences from placebo were observed after 4 days of subchronic treatment with <b>triprolidine</b> (10 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg), fexofenadine (up to 120 mg), and after 8 days of daily treatment with dexchlorpheniramine (6 mg), bilastine (20 and 40 mg), and mequitazine (10 mg). Conclusion: First- and second-generation antihistamines may significantly impair driving performance. The newer antihistamines such as levocetirizine and fexofenadine that cross to blood brain barrier to a much lesser degree do not show clinically relevant sedation or driving impairment...|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} {{reported on the}} successful generation of immortalized (CEPI- 17 -CL 4) cells from primary human corneal epithelial (P-CEPI) cells which exhibited phenotypic, immunohistochemical and metabolic characteristics akin to the P-CEPI cells. The aims of the present studies were to investigate the ligand binding and functional coupling of the histamine receptors to various biochemical and physiological systems in the P-CEPI and CEPI- 17 -CL 4 cells and to relate these findings to the normal and/or pathophysiological role of histamine on the human ocular surface. Specific [3 H]-pyrilamine binding to CEPI- 17 -CL 4 cell homogenates comprised > 93 % of the total binding and represented interaction with an apparent single population of high affinity (Kd= 3. 76 ± 0. 78 [*]nM; n= 4) and saturable (Bmax= 1582 ± 161 [*]fmol[*]g− 1 tissue) number of histamine- 1 (H 1) receptor binding sites on CEPI- 17 -CL 4 cell homogenates. The H 1 -receptor selective antagonists, pyrilamine (Ki= 3. 6 ± 0. 84 [*]nM, n= 4) and <b>triprolidine</b> (Ki= 7. 7 ± 2. 6 [*]nM, n= 3), potently displaced [3 H]-pyrilamine binding, while the H 2 - and H 3 -receptor selective antagonists, ranitidine and clobenpropit, were weak inhibitors (Kis> 13 [*]μM). Histamine induced phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis 2. 7 – 4. 4 fold above basal levels and with a potency of 14. 9 ± 4. 9 [*]μM (n= 9) and 4. 7 ± 0. 2 [*]μM (n= 9) in P-CEPI and CEPI- 17 -CL 4 cells, respectively. Histamine-induced PI turnover was antagonized by H 1 -receptor selective antagonist, <b>triprolidine,</b> with a potency (Ki) of 3. 2 ± 0. 66 [*]nM (n= 10) and 3. 03 ± 0. 8 [*]nM (n= 4) in P-CEPI and CEPI- 17 -CL 4 cells, respectively, but weakly effected by 10 [*]μM cimetidine and clobenpropit, H 2 - and H 3 -receptor antagonists. The PI turnover response was attenuated by pre-treatment of the cells with the selective phospholipase C inhibitor, U 73122 (1 -(6 -((17 β- 3 -methoxyestra- 1, 3, 5 (10) -trien- 17 -yl) amino) hexyl) - 1 H-pyrrole- 2, 5 -dione) (IC 50 = 4. 8 ± 2. 4 [*]μM, n= 3). Histamine stimulated intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) mobilization in CEPI- 17 -CL 4 cells with a potency of 6. 3 ± 1. 5 [*]μM (n= 4). The histamine-induced [Ca 2 +]i mobilization was reduced by about 28 % following pre-incubation of the cells with 4 [*]mM EGTA. While <b>triprolidine</b> completely inhibited histamine-induced [Ca 2 +]i mobilization, it did not influence the bradykinin-induced [Ca 2 +]i mobilization response. Histamine (EC 50 s= 1. 28 – 2. 77 [*]μM, n= 3 – 4) concentration-dependently stimulated the release of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, {{but it did not}} significantly alter release of tumour necrosis factor-α, PGE 2 or collagenase- 1 (matrix metalloproteinase- 1; MMP- 1) from CEPI cells. However, IL- 1 (10 [*]ng[*]ml− 1), foetal bovine serum (10 %) and phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (3 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) were effective positive control secretagogues of all the cytokines, PGE 2 and MMP- 1, respectively, from these cells. It is concluded that the CEPI cells express H 1 -histamine receptors which are positively coupled to PI turnover and [Ca 2 +]i mobilization which may be directly or indirectly responsible for the release of various cytokines from these cells at physiologically and/or pathologically relevant concentrations...|$|E
