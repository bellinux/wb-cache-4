25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels, , , , depict Jesus as {{presiding over}} the Last Supper. The versions in Matthew and Mark are almost identical; but Luke's Gospel presents a textual problem in that a few manuscripts omit {{the second half of}} verse 19 and all of v.20 ("given for you … poured out for you"), which are found {{in the vast majority of}} ancient witnesses to the text. If the shorter text is the original one, then Luke's account is independent of both that of Paul and that of Matthew/Mark. If the majority longer text comes from the author of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>gospel</b> then his version is very similar to that of Paul in 1 Corinthians, being somewhat fuller in its description of the early part of the Supper, particularly in making specific mention of a cup being blessed before the bread was broken.|$|E
2500|$|A {{full page}} {{miniature}} on folio 125r prior to Luke contains twelve narrative {{scenes from the}} Life of Christ, all from the Passion except the Raising of Lazarus. [...] This was included because, following John 11.46 ff. it was considered the immediate cause of the Sanhedrin's decision to move against Christ. [...] As in the few other surviving cycles of the Life from the 6th century, the Crucifixion itself is not shown, the sequence ending with Christ carrying the Cross. [...] However at least two further such pages once existed, {{at the start of}} other Gospels. [...] Luke is <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>gospel,</b> so a panel preceding the Gospel of John might well have completed the Passion and Resurrection story, and two others covered the earlier life of Christ. [...] The scenes around Luke's portrait notably avoid the major episodes in Christ's life such as his Nativity, Baptism and Temptation, probably reserving these scenes for other grid pages.|$|E
6000|$|This is {{a curious}} [...] "practical {{surrender}} of the adverse case." [...] M. Renan thinks {{that there is no}} doubt that the author of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>Gospel</b> is the author of the Acts--a conclusion in which I suppose critics generally agree. He goes on to remark that this person seems to be a companion of St. Paul, and adds that Luke was a companion of St. Paul. Then, somewhat needlessly, M. Renan points out that there is more than one objection to jumping, from such data as these, to {491} the conclusion that [...] "Luke" [...] is the writer of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>Gospel.</b> And, finally, M. Renan is content to reduce that which is [...] "beyond doubt" [...] to the fact that the author of the two books is a man of the second apostolic generation. Well, it seems to me that I could agree with all that M. Renan considers [...] "beyond doubt" [...] here, without surrendering anything, either [...] "practically" [...] or theoretically.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the first}} gospel, the event which {{immediately}} precedes the Gadarene affair is, as before, the storm; {{the message from}} the ruler and the healing of the issue are separated from it by the accounts of the healing of a paralytic, of the calling of Matthew, and of a discussion with some Pharisees.

6000|$|The {{author of}} this Gospel [Luke] is {{certainly}} the same as [...] {{the author of the}} Acts of the Apostles.

60|$|So, when Dr. Wace {{says that}} he {{believes}} in the synoptic evangelists' account of the miraculous bedevilment of swine, I may fairly ask which of them does he believe? Does he hold by the one evangelist's story, or by that of the two evangelists? And having made his election, what reasons has he to give for his choice? If {{it is suggested that}} the witness of two is to be taken against that of one, not only is the testimony dealt with in that commonsense fashion against which the theologians of his school protest so warmly; not only is all question of inspiration at an end, but the further inquiry arises, After all, is it the testimony of two against one? Are the authors of the versions in the second and <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>gospels</b> really independent witnesses? In order to answer this question, it is only needful to place the English versions of the two side by side, and compare them carefully. It will then be seen that the coincidences between them, not merely in substance, but in arrangement, and in the use of identical words in the same order, are such, that only two alternatives are conceivable: either one evangelist freely copied from the other, or both based themselves upon a common source, which may either have been a written {447} document, or a definite oral tradition learned by heart. Assuredly, these two testimonies are not those of independent witnesses. Further, when the narrative in the first gospel is compared with that in the other two, the same fact comes out.|$|R

6000|$|And {{still more}} weighty {{is the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>gospel,</b> the author of which tells us that he wrote after [...] "many" [...] others had [...] "taken in hand" [...] the same enterprise; who should {{therefore}} have known the first gospel (if it existed), and was bound to pay to it the deference due to the work of an apostolic eye-witness (if he had any reason for thinking it was so)--this writer, who exhibits far more literary competence than the other two, ignores any [...] "Sermon on the Mount," [...] such as that reported by [...] "Matthew," [...] just as much as the oldest authority does.

6000|$|Of the Gadarene story, Dr. Wace, {{with all}} solemnity and twice over, affirms that he [...] "believes it." [...] I {{am sorry to}} trouble him further, but what does he mean by [...] "it"?

[...] In the former, which I quoted in my {{previous}} paper, there is one possessed man; in the latter there are two.

The immediately consequent events are the message from the ruler of the synagogue and the healing of the woman with an issue of blood. In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>gospel,</b> the order of events is exactly the same, and there is an extremely close general and verbal correspondence between the narratives of the miracle.

And it must be remembered that the New Testament books are not responsible for the doctrine invented by the Churches that they are anything but ordinary historical documents. The author of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>gospel</b> tells us, as straightforwardly as a man can, that he has no claim to any other character than that of an ordinary compiler and editor, who had before him the works of many and variously qualified predecessors.|$|E

6000|$|Yet another [...] "point" [...] {{does not}} seem to have {{occurred}} to Mr. Gladstone, who is so much shocked that I attach no overwhelming weight to the assertions contained in the synoptic Gospels, even when all three concur. These Gospels agree in stating, in the most express, and to some extent verbally identical, terms, that the devils entered the pigs at their own request,[112] and <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>Gospel</b> (viii. 31) tells us what the motive of the demons was in asking the singular boon: [...] "They intreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss." [...] From this, it would seem that the devils thought to exchange the heavy punishment of transportation to the abyss for the lighter penalty of imprisonment in swine. And some commentators, more ingenious than respectful to the supposed chief actor in this extraordinary fable, have dwelt, with satisfaction, upon the very unpleasant quarter of an hour which the evil spirits must have had, when the headlong rush of their maddened tenements convinced them how completely they were taken in. In the whole story, there is not one solitary hint that the destruction of the pigs was intended as a punishment of their owners, or of the swineherds. On the contrary, the concurrent testimony of the three narratives is to the effect that the catastrophe was the consequence of diabolic suggestion. And, indeed, no source could be more appropriate for an act of such manifest injustice and illegality.|$|E

The question, as Dr. Wace puts it, is [...] "It may be asked how far can we rely on the accounts we possess of our Lord's teaching on these subjects." [...] It will be obvious that M.

He does not believe that Matthew, the apostle, wrote the first Gospel; he does not profess to know who is responsible for the collection of [...] "logia," [...] or how many of them are authentic; though he calls the second Gospel the most historical, he points out that it is written with credulity, and may have been interpolated and retouched; and as to the author, [...] "quid qu'il soit," [...] of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>Gospel,</b> who is to [...] "rely on the accounts" [...] of a writer, who deserves the cavalier treatment which [...] "Luke" [...] meets with at M.

6000|$|If {{this course}} had been taken, Dr. Wace {{might have found}} some as decided {{expressions}} of opinion in favour of Luke's authorship of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>Gospel</b> as he has discovered in The Apostles.
