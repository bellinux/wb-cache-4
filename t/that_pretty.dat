500|$|... "Summer Love" [...] is an uptempo pop song, with {{a length}} of four minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to digital sheet music published at Musinotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "Summer Love" [...] {{was written in the}} key of D minor, in common time with a moderately slow 96 beat-per-minute tempo. Timberlake's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of A5. Its instrumentation consists of keyboards, drums, guitar, piano and handclaps. [...] Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine praised the song and commented that [...] "with its good foot hesitation boom-clap and cascading chorus synthline" [...] 'Summer Love' shows Timberlake's best vocals on FutureSex/LoveSounds." [...] Schwartz further stated that [...] "the beat drops out while he sings in perfect harmony, 'Tell me how they got <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> little face on <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> little frame girl'".

500|$|Sean Elliot, {{the senior}} editor of iF Magazine, gave the episode an [...] "A-" [...] and said about the change of Shocker's secret identity, [...] "saves the writers from having {{to come up with}} a {{completely}} different origin for a character <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> much is a second tier villain anyways. [...] " [...] Elliot wrote that having Norman making a deal to produce new supervillains was [...] "an extremely useful" [...] convention that allows the introduction and creation of enemies for Spider-Man to fight.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Bad Day" [...] {{were said to}} have a {{universal}} appeal by Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine as they have an [...] "everyman breeziness" [...] because the song's subject can be any person going through a bad daytime. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as: [...] "a loping, sunny tune <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> much has the opposite sentiment of its title". Although About.com's Bill Lamb described its lyrics as having a [...] "reassuring, comforting" [...] tone, Powter said the song [...] "mak fun of self-absorbed and narcissistic people who bitch and gripe". He also affirmed: [...] "It's not literally about having a bad day, it's more about not taking yourself too seriously and complaining about trivial things".|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Wayne Thomas, in Intrinsic Motivation at Work, {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to Erhard and the est philosophy; Steve Jackson, writing in Westword, similarly included it among [...] "books sympathetic to Erhard, est and Landmark", written by an [...] "old friend of Erhard's". Stephen Goldstein, in a Washington Post review, said Bartley had made it [...] "obvious {{from the start that}} he cares about his subject and his own est experience" [...] and had told [...] "a rather simple, straightforward story <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> much lets you draw your own conclusions [...] or keep the ones you have already reached." [...] A reviewer in [...] stated he was [...] "enthusiastic about this book", praising the [...] "personal quality [...] the narrative, which, though, sometimes becomes overly detailed."

500|$|Josh Harrison of Ology {{deemed the}} episode a [...] "good sign" [...] {{that the second}} season will be [...] "just as good, if not better" [...] than the first season. He said, [...] "The way it all works {{together}} in this episode ... is subtle and surprising but nevertheless convincing evidence that there's method to the madness. Ugly Americans knows when to play this card; at all other junctures, it's got the right instinct when it shows us yet more madness." [...] Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons, calling it [...] "one of the best single sequences in the series so far". In contrast, The Standard-Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode, noting that it [...] "tries a tad too hard". McDonough commented: [...] "The efforts to meld 1980s summer-camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing. Then again, <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> much sums up Ugly Americans itself." ...|$|E
500|$|A murderous and psychopathic {{criminal}} mastermind who portrays {{himself as}} an [...] "agent of chaos" [...] and rises to power by terrorizing Gotham and plunging it into anarchy. Before Ledger was confirmed for the role in July 2006, Paul Bettany, Lachy Hulme, Adrien Brody, Steve Carell, and Robin Williams publicly expressed interest in it. However, Nolan had {{wanted to work with}} Ledger on a number of projects in the past (including unsuccessfully approaching Ledger for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger's chaotic interpretation of the character. When Ledger saw Batman Begins, he had realized a way to make the character work that was consistent with the film's tone: he described his Joker as a [...] "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy." [...] In the film, the Joker has a Glasgow smile, and his trademark chalk-white skin and red lips are makeup rather than the result of chemical bleaching, as in the traditional portrayal of the character. Throughout the film, the Joker states his desire to upset social order through crime, and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role, Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month, formulating the character's posture, voice, and personality, and kept a diary, in which he recorded the Joker's thoughts and feelings. While he initially found it difficult, Ledger eventually generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholson's character in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. He was also given [...] and , which he [...] "really tried to read and put it down." [...] Ledger also cited A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious as [...] "a very early starting point for Christian [...] and I. But we kind of flew far away from <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> quickly and into another world altogether." [...] "There's a bit of everything in him. There's nothing that consistent," [...] Ledger said, and added, [...] "There are a few more surprises to him." [...] Ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall). On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. [...] "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day ," [...] Nolan recalled. [...] "But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish." [...] All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no [...] "digital effects" [...] to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory.|$|E

2500|$|According to a BBC Arts article, Kathak {{is unique}} in being practiced by the Muslim {{community}} of the India, and thus has a [...] "historical link to Islam <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> much officially forbids dance and music". Farah Yasmeen Shaikh, a Muslim and a disciple of Pandit Chitresh Das in the Lucknow school, considers Kathak as a [...] "confluence of Hindu and Muslim cultures", and has presented her performance in Pakistan. In contrast, states BBC, [...] "Nahid Siddiqui, settled and nurtured in the UK, {{has a hard time}} practising and presenting her [...] art in her birth-country of Pakistan".|$|E
2500|$|DeRogatis {{compared}} the album's repeated listening value to a heightened psychedelic awareness, that its melodies [...] "continue to reveal themselves after dozens of listens, just as previously unnoticed {{corners of the}} world reveal themselves during the psychedelic experience". On the subject of psychedelic records in the 1960s, Sean Lennon stated that [...] "psychedelic music is a term <b>that</b> <b>pretty</b> much refers to these sort of epic, ambitious long-form records... the reason Pet Sounds is considered a psychedelic journey or whatever is because it's like opening a door and stepping through and entering another world and you're in that other world {{for a period of time}} and then you come back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pixies {{agreed to}} a United States {{distribution}} deal with Elektra Records before releasing their third album, Doolittle. Doolittle was the most successful album for Pixies, earning them a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America in 1995 (along with Surfer Rosa in 2005). Following a hiatus in 1989, the band reconvened to release Bossanova in 1990 and Trompe le Monde in 1991, before breaking up in 1993. After reuniting in 2004, Black Francis, Joey Santiago, Kim Deal and David Lovering issued a download-only single, [...] "Bam Thwok," [...] and Warren Zevon cover, [...] "Ain't <b>That</b> <b>Pretty</b> At All", as well as collaborating with Disc Live to release a number of reunion tour live albums in the same year.|$|E
