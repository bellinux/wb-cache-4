50|$|Integration with a <b>transcoder</b> {{without using}} MM11 is {{possible}} by implementing the <b>transcoder</b> {{as a proxy}} server. By placing the <b>transcoder</b> on the MM1 interface between the user equipment and the MMSC, messages can be transparently transcoded. A possible disadvantage of this implementation is that transcoders are typically licensed in transactions per second. All transactions will be sent through the <b>transcoder,</b> rather than just those marked to allow adaptations.|$|E
50|$|In a {{telecommunication}} network <b>Transcoder</b> free operation, or TrFO, {{also known as}} Out of band <b>transcoder</b> control {{is the concept of}} removing transcoding function in a call path. In legacy GSM networks a call between two mobile stations involved two transcoding functions, one at each BSC. This transcoding functionality was generally implemented in a separate <b>Transcoder</b> and Rate Adaptation Unit, or TRAU. TRAU was connected to BSC and MSC through TDM E1 or STM-1.|$|E
50|$|The codec {{operates}} on 160 sample frames that span 20 ms, {{so this is}} the minimum <b>transcoder</b> delay possible even with infinitely fast CPUs and zero network latency. The operational requirement is that the <b>transcoder</b> delay should be less than 30 ms. The <b>transcoder</b> delay is defined as the time interval between the instant a speech frame of 160 samples has been received at the encoder input and the instant the corresponding 160 reconstructed speech samples have been out-put by the speech decoder at an 8 kHz sample rate.|$|E

50|$|Creating (typically 2-channel) UHJ {{recordings}} is {{a simple}} matter of passing B-Format signals through a UHJ encoder and recording the result. These might be derived from soundfield microphone recordings or from mixdown. In addition, mixes can be created directly in UHJ by using a UHJ <b>Transcoder,</b> such as that offered by Audio & Design Recordings in the 1980s, along with other Ambisonic mixing hardware (see Ambisonic mixing: Legacy hardware). The <b>Transcoder</b> both encoded B-Format into 2-channel UHJ and in addition allowed a stereo front stage and a stereo rear stage (both with adjustable widths) to be transcoded direct to 2-channel UHJ, while other units facilitated the production of B-Format mixes that could be encoded into UHJ with the <b>Transcoder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A CSD call {{functions}} {{in a very}} similar way to a normal voice call in a GSM network. A single dedicated radio time slot is allocated between the phone and the base station. A dedicated [...] "sub-time slot" [...] (16 kbit/s) is allocated from the base station to the <b>transcoder,</b> and finally, another time slot (64 kbit/s) is allocated from the <b>transcoder</b> to the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC).|$|E

50|$|In {{traditional}} GSM networks, a call {{between two}} Mobile Stations (MS) involve a dual encoding/decoding process. Speech signals are first encoded in the originating MS, converted to G.711 {{in the local}} <b>transcoder,</b> converted back to a GSM codec in the remote <b>transcoder</b> and finally converted back to speech at the terminating MS. In this configuration the two transcoders are operating in tandem introducing a voice quality degradation. It is possible to eliminate this problem by removing the two transcoding operations in the voice path if the two MS are using the same codec.|$|E
