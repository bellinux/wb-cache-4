International Fight Week {{is expected to be}} an annual July occurrence, coinciding with a Las Vegas UFC event. UFC President Dana White stated, [...] "The first annual International Fight Week will be awesome, the fans {{are going to have a}} fight week experience better than anything they've ever had before, and each year we are going to build <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> the point where every fan on the planet knows they have to come to Vegas for this July fight week at least once in their lives."

500|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{much of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. Their addictions had begun to affect their performances and matters seemed to only be getting worse, according to many involved. The clinic was deemed a [...] "joke" [...] and a [...] "nuthouse" [...] by Payne and Red Dog, and was later described {{as more of a}} psychiatric ward, as true rehabilitation clinics were several years away. All involved (including Duane) struggled to keep off the substance in the ensuing days. Despite this, Duane fueled the band's passion to get better and end their addictions: [...] "Duane was so happy and full of positive energy. He was always like that unless he was just totally wasted. He was the leader, the great soul, and he kept saying, 'We are on a mission and it's time for <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> happen,'" [...] said Linda Oakley. [...] "He was moving forward, and that energized everyone else. Everyone fed off of that." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was trying to preserve the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when listened with a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, so it was really difficult for me to figure out globally how real, how dry, how punchy can we get <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan to change anything, unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's {{competitive}} play mode was released, Kotakus Nathan Grayson stated that [...] "Overwatchs competitive mode [...] all that bad, for how new and unpolished it is," [...] but opined that [...] "high-stakes competition and toxicity {{tend to go}} hand-in-hand, and Overwatchs competitive mode already has an ugly toxic stain." [...] Grayson concluded his piece with [...] "Overwatch is, most of the time, a feel-good team game. Introducing high-stakes competition with a muddled message {{about the importance of}} individual skill drags the game into confused, oftentimes negative territory. If Blizzard wants <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> work, they're gonna have to figure out a competitive framework that's true to Overwatchs spirit, rather than just the spirit of competition." [...] Kaplan acknowledged that with the introduction of competitive mode that the whole of the Overwatch community has become more toxic, and they are constantly adapting elements behind the scenes to help deal with aggressive players in a more responsive manner, while trying to promote more enjoyable matches.|$|E
