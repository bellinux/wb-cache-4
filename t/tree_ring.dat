5|$|Hawley's {{first period}} (945–1030) was {{suggested}} by <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> dates scattered throughout later parts of Chetro Ketl. Archeologists subsequently discovered that her second period (1030–90) structure was built directly over an earlier (990–1030) one-story-tall, two-room-wide row of rooms. Lekson shortened Hawley's second period to 1030–75, and subdivided it into {{at least eight}} different construction events, including the successive additions of upper stories along the main room block, running {{the length of the}} building. After 1075, construction consisted of minor additions and alternations, {{with the exception of a}} row of three large, Chaco-style second- and third-story round rooms that were added to the plaza-facing center of the main room block during 1075–95. Much of the later construction, including the large Chaco-style kivas, was in McElmo style masonry, using shaped blocks of relatively soft tan colored sandstone instead of the previously preferred harder, denser dark brown sandstone, which may have been quarried out in the central canyon after 1075. Chetro Ketl required an estimated 50 million sandstone blocks and more than 500,000 man-hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old.

Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>rings</b> can be {{reliable}} recorders of past weather and climate variations. <b>Tree</b> <b>rings</b> from mountain regions {{can be linked}} to upper air atmospheric sounding observations and large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. A "synoptic dendroclimatology" approach is used to define the relationship between <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> and a specific upper air anomaly feature that affects climate in the western US. I have also reconstructed this anomaly feature using both regression and fuzzy logic approaches. Correlation analysis between 500 mb geopotential heights and <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> at a site near Eagle, Colorado reveals an important anomaly centered over the western US. This center {{can be viewed as a}} circulation anomaly center index (CACI) that can quantitatively represent the relationship between atmospheric circulation and tree growth variations. To reconstruct this index from <b>tree</b> <b>rings,</b> I used both a multiple linear regression (MLR) and a fuzzy-rule-based (FRB) model. The fuzzy-rule-based model provides a simple structural approach to capture nonlinear relationships between <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> and circulation. The reconstructing capability of both models is validated directly from an independent data set. Results show that the fuzzy-rule-based model performs better in terms of calibration and verification statistics than the multiple linear regression model.

25|$|The carbon-bonded {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} of cellulose, as inherited from leaf water, {{has the potential}} of preserving the original meteoric water signal. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s. In a systematic survey across North America, tree cellulose δD was found to have a temperature sensitivity of 5.8‰/°C, similar to precipitation δD sensitivity of 5.6‰/°C. This spatial correlation may be complicated by local effects of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration, and the spatial gradient may not be representative of temporal changes in <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> cellulose at a single place. The mechanism that generates the δD signal in cellulose from meteoric water is not completely understood, but at least includes leaf water transpiration, synthesis of carbohydrates, synthesis of cellulose from photosynthetic sugars, and exchange of sugars with xylem water. Modeling studies show that observed <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> cellulose δD can be produced when 36% of the hydrogen in sugars can exchange with xylem water, and effects such as humidity and rainfall seasonality may complicate the cellulose δD proxy. Despite these complications, <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> δD have been used for paleoclimate reconstructions of the past few millennia. For example, a <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> cellulose δD records from pine trees in the White Mountains, California shows a 50‰ depletion from 6800 year ago to present. The cooling trend since the mid-Holocene thermal maximum is consistent with ice core and pollen records, but the corresponding magnitude of cooling is elusive due to complicated influences from local effects such as humidity and soil water composition. The meaning of isotopes in cellulose and its applications is still an area of active study.|$|E
25|$|Dendroclimatology is the {{analysis}} of <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> growth patterns to determine past climate variations. Wide and thick rings indicate a fertile, well-watered growing period, while thin, narrow rings indicate a period of lower rainfall and less-than-ideal growing conditions.|$|E

Because the <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> record in Reelfoot Lake and the St. Francis sunk lands extend back to AD 1682 and AD 1321, respectively, Van Arsdale et al. interpreted the lack of similar signals elsewhere in the chronology as evidence against large New Madrid earthquakes between those years and 1811.|$|E

From the Late 1950s through the 1960s she directed a summer archaeological field schools through the University of New Mexico.

Her work on dendrochronology helped provides a baseline for southwestern chronologies and her work constituted a technical expertise which is still largely in demand. Hawley also conducted dendrochronological research in eastern North America, conducting some of the first such work in the region. She began her tree-ring research in the Midwest around the 1933 - 1934 academic year. She collected tree - ring specimens or inspected samples of archaeological wood from the University of Chicago’s excavations in southern Illinois. In 1937, she continued her Midwestern dendrochronological fieldwork and collected 1000 living-tree specimens in eight different states in an effort to identify the climate signal recorded by trees across the Midwest. In 1941, Hawley published Tree-Ring Analysis and Dating in the Mississippi Drainage where she presented the major problems she and her team faced: they were working with new species, they were working across a huge area, there was a shortage in old growth timber because of the extensive tree cutting, and the wood was not preserved well because of the damp mound sediments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>rings</b> are {{especially}} useful as climate proxies {{in that they}} can be well-dated via dendrochronology, i.e. matching of the rings from sample to sample.

Another advantage of <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> is that they are clearly demarked in annual increments, as opposed to other proxy methods such as boreholes.

40|$|Tropical <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to yield valuable ecological and climate information, on the condition that rings are annual and accurately dated. It is important to understand the factors controlling ring formation, since regional variation in these factors could cause trees in different regions to form <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> at different times. Here we use ‘bomb-peak’ radiocarbon (14 C) dating to test the periodicity of ring formation in Cedrela trees from four sites across tropical South America. We show that trees from Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela have reliably annual <b>tree</b> <b>rings,</b> while <b>trees</b> from Suriname regularly form two rings per year. This proves that while <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> of a particular species may be demonstrably annual at one site, this does not imply that rings are formed annually in other locations. We explore possible drivers of variation in ring periodicity and find that Cedrela growth rhythms are most likely caused by precipitation seasonality, with a possible degree of genetic control. Therefore, tree-ring studies undertaken at new locations in the tropics require independent validation of the annual nature of <b>tree</b> <b>rings,</b> irrespective of how the studied species behaves in other locations...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{frequent}} {{uses of the}} technique is to date organic remains from archaeological sites. Plants fix atmospheric carbon during photosynthesis, so the level of 14C in plants and animals when they die approximately equals the level of 14C in the atmosphere at that time. However, it decreases thereafter from radioactive decay, allowing the date of death or fixation to be estimated. The initial 14C level for the calculation can either be estimated, or else directly compared with known year-by-year data from tree-ring data (dendrochronology) up to 10,000 years ago (using overlapping data from live and dead trees in a given area), or else from cave deposits (speleothems), back to about 45,000 years before the present. A calculation or (more accurately) a direct comparison of carbon-14 levels in a sample, with <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> or cave-deposit carbon-14 levels of a known age, then gives the wood or animal sample age-since-formation.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years of using the technique, it was {{understood}} that it depended on the atmospheric / ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years. To verify the accuracy of the method, several artefacts that were datable by other techniques were tested; the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects. Over time, however, discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest Egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of Egyptian artefacts. Neither the pre-existing Egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate, but a third possibility was that the / ratio had changed over time. [...] The question was resolved by the study of tree rings: comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a continuous sequence of tree-ring data that spanned 8,000 years. [...] (Since that time the tree-ring data series has been extended to 13,900 years.) [...] In the 1960s, Hans Suess was able to use the tree-ring sequence to show that the dates derived from radiocarbon were consistent with the dates assigned by Egyptologists. [...] This was possible because although annual plants, such as corn, have a / ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing, trees only add material to their outermost <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> in any given year, while the inner tree rings don't get their [...] replenished and instead start losing [...] through decay. [...] Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric / ratio of the year it grew in. [...] Carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric / ratio: with a sample of known date, and a measurement of the value of N (the number of atoms of [...] remaining in the sample), the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of N0 – the number of atoms of [...] in the sample at the time the <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> was formed – and hence the / ratio in the atmosphere at that time.

[...] This {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "old wood" [...] problem. [...] One example is the Bronze Age trackway at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway. [...] Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material. [...] It is not always possible to recognize re-use. [...] Other materials can present the same problem: for example, bitumen is known to have been used by some Neolithic communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age of the context, so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken. [...] A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition.
