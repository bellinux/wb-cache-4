5|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, the ensuing {{wars of the}} Diadochi, and the {{partitioning}} of Alexander's short-lived empire, Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Kingdom of Pergamon. Important cities such as Pella, Pydna, and Amphipolis were involved in power struggles {{for control of the}} territory. New cities were founded, such as Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander (named after his wife Thessalonike of Macedon). Macedonia's decline began with the Macedonian Wars and the rise of Rome as the leading Mediterranean power. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> Macedonian War in 168BC, the Macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by Roman client states. A short-lived revival of the monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War in 150–148BC ended with the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{historians have}} grouped the Precious Blood-related churches of far western Ohio into four {{different}} generations: the first, composed primarily of small log buildings {{from the first}} years of settlement until 1865; the second, composed of moderately sized brick churches built between 1865 and 1885; the third, composed mostly of large High Gothic Revival churches with massive towers constructed from 1885 to 1905; and the fourth, composed of churches built between 1905 and 1925 {{in a wide range of}} styles. Immaculate Conception's place at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> generation is significant: its Romanesque Revival style is atypical of that period and much more common in the fourth generation that would soon arise, putting it in somewhat of a transitional place between the third and fourth generations.|$|E
