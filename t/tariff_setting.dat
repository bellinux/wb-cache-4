5000|$|LGU-operated systems In LGUs, tariff {{levels and}} {{structures}} vary widely. Since most connections are not metered, {{it is difficult}} to charge tariffs depending on consumption. Where LGUs provide Level I or II services, they usually charge no or very low tariffs, although connection fees are common. The costs of providing the service are usually met by local governments. [...] The NWRB in its benchmarking project had about half of the average tariff of private operators and water districts.The cost of tariff in LGU-operated systems is, on average, lower than other management models. In order to introduce cost recovery tariffs and effective regulation, the NWRB issued a primer on <b>tariff</b> <b>setting</b> and regulation in March 2005.

50|$|Social and {{political}} considerations often {{are also important}} in setting tariffs.

50|$|A {{number of}} issues make the energy {{generation}} of insular systems extremely expensive and less secure. First, the great dependency of insular energy systems on imported energy sources for electricity generation and their associated high transportation and shipping costs {{are reflected in the}} electricity pricing. Additionally, the small sizes of these systems limit not only the production and consumption capacities, but also the establishment and growth of significant internal markets. Also, the dominance of a sole public or private energy producer means that a single stakeholder is fully responsible for generating, transmitting and distributing electricity and in control of the associated investment decisions, programmes, and <b>tariff</b> <b>setting.</b> The reduction of GHG emissions is another great challenge for insular energy systems given that most of their electricity production is based on fossil fuels.|$|E

The local government law was a landmark in terms of decentralization in Indonesia after the fall of Suharto, making the previous rhetorical commitment to decentralization a reality by transferring all powers except certain specifically enumerated powers to local government. The fiscal balance law greatly increased the revenue base for local government. Relevant implementing regulations include Government Act No.16/2005 [...] "on the development of the water supply system", which allows private sector participation in water supply; two decrees by the Ministry of Public Works from 2006 and 2007 to establish a National Water Board; and the Ministry of Home Affairs Decree No. 23/2006 on guidelines for water <b>tariff</b> <b>setting.</b> The latter stipulates that tariffs should fully recover costs including a rate of return of 10 percent.
