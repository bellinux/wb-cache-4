Methods: This 30 -day, multicentered, open-label study enrolled 109 eligible soft contact lens wearers using COMPLETE&reg; Multi-Purpose Solution (MPS) Easy Rub&reg; or ReNu MultiPlus&reg; MPS. The <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> (OPTI-FREE&reg; RepleniSH&reg; MPDS) was dispensed {{for use in}} place of habitual care solutions.

Results: The <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> {{was associated with a}} statistically significant improvement in instillation comfort (P = 0. 02), end of day comfort (P &lt; 0. 0001), clear vision (P &lt; 0. 0001) and overall satisfaction (P &lt; 0. 001).

40|$|A rat {{develops}} {{an aversion}} to the flavor of a solution which is paired with illness. Although it is well established that the rat will avoid consuming this flavor, the actual conditioned response (CR) that it elicits has not been systematically investigated. The following series of experiments present a technique for measuring this CR. The rats were first trained to discriminate between an aversive flavored solution (CS+) which was paired with lithium and a safe flavored solution (CSc) which was presented alone. The CR was then measured by {{the ability of the}} immediate aftereffect of the CS+ flavor to suppress consumption of a differently flavored <b>solution</b> (the <b>test</b> <b>solution).</b> While the rats consumed the <b>test</b> <b>solution,</b> they were intraorally infused with 2 ml of either the CS+ or esc flavored solution; the time to resume drinking and the subsequent rate of licking of the <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> were recorded. [...] All experiments demonstrated that the rats infused with the CS+ flavored solution were more hesitant to resume drinking the <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> than were the rats infused with the esc flavored solution. This CR was evident whether the <b>test</b> <b>solution</b> was unflavored water, a novel flavored solution or a conditioned aversive flavored solution; however, the duration of the CR varied {{by the nature of the}} <b>test</b> <b>solution,</b> ranging between 45 and 235 seconds. Finally, the strength of the suppressive CR was influenced by variations of the sickness intensity and the flavor intensity during conditioning. [...] It is unlikely that the CR measured in these experiments is the sole motivator of a flavor aversion, because extinction of the suppressive CR did not even weaken the rats subsequent avoidance of the CS+ flavored solution. The suppressive CR elicited by a lithium-conditioned flavor parallels the suppressive CR elicited by a shock-conditioned external cue...|$|R
