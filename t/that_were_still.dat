5|$|A {{demonstration}} of the game was released on 26 June 2002, featuring tutorial missions and a full single-player mission. The game was released on 19 August in North America and on 30 August in Europe. The Creative Assembly released a patch on 5 November 2002, which was targeted to fix the several bugs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> present in the game. A new historical battle based on the Battle of Stamford Bridge was later released by The Creative Assembly, made available through Wargamer.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was then declared {{at this time}} for the Yasawa Group, northern Viti Levu, Vanua Levu as well as smaller islands located nearby. Later that day, as Daman reached its peak, all areas of Fiji were under a gale warning. Early on December 7 RSMC Nadi canceled some of the warnings for Fiji, including the gale force warning for southwestern Viti Levu, and then later that day downgraded all the warnings <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in effect for Fiji to gale force as Daman was weakening.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking the}} Family Portrait series of images, which {{included}} Pale Blue Dot, NASA mission managers commanded Voyager 1 to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft {{was not going}} to fly near anything else of significance for the rest of its mission, while other instruments <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.|$|E

5|$|Since {{before the}} Civil War, {{the two major}} parties were the Republicans and the Democrats, and {{after the end of the}} Reconstruction Era in 1877, the {{national}} electorate was closely divided between them. Party membership was only partly based on ideology; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background, as well as Civil War loyalties <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> keenly felt by many voters. Most Northern Protestants voted Republican, as did black Southerners. On the other hand, white Southerners and Northern Catholics generally voted Democratic.|$|E
5|$|The Barranca Blanca and Carachi Ignimbrites {{are covered}} by lavas from Volcán Carachipampa and are thus older than 0.75 mya. They contain pumices of various colours and lithic fragments, {{including}} mylonite and schist. The Barranca Blanca ignimbrite is white in colour and contains rhyodacitic white pumice with subordinate amounts of grey trachyandesitic pumice. The Carachi Ignimbrite overlies the Barranca Blanca ignimbrite. It is weakly welded and contains white pumice and crystals with fiamme. Both of these are pyroclastic density currents <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> hot {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see if we could not get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> not words—something far beyond words.|$|E

5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one side has scored more runs {{than the total}} runs scored by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> to fall.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} possibly {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over waters <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late on October 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early on October 26.|$|E
5|$|After King Francis I {{commissioned}} Jacques Cartier {{to search}} out an eastern route to Asia, the city of Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia. From there, the French Crown's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River, as well as islands in the Caribbean, and the north eastern shore of South America; the Viceroyalty of New France was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by King Louis XIV. Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties, and those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up {{defensive}} positions in the outer roadstead and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. The two shell hits suffered by Kaiser had been largely ineffectual, wounding only one crewmember.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{minutes of}} brutal, close-quarters fighting, {{the two sides}} broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26, after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of Helena and senior {{surviving}} U.S. officer) ordered their respective forces to disengage. Admiral Abe had one battleship (Kirishima), one light cruiser (Nagara), and four destroyers (Asagumo, Teruzuki, Yukikaze, and Harusame) with only light damage and four destroyers (Inazuma, Ikazuchi, Murasame, and Samidare) with moderate damage. The U.S. had only one light cruiser (Helena) and one destroyer (Fletcher) <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear to Abe, the way was now clear for him to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, thus allowing the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E

5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{regional}} seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, {{but the majority of}} records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance. Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak ground acceleration could be made.|$|E
5|$|Fighting raged {{throughout}} {{the early morning}} as 'B' Company vainly attempted to assist the cut-off 'D' Company. Varley decided to launch a counterattack with 'A' Company, but at 8:00am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters, cancelling the attack. Covered by the reserve company, 'A' and some of 'B' Company were able to break contact and fall back. 'D' Company, {{along with those of}} 'B' Company <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> isolated and in contact, had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion's lines. By the time they arrived, there were only enough men left to form one platoon. The 2/18th's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed, wounded or missing. Japanese losses are unknown, but are thought to be significant and they were unable to take Jemaluang for two more days.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{was more}} {{difficult}} in practice. The French were still a vacillating ally until the spring/summer, 1940, but the Command was still stretched by German naval forces operating from Germany, and then Norway. The Germans used surface vessels and U-boats to breakout into the Atlantic by using periods of dark, in winter, and weather conditions unfavourable to aircraft <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> without radar. Tiger Moth biplanes were used, as were civil pilots, {{to compensate for the}} lack of Hudsons. These machines were also without armament to defend from enemy fighters. It could carry 250lb DCs, but there was no sufficient stock. Only 100lb bombs could be used by the Anson, and they were ineffective. Crew were also insufficiently trained.|$|E
5|$|In early-1941 Stalin {{authorized}} the State Defense Plan 1941 (DP-41), which {{along with the}} Mobilization Plan 1941 (MP-41), called for the deployment of 186 divisions, as the first strategic echelon, in the four military districts of the western Soviet Union that faced the Axis territories; and the deployment of another 51 divisions along the Dvina and Dnieper Rivers as the second strategic echelon under Stavka control, which {{in the case of}} a German invasion was tasked to spearhead a Soviet counteroffensive along with the remaining forces of the first echelon. But on 22 June 1941 the first echelon only contained 171 divisions, numbering 2.6–2.9 million; and the second strategic echelon contained 57 divisions <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> mobilizing, most of which were still understrength. The second echelon was undetected by German intelligence until days after the invasion commenced, in most cases only when German ground forces bumped into them.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{was still}} in command of China's armed forces when Mao ordered the {{shelling}} of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu, islands {{off the coast of}} Fujian <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> held by the Kuomintang, in the late summer and autumn of 1958. Peng developed a strategy with his Chief of Staff, Su Yu, to bombard the islands so intensely that the morale of their defenders would collapse, eventually leading to the islands' surrender. After the islands' surrender, the PLA would then use the islands to launch attacks against Taiwan. The saturated shelling of the islands included over half the artillery in China, and began on August 28. The attack included a coordinated effort to cut off the islands' air and sea supply lines.|$|E
