40|$|CyberCIEGE is a resource-management {{simulation}} {{in which}} the player assumes {{the role of a}} decision maker for an IT-dependent organization. Through the use of scenarios, it is intended to support education, training and awareness in cyber security. Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) plans to use the game to help to teach Identity Management concepts. To help prepare for that, we conducted a study of barriers to engagement in CyberCIEGE by observing eight students while playing the game, analyzing game logs and holding evaluation meetings with two classes. Our study revealed several barriers to becoming engaged in the game due to weaknesses in the game's user interface, the students' limited understanding of the security context and their limited video game playing skills. These problems can be mitigated by structuring game scenarios so that students must pass the beginners' level before advancing to subsequent levels. Optimally, a skilled student should be allowed to skip the simple introductions; however, {{it is not clear that}} student skill can be reliably assessed prior to playing the scenarios. Also, the CyberCIEGE <b>Tire</b> <b>Ply</b> Scenario should be improved to provide unambiguous objectives, timely and clear feedback and more relevant real life narratives.

50|$|One {{effect of}} body (frame) lean, for typical {{suspension}} geometry, is positive camber of the wheels {{on the outside}} of the turn and negative on the inside, which reduces their cornering grip (especially with cross <b>ply</b> <b>tires).</b>|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{the fabric}} was built up {{on a flat}} steel drum, with the cords at angles of about +60 and −60 degrees from the {{direction}} of travel, so they criss-crossed over each other. They were called cross ply or bias <b>ply</b> <b>tires.</b> The <b>plies</b> were turned up around the steel wire beads and the combined tread/sidewall applied. The green (uncured) tire was loaded over a curing bladder and shaped into the mold. This shaping process caused the cords in the tire to assume an S-shape from bead to bead. The angle under the tread, the crown angle, stretched down to about 36 degrees. In the sidewall region the angle was 45 degrees, and in the bead it remained at 60 degrees. The low crown angle gave rigidity to support the tread and the high sidewall angle gave comfort. To increase strength, the manufacturer would increase the number of plies, and the heat buildup in the tire.|$|R

50|$|Bias <b>tire</b> (or cross <b>ply)</b> {{construction}} utilizes {{body ply}} cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles {{in the range}} of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased rolling resistance and less control and traction at higher speeds. This outdated technology is still made in limited quantities to supply collector vehicles. It is possible to fit older cars with modern tires if historical authenticity is not paramount.|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Master of Science thesis. January 2011. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Lev Khazanovich and Joseph F. Labuz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 199 pages. Agricultural equipment manufacturers have been producing equipment with larger capacity {{to meet the}} demands of today’s agricultural industry. This rapid shift in equipment size has raised concerns within the pavement industry, as these heavy vehicles have potential to cause significant pavement damage. At present, all implements of husbandry are exempted from axle weight and gross vehicle weight restrictions in Minnesota. However, they must comply with the 500 lb per inch of tire width restriction which may lead to very large loads as long as the tires are sufficiently wide. A full scale accelerated pavement test was conducted at the MnROAD test facility. Both flexible and rigid pavements were tested in this study. This thesis presented analysis performed on the flexible pavement sections. The flexible pavement sections consisted of a “thin section” which represented a typical 7 -ton road and a “thick section” which represented a 10 -ton road. Both sections were instrumented with strain gages, earth pressure cells, and LVDTs to measure pavement responses generated by these heavy agricultural vehicles. These response measurements were compared to responses generated by a typical 5 -axle semi truck. Additionally, tire contact area and contact stresses of these vehicles were measured. Through this research, it was determined that traffic wander, seasonal changes, time of testing, pavement structure, and gross vehicle weight have profound effects on pavement response measurements. The effect of vehicle speed and benefits of flotation <b>tires</b> over radial <b>ply</b> <b>tires</b> were not significant in this study. Additionally, all agricultural vehicles loaded above 80 % of full capacity generated higher subgrade stresses compared to the 80 -kip 5 -axle semi truck. Layered elastic programs, BISAR and MnLayer were used in the modeling analysis. The contact areas of these vehicles were approximated through multi-circular area estimation. This detailed modeling of the contact area yielded a more realistic representation of the actual vehicle footprint. DAKOTA-MnLayer optimization framework was introduced to perform backcalculation analysis to determine Young’s moduli of the pavement layers. The backcalculated Young’s moduli resulted in a close match between predicted responses and field measurements...|$|R
50|$|Fitting modern tires {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} to improve the handling. However, most modern tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on classic cars when new, therefore they may interfere with suspension elements and the tire walls may become damaged. The suspension of a classic car may not be suitable for radial ply tyres, having been designed to only accommodate bias <b>ply</b> <b>tires.</b> Narrow classic car wheels may have been designed for narrow high-profile tube tires and not be suitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering effort; many classic cars do not come with power steering. Many major tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and {{will be able to}} give expert technical advice to address all these issues. It is important to know how radial tires will affect the performance of a car originally fitted with bias-ply tires, and the considerations needed to compensate for the differences.|$|R

The Ram Air II was the first engine that incorporated Pontiac's legendary round-port head design in a production vehicle, however the intake port was the same as other D-port heads, leaving a head which exhaust port could nearly match the intake at high valve lifts. The Ram Air II also incorporated the first computer-designed camshaft. This camshaft sported a wild 308-/320-degree duration with 0.470 in lift. This same camshaft was also used in Pontiac's 1969-1970 RA IV production cars. However, the RA II was limited to a 1.50:1 rocker ratio, while the RA IV used a 1.65:1 ratio, which yielded significantly greater total lift and, therefore, superior flow and power.

50|$|Chrysler Australia {{launched}} {{the first generation}} in April/May 1979 as the MA series Chrysler D-50. Initially, two pickup versions were sold, the Commercial with the 1.6-liter Saturn (4G32) engine and the higher specification Recreational with the 2.0-liter Astron (4G52) engine. Commercials received the three-speed column-shift manual, with the floor-mounted four-speed transmission and taller axle ratio for the Recreational. Commercials were specified with heavy duty suspension rated for 1000 kg payloads; the Recreational version carries a 500 kg load. The reason for the halved payload {{was due to the}} sedan-type suspension of softer springs and more supple shock absorbers. The Recreational model also featured radial <b>ply</b> <b>tires,</b> electronic ignition, bucket seats, pile carpet, radio, floor console, sports steering wheel and an adjustable steering column as standard. An optional sports stripe package was also available. Options included a weather-tight, fibreglass canopy with foam rubber mattress. This was manufactured by Challenge Industries and incorporated sliding side windows. Later in 1979, a cab chassis body variant of the Commercial was released. In March 1980, the D-50 was renamed Chrysler L200 Express to form linkage with the newly released L300 Express vans. In October 1980, the Chrysler labelling made way for Mitsubishi badges following the establishment of Mitsubishi Motors Australia from Chrysler Australia's old operations. In June 1981, Mitsubishi released 4WD versions of the pickup and cab chassis, both with the 2.0-liter motor. Free-wheeling hubs to reduce noise and fuel use in 2WD mode were optional. In late 1981, the 2.0-liter with five-speed manual was made optional for the 2WD one-tonne suspension models.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the work of}} creating and validating a novel corner module for a three-wheeled urban electric vehicle in the tadpole configuration. As the urban population increases, {{there will be a}} growing need for compact, personal transportation. While urban electric vehicles are compact, they are inherently less stable when negotiating a turn, and they leave little space for passengers, cargo and crash structures. Corner modules provide an effective solution to increase the space in the cabin and increase the handling capabilities of the vehicle. Many corner module designs have been produced in the hopes of increasing the cabin space and improving the road holding capabilities of the wheel. However, none have been used to increase the turning stability of the vehicle via an active camber mechanism while remaining in an acceptable packaging space. Active camber mechanisms are also not a new concept, but they have not been implemented in a narrow packaging space with relatively large camber angle. Parallel mechanism research and vehicle dynamics theory were combined to generate and analyse this new corner module design. The corner module increases the stability of the urban electric vehicle by cambering the front wheels to - 15 degrees when the vehicle is turning. The camber angle augmentation increases the track width which subsequently decreases the center of gravity height. These changes accumulated to increase the stability of the vehicle. The corner module uses two actuators to control the orientation of the wheel. Bias <b>ply</b> <b>tires</b> are incorporated into the corner module to enable the large camber angles. To increase the space in the cabin, the front left and right wheels are not connected by a mechanical linkage, and the motors are mounted to the wheel rim. While disc brakes are integrated into the corner module, the motor is also capable of regenerative braking. By integrating this corner module into urban electric vehicles, the vehicle size and pollution can be reduced while increasing the cabin space and public space...|$|R
