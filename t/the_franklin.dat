5|$|Readville has {{an unusual}} layout {{because it is}} built on the {{crossing}} of two rail lines. The Fairmount Line and Franklin Line each have a single track atop an embankment. The Fairmount Line has a single side platform, while <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Line has two. The Fairmount Line track continues atop a bridge over the Northeast Corridor to join with <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Line. This connection is used by several trains each rush hour, allowing trains from <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Line to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 {{race for}} re-election, <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> County Republican party made no endorsement, but Republican Jim Timko {{challenged}} Cordray. Cordray defeated {{him and was}} elected to a four-year term by a 272,593–153,625 (64%36%) margin.|$|E

5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the Inuit near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, but none of <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> expedition survivors he believed would be found among the Inuit. Though he concluded that all of <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> crew were dead, {{he believed that the}} official expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered hundreds of pages of Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party of white men {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, Unravelling <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Mystery (1992) and Strangers Among Us (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.|$|E
5000|$|George did not {{originally}} name <b>the</b> town <b>Franklin,</b> as it {{is known}} today. He called it [...] "Georgetown", after himself, and the post office there was known by that name. The hotel he built was, however, given the name [...] "Franklin House" [...] in honor of his mother's family, <b>the</b> <b>Franklins.</b>|$|R
2500|$|North Franklin {{is located}} entirely {{within the city}} of El Paso, {{approximately}} [...] east of the Texas–New Mexico border and [...] north of the U.S.–Mexico border. [...] The mountain is the highest of <b>the</b> <b>Franklins,</b> clipping nearby Anthony's Nose by just over [...] and neighboring South Franklin by nearly [...] [...] North Franklin rises [...] above both its western base in the Mesilla Valley and its eastern base in the Hueco Bolson. [...] In spite of its name, North Franklin is actually in <b>the</b> central <b>Franklins,</b> being <b>the</b> northernmost of the range's two key peaks (South Franklin, of course, is the other). [...] To the south of these, <b>the</b> South <b>Franklins</b> include <b>the</b> peaks Mount <b>Franklin</b> and Ranger Peak (all of the television broadcast towers for El Paso are in <b>the</b> Southern <b>Franklins).</b>|$|R

5|$|After regular {{ballots were}} counted, Pryce led Kilroy by over 3,500 votes with about 19,000 {{provisional}} ballots outstanding. <b>The</b> <b>Franklin</b> county absentee and provisional ballots were not counted until approximately {{two weeks after}} the election. On Monday November 27, nearly three weeks after Election Day, Pryce was declared the winner by a 1,054 vote margin that mandated a recount. After two recounts and all of the votes were counted, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce (R) prevailed over Democratic challenger Mary Jo Kilroy. <b>The</b> <b>Franklin</b> County Board of Elections announced the results Monday morning December 11, 2006. Pryce (R) gained 25 votes and Kilroy (D) gained 18 votes in the recount of votes in Franklin, Union, and Madison Counties in Ohio. Pryce won with 50.20% of the vote by a 110,739–109,677 margin. Kilroy felt her campaign was slowed by the early candidacy of fellow Franklin County Commissioner Paula Brooks, who eventually withdrew. Immediately after losing in 2006, she announced she would recontest the seat in 2008.|$|E
5|$|After scalemaker Saxton {{left the}} Mint Service in 1844, {{much of the}} work of {{maintaining}} and modifying the sensitive balances for which Saxton was responsible fell to Peale. The Chief Coiner made a number of improvements to the scales, which he wrote up for an article in the Journal of <b>The</b> <b>Franklin</b> Institute in 1847. These balances, sensitive to , were protected by plate glass from air currents and dust.|$|E
5|$|In late May 2007, 20th Century Fox {{struck a}} deal with <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Mint to promote the movie by {{altering}} 40,000 U.S. quarters and releasing them into circulation. All of the altered quarters were minted in 2005 and honor the state of California as part of the 50 State Quarters program created by the U.S. Mint. The altered quarters feature the Silver Surfer on the reverse along with a URL to the movie's official website. Once the U.S. Mint became aware of the promotion, it notified the studio and <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Mint that it was breaking the law by turning government-issued currency into private advertising. The federal mint did not indicate whether a penalty would be effected.|$|E

50|$|Some stream {{reaches in}} the {{watershed}} of Zerbe Run are designated as impaired waterbodies, {{but others are}} not. Abandoned mine drainage {{is the source of}} impairment of impaired streams in the watershed. The stream's watershed has four abandoned mine drainage sites: <b>the</b> North <b>Franklin</b> Mine drift and Borehole, <b>the</b> North <b>Franklin</b> Mine seepage, <b>the</b> North <b>Franklin</b> Mine bank seepage, and <b>the</b> North <b>Franklin</b> Mine Sunshine Mine overflow. Passive treatment wetlands may be suitable for treating <b>the</b> North <b>Franklin</b> Mine drift and Borehole discharge. There are also large silt piles along the stream near Trevorton. The effect that the abandoned mine drainage discharges have on the water quality of the stream depends on how much unimpacted water is flowing from the stream's upper reaches.|$|R
5|$|NY458 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY11B in Hopkinton {{at the western}} fringe of the Lawrence hamlet of Nicholville. The route heads southeast, loosely paralleling the St. Regis River as it proceeds through rural eastern St. Lawrence County.

There are currently six different school districts with students attending FCCTC: Chambersburg, Fannett-Metal, Greencastle-Antrim, Shippensburg, Tuscarora, and Waynesboro.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Bell {{appeared}} on a commemorative coin in 1926 to mark the sesquicentennial of American independence.

5|$|These Precambrian igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks underlie {{most of the}} state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Mountains, near El Paso. Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{received}} many awards and honors, including the Elliott Cresson Medal from <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Institute in 1964, the National Medal of Science in 1973, and the Department of Energy's Enrico Fermi Award in 1984. He {{was elected to}} the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and was president of the American Physical Society in 1985.|$|E
5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some have argued that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Franklins started {{setting up}} {{franchise}} opportunities under the [...] "Franklins Family Supermarkets" [...] brand (similar to the [...] "Pick 'n Pay Family Supermarkets" [...] brand). By that time, there were 80 Franklins supermarkets across New South Wales. <b>The</b> only <b>Franklins</b> store to open that {{year was the}} one in Newcastle. <b>The</b> <b>Franklins</b> store in Erina Fair on the Central Coast was also closed, soon replaced by Aldi.|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1998, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) SIGCHI awarded Engelbart the CHI Lifetime Achievement Award. ACM SIGCHI later {{inducted}} Engelbart {{into the}} CHI Academy in 2002. Engelbart was awarded <b>The</b> <b>Franklin</b> Institute's Certificate of Merit in 1996 and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1999 in Computer and Cognitive Science. In early 2000 Engelbart produced, with volunteers and sponsors, {{what was called}} The Unfinished Revolution– II, {{also known as the}} Engelbart Colloquium at Stanford University, to document and publicize his work and ideas to a larger audience (live, and online).|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{enjoyed a}} series of prestigious fellowships after graduation. He was awarded a National Research Council, and then a Bartol Research Foundation fellowship. At the time <b>the</b> <b>Franklin</b> Institute's Bartol Research Foundation was located on the Swarthmore College campus in Pennsylvania, and was {{directed}} by W. F. G. Swann, an English physicist {{with an interest in}} nuclear physics. Bainbridge married Margaret ("Peg") Pitkin, a member of the Swarthmore teaching faculty, in September 1931. They had a son, Martin Keeler, and two daughters, Joan and Margaret Tomkins.|$|E
