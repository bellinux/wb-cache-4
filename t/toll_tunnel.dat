5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to bypass the Antelope Valley Freeway by boring a tunnel under the San Gabriel Mountains and extending the Glendale Freeway through it to the Antelope Valley. In 2003, Caltrans published a map showing potential improvements to the transportation infrastructure of southern California. The proposal showed both the unconstructed portion of Route 14 and new routes over or under the mountains to Antelope Valley. In 2005, the idea was advanced as a combination <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel</b> and surface highway. Preliminary studies estimated costs around $3 billion and suggested charging a varying toll, adjusted for the time of day, averaging around $8 for one-way passage.|$|E

50|$|The M7 Clem Jones Tunnel, a <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel,</b> {{which opened}} in March 2010, has a {{connection}} on Shafston Avenue. It diverts some traffic travelling through the suburb while providing an additional transport route for residents.|$|E
50|$|It was {{converted}} to auto traffic in 1922 as the Carlton Tunnel, a <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel</b> carrying then-State Highway 104, closing in 1942 {{when the state}} discontinued maintenance of the road. The tunnel collapsed in 1945.|$|E
50|$|The Karisaka Tunnel is a Japanese <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{that opened}} April 23, 1998 between Chichibu, Saitama Prefecture and Yamanashi City, Yamanashi Prefecture. Until this tunnel opened, {{there was no}} direct road {{connection}} between Saitama and Yamanashi prefectures.|$|E
5000|$|The {{strategic}} objectives that the scheme was originally conceived to address {{have never been}} made public. The initial application for federal funding was made under the 'National Freight Network' category, and the new tunnels converge near Sydney's main container port (Port Botany) and airport. This suggests the primary objective was to improve road freight productivity. However, smaller truck-only <b>toll</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{would not have been}} financially viable. Therefore, general use <b>toll</b> <b>tunnels</b> were proposed instead, to generate toll revenue from passenger vehicles as well. This approach has been described as [...] "suburban motorists ... paying for an inner-city freight project".|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of a <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel</b> to avoid the mountain pass started in 1999 and opened to traffic in 2002. The tunnel is located {{at an altitude of}} about 2000 meters and is nearly 3 kilometers long.|$|E
50|$|The Tunnel is {{operated}} by Globalvia (a {{joint venture between}} Spanish companies Caja Madrid and FCC) as a <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The concession period is for 50 years. The construction cost was 11 Bn Pesetas (approx. 80 Million Euros).|$|E

In Indonesia, all toll roads are built by private companies, and private toll roads are being built in Bangladesh.|$|R
50|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has three}} toll roads, three toll bridges, and two <b>toll</b> <b>tunnels,</b> which are {{operated}} by various independent operators. Most were built under a public-private partnership system, giving the company which {{arranged for the}} road to be built the right to collect tolls for a defined period. Tolls vary from €1.65 to €12 for cars.|$|R
50|$|Under British law, {{regardless}} of {{whether there is a}} footpath, pedestrians have the right to use most public roads, excluding motorways and some <b>toll</b> <b>tunnels</b> and bridges such as the Blackwall Tunnel and the Dartford Crossing. The UK Highway Code advises that pedestrians should walk in the opposite direction to oncoming traffic on a road with no footpath. However sharing roads with fast-moving traffic is highly dangerous.|$|R

50|$|In February 2007 it was {{announced}} by the Queensland Government that the road was to receive a major upgrade and that traffic rates were estimated at 67,000 vehicles a day. Traffic volumes on the road are increasing. This {{has led to a}} drop in the average speed on the road from 45 km per hour in 2008 to 36 km per hour in 2009. The Airport Link <b>tolled</b> <b>tunnel</b> project is expected to reduce traffic volumes by 12%.|$|R
50|$|In April 2006, Zeelandic Flanders {{citizens}} {{in cooperation with}} the Socialist Party of Terneuzen established the Lawsuit Committee <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Toll</b> Free (Actiecomité TunnelTolvrij.nl). The purpose of this lawsuit is first to oppose the sale of the tunnel and secondly to make the <b>tunnel</b> <b>toll</b> free.|$|R
50|$|After the {{completion}} of the consequential surface road changes in March 2008, the existing Epping Road was slated to have 24-hour bus lanes to reduce travel times for east and west bound bus services, a new bus interchange, a shared cyclist and pedestrian path, and other measures were implemented to improve public transport and local traffic in the corridor. Changes to the road network in the area had the primary aim of encourage traffic to use the new <b>tolled</b> <b>tunnel</b> instead of the untolled surface road.|$|R
50|$|The Huguenot Tunnel is a <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel</b> near Cape Town, South Africa. It {{extends the}} N1 {{national}} road through the Du Toitskloof mountains that separate Paarl from Worcester, providing a route that is safer, faster (between 15 and 26 minutes) and shorter (by 11 km) {{than the old}} Du Toitskloof Pass travelling over the mountain.|$|E
5000|$|The Liefkenshoektunnel is a <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel</b> between Antwerp and Beveren {{under the}} River Schelde. The tunnel is a {{continuation}} of Highway R2, the ring motorway surrounding the city and harbour of Antwerp. In 2010 the tunnel was used by 6,373,894 vehicles. Positioned between the Beverentunnel and the Tijsmanstunnel, the Liefkenshoektunnel is the second of three sequential road tunnels running under the river and port installations.|$|E
50|$|Sóller {{is linked}} by the {{historic}} railway, the Ferrocarril de Sóller, {{and by a}} highway with a <b>toll</b> <b>tunnel,</b> to the Majorcan capital of Palma. The Ferrocaril {{was built on the}} profits from the orange and lemon trade and completed in 1911. The Andratx-Pollença highway also runs through the valley. The present-day economy is based mainly on tourism and the expenditure of foreign residents, complementary to the agricultural economy based around citrus and olive groves.|$|E
50|$|The Tyne Tunnel is {{the name}} given to two 2-lane {{vehicular}} <b>toll</b> <b>tunnels</b> under the River Tyne in North East England. Completed in 1967 and 2011 respectively, they connect the town of Jarrow on the south {{bank of the river}} with North Shields and Howdon on the northern end. The original tunnel was one of three forming the original Tyne Tunnel Project; the others are the pedestrian and cyclist tunnels opened in 1951. The tunnels are 11 km downstream and to the east of Newcastle upon Tyne and form part of the A19 road.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to toll roads, toll bridges and <b>toll</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{are also used}} by public authorities to generate funds to repay {{the cost of building}} the structures. Some tolls are set aside to pay for future maintenance or enhancement of infrastructure, or are applied as a general fund by local governments, not being earmarked for transport facilities. This is sometimes limited or prohibited by central government legislation. Also road congestion pricing schemes have been implemented in a limited number of urban areas as a transportation demand management tool to try to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.|$|R
