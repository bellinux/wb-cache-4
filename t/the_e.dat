5|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>E</b> Company platoon joined Vandygriff, the North Koreans {{attacked}} again. <b>The</b> <b>E</b> Company infantrymen {{had brought}} no mortars with them-only small arms.

By now Vandygriff's troops were nearly out of ammunition. He then instructed his men to gather up all the weapons and ammunition from North Korean dead they could reach, and in this manner they obtained for emergency use about 30 to 40 rifles, 5 PPSh-41 guns, and some hand grenades.|$|E

5|$|There are two diamond {{switches}} {{near the}} western end of this station, located between the local and express tracks in each direction. This switch is used in revenue service.

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>Es</b> layer {{instability}} {{has been}} suggested as {{a participant in the}} creation of frontal structures observed in both <b>the</b> <b>Es</b> and F layers of the nighttime midlatitude iono-sphere, {{in spite of the fact}} that the spatial scales of the frontal structures are very different in the two layers. The linear growth rate of the instability has a maxima in the vicin-ity of the wavelength observed for <b>the</b> <b>Es</b> layer structures (short wavelengths). However, the maxima is non-distinct, and simulations have shown that the instability is extremely nonlinear. Therefore, to understand the wavelength depen-dence of <b>the</b> <b>Es</b> layer instability it is necessary to factor in nonlinear behavior. Simulations have shown that the insta-bility is active at the wavelengths observed in the F layer, and revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Es</b> layer behavior at these long wave-lengths is so nonlinear that the common, highly localized Es layer observation techniques would likely miss the signature, which is highly visible in the F layer. However, there is cur-rently no explanation for why long wavelengths so clearly dominate short (or intermediate) wavelengths in the F layer observations, and this is a weakness in arguments that <b>the</b> <b>Es</b> layer instability participates in the creation of F-region frontal structures. Herein we remove this weakness by show-ing that longer wavelengths grow to larger amplitudes before eventual nonlinear saturation, and couple more effectively to the F-region...|$|R
