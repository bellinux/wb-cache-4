The measurements were carried out in the Zone of Established Flow up to 50 propeller diameters downstream of the propeller.

40|$|Two-stroke {{outboard}} boat engines using <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>lubrication</b> deposit {{a significant}} proportion of their lubricant and fuel directly into the water environment. Extensive atmospheric emission testing of outboard motors has taken place, however, emissions to the water are largely unaddressed in the literature and could be critical because the exhaust of most outboard engines is released below the water and mixed by the action of the propeller. The purpose of this work is to document the velocity and scalar field characteristics of a submerged swirling jet emanating from a propeller. The aim is to provide guidance on fundamental characteristics of such a jet, far enough downstream that it is relevant to the eventual modelling of this mixing problem (i. e. the mixing of engine emissions with water). Measurements of the velocity field (axial, tangential, and radial) and scalar field (concentration) were performed in a turbulent jet generated by a model boat propeller (0. 02 m diameter) operating in a weak co-flow of 0. 04 ms- 1. The measurements were carried out up to 50 propeller diameters downstream of the source which was placed in a glass-walled flume, 0. 4 m wide with a free surface depth of 0. 15 m. The jet and scalar plume development were compared to that of a classical free round jet. Further, results with respect to velocity distribution, turbulence decay and integral flow properties plus scalar distribution, dilution and integral plume properties were all calculated and compared to existing literature. The velocity field results are the first published results to show the development of the flow fifty propeller diameters downstream. Up to ten propeller diameters downstream the results corroborate the earlier work of Petersson [1, 2]. Beyond ten propeller diameters downstream, the walls of the flume affected the flow. The concentration field results show that under these experimental conditions the propeller induced mixing exhibited a complete mixing length some 300 times shorter than for the wall-shear induced diffusion alone. Furthermore, a first principles relation was derived that illustrates the link between engine emission rate and propeller kinematics in generating the propeller-jet source concentration of pollutants. Using experimental results an estimate for benzene concentration fifty propeller diameters downstream of a 74 kW vessel was calculated to be around one third of the regulatory threshold for that chemical...|$|E

Policyholders can be indemnified by <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim for quake-related losses of property. Despite {{there are many other}} professionals involved in the assessment procedure for <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim, the qualified adjustors from underwriters are pivotal to the assessment of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claims. The qualified adjustors are personnel of non-life insurance companies that underwent training courses for earthquake building damage assessment {{and many of them are}} not professionals in civil engineering. Their determination of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claims are based on claim standard operation procedure (SOP) established by Taiwan Residential Earthquake Insurance Fund (TREIF) and mainly relies on personal experience and knowledge of earthquake building damages. Furthermore, considering that reinforced concrete buildings account for more than 76 % effective policies in Taiwan, a quantified <b>loss</b> model for <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim determination for RC buildings has been developed in 2009.

40|$|To {{what extent}} should insureds expect {{compensation}} on interruption to their voyage by loss of possession or free use or disposal {{of their property}} where it remains undamaged? Marine insurance does not compensate for partial losses occasioned by delay. Recent authority (Masefield v Amlin Corporate Member) confirmed an insured could not recover for an actual <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> following capture where pirates would accept ransom then release the property. Property was not an actual <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> even after condemnation by a foreign tribunal (Panamanian Oriental Steamship Corporation v Wright), although condemnation might establish constructive <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> Where the voyage becomes impossible by detention or embargo, the insured’s right to abandon to insurers for constructive <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> may be unpredictable (eg after one year’s duration in The Bamburi). In each scenario, insurers are excused making prompt payments, and from dealing themselves {{with the consequences of}} the peril. In each the insured is either uncompensated, or at best must wait. These authorities document an evolution; historically, English and American laws allowed the insured to abandon and recover for a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> while these perils lasted, ignoring ongoing hopes of recovery. This thesis argues that a presumption of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> still applies to all perils causing loss of possession. This appeared first in Continental treatises and was later applied in English law. No universal test of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> applies equally to all marine perils. Instead, situations of loss of possession should be governed by peril-specific rules, including the presumption of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> for perils causing loss of possession...|$|R

40|$|A <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all {{heat sinks}} is {{considered}} a severe accident with a low probability of occurrence. Following a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all heat sinks, the degasser/condenser relief valves (DCRV) become the sole means available for the depressurization of the primary heat transport system. If {{a nuclear power plant}} has a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of heat sinks accident, high-temperature steam and differential pressure between the primary heat transport system (PHTS) and the steam generator (SG) secondary side can cause a SG tube creep rupture. To protect the PHTS during a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all heat sinks accident, a sufficient depressurization capability of the degasser/condenser relief valve and the SG tube integrity is very important. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the discharge through these valves is necessary {{to assess the impact of}} the PHTS overprotection and the SG tube integrity of the primary circuit. This paper describes the analysis of DCRV discharge capacity and the SG tube integrity under a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all heat sink using the CATHENA code. It was found that the DCRV's discharge capacity is enough to protect the overpressure in the PHTS, and the SG tube integrity is maintained in a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all heat accident...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A typical {{problem of}} radial {{magnetic}} bearing is chosen and bearing involving n-pole pairs, where n = 2, 4, 6, 8, are designed. The <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> {{in each case}} are computed for different rotor speeds. A comparative study of the <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> in each case is performed theoretically in order to arrive at possible optimum situations. The major dimensions required {{for the analysis of}} losses were obtained in all those cases. A loss analysis was performed and the results were presented. It was found that there was a drastic decrease in the <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> from two pole pair to four pole pair. On the whole, it appeared as though four pole pair gives the minimum <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> for all the speeds. Further a better analysis of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> in four pole pair radial magnetic bearing was performed using genetic algorithms in two sections. Initially objective functions have been considered, namely minimization <b>total</b> power <b>loss</b> considering three variables like air gap length, rotor speed, and lamination thickness of rotor. Finally, same objective functions have been considered, namely minimization <b>total</b> power <b>loss</b> considering only two variables like air gap length and lamination thickness of rotor because in practical application machine should run at particular speed.
