40|$|Iris {{recognition}} constitutes one of {{the most}} powerful method for the iden- <b>tification</b> <b>and</b> authentication of people today. This thesis aims to describe the algorithms used by a mathematical apparatus. The description of these algo- rithms is not the only objective of this thesis; the reason they were chosen and potential improvements or substitutions are also discussed. The background of iris recognition, its use in cryptosystems, and the application of error-correcting codes are investigated as well. The second version of the thesis eliminates errata and a quantum of inaccu- racies discovered in the first version, especially in the ROI Definition, the Hough Transform and the Feature Extraction sections. Besides that, it also contains se- veral new propositions. Last, but not least, it shows a potential implementation of the algorithms described by appending pseudocodes to the relevant sections. ...|$|R
40|$|Postmarketing {{surveillance}} (PMS) has {{the vital}} aim to monitor effects of drugs af- ter release {{for use by}} the general pop- ulation, but suffers from under-reporting and limited coverage. Automatic meth- ods for detecting drug effect reports, es- pecially for social media, could vastly in- crease the scope of PMS. Very few auto- matic PMS methods are currently avail- able, in particular for the messy text types encountered on Twitter. In this paper we describe first results for developing PMS methods specifically for tweets. We de- scribe the corpus of 125, 669 tweets we have created and annotated to train and test the tools. We find that generic tools per- form well for tweet-level language iden- <b>tification</b> <b>and</b> tweet-level sentiment anal- ysis (both 0. 94 F 1 -Score). For detection of effect mentions we are able to achieve 0. 87 F 1 -Score, while effect-level adverse- vs. -beneficial analysis proves harder with an F 1 -Score of 0. 64. Among other things, our results indicate that MetaMap seman- tic types provide a very promising ba- sis for identifying drug effect mentions in tweets...|$|R
40|$|Power {{abuse is}} one of the social {{problems}} in the society. It is happen because there are two social class namely upper classes and lower class. Power abuse can be used as subject in literary work because literary work is a picture of human life. One of the literary work that use power abuses as subject is David Copperfield. The author of David Copperfield is Charles Dickens, a famous author at Victorian era. Power abuse is also related to the oppression so that {{so that it can be}} analyze by using Marxist Approach. Marxist Approach {{is one of}} the literary, which based on economic and political theories or Karl Marx. Literary work is picture of human. It means that the society influences literary work in many aspects such as social aspects, economic aspects, political aspects, science and technological aspect, cultural aspects, and religious aspects. In this novel, power abuse can be seen from characters <b>and</b> <b>characterization,</b> plot, style, <b>and</b> theme. This novel also analyzed based on Marxist approach. Dialectical materialism can be seen from characters <b>and</b> <b>characterization,</b> <b>and</b> plot. Historical materialism can be seen from character <b>and</b> <b>characterization,</b> plot, style, <b>and</b> theme. Alienation can be seen from character <b>and</b> <b>characterization,</b> plot, <b>and</b> setting. Revolution can be seen from character <b>and</b> <b>characterization,</b> <b>and</b> setting. Class struggle can be seen from character <b>and</b> <b>characterization</b> <b>and</b> plot. Revolution can be seen from character <b>and</b> <b>characterization,</b> setting, <b>and</b> plot. In this novel, power abuse is portrayed in many aspects such as social aspects, economic aspects, and politic aspects. In social aspects, power abuse can be seen from character <b>and</b> <b>characterization,</b> plot, style, <b>and</b> theme. In economic aspects, power abuse can be seen from character <b>and</b> <b>characterization,</b> plot, <b>and</b> theme.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{analyzed}} RNA {{isolated from}} recently prepared and historically preserved slides containing smears of Plasmodium-infectcd blood. We found that slides preserved {{as long as}} 20 years can yield RNA that is a suitable template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Mosquitoes that have been stored for years under ambient temperature {{can also be used}} as an RNA source. The RNA amplification from slide-derived material is shown to be dependent upon the addition of reverse transcriptase and the resultant products are specific to the developmental state of the parasite. Amplification of ribosomal RNA with primers conserved for Plasmodium and hybridization with species-specific probes provide a general, unbiased method for species determination. Messenger RNA transcripts from slides also appear to serve as templates. The procedure may add complementary information to that derived from microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears including species identification, variant antigen iden <b>tification</b> <b>and</b> drug resistance status. Historical information regarding the epidemiology of par asitic diseases, such as malaria, is stored in stained blood smears and desiccated arthropod vectors as well as in doc umented reports of the outbreaks. Important information about these diseases and their spread could be obtained b...|$|R
40|$|Rogers characterises {{engineering}} as: [...] . {{the practice}} of organising the design and construction of any artifice which transforms the physical world around us to meet some recognised need. When the artifice is software, a key challenge is learn how to recon- cile the formal world of the computing machine and its software with the non-formal physical world around it. In this paper, we describe an approach that brings both non-formal and formal aspects of software en- gineering together within a single theoretical framework, which sees soft- ware engineering practice as recordable and re-playable design theoretic transformations of software problems. The framework permits the iden- <b>tification</b> <b>and</b> clarification of software requirements, {{the representation of the}} problem world into which the software solution will be delivered, and the construction of adequacy arguments for stake-holders. Designs are recordable and re-playable through our adaptation of tactics, a (now standard) form of programming language used in transformational proof theoretic presentations. This brings to our system many other benefits of such approaches, including the ability to abstract from a captured design, and to combine programmatically captured designs. This paper provides an example-driven presentation of our framework...|$|R
