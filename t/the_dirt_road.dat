Hamilton Avenue was renamed Harvard Avenue in 1905, but <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> did not begin to be paved until 1914. Roads were so bad that when St. Catherine Church (at E. 93rd and St. Catherine Avenue) caught fire in March 1899, the poor condition of the roads prevented firefighting personnel from reaching it in time and the new church {{burned to the ground}} (and was rebuilt). Even as late as 1906, most of Union-Miles Park still consisted of fields and dirt roads.|$|E

500|$|Elements of the US 24th Infantry Regiment had {{a similar}} {{experience}} west of Sangju.

500|$|At {{the dawn}} of the {{automobile}} era, the state legislature authorized California's first state road on March 26, 1895, by creating the post of [...] "Lake Tahoe Wagon Road Commissioner" [...] to maintain the road from Newtown Road near Smith Flat (just east of Placerville) to Nevada. The county deeded the 58-mile (93km) road to the state on February 28, 1896. Funding was only enough for minimal improvements, including a new stone bridge over the South Fork American River at Riverton in 1901. The Department of Engineering took over its maintenance in 1907, immediately completed a survey and posted granite milestones that marked the distance from Placerville, and in 1910 started sprinkling <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> with water in summer to keep down dust (as had been done in the 1860s). A 1915 law added the short distance from Smith Flat west to the east limits of Placerville to the state road.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} highway along {{much of the}} US113 corridor was a {{post road}} established in the late 18thcentury that connected Horn Town on the Eastern Shore of Virginia with Snow Hill, Berlin, Selbyville, Georgetown, Milford, and Dover, ultimately leading to Wilmington and Philadelphia. The Dover–Milford portion of the post road followed the King's Highway established in the late 17thcentury to connect Dover with Lewes, the original county seat of Sussex County. South of Milford, the post road followed a stage road from Dover to Dagsboro constructed to connect the new county seat of Georgetown with Dover in the 1790s. A 1796 act of the Delaware General Assembly called for surveying a straighter [...] clear path in Sussex County from Milford through Georgetown and Dagsboro to the Maryland state line, a highway that {{became known as the}} State Road by the mid-19thcentury. In Maryland, the post road followed what is now MD12 from the Virginia state line through Stockton to Snow Hill and the Old Stage Road from north of Showell to the Delaware state line, and a separate road connected Pocomoke City and Snow Hill. By 1898, <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> from Pocomoke City to Berlin via Snow Hill was the main thoroughfare of Worcester County.|$|E

500|$|According to Predić, the {{painting}} shows four intoxicated youths {{who have been}} drinking all night walking rowdily through their village around dawn and waking all their neighbours. They trudge {{down the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>road,</b> keeping their distance from the surrounding houses so as to avoid crashing against a wall and hurting themselves. The gajda (bagpipe) player, the most sober of the four, walks slightly ahead of his friends. The one to the left, the youngest of the group, walks barefoot through the mud and props one of his friends up against his shoulder. The man he is propping up, who is the most intoxicated, paid for the previous night's drinks and bounces between shoulders for support. The man to his right has just realized that he is walking by his own dilapidated home. His mother, alerted by the young men's laughter and song, emerges from the house and recognizes her son. She begins to shout at him and threatens to spank him once he returns, but the young man simply laughs and sends her an acknowledging wave with his hat. A young girl peaks out the bottom pane of the left window of the house to the far right, wondering if her boyfriend is part of the group. A sign above her reads Szeszfőzde ("distillery" [...] in Hungarian). Predić's initials in Cyrillic, У.П., {{can be found in the}} bottom-right corner.|$|E
