5|$|On September 30, the French {{attacked}} the British Fusiliers redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, {{in which the}} French were repulsed suffering several casualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> food, the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach. In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for earthworks. Preparations for the parallel also began.|$|E

This {{was the first}} opera written by a Welsh composer and also the first opera to be performed in Welsh.

The Allied Tripartite Commission allocated Steinbrinck to the Soviet Union at the end of 1945 and she sailed for Libau on 2 January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Fraternity {{growth was}} {{interrupted}} by the Civil War, as men from many Southern colleges halted their studies to join the Confederate army. Many fraternity chapters ceased to exist during this time, but some students made efforts <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> fraternities as the war continued. Harry St. John Dixon, a member of Sigma Chi from the University of Virginia, joined with four other Sigma Chi brothers from other universities to form the Constantine Chapter of the fraternity. Created in 1864, this chapter was meant to preserve the bonds of the fraternity during the war, promote ties between the North and South, and ensure the fraternity's continued existence.|$|E

Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and thus prohibit discrimination {{on the grounds of}} religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions.

5|$|In 1972, key {{elements}} of the park, including the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, were grade II listed <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> character. Following the 2004 film Closer, based on the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber, Postman's Park experienced a resurgence of interest; key scenes of both were set in the park itself. In June 2009, a city worker, Jane Shaka (née Michele), via the Diocese of London added a new tablet to the Memorial, the first new addition for 78 years. In November 2013 a free mobile app, The Everyday Heroes of Postman’s Park, was launched which documents the lives and deaths of those commemorated on the memorial.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> integrity.|$|E
5|$|Mutukumbo {{festival is}} the major festival celebrated in the {{province}} in Luapala Valley.

The event involves enacting the migration of Luba Lunda and conquest of the valley by the chiefs of the tribe during historic times. Kwanga festival is held in the October by the Njumba tribe in Samfya. It {{is seen as a}} cultural reunion of the tribe <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> rituals and traditions.

5|$|The {{east coast}} of the U.S. also began to consume more ice, {{particularly}} as more industrial and private customers found uses for refrigeration. Ice became increasingly used in the northeast of the U.S. to preserve dairy products and fresh fruit for market, the chilled goods being transported over the growing railroad lines. By the 1840s, ice was being used to transfer small quantities of goods further west across the continent. Eastern U.S. fishermen began to use ice <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> catches. Fewer businesses or individuals in the east harvested their own ice independently in winter, most preferring to rely on commercial providers.|$|E

5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a clear}} {{majority}} in the English Parliament for removing James and offering the throne to Mary; William's demand he be made joint monarch and sole ruler {{in the event of}} Mary's death was far more controversial and only narrowly approved. In Scotland, William was the main prize, not Mary; as a fellow Calvinist, the Presbyterian majority saw him as a natural ally in regaining control of Kirk and government. The Episcopalian minority who formed the existing government recognised his support was the only way <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> power. As a result, on 7th January 1689 the Scottish Privy Council asked William to take over the government in Scotland pending a formal Settlement.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their Umayyad predecessors, the Abbasid caliphs did {{not pursue}} active expansion: in general terms, they were {{content with the}} {{territorial}} limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or preemptive, meant <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours. At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular remained important for domestic consumption. The annual raids, which had almost lapsed in the turmoil following the Abbasid Revolution, were undertaken with renewed vigour from ca. 780 on, and were the only expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person.|$|E

5|$|Brugge {{needed to}} score again {{to keep the}} tie alive, and pushed their players forward {{in search of an}} equaliser. This forced Liverpool to pull all their players, except Keegan, into {{defensive}} positions to try <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> lead. Despite this Liverpool had a chance {{to take the lead in}} the 34th minute. Smith's volley from a Kennedy free-kick went wide of the Brugge goal. Brugge's pressure almost paid off five minutes into the second half. Ulrik le Fevre and Roger van Gool combined to split the Liverpool defence, leaving Lambert with the ball. His subsequent shot beat Liverpool goalkeeper Clemence but hit the post. Brugge kept attacking in an effort to find the goal they needed; their best chance came four minutes from the end. Brugge breached the Liverpool defence, but Cools' shot was denied by a diving save from Clemence. No more goals were scored; the final score was 1–1.|$|E
5|$|Charles won {{his first}} decisive victory in the Battle of Rozgony (at present-day Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15June 1312. After that his troops seized most fortresses of the {{powerful}} Aba family. During the next decade, Charles restored royal power primarily {{with the assistance of}} the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom. After the death of the most powerful oligarch, Matthew Csák, in 1321, Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom, with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> autonomous status. He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330. Charles's contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from God for his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Záh who had attempted to slaughter the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the optimistic}} Australian {{assessments}} of Viet Cong capability, {{rather than having}} left Phuoc Tuy the communists were more likely reinforcing and consolidating in preparation for future operations, avoiding battle with the Australians in order <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>their</b> strength. Regardless, D445 Battalion had suffered heavy casualties and posed a diminished threat, while {{the headquarters of the}} Viet Cong 5th Division was located near the northern border, west of the May Tao mountains, with its fighting formations widely dispersed. The Viet Cong 275th Regiment was reported to have moved north to War Zone D for retraining and refitting, and the Viet Cong 274th Regiment had moved from its scattered locations in the north-west Hat Dich to replace it in the north-east of the province, and was now operating in unfamiliar terrain. Meanwhile, casualties, illness and poor local recruitment meant they were now largely reliant on reinforcements from North Vietnam. Unsure of the next move, the Viet Cong 5th Division adopted a cautious posture, with only the 1st Battalion, 275th Regiment remaining in the May Tao mountains while the 274th Regiment dispersed east of Route 2 {{for the remainder of the}} month.|$|E
