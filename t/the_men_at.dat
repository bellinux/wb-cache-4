5|$|On 18 March 1800, Agamemnon {{was damaged}} {{when she ran}} onto the Penmarks Rocks. She came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800. On her way to port she had {{encountered}} , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With {{the assistance of the}} crews from two sloops, the guardship , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps, the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> the pumps once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|E
5|$|South Wales miners, {{including}} those at Universal, were paid on a rate {{determined by the}} Sliding Scale Committee, which fixed wages on the price coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led to industrial unrest and, in 1898, a strike that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> Universal joined {{at the end of}} April. The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners. The colliery resumed production and in 1899 was producing 3,000 long tons (3,400short tons) of coal a week.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} the {{southern}} winter and adverse ice conditions meant {{that it was more}} than three months before Shackleton was able to achieve the relief of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> Elephant Island. His first attempt was with the British ship Southern Sky, then the government of Uruguay loaned him a ship, while searching on the Falkland Islands he found the ship Emma for his third attempt but the ship's engine blew, then finally, with the aid of the steam-tug Yelcho commanded by Luis Pardo, the entire party was brought to safety, reaching Punta Arenas in Chile on 3 September 1916.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> Boulogne {{formed the}} core for what Napoleon would later call La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men {{organized}} into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannon each and {{were capable of}} independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps (properly situated in a strong defensive position) could survive {{at least a day}} without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> the Plum River {{settlement}} waited {{overnight and}} then fled to Galena where they reported the incident to Colonel James M. Strode. He ordered a militia {{party to the}} settlement to secure the it {{and make sure the}} attackers were dealt with accordingly. When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans, and plenty of bullet holes from the battle. The group continued to Fort Armstrong, where they picked up supplies, and returned to Galena without incident. On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about recent events, including the Plum River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson. He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement, but no one was killed and the site abandoned since.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> {{the front}} had to {{struggle}} with supply problems–there was a shortage of food; and disease was rife in the damp, rat-infested conditions. Along with enemy action, many soldiers {{had to contend with}} new diseases: trench foot, trench fever and trench nephritis. When the war ended in November 1918, British Army casualties, as the result of enemy action and disease, were recorded as 673,375 killed and missing, with another 1,643,469 wounded. The rush to demobilise {{at the end of the}} conflict substantially decreased the strength of the British Army, from its peak strength of 4,000,000 men in 1918 to 370,000 men by 1920.|$|E

5|$|The now-isolated Rangers fended off {{numerous}} counter-attacks {{from the}} German 914th Grenadier Regiment. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> the point became isolated {{and some were}} captured. By dawn on D+1, Rudder had only 90 men able to fight. Relief did not arrive until D+2, {{when members of the}} 743rd Tank Battalion and others arrived. By then, Rudder's men had run out of ammunition and were using captured German weapons. Several men were killed as a result, because the German weapons made a distinctive noise, and the men were mistaken for the enemy. By the end of the battle, the Rangers casualties were 135 dead and wounded, while German casualties were 50 killed and 40 captured. An unknown number of French collaborators were executed.|$|E
5|$|Brett's replacement, Major General George Kenney, {{arrived in}} the theater in August, and Walker was {{appointed}} Commanding General, V Bomber Command, Fifth Air Force on 3 September, with his headquarters in Townsville. At this time, Port Moresby was subject to frequent Japanese air raids, so the bombers were generally based in the Townsville area and staged through Port Moresby to minimize their chance of loss or damage on the ground. In mid-September 1942, {{at the height of}} the Kokoda Track campaign, Kenney sent Walker to Port Moresby for a few weeks to direct the advanced echelon, to give Whitehead a rest and Walker more experience. Walker attempted to lift morale by improving the men's living conditions. He made a point of small gestures of fellowship, such as standing in line with <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> meal times. But what endeared him most to his men was his willingness to share the dangers as well as their hardships, by flying a mission a week on average. In October, General Douglas MacArthur gave Kenney a dressing down for flying over the Owen Stanley Range. In turn, Kenney ordered Walker, Wilson and Whitehead not to fly any more missions. For a variety of reasons, all four of them eventually disobeyed their orders.|$|E
5|$|Just after midday, the 21st Panzer Division {{received}} {{permission to}} attack the landings. Luck ordered the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment, east of the River Orne, towards the bridges. The column was quickly spotted, and engaged {{for the next two}} hours by Allied artillery and aircraft causing heavy losses. The 1st Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment and the 100th Panzer Regiment, attacking from west of the canal, had more success reaching the beaches between the British landing area of Sword and the Canadian Juno. At 13:30, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> the bridges heard the sound of bagpipes, played by Bill Millin of the 1st Commando Brigade. As the commandos arrived, they crossed the bridges and joined the rest of 6th Airborne Division defending the eastern perimeter. Some of the tanks accompanying the commandos moved into Bénouville to reinforce its defences, while others crossed the bridges with the commandos. At 15:00, a boat loaded with German infantry approached from Caen. It was engaged with the anti-tank gun manned by number One Platoon, hit in the stern by the second round fired and then retreated back toward Caen.|$|E

5|$|Police {{seized a}} rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three pistols from <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> {{the time of}} the arrest. They were {{detained}} in Bells, Tennessee for a few days before being moved to another facility. During interrogation, the men told authorities of their plan to kill Obama. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives handled the initial federal investigation of the case. The United States Secret Service became involved in the investigation once the assassination plot was discovered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was also involved in the investigation. Both men were charged with illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to rob a firearms dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate; a superseding indictment additionally charged the pair with civil rights conspiracy and conspiracy, and charged Cowart with destruction of religious property and a related firearms charge. Authorities have found no evidence that anyone besides the two men were involved in the plot, but as of October 2008 authorities were said to be investigating the possibility.|$|E
5|$|That night workers put the flukeman into a U.S. Marshal's van unrestrained, but {{it kills}} {{the driver and}} escapes to a local campsite. The flukeman hides in a {{portable}} toilet and is suctioned into a truck's tank {{the next day when}} the toilet is drained. Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller telling him that success on his current work is imperative so that the X-Files be reinstated undeniably. When he questions Scully about it, she denies any involvement. The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant. Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva, attempting to reproduce. One of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a storm drain overflow. Mulder heads in and saves him, apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it, slicing it in half. Scully concludes her investigation, thinking that the creature was brought to the U.S. by a Russian freighter that was hauling salvage material from Chernobyl, and that the creature was created in a 'soup' of radioactive sewage. Elsewhere, the flukeman's remains open its eyes.|$|E

25|$|If Philip II of Macedon had {{not been}} the father of Alexander the Great, he would be more widely known as a first-rate {{military}} innovator, tactician and strategist, and as a consummate politician. The conquests of Alexander {{would have been impossible}} without the army his father created. Considered semi-barbarous by some metropolitan Greeks, the Macedonians were a martial people; they drank deeply of unwatered wine (the very mark of a barbarian) and no youth was considered to be fit to sit with <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> table until he had killed, on foot with a spear, a wild boar.|$|E

Despite being the sole witness who reported that she could identify <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>at</b> the scene, Shawna Ornt was never asked in court if she could identify Ferguson.

Bartlett and Chamberlain reorganized 150 to 200 stragglers and put them back into the battle. Chamberlain saw Colonel Gwyn's battle flag to the rear and asked Gwyn to have his brigade assist Chamberlain's men, which Gwyn did. Suddenly confronted by a large number of Confederates, Chamberlain feared being caught in a cross-fire when the Confederates suddenly threw down their arms and surrendered.|$|E
