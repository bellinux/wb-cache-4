In a follow-up interview, {{he was asked about}} the possibility of re-introducing The Land of Gorch to popular culture, and said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is a reference that is probably lost to time...They weren't even famous then". In 2013, writer Jay Fosgitt marketed to publishing company Archaia Entertainment the idea of reviving The Land of Gorch characters in comic book format with a new storyline.|$|E
500|$|Kennan had not {{intended}} the [...] "X" [...] article as {{a prescription for}} policy. For {{the rest of his}} life, Kennan continued to reiterate that the article did not imply an automatic commitment to resist Soviet [...] "expansionism" [...] wherever it occurred, with little distinction of primary and secondary interests. The article did not make it obvious that Kennan favored employing political and economic rather than military methods as the chief agent of containment. [...] "My thoughts about containment" [...] said Kennan in a 1996 interview to CNN, [...] "were of course distorted by the people who understood it and pursued it exclusively as a military concept; and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that,</b> as much as any other cause, led to [...] 40 years of unnecessary, fearfully expensive and disoriented process of the Cold War".|$|E
500|$|When Pee-wee's fame started growing, Reubens {{started to}} move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public {{appearance}} and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to [...] "get the public to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was a real person". Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee-wee Herman Show, playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline's in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.|$|E

500|$|Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{said that}} second season {{was the one}} on which {{the rest of the}} series was based, with {{characters}} taking long-term roles such as Geordi La Forge as Chief Engineer and Worf at the Tactical station. DeCandido said that the addition of Goldberg as Guinan was [...] "delightful", but that Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski [...] "didn't entirely work as a character". In his view, the episodes during season two were varied in quality. He gave [...] "Q Who" [...] ten out of ten, while he gave [...] "Shades of Grey" [...] a zero. It {{was the first time he}} awarded the top score to an episode; none of the first season had qualified. He gave the season an overall mark of seven out of ten and said that [...] "Far too many people say that TNG didn't come into its own until the third season, and frankly, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> estimation comes a year too late." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{topic of}} {{abortion}} is a prominent theme in [...] "Secrets". After discovering {{that she is}} pregnant, Lori asks Glenn to retrieve with emergency contraception pills from the pharmacy. Upon returning, an infuriated Maggie hands Lori her pills. Dale gently confronts her about her pregnancy when he sees that she becomes nauseated at the smell of cooking meat, and Lori explains that Rick is the biological father of the child. Writer Robert Kirkman opined that such assertions were [...] "wishful thinking". [...] "She was with those two men very close to each other. There was not a large span of time between her time with Shane and then Rick's return and her time with Rick. It's definitely {{up in the air}} and it’s not like there's a lot of paternity tests floating around out there." [...] Kirkman felt that he had to responsibly approach controversial issues from a neutral standpoint and insisted that abortion should warrant discussion, considering the circumstances. He stated: [...] "As far as the abortion stuff goes, it’s really just a matter of being realistic. These are the kinds of issues that people deal with in real life and in this situation I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is the kind of thought process that Lori Grimes would be going through." ...|$|E
500|$|Beatty {{ordered his}} battlecruisers {{to make all}} {{practical}} speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. New Zealand and Indomitable were the slowest of Beatty's ships, and gradually fell behind the newer battlecruisers. Despite this, New Zealand was able to open fire on Blücher by 9:35, and continued to engage the armoured cruiser after the other British battlecruisers had switched targets to the German battlecruisers. After about an hour, New Zealand had knocked out Blüchers forward turret, and Indomitable began to fire on her as well at 10:31. Two 12-inch shells pierced the German ship's armoured deck and exploded in an ammunition room four minutes later. This started a fire amidships that destroyed her two port [...] turrets, while the concussion damaged her engines so that her speed dropped to , and jammed her steering gear. At 10:48, Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her, but {{the combination of a}} signalling error by Beatty's flag lieutenant and heavy damage to Beatty's flagship Lion, which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards, caused the rest of the British battlecruisers, temporarily under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Gordon Moore in New Zealand, to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> signal applied to them. In response, they turned away from Hipper's main body and engaged Blücher. New Zealand fired 147 shells at Blücher before the German ship capsized and sank at 12:07 after being torpedoed by Arethusa. Captain Halsey had again worn the piupiu over his uniform during the battle, and the lack of damage to New Zealand was once more attributed to its good luck properties.|$|E

500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E

2500|$|The fight ended {{after the}} fourth round when Penn's cornerman, Jason Parillo, {{requested}} that the referee stop the fight.

[...] During the fight, Penn complained that St-Pierre was too slippery to hold, which led to suspicion about petroleum jelly being illegally applied to St-Pierre's back.
