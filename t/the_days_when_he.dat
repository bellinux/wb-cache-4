25|$|In 1993, the Angels {{had a new}} spring {{training}} camp in Tempe, Arizona after 31 previous seasons in Palm Springs Stadium in Palm Springs, an idea Autry developed from <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> stayed in his desert resort home. The Angels hoped a new facility would rejuvenate and improve the roster in the long run. The 1993 and 1994 seasons proved to be worse for the Angels than the previous three, particularly since the 1994 season ended in a baseball player strike that kept Angel fans waiting even longer for the team's fate to change. In that season, the Halos had the second-worst record in baseball {{at the time of}} the strike, and were en route to a 66-96 season, which would have been their worst record in team history had the season continued, and were in last place in their division, but just 5 1/2 games out.|$|E
25|$|Most Ashkenazim {{have the}} custom {{to fill a}} fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic {{discussion}} that concerns the number of cups {{that are supposed to}} be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6-7, some rabbis felt {{that it was important to}} include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured but the question as to whether or not the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which - by this stage - was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until Elijah (in reference to the notion that Elijah's arrival would precipitate the coming of the Messiah, at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the Kos shel Eliyahu ("Cup of Elijah"). Over time, people came to relate this cup to the notion that Elijah will visit each home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of <b>the</b> <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> will come to announce the coming of the Jewish Messiah.|$|E

This is Dylan at his most romantic." [...] Wilentz comments that Dylan's writing had shifted from <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> asked questions and supplied answers.

500|$|After his father's {{death in}} 1898, Chekhov bought {{a plot of}} land on the {{outskirts}} of Yalta and built a villa, into which he moved with his mother and sister the following year. Though he planted trees and flowers, kept dogs and tame cranes, and received guests such as Leo Tolstoy and Maxim Gorky, Chekhov was always relieved to leave his [...] "hot Siberia" [...] for Moscow or travels abroad. He vowed to move to Taganrog as soon as a water supply was installed there. In Yalta he completed two more plays for the Art Theatre, composing with greater difficulty than in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> [...] "wrote serenely, the way I eat pancakes now". He took a year each over Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard.|$|E
500|$|Skinner {{tries to}} keep the {{children}} under control, forcing them to stay together in the cafeteria and eat apples, relish and (only if they behave well enough) mayonnaise and will not let them go home until the snow melts. After Nelson tries to escape, Skinner unearths his U.S. Army memorabilia and is reminded of <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> commanded respect from his troops. Skinner tries to command respect from the students, and briefly succeeds after threatening to hang them in their clothes on hooks on the wall if they rebel. Bart tries to tunnel his way out, but Skinner stops him, and after Willie refuses to destroy the tunnel, Skinner does so himself, but is stuck in the resulting cave-in. The students rebel and eventually tie Skinner up in a dodge ball bag. They then set about [...] "going nuts" [...] such as racing trolleys in the school hallway, even burning numerous books in the school's library.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000 he {{suffered}} a stroke in Bangladesh which put him initially in intensive care and then a wheelchair. He was forced to sell the wine farm in 2001 to pay for medical bills that his insurer refused to pay. Later he moved to North Wales, where he continued to coach locally at Marchwiel & Wrexham and also NE Wales Development squads. [...] He was also involved with disabled cricket in Wales. Though he was not (as often erroneously stated) a full-time wheelchair user, he could only walk very slowly, so {{it was easier to}} get from A to B in the wheelchair, and for <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> coached he used an electric scooter which was provided for him by the PCA. [...] He died after a brain haemorrhage in Jersey on 30 December 2005, leaving his third wife a widow.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{was young}} Gromyko's mother Olga {{told him that he}} should leave his home town to become an educated man. Gromyko {{followed}} his mother's advice and, after finishing seven years of primary school and vocational education in Gomel, he moved to Borisov to attend technical school. Gromyko {{became a member of the}} All-Union Communist Party Bolsheviks in 1931, something he had dreamed of since he learned about the [...] "difference between a poor farmer and a landowner, a worker and a capitalist". Gromyko was voted in as secretary of his party cell at his first party conference and would use most of his weekends doing volunteer work. Gromyko received a very small stipend to live on, but still had a strong nostalgia for <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> worked as a volunteer. It was about this time that Gromyko met his future wife, Lydia Dmitrievna Grinevich. Grinevich was the daughter of a Belarusian peasant family and came from Kamenki, a small village to the west of Minsk. She and Gromyko would have two children, Anatoly and Emilia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{pursuit of}} the ADF, Kishi visited India, Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, Ceylon, and Taiwan in May 1957, asking the leaders of those nations to join the ADF, but with the {{exception}} of Taiwan, which agreed to join, all {{of the leaders of the}} those nations gave equivocal answers. Through he always denied it in public, but Kishi saw the ADF as an economic version of the [...] "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" [...] that Japan had sought to establish in World War II, which contributed to the failure of the proposed ADF as memories of the Japanese occupation were too fresh in Southeast Asia. To many people in Southeast Asia, the slogan [...] "Economic Development for Asia by Asia" [...] sounded too much like the wartime Japanese slogan [...] "Asia for Asians!". During World War II, the Japanese state had always presented the war as a race war between Asians vs. the [...] "white devils", portraying the war as a Pan-Asian crusade to unite all of the peoples of Asia against the [...] "white devils". The Japanese had been generally welcomed as liberators from European imperialism when they arrived in Southeast Asia, but soon the peoples of Southeast Asia had learned the Japanese did not regard other Asians as equals, as the Japanese had a habit of slapping the faces of the peoples they ruled to remind them who were the [...] "Great Yamato race" [...] and who were not. [...] The Burmese Prime Minister U Nu had, like everyone else in the Burmese elite, been a Japanese collaborator in World War II. Precisely because of his past U Nu told Kishi during his visit to Rangoon that he was reluctant to join the ADF as it would remind the Burmese people of <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was shouting Pan-Asian rhetoric, praising Japan as the natural leader of Asia and declaring how happy he was to serve the Japanese. Even in countries that were not occupied by Japan like India, Ceylon and Pakistan, Kishi encountered obstacles. During his visit to Karachi, the Pakistani Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy told Kishi that he thought of himself as a [...] "human being rather than an Asian first", preferred bilateral over multilateral aid as it allowed Pakistan to play off rival nations for better terms, and that Pakistan would not join the ADF if India also joined. Suhrawadry made it clear that until the Kashmir dispute was settled to Pakistan's satisfaction that Pakistan would not be joining any organization that India was a member of. [...] The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru told Kishi during his visit to New Delhi that he wanted his nation to be neutral in the Cold War, and that as Japan was allied to the United States, joining the ADF would be in effect aligning India with the Americans. In Colombo, the Ceylonese Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, through not objecting to the ADF in principle, told Kishi that he preferred bilateral aid deals as it allowed Ceylon to play off the Soviet Union against the United States, and objected to the provision that joining the ADF would mean be [...] "locked in" [...] to only accepting aid from the ADF. Only during his visit to Taiping did Kishi receive outright acceptance of the ADF, through the Taiwanese press statement proclaiming the ADF would be most useful for stopping the rise of Communism in Asia proved embarrassing for Kishi as he had maintained in public that the ADF was supposed to be an organization for allowing Asians to help other Asians and had nothing to do with the Cold War. Because Japan was a much richer nation than all of the other nations of the proposed ADF combined, the ADF was generally as a vehicle for Japan to re-establish itself as a great power in Asia, as few had any doubt that Japan would be the dominant member of the ADF. Moreover, the fact that the United States was supporting the ADF led the proposed organization to be seen as siding with the United States in the Cold War, a struggle that many Asian nations wanted to be neutral in.|$|E
