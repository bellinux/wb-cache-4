5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation {{is known as}} dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E

5|$|The 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was a Royal Yugoslav Army {{infantry}} formation raised {{prior to}} the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941. It formed part of the Yugoslav 7th Army, and was deployed southwest of Ljubljana in the Julian Alps, along the western border with Italy from Bičke north to Mount Blegoš. It was not heavily engaged during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the invasion, but from 9 April it withdrew steadily due to withdrawals on its flanks and {{in the face of}} the advancing German XLIX Mountain Corps. Encircled by the 14th Panzer Division linking up with Italian thrusts further west, it surrendered on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|The besieging force outnumbered the JNA {{garrison}} in Varaždin, {{which was}} divided among several barracks, storage depots and other facilities, but the JNA possessed substantially greater firepower. The balance shifted {{in favour of}} the Croatian forces after smaller JNA posts were captured in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the siege, until only one barracks along with {{the headquarters of the}} JNA 32nd Corps remained under JNA control. At that point, the commander of the 32nd Corps, Major General Vladimir Trifunović, and the civilian authorities in Varaždin agreed that the remaining JNA forces in the city would surrender, but all those wishing to leave would be permitted to do so, leaving their weapons behind.|$|E

5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{search and}} rescue efforts for {{thirteen}} people who were listed as missing through May 7 were assisted by urban {{search and rescue}} dogs from across the country. Nearly 1,000 members of the Oklahoma National Guard were deployed throughout the affected region. The American Red Cross had set up ten mobile feeding stations by this time and stated that 30 more were en route. On May 8, a disaster recovery center was opened in Moore for individuals recovering from the tornadoes. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, roughly 500,000 cubic yards (382,277 cubic meters) of debris was left behind and would likely take weeks to clear. Within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the disaster declaration, relief funds began being sent to families who requested aid. By May 9, roughly $180,000 had been approved by FEMA for disaster housing assistance.|$|E
5|$|During June1966, low {{atmospheric}} pressure {{stretched across the}} western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexicoa pattern that is conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the month, a dissipating trough extended from the southeastern United States into the western Caribbean. A mid-level circulation developed along the trough near Cabo Gracias a Dios on June3. By the next day, the circulation had reached the surface, which marked {{the development of a}} tropical depression over eastern Nicaragua. On June 5, the depression crossed Honduras and emerged into the western Caribbean, moving north-northeastward through an area of warm sea surface temperatures. It had a good cyclonic circulation, convection, and moisture content, but most significantly, a passing trough to the north provided the depression with favorable outflow. On June 6, the depression rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm and later Hurricane Alma. This made it the earliest hurricane in the basin since Hurricane Able in 1951.|$|E

5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Sava {{served with the}} 1st Monitor Division. Along with her fellow monitor , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the invasion. The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe, but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigation was difficult, and Sava was scuttled on 11 April. Some of her crew tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but all were captured prior to the Yugoslav surrender. The vessel was later raised by the navy of the Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia and continued to serve as Sava until the night of 8 September 1944 when she was again scuttled.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, {{she was the}} flagship of the 1st Monitor Division, and along with her fellow monitor , she laid mines in the Danube near the Romanian border during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the invasion. The two monitors fought off several attacks by the Luftwaffe, but were forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, the monitors' navigation was difficult, and they were scuttled by their crews on 11 April. Some of her crew may have been killed when a demolished bridge collapsed onto a tugboat after they abandoned ship. A number tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but most were obliged to surrender to the Germans at Sarajevo on 14 April. The remainder {{made their way to}} the Bay of Kotor, where they were captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April.|$|E
5|$|Early on June17, the JTWC {{issued a}} second TCFA {{as the system}} {{continued}} to organize. By this time the system was nearly stationary and at 0600UTC, the JMA declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression. Several hours later, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W while the storm was situated about 705km (440mi) south-southwest of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Little movement took place for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the storm's existence as weak steering currents were in place over the South China Sea. Following further development of the depression, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm late on June17. At 0600UTC on June18, the JMA classified {{the system as a}} tropical storm and gave it the name Linfa. Limited poleward outflow hindered intensification for the remainder of June18. By this time, the storm began to increase in forward motion due to a strengthening subtropical ridge located east of Taiwan and a mid-latitude trough to the west.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> September 2002, an upper-level trough {{emerged in}} the Gulf of Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of {{the location of the}} center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September, the ZNG {{clashed with}} the JNA {{garrison}} at the Logorište barracks in Karlovac, captured a communications facility at Platak near Rijeka an additional JNA barracks and a storage depot in Varaždin, restricting the JNA to the barracks housing headquarters of the JNA Varaždin Corps. By 20 September, when the JNA launched a campaign against the ZNG throughout Croatia, more than 60 JNA facilities in Croatiaincluding 15 barracks and 11 storage depotshad surrendered or were captured. The JNA barracks in Našice surrendered on 21 September. The JNA Varaždin Corps surrendered the next day, providing the ZNG with a major caché of weapons. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the blockade, the Croatian forces also captured several small JNA posts in Split, but no large JNA facility in the city.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army Group was not {{directly}} attacked during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the invasion, but events {{to the east}} and west of its deployment area resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Drava and Danube then the Sava. On 10 April, the crumbling defences of the 4th Army on the left flank of the 1st Army Group had been penetrated by the German 8th Panzer Division, which then turned east and drove into the left flank of the 1st Army Group on the following day. By the end of that day, the Germans had effectively routed the 2nd Army Group. Remnants continued to fight along the line of the Sava until early on 14 April, but mass surrenders began that day {{with tens of thousands of}} Yugoslav soldiers being taken into captivity by the Germans during their drive on Sarajevo in the centre of the country. The Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E

5|$|The Syrian Army, which {{consisted}} of 4,500 soldiers, had been mostly repelled in their offensive during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the war, gaining control over a small area along the Syrian border. As {{a result of the}} army's poor showing, Quwatli pressed defense minister Ahmad al-Sharabati to resign his post, which Sharabati did on 24 May. He then replaced chief of staff Abdullah Atfeh with Husni al-Zaim during that same period of the war. Following the war, Quwatli accused Zaim of military incompetence and his officers of profiteering. In turn, Zaim accused Quwatli of mismanagement during the conflict. The Syrian public did not spare Quwatli blame for the army's poor performance, causing his popularity, built on his nationalist reputation, to erode further. The Syrian press was also sharply critical of Quwatli and Prime Minister Mardam Bey, urging them to leave their positions. Mardam Bey resigned on 22 August 1948 and was replaced by Khalid al-Azm.|$|E
5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds {{set a new}} personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed {{during the first few}} days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, and that it was operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E
5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very {{reluctant}} to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E
