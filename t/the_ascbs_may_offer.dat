40|$|Twenty {{years ago}} I {{attended}} my first ASCB meeting as a newly minted assistant professor.

The latter offered a challenge: The award was inscribed “In recognition of her significant potential for scientific achievement. ” In one meeting <b>the</b> <b>ASCB</b> had both acknowledged my efforts to that point and created the expectation for me to do more.

The percentage of RPG applications submitted by women increased almost linearly throughout the entire period of the study and has approximately doubled since 1980 (Figure 1). The number of RPG awards to women has thus also increased dramatically (Table 1).

5000|$|Typically held {{within the}} first two weeks of December, <b>the</b> <b>ASCB's</b> annual meeting brings {{together}} scientists in the field of cell biology to highlight the latest research, techniques, products, and services, providing a venue for networking and career advice, offering research-tested educational approaches for high school teachers and professors who teach undergraduates, and to spur future discovery and collaboration. <b>The</b> <b>ASCB</b> also presents awards, poster sessions (where students, postdoctoral fellows, and independent scientists present their research and receive feedback), scientific sessions (symposia, minisymposia, working groups, workshops, translational sessions, special interest subgroups, award lectures, and [...] ). Science discussion tables offer opportunities to discuss scientific topics with expert scientists, and the career discussion roundtables offer a variety of career topic-themed tables addressed with expert facilitators.

Now, 54 years since its first meeting, a meeting is held once a year that brings together on average 9, 000 participants. In order to reach an even wider audience, the International Affairs Committee (IAC) collects information on scientific activities in various countries to disseminate through <b>the</b> <b>ASCB.</b> <b>The</b> purpose is to raise awareness, to increase communication, and to promote exchange of science and scientists around the globe. Why now? Although it may be relatively easy {{to learn about the}} universities and research institutes, and the research programs and funding agencies in a country such as the U. S., this is not always the case for a large number of countries, even though some of them have world-class centers of science and education. Many young, and not so young, scientists are perhaps unaware of the research activities and opportunities, as well as the simple fact that English is the lingua franca at many of the research centers around the globe. Many countries have built, and are building, highly sophisticated centers for education and research with the intent of attracting new blood. However, those outside of the respective countries are usually not aware of the new developments, the sources of funding, deadlines for applications, positions available, and the possibilities of obtaining funds for short- and long-term travel. Our aim is to serve as a platform for the exchange and exhibition of scientific developments in all countries. This year we report on 21 countries. The respective reports include the current status of the scientific communities and websites for accessing information on funding and travel related opportunities. We hope that this information will help and encourage young scientists in the scientific programs around the globe. We shall soon report all new developments on IAC’s websit...|$|R

Figure 2 B of this paper shows two Eppendorf tubes containing mouse feces that illustrate the unexpectedly normal functionality of the intestinal tract of knockout mice lacking brush border myosin (myosin- 1 a; Tyska et al., 2005).

5000|$|His {{greatest}} professional legacy, {{according to}} Harvard colleague Dan Goodenough, {{may have been}} his talent for identifying and recruiting young talent, including Susumu Ito, Betty Hay (who succeeded him as Chair of Anatomy at Harvard and later as President of <b>the</b> <b>ASCB),</b> and Jean-Paul Revel, also to become an ASCB president. Fawcett recruited dozens of postdoctoral fellows, many of whom also {{went on to become}} leaders of cell biology.

My University of California, Berkeley, colleague Jasper Rine brought this article to my attention when we served on a committee to over-haul our graduate curriculum.

This article came out in December 1995, while I was a postdoctoral fellow in Tim Mitchison’s lab at University of California, San Francisco, and shortly after I had discovered that kinesins could regulate microtubule dynamics. The review was extraordinarily helpful for me in that it provided a perspective that significantly clarified my thinking about {{the means by which}} microtubule dynamics could be harnessed to per-form work. More generally, the years of knowledge of Inoue and Salmon are evident as you read this article, as well as their deep and brilliant thoughts about the problems at hand. While this article is approaching 20 years of age, I still recommend it to my graduate students, and in fact I think it is time for me to read it yet again...|$|R
40|$|In {{celebration of}} MBoC’s first 20 years, {{members of the}} Editorial Board, members of <b>the</b> <b>ASCB</b> Council, and others comment on their {{favorite}} MBoC papers from the past two decades. This paper is a beautiful example of how studies in Drosophila melanogaster can reveal unexpected functions of conserved proteins in multicellular organisms. Drosophila spermatogenesis takes place within a syncytial cytoplasm. At the end of spermatogenesis, individualiza-tion complexes (ICs) containing F-actin traverse {{the length of the}} spermatid cysts, reorganizing membranes and removing material not re-quired in mature sperm. Previous experiments had implicated myosin VI in cellularization of the syncytial embryo. However, since mutations in the gene encoding myosin VI were unavailable, its in vivo functions were poorly understood. Hicks et al. (1999) isolated partial loss-of-function mutations in myosin VI and demonstrated that the incorporation of myosin VI at the leading edge of ICs is necessary to form the robust F-actin arrays required for proper IC movement and individualization. This laid the groundwork for subsequent studies (many i...|$|R
40|$|In {{celebration of}} MBoC’s first 20 years, {{members of the}} Editorial Board, members of <b>the</b> <b>ASCB</b> Council, and others comment on their {{favorite}} MBoC papers from the past two decades. Who {{would have thought that}} the motor domain of a motor was dispensable? Nonmuscle myosin II has long been implicated in provid-ing the contractile force to constrict the actomyosin ring during cytokinesis. So it was quite a shock to learn that myosin II could promote ring assembly and constriction (albeit a bit more slowly than wild-type) without its motor-domain “head ” in budding yeast! The key finding here was serendipitous and illustrates the importance of good controls: the intent was to investigate structure–function relationships among dif-ferent myosins, and the big surprise came from analysis of the “headless ” control (Lord et al., 2005). Subsequent work from other labs showed the myosin tail helps IQGAP to assemble the actin ring, and the force for ring constriction comes from inward squeezing by extracel...|$|R

After instantaneous {{elimination of}} cofilin activity by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI), the actin network of the lamellipodium immediately increased in size, with many individual filaments lengthening.

Following {{the identification of the}} Target of the immunosuppressant drug Rapamycin (TOR) in yeast and mTOR in mammals, this paper established clear connections between TOR and both protein synthesis and cellular proliferation (Barbet et al., 1996). The paper set the scene for studies on the TOR pathway by proposing that this pathway managed G 1 progression via the regulation of translation initiation of specific mRNAs. From a more personal perspective, this paper introduced me to the potential that polysome analysis held in terms of the level of information that could be gained from such a simple technique. I also remember reading the paper and being struck by how com-prehensive the story was; the authors outlined the basic mechanism of translational regulation and detailed the downstream consequences in terms of cellular physiology.
