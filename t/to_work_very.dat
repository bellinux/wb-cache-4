25|$|His early {{sketches}} gained him a {{place in}} the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin. He moved next to the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin. However, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, where several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the valet de chambre of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.|$|E

[...] He also said he would be [...] "taking a different approach" [...] with the score.

500|$|In his {{biography}} of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> hard for his employer in this period, and found {{little time for}} cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, {{and he seemed to}} be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but [...] "he never really recovered his form". In summarising Ranjitsinhji's life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: [...] "Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung's fictional character Raffles, the cricketing burglar." ...|$|E
500|$|Quantum of Solace {{was shot}} in six countries, {{including}} Italy (Talamone and Siena), Chile (the Paranal Observatory), Austria (Bregenz), Mexico, Panama and the UK. In the UK interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot, as well as ten stages at Pinewood and two theatres for ADR work. David Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for Quantum of Solace. He said that Forster likes <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> closely with his composers and that, {{in comparison to the}} accelerated schedule he was tied to on Casino Royale, the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to [...] "really work it out".

He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). Natural selection was expected <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could [...] "see no limit {{to the amount of}} change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection".

The actress said that {{that she did not}} lose any weight (as the media speculated), but worked out for a toned look in her films; she was also filming Fashion (2008) at the time. According to Chopra, [...] "For Fashion, I had to put on six kilos and later had to shed chip by chip as the character progressed in the film.

Dominik Moll is considered the head director, with the other directors being Hettie MacDonald, Thomas Vincent, Udayan Prasad and Philip Martin. The series' executive producers are Sky's Anne Mensah; Canal+'s Fabrice De La Patellière; Kudos' Jane Featherstone, Karen Wilson, Manda Levin and Ben Richards; Shine France's Nora Melhli; and Filmlance's Lars Blomgren. Ruth Kenley-Letts is the series producer.

Pauline's marriage to Joe {{was an attempt to}} give the character a [...] "new lease of life", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with EastEnders 21st anniversary. Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the [...] "Fowler" [...] surname. However, in July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she was leaving EastEnders; she quit due to [...] "creative differences" [...] with the show's producers regarding Pauline's remarriage, which she felt was [...] "disloyal" [...] to her character's beloved first husband, Arthur. According to an interview in The Sun, Richard commented, [...] "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong... I just couldn't believe that Pauline would remarry—anybody... I would have stayed a bit longer if Pauline hadn't got married." [...] Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opinions that Pauline and Joe [...] "looked good together" [...] and felt that she and Brooks had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>very</b> hard to turn them into a [...] "realistic-looking couple." ...|$|E
