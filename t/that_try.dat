It secured AV-TEST certification on October 2009, having demonstrated {{its ability to}} eliminate all widely encountered malware. However, it lost the certificate on October 2012, having shown a constant decline in protection and repair scores. In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. According to a March 2012 report by anti-malware specialist OPSWAT, MSE {{was the most popular}} AV product in North America and the second most popular in the world, which has resulted in the appearance of several rogue antivirus programs <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to impersonate it.|$|E

He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E

Apart from the defence or hunting value, venom might have value for bottom dwelling fish by killing the bacteria <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to invade their skin. Few of these venoms have been studied.

25|$|While {{there has}} been a {{tendency}} to focus on the bystander effect in disease due to the possibility of therapeutic avenues there is evidence that there is a more central role in normal development of tissues. Death of some cells and their surrounding matrix may be required for a tissue to reach its final configuration and gap junctions also appear essential to this process. There are also more complex studies <b>that</b> <b>try</b> and combine our understanding of the simultaneous roles of gap junctions in both wound healing and tissue development.|$|E
25|$|The mistaken {{identity}} hypothesis suggests that sexual cannibalism occurs when females fail to identify males <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to court. This hypothesis {{suggests that a}} cannibalistic female attacks and consumes the male without the knowledge of mate quality. In pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism, {{mistaken identity}} can be seen when a female does not allow the male to perform the courtship dance and engages in attack. There is no conclusive evidence for this hypothesis because scientists struggle to distinguish between mistaken identity and the other hypotheses (aggressive spillover, adaptive foraging, and mate choice).|$|E

Pups first enter the water at about four weeks and are weaned at about 12 months. This is normally when the mother gives birth to a new pup.

25|$|Magnetic Mirror One {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement {{is with the}} magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and Biconic cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit {{languages}} are a fairly closely linked set of languages {{which can be}} broken up using a number of different criteria. Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language: The dialect of Igloolik versus the dialect of Iqaluit, for example. However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit languages because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary. This makes any partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic. This article will use labels <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum. This scheme {{is not the only one}} used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.|$|E

[...] The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a well-camouflaged ambush predator. Its tongue bears a conspicuous pink extension that resembles a worm and can be wriggled around; fish <b>that</b> <b>try</b> to eat the [...] "worm" [...] are themselves eaten by the turtle. Similarly, some snakes employ caudal luring (using the tail) or lingual luring (using the tongue) to entice small vertebrates into striking range.|$|E
