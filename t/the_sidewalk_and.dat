Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) {{explains}} that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the bomb}} explosion, the entire South Oval was marked as off-limits with crime scene tape. Fans exited the stadium at the {{conclusion}} of the game without incident. The South Oval was open the next afternoon except for the immediate area of the explosion, so a broken glass door could be replaced and firefighters could finish spraying down the area with water to wash debris, chemicals and bodily fluids away from <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> a bus parked there before the preceding day's game.

25|$|On June 23, 2008, a bus loading {{passengers}} {{was struck}} by an out-of-control dump truck {{at the corner of}} Bowery and Canal Street in New York’s Chinatown. The force of the impact pushed the bus onto <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> into a bank. As the result of the accident, a sign attached to a light pole fell, injuring a 57-year-old woman; the woman later died {{as the result of a}} heart attack. Several people, including two police officers, were treated for minor injuries. State Department of Transportation inspectors found that the dump truck, owned by CPQ Freight Systems, had eight mechanical issues including faulty brakes which led to the accident.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} federal, county, and private {{hospitals}} suffered {{varying degrees of}} damage, with four major facilities in the San Fernando Valley experiencing structural damage, and two of those experiencing collapse. The Indian Hills Medical Center, Foothill Medical Building, and the Pacoima Lutheran Professional building were all heavily damaged, but nursing homes were also affected. One facility in particular, the one-story Foothill Nursing Home, sat very close to {{a section of the}} fault that broke the surface and was raised up three feet relative to the street. Scarps ran along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> across the property, but the building was not in use at the time, and remained standing. Though the reinforced concrete block structure was afflicted by the shock and uplift, the relatively good performance was {{in stark contrast to the}} Olive View and Veterans Hospital complexes.|$|E

500|$|Offerman and Mullally {{were allowed}} to improvise a great deal during filming. The episode {{features}} a montage of various clips showing how Ron and Tammy gradually go from fighting {{with each other to}} getting married {{over the course of a}} particularly wild night. Long sequences of footage were shot [...] including Ron and Tammy loudly arguing on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> the two making out atop a police car [...] but little more than a few seconds ultimately made the final episode. Offerman said it took about a half hour for the hair department to give him his cornrows haircut. He said he enjoyed the process, saying it [...] "felt like a stiff head massage".|$|E
500|$|From {{the top of}} the American Radiator Building to {{the ground}} in Bryant Park, a drop of 324 feet (98.75 m), Bomar {{completed}} a pass to Hinkey Haines for a record on November 12. Haines caught the ball on the fifth attempt. On Bomar's first attempt, the New York Times reported that the ball [...] "hit <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> burst" [...] and the third pass knocked Haines over. The stunt took place two days before a game with the Los Angeles Buccaneers. [...] "It was as much as anything a playful jab at Brick Muller" [...] (the Buccaneers' end), who caught a pass thrown from atop the Telephone Building—a drop of 320 feet (97.5 m)—in San Francisco the year before to advertise the first East-West Shrine Game.|$|E
500|$|Mayor Puusemp {{and the new}} Village Board also reorganized the Village Police force, {{appointing}} Richard F. Miniter Chief-of-Police {{and hiring}} a dozen part-time officers {{most of which were}} adult students at the Ulster County Community College’s Criminal Justice Program. [...] One of the tasks assigned Chief Miniter by the Village Board and Mayor Puusemp was the closing of Billy Guldy’s bar the Well. [...] It was a continual source of disruption late at night and <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> street outside the premises the site of numerous drug and assault arrests. [...] Billy Guldy also seemed to go {{out of his way to}} offend residents for example by having a lifesize caricature of the Virgin Mary painted on the premise’s front wall.

500|$|When Berlin was {{a divided}} city, the Berlin Wall ran along Bernauer Straße. [...] The street itself {{belonged to the}} French sector of West Berlin and the East German {{authorities}} declared that the windows and doors that led out onto Bernauer Straße should be bricked up. [...] In the early morning of 22 August 1961, Ida Siekmann {{was the first of}} 98 people to die while attempting to escape. [...] She was living on the fourth floor of number 48 (third floor, 3te Stock, by German standards), threw bedding and some possessions down onto the street, and jumped out of the window of her apartment. She fell on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> was severely injured, dying shortly afterwards {{on her way to the}} Lazarus Hospital. [...] On 8 March 1989, Winfried Freudenberg became the last person to die in an attempt to escape from East Germany to West Berlin across the Berlin Wall by falling from his balloon.|$|E
500|$|The two hotels, {{under one}} management, were renamed the Waldorf–Astoria. Situated on Fifth Avenue {{in what is}} now Midtown Manhattan, it was {{surrounded}} by streets on all sides. The Waldorf–Astoria had a frontage of [...] on Fifth Avenue, [...] on 33rd Street, [...] on 34th Street, and [...] on Astor Court, with 13 entrances opening directly from these thoroughfares. Below, extending to a depth [...] beneath <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> <b>and</b> occupying an additional area of [...] running toward Broadway, were the basements, which contained the engine room, laundries, kitchens, and even the Waldorf-Astoria Cigar Company.

The cost of the two buildings, exclusive of the furnishings but including the land, was about $15 million. The assessed value in 1897 was $12,125,000, making it the next most valuable parcel on Fifth Avenue, after the B. Altman and Company site. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, [...] "a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family".|$|E
500|$|Due to the United States' {{entry into}} World War I, some suffragists stopped their {{activism}} in 1917 {{because it might}} be seen as [...] "unpatriotic;" [...] Stevens, instead, insisted that it was [...] "arrogant of Wilson to fight for democracy abroad when women were not included in democracy at home." [...] In January after a delegation of NWP members had a disappointing meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, it was decided that they would protest at the White House every day, standing as Silent Sentinels until Wilson recognized the importance of their cause. The women maintained their post for over a year disregarding weather conditions and the threat of arrest. Though she performed other organizational tasks, such as organizing the North Carolina branch of the NWP in March, Stevens participated as a sentinel. She and fifteen other women were arrested for picketing at the White House on Bastille Day, in July 1917, charged with obstructing <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> <b>and</b> served three days of their 60-day sentence at Occoquan Workhouse before receiving a pardon from President Wilson. The women were placed within the prison population, given no toothbrushes, combs or toiletries and were surprised that they were required to share a water dipper {{with the rest of the}} prisoners.|$|E

The [...] "We the People: Marching in Resistance" [...] rally included groups such as: Oregon's Union Movement, Basic Rights Oregon, Unite Oregon, and the Northwest Oregon Labor Council. The event {{was held at}} Director Park and the groups had a permit to march. Don't Shoot Portland organized a demonstration {{in front of the}} Edith Green – Wendell Wyatt Federal Building, where a small group of protestors faced off with police. This second protest did not have a permit and consisted of a couple of hundred people. The police were in riot gear and pushed the crowd out of the street. Thirteen demonstrators were arrested for blocking traffic. One protester was tackled by the police and then shot with non-lethal projectiles. One man who was reportedly [...] "one step off the curb" [...] in the street was pushed to the ground by police, had his arms pinned to his back, and was then pepper-sprayed in the face; and a woman was shoved to <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> then shot by police with [...] "pepper balls". A 66-year-old woman was also tackled and hurt by the police when she attempted to shield her 72-year-old friend from being pushed.

The adults were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct in the second degree, with one man also being charged with resisting arrest and giving false information to the police.|$|E
500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Peter discovers that his past actions have had drastic effects on the world: he and Molly {{have been married for}} 20 years; Judd Nelson crashes at their house once or twice a week; Lois is married to Quagmire; Al Gore is now the President of the United States; Chris, Meg, and Stewie have Quagmire's chin, nose, and mannerisms; and Chevy Chase is the host of The Tonight Show. Brian {{explains}} to Peter that by missing out on his date with Lois and making out with Molly, he altered the time line. Despite Brian's objections about leaving the [...] "perfect" [...] world (in which there are flying cars that run on vegetable oil and Gore has killed Osama bin Laden by strangling him with his bare hands), Peter wants {{to go back to the}} past so he can undo his mistake. Brian says that this is impossible because Death can only be summoned if someone dies and thanks to Gore's universal health care, people are living much longer along with a strong, well-funded educational system and zero tolerance gun control that has eliminated street crime. However, when Jane Jetson suddenly falls on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> dies, Death arrives and again grants Peter's wish to return to the past. Back in the past, Peter is determined to accept Lois' invitation but repeatedly blows his opportunity and ends up repeatedly asking Death for a do-over. When Peter finally gets it right, he forgets a few hours later and parties with Cleveland instead of keeping the date. He asks Death for another chance but Death, fed up with Peter's continued blunders, tells him that he will have to fix the problem on his own.|$|E
500|$|Leterrier {{had planned}} to use {{prosthetic}} makeup and animatronics to complement the computer-generated imagery that was solely used in the previous film. The make-up artists who worked on [...] were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation, which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky [...] "not [...] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, {{and we talked about}} how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> he's tripping. [...] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [...]" [...] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3) was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic. An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however. Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.|$|E

The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note.
