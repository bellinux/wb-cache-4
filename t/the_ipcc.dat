5|$|Nick Hardwick, {{chair of}} <b>the</b> <b>IPCC,</b> said on 9 April {{that there were}} no CCTV cameras in the area. On 14 April the Evening Standard wrote that it had found at least six CCTV cameras in the area around the assault. After {{photographs}} of the cameras were published, <b>the</b> <b>IPCC</b> reversed its position and said its investigators were looking at footage from cameras in Threadneedle Street near the corner of Royal Exchange Passage.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of <b>the</b> <b>IPCC,</b> said <b>the</b> <b>IPCC</b> had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because {{it would have been better}} had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E

5|$|Harwood said {{he first}} {{realized}} on 8 April, {{when he saw}} the Guardian video, that Tomlinson had died. He reportedly collapsed at home and had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. Harwood and three colleagues made themselves known to <b>the</b> <b>IPCC</b> that day.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011 <b>the</b> <b>IPCC</b> {{released}} three reports into Tomlinson's death, written between April 2010 and May 2011. The main report contained material revealed {{during the}} inquest. The third report detailed an allegation from Tomlinson's family {{that the police}} had offered misleading information to the pathologists before the third autopsy on 22 April 2009. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, had told the pathologists that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence to support this. <b>The</b> <b>IPCC</b> ruled that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead the pathologists.|$|E
5|$|The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) {{began to}} operate in 2004; its chair when Tomlinson died was Nick Hardwick. Created by the Police Reform Act 2002, the {{commission}} replaced the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) following public dissatisfaction with the latter's relationship with the police. Unlike the PCA, <b>the</b> <b>IPCC</b> operates independently of the Home Office, which regulates the police.|$|E

5|$|Tomlinson's death {{sparked a}} debate in the UK about the {{relationship}} between the police, media and public, and the independence of <b>the</b> <b>IPCC.</b> In response to the concerns, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Denis O'Connor, published a 150-page report in November 2009 that aimed to restore Britain's consent-based model of policing.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April The Observer (the Guardians sister paper) {{published}} the first photograph of Tomlinson {{lying on the}} ground next to riot police. Over the next few days <b>the</b> <b>IPCC</b> told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not surprised that he had had a heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of wind power {{when compared to the}} {{environmental impact}}s of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to <b>the</b> <b>IPCC,</b> in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources, wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 (geq/kWh) depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed. Compared with other low carbon power sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated.|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} investigates how <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s</b> Working Groups safeguard their scientific character while communicating with policymakers. Due {{to the different}} nature of Working Groups’ assessments, all Working Groups make different boundary arrangements of how science is defined; what is considered as relevant knowledge; and what {{the division of labor}} is amongst Working Groups. The results show that science is a context-specific activity in a constantly changing landscape, which in turn affects <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s</b> credibility if they keep advocating that their science is policy-neutral and never policy-prescriptive...|$|R
40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{issued its}} Third Assessment Report in July 2001. When President Bush {{announced}} the U. S. would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, he {{also asked the}} U. S. National Academy of Science (NAS) to assess <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s</b> climate science analysis and conclusions – the domain of <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s</b> Working Group I. The NAS supported <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s</b> climate science, laying to rest most doubts about predictions that the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is likely to generate changes in the world’s climate in the 21 st century. However, no assessment {{was made of the}} report of <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s</b> Working Group III, charged with assessing the scope for and impact of policies to mitigate greenhouse gases. While the report of WG III contains a large amount of useful information, it makes some claims that require scrutiny. This paper focuses on the validity of the claim made by WG III that “Known technological options could achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO 2 stabilization levels, such as 550 ppmv, 450 ppmv or below ” without requiring “drastic technological breakthroughs. ” This claim is made {{despite the fact that it}} will take a 17 to 20 fold increase in carbon-free power to achieve stabilization at 550 ppmv b...|$|R

5|$|The first Guardian {{video was}} shot on {{a digital camera}} by an {{investment}} fund manager from New York who was in London on business, and who attended the protests out of curiosity. On his way to Heathrow airport, {{he realized that the}} man he had filmed being assaulted was the man who had reportedly died of a heart attack. At that point, 2 am on 7 April, he passed his footage to The Guardian, which published it on its website that afternoon. The newspaper passed a copy to <b>the</b> <b>IPCC,</b> which opened a criminal inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Albert Arnold Gore Jr. (born March 31, 1948) is an American {{politician}} and environmentalist {{who served as}} the 45th Vice President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Gore was Bill Clinton's running mate in their successful campaign in 1992, and the pair were re-elected in 1996. Near the end of President Clinton's second term, Gore was selected as the Democratic nominee for the 2000 presidential election but did not win the election. After his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and environmental activist, whose work in climate change activism earned him (jointly with <b>the</b> <b>IPCC)</b> the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. <b>The</b> <b>IPCC</b> ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E

Throughout, {{the focus is on}} the implications of its findings for policy, without being prescriptive about the particular policies that governments and other important participants in the policy process should adopt. In light of <b>the</b> <b>IPCC's</b> mandate, authors in WGIII were guided by several principles when assembling this assessment: (1) to be explicit about mitigation options, (2) to be explicit about their costs and about their risks and opportunities vis-a-vis other development priorities, (3) and to be explicit about the underlying criteria, concepts, and methods for evaluating alternative policies.

5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why <b>the</b> <b>IPCC</b> were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. <b>The</b> <b>IPCC</b> sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
25|$|On 16 August 2005, British {{television}} network ITV {{released a report}} said {{to be based on}} leaked documents from <b>the</b> <b>IPCC</b> investigation which conflicted with previous statements by police chief Sir Ian Blair.

40|$|There is {{significant}} potential in young talent for enhancing {{the credibility of}} the scientific assessments such as <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s</b> by contributing to quality assurance and quality control. In this essay, we reflect on an experiment that was done by the Dutch government as part of its government review of a contribution to <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s</b> Fifth Assessment Report (AR 5). In an effort to review the entire Working Group II contribution to the AR 5 within the official review period for the Second Order Draft (SOD), the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency turned to PhD students. This article shows that a systematic review focusing on transparency and errors of a large scientific assessment document using young talented scientists can be successful if certain conditions are met. The reviewers need to have intrinsic motivation to conduct the review. There needs to be a communication plan that fosters engagement and a clear methodology to guide the reviewers through their task. Based on this experiment in review, we reflect on the wider potential for openness and crowdsourcing in scientific assessment processes such as <b>the</b> <b>IPCC’s...</b>|$|R
