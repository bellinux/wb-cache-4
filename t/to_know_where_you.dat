500|$|Sylvia and Adela, meanwhile, did {{not share}} their mother's enthusiasm for the war. As {{committed}} pacifists, they rejected the WSPU's support for the government. Sylvia's socialist perspective convinced her {{that the war was}} another example of capitalist oligarchs exploiting poor soldiers and workers. Adela, meanwhile, spoke against the war in Australia and made public her opposition to conscription. In a short letter, Emmeline told Sylvia: [...] "I am ashamed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> and Adela stand." [...] She had a similar impatience for dissent within the WSPU; when long-time member Mary Leigh asked a question during a meeting in October 1915, Pankhurst replied: [...] "hat woman is a pro German and should leave the hall.... I denounce you as a pro German and wish to forget that such a person ever existed." [...] Some WSPU members were outraged by this sudden rigid devotion to the government, the leadership's perceived abandonment of efforts to win the vote for women, and questions about how funds collected on behalf of suffrage were being managed with regard to the organisation's new focus. Two groups split from the WSPU: The Suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union (SWSPU) and the Independent Women's Social and Political Union (IWSPU), each dedicated to maintaining pressure toward women's suffrage.|$|E
2500|$|A United Press {{correspondent}} described Robinson's {{speech as}} [...] "the most unrestrained language that ever has been {{heard in the}} Senate." [...] La Follette sat motionless in his chair, even when Robinson began shaking his fist at him. Near the conclusion of his speech, Robinson violated the custom of the Senate and addressed his colleague directly, pointing at La Follette and shouting, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> stand." [...] La Follette {{was not allowed to}} take the floor to refute the other Senators before adjournment, though Senator Fall allowed him a brief statement, whereupon he announced he was prepared to substantiate everything he said in St. Paul and desired the chance to rebut the charges being made against him by his fellow senators. Throughout the remainder of his term in the Senate, his opponents used procedural maneuvers to ensure he never was allowed to address charges of disloyalty again.|$|E
