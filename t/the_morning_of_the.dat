5|$|During {{the night}} of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters moved down from the {{mountains}} and waited in hidden locations around the city; they were assisted by RPF sympathisers residing in the area.

The Rwandan forces in the area were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion, although the Rwandan police and army did succeed {{for a while in}} repelling the invasion in some areas, killing a number of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the FAR forces were assisted by French troops, as the French government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, however, the defending forces were defeated, and the RPF held the whole of the city.|$|E
