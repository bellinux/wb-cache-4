5|$|During the 1870s ice {{began to}} be used by Timothy Eastman, of the Bell Brothers firm, to {{transport}} American meat to Britain; the first shipment successfully arrived in 1875 and by the following year 9,888 tons (8,909,000kg) of meat was shipped. The chilled meat was retailed through special warehouses and stores. There was concern in Britain that chilled American meat might flood the market and harm domestic farmers, but the exports continued. The rival Chicago-based meat firms of Armour and Swift entered the refrigerated meat <b>transport</b> <b>market</b> in the late 1870, establishing their own fleet of refrigerator cars, network of icing stations and other infrastructure, increasing the sales of chilled Chicago beef to the eastern seaboard from 15,680 tons (14,128,000kg) a year in 1880, to 173,067 tons (155,933,000kg) in 1884.|$|E
5|$|The railway past Værnes {{opened on}} 27 October 1902 as the Hell–Sunnan Line—today {{part of the}} Nordland Line. The plans for a railway station in the {{terminal}} of Værnes were launched in 1990, along with the {{plans to build a}} second terminal at the airport. Construction of the new terminal started on 1 October 1992. On 15 March 1993, NSB announced that they would start a commuter train service between Steinkjer and Melhus, south of Trondheim. The service would give a half-hour headway during peak hours between Stjørdal and Melhus, and a one-hour headway onwards to Steinkjer. NSB stated that the concept was based on the success of the Jæren Commuter Rail and that they hoped to have a 70% increase in ridership, in part due to the opening of the airport station. The concept would also take advantage of expansion of Trondheim Central Station that would co-locate the main coach- and train terminals in Trondheim. The service would also give direct services along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and the Røros Line to Tynset. Estimates were that the railway would capture a 10% ground <b>transport</b> <b>market</b> share. The commuter rail service started on 1 September 1993.|$|E

40|$|The past {{emphasis}} in this conference series {{has been on}} the best ways to deregulate regulated public <b>transport</b> <b>markets.</b> This workshop reverses this process by examining the best ways to regulate deregulated public <b>transport</b> <b>markets.</b> A hierarchy of regulatory needs is identified and three hybrid models examined, based loosely on experience from Great Britain, New Zealand and Sweden. It is argued that deregulated public <b>transport</b> <b>markets</b> are a global phenomenon but regulatory measures should reflect local requirements. The resultant process of glocalisation might result in regulatory measures that focus on the rules of law and their enforcement in emerging public <b>transport</b> <b>markets</b> (such as urban transport in Sub Saharan Africa and for the soon to be competitive inter urban market in Germany) but that focus on guidance for network integration and incentivisation for welfare maximisation in more mature public <b>transport</b> <b>markets</b> (as in Great Britain, New Zealand and Sweden) ...|$|R

40|$|Last {{year the}} Commission on Reducing Counterproductive Market Regulations (Deregulation Commission), {{appointed}} by the German Federal Government in 1987, put forth its first report dealing with regulations on German <b>transport</b> and insurance <b>markets.</b> Following a consequent market-oriented approach, the commission arrives at {{the conclusion that the}} traditional position, i. e. contending that competitive mechanisms would not be feasible for govering supply and demand in <b>transport</b> <b>markets,</b> is highly questionable. Though the deregulation proposals, derived from a thorough economic analysis of the <b>transport</b> <b>markets,</b> may seem radical from such a traditional point of view - even the railway System could nearly entirely be deregulated - the commission's argumentation is convincing and consistent. Its arguments are backed up by evidence from foreign countries' successful experience with deregulating <b>transport</b> <b>markets.</b> Another strong point of the report lies in its combining rigorous economic analysis with practical considerations...|$|R

25|$|On 12 January 1990, the {{operations}} of government-owned Air France, semi-public Air Inter and wholly private Union de Transports Aériens (UTA) were merged into an enlarged Air France. Air France's acquisition of UTA and Air Inter {{was part of an}} early 1990s government plan to create a unified, national air carrier with the economies of scale and global reach to counter potential threats from the liberalisation of the EU's internal air <b>transport</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} days when {{liberalisation}} of the EU/EEA internal air <b>transport</b> <b>market</b> was still in progress and when domestic traffic rights were reserved for each member country's own airlines. The German government therefore insisted that all non-German EU/EEA carriers either withdraw their internal German scheduled services from Berlin or transfer them to majority German-owned subsidiaries {{by the end of}} 1992. It also wanted the bulk of all charter flights from Berlin to be operated by German airlines. These measures were squarely aimed at UK carriers with a major presence in the internal German air <b>transport</b> <b>market</b> from Berlin as well as the city's charter market, specifically British Airways and Dan-Air. Lufthansa and other German airlines reportedly lobbied their government to curtail British Airways's and Dan-Air's activities in Berlin, arguing that German airlines enjoyed no equivalent rights in the UK. This resulted in British Airways taking a 49% stake in Friedrichshafen-based German regional airline Delta Air, renaming it Deutsche BA (DBA) and transferring its internal German traffic rights to the new airline. BA also replaced the commuter aircraft DBA had inherited from Delta Air with new Boeing 737-300s. These in turn replaced the Boeing 737-200 Adv and BAe ATP airliners British Airways had used on its internal German scheduled services from Berlin.|$|E

At the same time, it was decided that a high-speed railway was to be built to Gardermoen, so the airport would have a 50% public <b>transport</b> <b>market</b> share.|$|E

However, despite the considerable increase in railway journeys since the mid-1990s, rail transport's share of the total <b>transport</b> <b>market</b> remains below that of the early 1960s, with road overwhelmingly the dominant mode: rail's market share was 13% in 1961, 6% in 1991 and 2001 and 10% in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Lufthansa resumed {{flights to}} Berlin on 28 October 1990, {{initially}} operating twelve daily pairs of flights {{on a limited}} number of routes, including Tegel–Cologne, Tegel–Frankfurt and Tegel–London Gatwick. To facilitate the German flag carrier's resumption of services from/to Berlin, it purchased Pan Am's Internal German Services (IGS) division for US$150 million. This included Pan Am's internal German traffic rights as well as its gates and slots at Tegel. This agreement, under which Lufthansa contracted up to seven of Pan Am's Tegel-based Boeing 727-200s operated by that airline's flightdeck and cabin crews to ply its scheduled routes to Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart until mid-1991, also facilitated Pan Am's orderly exit from the internal German air <b>transport</b> <b>market</b> after 40 years' uninterrupted service as European Union (EU) legislation prevented it from participating in the internal air <b>transport</b> <b>market</b> of the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) as a non-EU/EEA headquartered carrier. However, Pan Am continued operating its daily non-stop Tegel–JFK service until Delta Air Lines assumed most of Pan Am's transatlantic scheduled services during 1991. Pan Am Express, which was not included in Pan Am's IGS sale to Lufthansa, continued operating all of its domestic and international regional scheduled routes from Tegel as an independent legal entity until its acquisition by TWA in 1991. Following TWA's takeover of Pan Am Express, the former Pan Am Express Berlin operations were closed. Until December 1994, Lufthansa also contracted Euroberlin to operate some of its internal German flights from its new Tegel base, making use of that airline's gates and slots at Tegel as well.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{highlight}} the importance of modern telecommunications networks in combined <b>transport</b> <b>marketing</b> channels deployed for intermodal terminals. To develop a customer-based and broadly applicable framework for studying combined freight transport in Europe, {{the use of the}} marketing channel theory is advocated. The central research question addressed in this paper is: which opportunities do telecommunications networks offer to intermodal freight terminals in order to function more efficiently in combined <b>transport</b> <b>marketing</b> channels? After a description of the information sector and telecommunications networks, recent developments in these booming sectors are pinpointed and the opportunities offered to intermodal freight terminals and combined transport are mapped out. The central focus is on intermodal freight terminals in combined <b>transport</b> <b>marketing</b> channels in which different types of flows are employed (e. g. payment, ordering, promotion, etc.). All these marketing channel flows are, in principle, customer-driven and require a lot of tailor-made information and, thus, also the use of proper telecommunications networks. This paper describes the changing scene of intermodal freight terminals with a particular view to the opportunities-service change, service development, market development, diversification-for intermodal freight terminals to improve their competitive position by using the information and communication technology sector. The main message is that there are numerous opportunities for intermodal freight terminals to function more efficiently...|$|R
