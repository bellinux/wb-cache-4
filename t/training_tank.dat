5|$|Design of the PanzerI {{began in}} 1932 and mass {{production}} began in 1934. Intended {{only as a}} <b>training</b> <b>tank</b> to introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army, the PanzerI saw combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War, and in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Experiences with the PanzerI during the Spanish Civil War helped shape the German Panzerwaffes' invasion of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940. By 1941, the PanzerI chassis design {{was used as the}} basis of tank destroyers and assault guns. There were attempts to upgrade the PanzerI throughout its service history, including by foreign nations, to extend the design's lifespan. It continued to serve in the Spanish Armed Forces until 1954.|$|E

2500|$|The 1968 {{buildings}} {{include a}} 25m, 6 lane {{swimming pool and}} dining hall shared with St Paul's Juniors. Extensive sports facilities notably include a fencing salle, six rugby fives courts, three squash courts and a Racquets court. [...] The location next to the River Thames meant that a rowing boathouse {{was included in the}} plans, which itself included both an indoor <b>training</b> <b>tank</b> and housing to accommodate a boatman, whose primary job was to build and maintain the boats. A striking and deliberate omission from the new buildings was any provision for a school hall capable of holding all masters and boys simultaneously, and although the main sports hall is large enough to accommodate the entire school, the difficulty in setting up enough chairs means that the hall is used to house the entire school only twice per year. There were originally two boarding houses in the 1968 buildings (School House and High House) accommodating up to 120 boarders, but the number of boarders has steadily declined since then and is now only 20. One of the boarding houses (School House) has been demolished {{to make way for a}} new music building, which houses the Wathen Hall. The other (High House, renamed School House) is in the process of being demolished, with boarders relocated to the recently renovated Colet House. The only building which remained from the previous Water Board landowners became the music department for St Paul's Juniors.|$|E
