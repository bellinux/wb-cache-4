50|$|This unique tank boasted {{increased}} cross-country capability. It featured four-track {{running gear}} mounted on two longitudinal, rectangular hollow beams, which {{were also used}} as fuel tanks. The tank suspension was hydro-pneumatic with complex hydrotransformer and three-speed planetary gearbox. The track adjuster was worm-type. The specific ground pressure of this heavy vehicle did not exceed 0.6 kg/cm2. The <b>track</b> <b>chain,</b> running practically along the whole track length provided for increased cross-country capabilities on swampy terrain, soft soils and area full of cut trees, Czech hedgehogs, antitank obstacles and the like.|$|E
5000|$|T-44M (1961) - T-44A {{modernization}} {{incorporating a}} drive train upgraded to match the one used in T-54 including the V-54 12-cylinder 38.88 liter water-cooled diesel engine developing 523 hp (390 kW), gearbox, tracks, 'starfish' road wheels and a conventional toothed drive sprocket, flush with the outer track edge. It had an increased ammunition stowage (from 58 rounds to 61 rounds), new R-113 and R-120 radio sets, a heater and infra-red night sight, TVN-2 night vision device for the driver as well as another fuel tank which increased the fuel capacity by 150 liters to 650 liters and 800 liters with additional fuel tanks. The maximal road operational range of the tank increased to 420 km - 440 km. The original fenders were replaced with T-54-style ones. The catwalk stowage was changed to the flat T-54 rectangular external fuel tanks with embossed circle and cross. Hence the T-44M had a different arrangement of additional fuel tanks and stowage boxes. There were four rectangular external fuel tanks {{as well as two}} smaller ones on the right fender and fastenings for four spare <b>track</b> <b>chain</b> links, one rectangular external fuel tank as well as two smaller ones and one stowage box. The tank received a mount for an antiaircraft machine gun. A T-54-style headlight cluster with two headlights was added to right hand side of the glacis plate and the T-34-style headlight on the left hand side of the hull was removed.|$|E

It is {{fitted with a}} BDD appliqué armour package, an additional belly armour plate for anti-mine protection, 10 mm thick reinforced rubber side skirts and 10 mm thick anti-neutron liner. The BDD appliqué armour package was specially designed to defeat shaped charges (for example RPGs) and consists of an appliqué plate on the glacis and two horseshoe shaped blocks fitted {{to the front of}} the turret. The handrails around the turret have been removed to make space for the bra appliqué armour. Fastenings for four spare <b>track</b> <b>chain</b> links have been added on the side of the turret. The tank is fitted with RhKM tracks from the T-72 main battle tank and two additional shock absorbers on the first pair of roadwheels. The [...] "Volna" [...] fire control system was improved by fitting the KTD-2 (or KTD-1) laser rangefinder in an armoured box over the main armament.

However, it cannot be used for both functions simultaneously) which allows the tank to fire 9M117 Bastion ATGMs through its gun tube. The tank was fitted with a gun thermal sleeve, new radios, the R-173 radio set instead of R-123M and a new V-55U diesel engine developing 620 hp (462 kW). The ammunition load was increased by two rounds. Some are fitted with two clusters of four smoke grenade launchers each on the right rear of the turret. The US intelligence saw T-62M main battle tanks for the first time during the Soviet war in Afghanistan and they gave it the designation T-62E. There are a number of sub-variants of the T-62M, depending on how much of the modernization package the vehicle has installed.|$|E

The structure of the tracked mobile system includes sprocket constructed by the wheel motor, closed <b>track</b> <b>chain</b> which is meshing with the sprocket and the idler, track shoes and high intensity pins.

40|$|Abstract: In this investigation, a {{computational}} {{finite element}} procedure for the deformation and stress {{analysis of the}} chain links of tracked vehicles is presented and {{used to examine the}} validity of using the static approach in the design and stress analysis of tracked vehicles. The contact forces resulting from the interaction between the track links and the vehicle components (sprocket, idler, and the rollers) as well as the interaction between the track links and the ground are evaluated using continuous force models, which are used to define generalized contact forces associated with the deformation degrees of freedom of the track links using the virtual work. The dynamic forces including the contact forces used in the finite element procedure developed in this investigation are evaluated using a 54 -body vehicle model in which the track is modeled as a closed kinematic chain with 42 degrees of freedom. It is demonstrated in this study that the effect of the contact forces is more significant as compared to the effect of the rigid-body inertia forces of the chain links, and consequently, it is assumed that the deformation of the track links does not {{have a significant effect on}} the overall motion of the vehicle. In the finite element computational procedure used in this study, three-dimensional solid elements are used to discretize the links of the <b>track</b> <b>chain.</b> The numerical results presented in this investigation demonstrate that the use of the static analysis may lead to low estimates of the stresses of the track links as compared to those obtained by a dynamic stress analysis that takes into consideration the time history of the forces...|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two common}} widths of single speed and fixed gear bicycle chains: [...] inch and [...] inch. The chainring, {{sprocket}} and chain {{should all be}} the same width.

40|$|Abstract—Stateful {{third-party}} {{web tracking}} has drawn {{the attention of}} public media given its popularity among top Alexa web sites. A tracking server can associate a unique identifier from the client side with the private information contained in the referer header of the request to the tracking server, thus recording the client’s behavior. Faced with the significant problem, existing works either disable setting tracking identifiers or blacklist third-party requests to certain servers. However, neither of them can completely block stateful web tracking. In this paper, we propose TrackingFree, the first anti-tracking browser by mitigating unique identifiers. Instead of disabling those unique identifiers, we isolate them into different browser principals so that the identifiers still exist but are not unique among different web sites. By doing this, we fundamentally cut off the <b>tracking</b> <b>chain</b> for third-party web tracking. Our evaluation shows that TrackingFree can invalidate all the 647 trackers found in Alexa Top 500 web sites, and we formally verified that in TrackingFree browser, a single tracker can at most correlate user’s activities on three web sites by Alloy.

5000|$|The core {{function}} of LIMS {{has traditionally been}} the management of samples.

The registration process may involve accessioning the sample and producing barcodes to affix to the sample container. Various other parameters such as clinical or phenotypic information corresponding with the sample are also often recorded. The LIMS then <b>tracks</b> <b>chain</b> of custody as well as sample location. Location tracking usually involves assigning the sample to a particular freezer location, often down to the granular level of shelf, rack, box, row, and column.
