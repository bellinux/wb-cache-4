60|$|The {{proceedings}} speedily {{settled down}} into the most wearisome drone that was ever heard {{in a court of}} law. The object of the accusers was to show the complicity of the accused with crime by tracing crime to the league, and making every member of the league constructively liable for every act of which the league was constructively guilty. Witnesses were produced in a series that seemed interminable, {{to tell the story of}} five-and-twenty outrages in Mayo, of as many in Cork, of forty-two in Galway, of sixty-five in Kerry, one after another, and all with immeasurable detail. Some of the witnesses spoke no English, and the English of others was hardly more intelligible than Erse. Long extracts were read out from four hundred and forty speeches. The counsel on one side produced a passage that made against the speaker, and then the counsel on the other side found and read some qualifying passage that made as strongly for him. The three judges groaned. They had already, they said plaintively, ploughed through the speeches in the solitude of their own rooms. Could they not be <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>read?</b> No, said the prosecuting counsel; we are building up an argument, and it cannot be built up in a silent manner. In truth it was designed for the public outside the court,(254) and not a touch could be spared that might deepen the odium. Week after week the ugly tale went on—a squalid ogre let loose among a population demoralised by ages of wicked neglect, misery, and oppression. One side strove to show that the ogre had been wantonly raised by the land league for political objects of their own; the other, that it was the progeny of distress and wrong, that the league had rather controlled than kindled its ferocity, and that crime and outrage were due to local animosities for which neither league nor parliamentary leaders were answerable.|$|E

An urgent need is signaled for governments to provide substantive reasoning for their policy choices.

40|$|In many {{publications}} and conferences on the subject, {{it is not}} unusual to hear the interior described as a slippery subject (Hollis 2007 : Edwards 2011 : Rogers 2012).

40|$|Abstract This {{paper will}} explore {{some of the}} {{tensions}} and contradictions in being labelled ‘black ’ and ‘British ’ within the United Kingdom, set against the discourses about the historic development of British and other identities as well as strands of post-modern thinking. It will relate these tensions and contradictions to emerging practice in citizenship and history curricula in England at Key Stage 3 level. ‘The English ’ by Jeremy Paxman (1998) has been a recent best seller in British bookshops. Paxman quotes the late, black, labour MP Bernie Grant as saying that he would rather be introduced as ‘Black British ’ than English. This hybrid label ‘Black British ’ is appropriate ‘because it includes other oppressed people like the Welsh or the Scots. It would stick in my throat to call myself English. ’ His statement deserves closer examination. Grant appears {{to imply that the}} ‘English’, ‘Welsh ’ and ‘Scots ’ are ‘peoples ’ while the ‘British ’ are not, {{at least not in the}} same way. A particular view of the past is also <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>read.</b> The ‘English ’ are cast as historic oppressors while the term ‘British ’ becomes a more neutral label to which the term ‘black ’ can be safely linked. Grant sees himself as belonging to a dual identity, ‘black’, by implicatio...|$|E

Electricity {{is said to}} fail infrequently, corruption is rare, theft and crime almost unheard of, reflecting, Kaplan claims, “a surprisingly functional social order” Eritrea {{is said to have}} “achieved a degree of non-coercive social discipline” by implication, unusual for Africa. The country’s political culture is described as “an almost Maoist degree of mobilization and an almost Albanian degree of xenophobia. ” In this account, Eritrea is an exotic specimen, not quite African, atypical in almost all respects. But is Eritrea accurately reflected or understood in this account? Is Eritrea really as isolated and marginal as this suggests? Is its development agenda and state-building project that divergent from elsewhere? Kaplan hints that Eritrea’s sense of nationhood — “rare in a world of nation-states rent by tribalism and globalisation” — exists despite globalisation. But this is in complete contrast to current research which emphasizes that “transnationalism does not necessarily operate in opposition to nationalism but can at times work to reinforce it”. In contrast, Kaplan’s article <b>takes</b> <b>as</b> <b>read</b> the official account of Eritrean nationalism, emphasizing that it is a product not simply of its history, but also of its having been isolated and alienated from international and regional influences: “we Eritreans are different from our neighbours”...|$|R

40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} barriers to further roofwater harvesting at the household level are high cost and inadequate service. Systems are too expensive for householders to afford them or, if the capacity is reduced to an affordable level, {{it is seen as}} too small to provide adequate service. As the cost of a rainwater harvesting system is a function of its capacity, these two problems are heavily interrelated. For some years there has been in existence a “sanitation ladder”, a catalogue of designs of varying quality from which a project manager, a community or individual can select an appropriate well designed sanitation system to suit local conditions and the available funds. Such “ranges ” are the norm in consumer products and usually form the basis for consumer choice. Rainwater harvesting systems are very amenable to this product-range approach, as no account of local geology and topography need be taken: the water simply falls from the sky. They are however, slightly more complex than sanitation systems as there are, in effect two ladders, one for service provision – mainly a function of system size and one for quality of construction. It is in fact this quality aspect that is predominant in the sanitation ladder whereas roofwater harvesting systems are dominated by the question of size with a certain quality <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>read.</b> Systems of different sizes and qualities can be clearly presented alongside forecasts of the service they will provide and a community can decide on the solution that is best for them.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to find out}} about the nature of science views held by British Muslim science {{teachers}} teaching in Muslim secondary schools, and whether or not these views have any impact on how they teach the National Curriculum. In the course of the study the views of a sample of non-Muslim science teachers and Muslim teachers teaching in state schools were elicited. The instrument used was the philosophy of science questionnaire based on systemic networks developed by Koulaidis and Ogborn (1989). The results were processed on the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) database, and followed by interview with a sample of Muslim science teachers and classroom observations of some selected lessons. The central finding was that the differences between Muslim teachers (in my sample) in their perceptions of science were not sufficiently clear to merit categorisation in an absolute sense. Predominantly, teachers (both Muslims and non-Muslims in my sample) tended to hold eclectic or mixed views about the nature of science, adhering to a diversity of elements taken from different philosophical positions. For Muslim science teachers teaching in Muslim schools, the teaching of science was driven by the principle of glorifying the Creator. In one sense, the science was <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>read,</b> in that the focus of science teachers was not to explore how scientific knowledge was gained or to question its validity, but to display the authority of the Quran and its predictive power.

40|$|Extending the author’s {{recent work}} (2007) this paper {{advances}} the argument that, in significant ways, designers construct {{the problems they}} seek to solve. While it is generally <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>read</b> that design problems are presented to designers by external agencies (clients) and with specific requirements (the brief), conventional understanding assumes that it is this problem that the designer ‘solves’, and that differences between solutions may be accounted for {{on the basis of}} differences in the skills/creativity of individual designers and/or of the plurality of different ‘satisficing’ solutions that design problems allow. While acknowledging both of these assertions this paper argues that it is not this ‘problem-as-given ’ that the designer ‘solves ’ but rather a substantially revised and personalized problem, the ‘problem-as-design-goal’, that both subsumes the original problem and imposes upon it a range of designer preferences, prejudices and expectations. Hence, starting from the same brief, different designers will necessarily produce different outcomes not merely on the basis of differential skill sets but because, in substantial ways, they are solving different problems. The paper briefly explores four key issues arising from this personal projection of self onto problem: (i) how such problematization not only determines the nature and suitability of the ‘new ’ problem but also informs and significantly constrains the nature of acceptable solutions and the criteria for such acceptability; (ii) hence how, contra the received view that problem definition and analysis precede solution attempts, problems and solutions are co-extensive and mutually informative; (iii) how such personal projection is often intuitive and unconscious, hence the role of education in revealing ideology, belief structures and theory commitment in designers; and (iv) how the designer’s vision is connected to and reconciled with the client’s vision and requirements...|$|E
40|$|According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, {{the tourist}} {{industry}} is providing one in nine jobs and eighty per cent of travellers come from just twenty countries. In other words, {{in a changing}} global economy, tourism {{is a matter of}} economic imperative for the Majority World, and privileged mobility for the Minority. The economic dependency of the Eastern Caribbean on tourism has been well- documented (Ferguson 1997, Lea 1998, Patullo 1996). A large element of its attractiveness depends on its connotations of paradise in the Minority World, and therefore it is an economic necessity that paradise is continually simulatable. The widespread development of all-inclusive resorts, or what Bauman has termed ‘reservation-style experiences’ (1998 : 58), organises social space as a simulacra of widely circulated images, and it is a structuration which approaches culture as a factor of risk and uncertainty. Furthermore, not only does a large amount of tourist/host contact take place within this confinement, but it is increasingly the normative setting for representations of the Caribbean in media texts. In this paper I do not wish to re-examine arguments concerning the social unsustainability of this form of tourism, as I think that can be <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>read.</b> My focus will be the way in which this kind of tourism provides a framework for imagining and gazing upon the Caribbean, and the problems this presents for island identities. Central to this is the question of identity and globalisation, that nebulous process which drives the increase in the type of tourism which is under discussion. An influential current in global theory is to analyse the way in which processes engendered in the economic sphere result in cultural phenomenon which are delinked from any simplistic notion of economic causality. While this is generally sustainable, I wish to argue that the precise form of tourism which defines the Caribbean’s entry into this global market has a structuring influence on the cultural, precisely because it is the cultural which has been fundamentally commodifie...|$|E

Através de levantamento bibliográfico, constatamos expressiva e {{singular}} representação de bichos na obra dos escritores referidos, que dialoga em momentos diversos. Interessa-nos, dessa forma, apurar de que maneira o animal dotado de características humanas está representado nas narrativas, bem como de que modo os autores mencionados abordam a relação entre o bicho, o homem e o mundo que os rodeia, que, no caso das obras dos autores citados, está situado, físico e emblematicamente, sobretudo, no meio rural. A nossa leitura privilegia as implicações da relação humano-animal em textos dos escritores aludidos, implicações que se baseiam, principalmente, em saberes alternativos, identificações e dicotomias. O corpus selecionado são os livros: Bichos, de Torga, e Ave, palavra, Estas estórias e Sagarana, de Guimarães Rosa.
