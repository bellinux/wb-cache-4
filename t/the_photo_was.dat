5|$|For the album's {{striking}} front-cover image, Wilkes used a Kirlian {{photograph of}} Harrison's hand holding a Hindu medallion. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken at UCLA's parapsychology department, {{as was the}} shot used on the back cover, where Harrison instead holds three US coins: a couple of quarters and a silver dollar.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{made the}} door of Jäger-Passage at Wohlwillstrasse 22 famous when he posed {{in front of it}} for a photo which was later used on the covers of the Rock 'n' Roll and Rock 'n' Roll Sessions albums. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken by Jürgen Vollmer, during the time The Beatles were playing at the Top Ten club.|$|E
5|$|One model had its lens {{fixed to}} a bag bellows. A scissor {{mechanism}} held the bellows in its expanded state until <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards. This allowed one exposure of size 6cm×9cm on a photographic plate, at a focal length of 85mm.|$|E
50|$|The McMinnville UFO {{photographs}} were {{taken on a}} farm near McMinnville, Oregon, United States, in 1950. <b>The</b> <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> reprinted in Life magazine and in newspapers across the nation, and are often considered {{to be among the}} most famous ever taken of a UFO. Most UFO skeptics have concluded that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> a hoax, but many ufologists continue to argue that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> genuine, and show an unidentified object in the sky.|$|R

5|$|By 1 March, over {{two-thirds of}} BuzzFeed users polled responded that {{the dress was}} white and gold. Some people have {{suggested}} that the dress changes colours on its own. Media outlets noted that <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E
5|$|Many early {{reports of}} the riots, {{starting}} with one from Reuters, used a picture purporting to show the previous day's riots. The photo, showing large number of People's Armed Police squares, was one taken of the 2009 Shishou riot and originally published on 26 June by Southern Metropolis Weekly. The same picture was mistakenly used by other agencies; {{it was on the}} website of The Daily Telegraph, but was removed a day later. In an interview with Al Jazeera on 7 July, WUC leader Rebiya Kadeer used the same Shishou photograph to defend the Uyghurs in Ürümqi. A World Uyghur Congress representative later apologised, explaining that <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> chosen out of hundreds for its image quality.|$|E
5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of a cropped Polaroid photograph of two unidentified fans taken at a Sonic Youth show in Amherst, Massachusetts in April 1995, during a short tour undertaken while the album was still in production. The fans are depicted wearing T-shirts that were sold as merchandise during that tour; early in 1995, the band was toying {{with the idea of}} changing their name to Washing Machine. Visible on the shirt on the left are signatures by Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw of the tour's opening band Come. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken by Gordon, who believed it could be used as the album cover. The band liked the shot, but the record label did not want to use it without permission from the fans. As the band did not have any way to contact them, their faces had to be cropped out.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Schlessinger's early radio mentor, Bill Ballance, sold nude {{photos of}} Schlessinger {{to a company}} specializing in Internet porn. <b>The</b> <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> taken in <b>the</b> mid-1970s while Schlessinger was {{involved}} in a brief affair with the then-married Ballance. Schlessinger sued after <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> posted on <b>the</b> Internet, claiming invasion of privacy and copyright violation. The court ruled that Schlessinger did not own the rights to <b>the</b> <b>photos.</b> She did not appeal the ruling. She told her radio audience that she was embarrassed, but that <b>the</b> <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> taken when she was going through a divorce and had [...] "no moral authority." ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Upon his arrival, Bond is {{contacted}} by Aki, {{assistant to the}} head of the Japanese secret service, Tiger Tanaka, while watching sumo. Aki introduces Bond to local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise and escapes in the getaway car, which goes to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of president Mr. Osato. After obtaining certain documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by Aki, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to Tanaka's office. The stolen documents are examined and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship Ning-Po with a microdot message saying the tourist who took <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> killed as a security precaution.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 investigative {{documentary}} {{broadcast by}} Japan's NHK reported research {{carried out by}} Kotaro Sawaki claiming that Gerda Taro should be acknowledged as the real photographer. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> published shortly after her death.|$|E

25|$|Sun Media, and Sun News in particular, was {{involved}} in two separate news stories during the final week of the 2011 federal election that centred {{on two of the}} federal party leaders. The first centred on a photo that appeared to show Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff posing with U.S. military forces in Kuwait in late 2002, months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The source of <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> Conservative Party operative Patrick Muttart, who had been providing pro bono advice to Sun News regarding its on-air presentation and offered the photo to Sun Media, which ran a story alleging Ignatieff's involvement with the U.S. plans to invade Iraq. Sun Media did not run the photo, however, as the image was illegible and did not conclusively prove of Ignatieff's presence with the U.S. troops. Sun Media head Pierre Karl Péladeau, in an editorial for the Sun papers, claimed <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> an attempt to not only damage the Ignatieff campaign but the integrity of Sun Media and Sun News as well. The incident led to Muttart's removal from the campaign of Conservative leader and incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper.|$|E
25|$|Mark Fuhrman was {{not called}} to testify, and Simpson was subpoenaed to testify {{on his own}} behalf. In addition, a photo of Simpson, taken while he was {{attending}} a Buffalo Bills game in 1993, was presented at trial that showed him wearing Bruno Magli shoes, {{the same type of}} shoes which investigators said the killer of Goldman and Brown was wearing when the murders were committed. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> presented as evidence against him, as Simpson had previously denied ever wearing such shoes.|$|E
