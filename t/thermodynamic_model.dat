5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>model,</b> which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E

25|$|B.A. Hills and D.H. LeMessurier {{studied the}} {{empirical}} decompression practices of Okinawan pearl divers in the Torres Strait and observed {{that they made}} deeper stops but reduced the total decompression time compared with the generally used tables of the time. Their analysis strongly suggested that bubble presence limits gas elimination rates, and {{emphasized the importance of}} inherent unsaturation of tissues due to metabolic processing of oxygen. This became known as the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>model.</b> More recently, recreational technical divers developed decompression procedures using deeper stops than required by the decompression tables in use. These led to the RGBM and VPM bubble models. A deep stop was originally an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm. There are also computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops, but these algorithms and the practice of deep stops have not been adequately validated.|$|E

2500|$|The role of entropy in {{cosmology}} {{remains a}} controversial subject {{since the time}} of Ludwig Boltzmann. Recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>model</b> to the universe in general. Although entropy does increase in the model of an expanding universe, the maximum possible entropy rises much more rapidly, moving the universe further from the heat death with time, not closer. [...] This results in an [...] "entropy gap" [...] pushing the system further away from the posited heat death equilibrium. Other complicating factors, such as the energy density of the vacuum and macroscopic quantum effects, are difficult to reconcile with thermodynamical models, making any predictions of large-scale thermodynamics extremely difficult.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "Pyle stop" [...] {{is a deep}} stop {{named after}} Richard Pyle, an early {{advocate}} of deep stops, at the depths halfway between the bottom and the first conventional decompression stop, and halfway between the previous Pyle stop and the deepest conventional stop, provided the conventional stop is more than 9m shallower. A Pyle stop is about 2 minutes long. The additional ascent time required for Pyle stops {{is included in the}} dive profile before finalising the decompression schedule. Pyle found that on dives where he stopped periodically to vent the swim-bladders of his fish specimens, he felt better after the dive, and based the deep stop procedure on the depths and duration of these pauses. The hypothesis is that these stops provide an opportunity to eliminate gas while still dissolved, or at least while the bubbles are still small enough to be easily eliminated, and the result {{is that there will be}} considerably fewer or smaller venous bubbles to eliminate at the shallower stops as predicted by the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>model</b> of Hills.|$|E

40|$|<b>Thermodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> {{is widely}} used to predict phase equilibria and solute {{partitioning}} in high temperature materials processing. There have been significant advances in computational <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> {{in the last three}} decades. A number of thermochemical software packages and databases have been established and developed, offering different features and capabilities. This paper summarises the fundamentals of <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> focusing on multi-component phase equilibrium using Gibbs energy minimisation and solution <b>models.</b> Different <b>thermodynamic</b> packages used by the authors are described and the key features of each package are highlighted. The packages described are Chemix (The CSIRO-SGTE Thermodata System), MTDATA, FactSage, and HSC. An example of <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> on the distribution of impurities in magnesium production using both ideal solution and a random mixing solution models is presented. Using ideal solution model for the condensate from the process, a purity of 98. 33 wt% Mg is predicted compared to 99. 98 wt% using the alternate solution model. These difference are important because of the repercussions on the development of new routes for magnesium, as commercial grade magnesium requires a purity of greater than 99. 95 wt. % This example illustrates both the predictive power of <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>modelling</b> but also the dilemmas associated with dealing with solution behaviour...|$|R
