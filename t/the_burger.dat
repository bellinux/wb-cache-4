5000|$|Dislocations do {{not have}} random {{structure}}s, the local atomic structure of a dislocation is determined by <b>the</b> <b>Burgers</b> vector. One very useful application of the TEM in dislocation imaging {{is the ability to}} experimentally determine <b>the</b> <b>Burgers</b> vector. Determination of <b>the</b> <b>Burgers</b> vector is achieved by what is known as [...] ("g dot b") analysis. When performing dark field microscopy with the TEM, a diffracted spot is selected to form the image (as mentioned before, lattice planes diffract the beam into spots), and the image is formed using only electrons that were diffracted by the plane responsible for that diffraction spot. The vector in the diffraction pattern from the transmitted spot to the diffracted spot is the [...] vector. Without going into the finer points of electron microcopy; the contrast of a dislocation is scaled by a factor of the dot product of this vector and <b>the</b> <b>Burgers</b> vector (...) [...] As a result, if <b>the</b> <b>burgers</b> vector and [...] vector are perpendicular, there will be no signal from the dislocation and the dislocation will not appear at all in the image. Therefore, by examining different dark field images formed from spots with different g vectors, <b>the</b> <b>burgers</b> vector can be determined.|$|R
