25|$|In training, {{the damage}} control team specializing in on-deck {{firefighting}} for Forrestal (Damage Control Team #8, led by Chief Petty Officer Gerald Farrier) had been shown films of Navy ordnance tests demonstrating how a 1000-lb bomb could be directly {{exposed to a}} jet fuel fire for a full 10 minutes and still be extinguished and cooled without an explosive cook-off. However, these tests were conducted using the new Mark 83 1000lb bombs, which featured relatively stable Composition H6 explosive and thicker, heat-resistant cases, compared to their predecessors; H6, which is still used in many types of naval ordnance due to its relative insensitivity to heat, shock and electricity, is also designed <b>to</b> <b>deflagrate</b> instead of detonate when it reaches its ignition point in a fire, either melting the case and producing no explosion at all, or, at most, a subsonic low order detonation {{at a fraction of}} its normal power.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrous oxide is said <b>to</b> <b>deflagrate</b> at {{approximately}} [...] at a pressure of 21atmospheres. At 600 for example, the required ignition energy is only 6joules, whereas [...] at 130psi a 2500-joule ignition energy input is insufficient.|$|E
2500|$|In vehicle racing, {{nitrous oxide}} (often {{referred}} to as just [...] "nitrous") allows the engine to burn more fuel by providing more oxygen than air alone, resulting in a more powerful combustion. The gas is not flammable at a low pressure/temperature, but it delivers more oxygen than atmospheric air by breaking down at elevated temperatures. Therefore, it often is mixed with another fuel that is easier <b>to</b> <b>deflagrate.</b> Nitrous oxide is a strong oxidant, roughly equivalent to hydrogen peroxide, and much stronger than oxygen gas.|$|E
50|$|High-order {{explosives}} (HE) {{are more}} powerful than low-order explosives (LE). HE detonate to produce a defining supersonic over-pressurization shock wave. Several sources of HE include trinitrotoluene, C-4, Semtex, nitroglycerin, and {{ammonium nitrate fuel oil}} (ANFO). LE <b>deflagrate</b> <b>to</b> create a subsonic explosion and lack HEâ€™s over-pressurization wave. Sources of LE include pipe bombs, gunpowder, and most pure petroleum-based incendiary bombs such as Molotov cocktails or aircraft improvised as guided missiles. HE and LE induce different injury patterns. Only HE produce true blast waves.|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate senses that are essential for mediating fright reaction and food behavior in Pseudoplatystoma corruscans, pintado. The dilemma ""to feed or to flee"" was also analyzed in fishes with intact and sectioned olfactory tracts, stimulated by alarm substance extracts and food. Fishes were arranged into five groups: fish with intact lateral olfactory tracts (LOT), fish with intact medial olfactory tract (MOT), fish with tracts totally sectioned (TOTAL, both LOT and MOT), sham operated, and nonoperated fish. The five groups were submitted to either alarm substance extract and food stimulus or to distilled water (control) and food stimulus. Fish reacted to food independently of which tract (LOT, MOT or TOTAL) was sectioned; vision seems necessary and elemental <b>to</b> detect and <b>deflagrate</b> food response. Latency of the responses to each reaction was different between groups. None of the fish with sectioned tracts reacted to alarm substance extract, while sham- and nonoperated fish showed the typical alarm behavior response, leading {{to the conclusion that}} olfaction is essential for mediating alarm response. These results indicate that others sense systems (e. g., vision) are sufficient to trigger and elicit feeding behavior and that olfaction is not necessary to fully maintain food detection to qualitative and quantitative extent. However, olfactory tract integrity seems to be required for mediation of alarm reaction in P. corruscans. FAPES...|$|R
2500|$|In November 1981, the RAF Regiment took {{delivery}} {{of the first of}} 184 Scorpions and other variants of CVR(T). These were to be used for airfield defence and served at RAF bases in the United Kingdom, Germany and Cyprus. The 76mm gun was ideal for the role, especially the canister round, which could be used on base against attacking personnel whilst minimising the risk to aircraft and infrastructure due to its short range. The RAF Regiment tranche of vehicles is understood to have originally been part of an order for Iran, but which were not delivered following the revolution that overthrew the Shah. [...] The vehicles differed by having no wading equipment, and the vehicle commander's cupola on the RAF Regiment Spartan was a different design to that of British Army variants. [...] British Scorpions were withdrawn from service in 1995, principally because of the toxicity hazard in the crew compartment caused when the main armament was fired. In addition, RAF Bomb Disposal (EOD) teams used Scimitar and Spartan. [...] Their protection and mobility allowed the teams to move around airfields that had unexploded ordnance (UXO) and CBRN contamination. [...] The 30mm main armament on the Scimitar could be used to detonate the UXO or to crack the case of a bomb to allow the contents to drain or <b>to</b> <b>deflagrate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Whilst cordite is {{classified}} as an explosive, it is not employed as a high explosive. It is designed <b>to</b> <b>deflagrate,</b> or burn, to produce high pressure gases.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrous oxide is said <b>to</b> <b>deflagrate</b> at {{approximately}} 600 C at a pressure of 21 atmospheres. At 600 [...] for example, the required ignition energy is only 6 joules, whereas [...] at 130 psi a 2500-joule ignition energy input is insufficient.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal {{destruction}} - {{uses the}} heat of the electrically heated containment vessel <b>to</b> <b>deflagrate</b> the munition and destroy the agent and energetics. The resulting gases are treated in an off-gas treatment system. The Static Detonation Chamber, or SDC, is an example of thermal destruction technology.|$|E

50|$|Low {{explosives}} are compounds {{where the}} rate of decomposition proceeds through the material at less {{than the speed of}} sound. The decomposition is propagated by a flame front (deflagration) which travels much more slowly through the explosive material than a shock wave of a high explosive. Under normal conditions, low explosives undergo deflagration at rates that vary from a few centimetres per second to approximately 400 metres per second. It is possible for them <b>to</b> <b>deflagrate</b> very quickly, producing an effect similar to a detonation. This can happen under higher pressure or temperature, which usually occurs when ignited in a confined space.|$|E
