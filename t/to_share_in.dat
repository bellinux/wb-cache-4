5|$|At forty, Chamberlain {{was expecting}} {{to remain a}} bachelor, but in 1910 {{he fell in love}} with Anne Cole, a distant {{relative}} by marriage, and married her the following year. She encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and was to be his constant companion, helper and trusted colleague, and <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> full his interests in housing and other political and social activities after his election as an MP. The two had a son and a daughter.|$|E
5|$|In 293, emperor Diocletian {{created a}} new {{administrative}} system (the tetrarchy), to guarantee security in all endangered regions of his Empire. He associated himself with a co-emperor (Augustus), and each co-emperor then adopted a young colleague given the title of Caesar, <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> their rule and eventually to succeed the senior partner. The tetrarchy collapsed, however, in 313 {{and a few years}} later Constantine I reunited the two administrative divisions of the Empire as sole Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Railroad Gazette was a trade journal {{published}} in the United States that focused on railroad news, transportation and engineering. The journal also published editorial content. It was established and first {{published in}} April 1856. Master train mechanics were among the journal's readership, who used it <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> technological information about railway matters. The publication served as a forum for readers to discuss railroad management and technology.|$|E

5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> territorial gains.|$|E

5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E

5|$|The Act of Killing {{garnered}} {{awards and}} nominations {{primarily in the}} Best Documentary category and for Oppenheimer's direction, but also audience awards, special awards, and recognition for Signe Byrge Sørensen's production and editing by Janus Billeskov Jansen and Niels Pagh Andersen. Among its Best Documentary awards are a BAFTA, European Film Award, and a Robert Award, along with nominations for an Academy Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, Directors Guild of America Award, Independent Spirit Award, and International Documentary Association Award. Included {{in many of the}} awards was the anonymous Indonesian co-director, who was unable <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> the recognition because of the danger posed by his or her participation.|$|E
5|$|The {{next seven}} games (games 14 through 20) were drawn. Fischer {{was unable to}} get the initiative. Spassky was {{choosing}} lines that Fischer was unable to break. With a three-point lead, Fischer was content to inch towards the title, and Spassky seemed resigned to his fate. The off-the-board antics continued, including a lawsuit against Fischer for damages by Chester Fox, who had filming rights to the match (Fischer had objected {{to what he said}} were noticeable camera noises, and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly– they were <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> film revenues along with the two contestants– removed the television cameras), a Fischer demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators (eventually, three rows were cleared), and Soviet claims that Fischer was using electronic and chemical devices to 'control' Spassky, resulting in an Icelandic police sweep of the hall.|$|E
5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E

50|$|The short ratio, short {{interest}} ratio (SIR) or float {{short for}} a public company is the ratio of tradable <b>shares</b> being shorted <b>to</b> <b>shares</b> <b>in</b> the market, or the float.

5000|$|References to [...] "true" [...] legal {{mortgages}} mean mortgages by {{the traditional}} common law method of transfer subject to a proviso in this manner, and references are usually made in contradistinction to either equitable mortgages or statutory mortgages. True legal mortgages are relatively rare in modern commerce, outside of occasionally with respect <b>to</b> <b>shares</b> <b>in</b> companies. In England, true legal mortgages of land have been abolished in favour of statutory mortgages.|$|R
5|$|Chi's {{character}} is voiced by Rie Tanaka, and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same, but they differ slightly. These differences include {{the events in}} the ending, other things such as describing Elda's memory loss, and her special program. In the anime for example, it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda's memories after her husband's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya's program in. Another difference is the special program that was placed into Elda in the anime, this program appears to have an alternate effect. If Chi finds the Person just for her, all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion. The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms, he viewed them all as his children. His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return, all his children would be able <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> this happiness by being able to feel emotions the way humans do.|$|E
5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a treasure trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a treasure trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the treasure. He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> any reward.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{much of the}} {{literature}} on <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> cities has focused on the <b>sharing</b> economy, <b>in</b> which people use online platforms <b>to</b> <b>share</b> underutilized assets <b>in</b> the marketplace. This view of sharing is too narrow for cities, as it neglects the myriad of ways, reasons, and scales <b>in</b> which citizens <b>share</b> <b>in</b> urban environments. Research presented here by the Liveable Cities team in the form of participant workshops in Lancaster and Birmingham, UK, suggests that a broader approach <b>to</b> understanding <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> cities is essential. The research also highlighted tools and methods that may be used to help <b>to</b> identify <b>sharing</b> <b>in</b> communities. The paper ends with advice to city stakeholders, such as policymakers, urban planners, and urban designers, who are considering how to enhance sustainability <b>in</b> cities through <b>sharing...</b>|$|R

5|$|On {{arrival in}} Britain, Seymour was celebrated and {{rewarded with a}} baronetcy for his second victory in {{less than six months}} while all of his {{officers}} were promoted. Niémen was purchased into the Navy for the sum of £29,979-2-10d, which was split between the government, the crew {{and a number of other}} parties. The share that went to the captors came under dispute: Mends had no intention of abiding by Seymour's agreement with Maitland and refused to allow Emerald <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> the prize money. Seymour and Maitland took Mends to court and the ensuing legal battle lasted years, Mends deliberately exaggerating his role in the capture of Niémen in public (although privately admitting that the victory was entirely Seymour's). Seymour and Mends became bitter enemies and their animosity continued throughout their lives, although both remained in the Navy and had successful careers. Forty years later, the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe {{division}} tracks down {{a series}} of deaths of wives shortly after the passing of their respective husbands. Discovering traces of the husbands' DNA on {{the bodies of the}} wives, Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from the husbands to get close to the wives, using the substances as a perfume. Further identifying castoreum within the pheromone mix, they identify the murderer as Anson Carr (Michael Massee), a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare skin disease. They arrive at Carr's home to find another husband, already dead, in a dehydration chamber, and race to protect his wife, Dianna (Ona Grauer). When no attack comes at the wife, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair, and races to the mistress' home, stopping Carr before he can kill her. As he is taken away, he admits he was trying to discover what love was, scientifically, so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>in</b> it.|$|E
