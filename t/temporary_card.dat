For instance, the Iranian government started to grant <b>temporary</b> registration <b>cards</b> to Afghan refugees instead of indefinite permission (Margesson 2007). These <b>temporary</b> registration <b>cards</b> confined Afghans to residence in refugee settlements or designated rural or urban areas (Rostami-Povey 2008). Starting in 1995, Iran closed its border with Afghanistan and stopped accepting newly arrived Afghans at the border on a prima facie basis (Garakani 2009; Marchand et al. 2014). In {{the course of the}} succeeding years, Afghans have had to prove owning a well-founded fear of persecution to earn a refugee status in Iran. Moreover, after 1995, Iran increasingly enacted measures to control refugees’ access to free or subsidized resources such as education, energy, and health services (Garakani 2009; Marchand et al. 2014; Margesson 2007; Rajaee 2000; Rostami-Povey 2008).|$|R

2500|$|As {{the first}} week of Foster's {{employment}} came to an end, rumors swirled that he would be denied union membership on grounds that he did not work for seven days (his makework did not count) and because he had not completed the union's required four-year apprenticeship program. UFM officials said any refusal of Foster's application [...] "dishonors our agreement", and pickets were again threatened. Local 65 leaders proposed that Foster be admitted as fourth-year apprentice and at 90 percent pay. At a two-and-a-half hour union membership meeting on August 14, Foster's application for membership was rejected. Union officers agreed that Foster's application was in order and that he was obviously qualified, but that no further action could be taken until a regularly scheduled union executive board meeting on August 28. Foster attempted to obtain a <b>temporary</b> work <b>card</b> from the union, but union offices were inexplicably closed each time he went there. Lacking a union card, Foster was laid off on August 15. Despite the previous day's statements by union leaders, a union business agent declared on August 15 that Foster had to follow the standard four-year apprentice process before he could join the union. The earliest his application for apprentice could be accepted was the middle of September. This outraged the UFM, which said it would begin picketing and refused to meet with representatives from city hall.|$|R

To assist Medicare beneficiaries with their prescription drug costs until the new benefit becomes available, the MMA also required {{the establishment of a}} temporary program, the Medicare Prescription Drug Discount Card and Transitional Assistance Program, which began in June 2004. The drug card program is designed to offer Medicare beneficiaries access to discounts off the retail price of prescription drugs. All Medicare beneficiaries, except those receiving Medicaid drug coverage, are eligible to enroll in the drug card program. Certain low-income beneficiaries without other drug coverage qualify for an additional benefit, a transitional assistance (TA) subsidy, that can be applied toward the cost of drugs covered under the drug card program. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) [...] the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs [...] administers and oversees the drug card program. The drug cards themselves are offered and managed by private organizations, known as drug card sponsors. There are different types of drug cards. General drug cards are available to all eligible beneficiaries living in a card's service area; there are both national and regional general cards. Exclusive and special endorsement drug cards are available to specific beneficiary groups. Some drug card sponsors offer more than one drug card. Congress asked us to examine CMS's implementation and oversight of the <b>temporary</b> drug <b>card</b> program.
