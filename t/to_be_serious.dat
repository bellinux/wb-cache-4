5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out every two hours. On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E

If we are going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> about living in a Circular Economy we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled.|$|E
25|$|Despite summer {{interest}} from English Premier League clubs, Ménez opted {{to remain at}} Monaco. In the 2007–08 campaign, he scored his first goal in the team's 3–0 victory over his former club Sochaux. The following week, he netted again, this time in a 3–1 win over Le Mans. On 15 December, Ménez scored a double in a 3–1 victory against Lens. It was his first multi-goal game since his hat-trick three years prior. The following month, Ménez scored both of the team's goal in a 2–0 away win against Metz. On 23 February 2008, he suffered an injury in a league match against Paris-Saint Germain, which led to him leaving the match at half-time. The injury was discovered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> and Ménez missed three months before returning for the final two matches of the season making obligatory substitute appearances.|$|E
25|$|Since then, {{the park}} has managed to survive and be self-sustaining. However, serious {{environmental}} problems continue to plague that park {{and the rest of}} chinampa lands in Xochimilco. Pollution of the waters in the lakes and canals continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>serious,</b> as sewage and household garbage finds its way into the water. However, the most pressing problem is invasions of chinampa land by illegal settlements. In 2004 and 2007, families who had been swindled into illegally buying lands in the park lost their homes as they were evicted. Many people living illegally on the land have organized to put political pressure on authorities to let them remain, with mixed success. The fact that there are still illegal settlements in the park, which is land designated as a World Heritage Site, has put the borough at odds with UNESCO. UNESCO wants all illegal settlements out in order to preserve the site's status, but borough officials claim this would not be feasible.|$|E

25|$|Other major {{problems}} facing the canal system is the damage by introduced species and disease destroying native ones. Water lilies {{were introduced to the}} canals from Brazil in the 1940s. Since then, they have become a serious problem as their overgrowth depletes minerals and oxygen from the water. Up to 400 tons of the plant has been extracted from the canals monthly. In 2006, a Brazilian insect (Anthonomus grandis) was introduced to the canals to help control the plant. However, some need to be maintained because the axolotls are using them for reproduction purposes. Introduced species include carp and tilapia, which were introduced in the 1960s. However, these have been very detrimental to the native ecosystem, especially the axolotl, whose eggs they eat. Despite tons of the fish being caught in the canals, they are still a serious problem. Another major problem is the loss of trees, especially junipers in the ecological zone. Over sixty percent of the area is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> deforested and eighty percent of the junipers have the parasitic plant mistletoe.|$|E
25|$|Dominic's {{health was}} {{steadily}} deteriorating, but {{he spent most}} of his time with his friends, talking with them, and encouraging those who were experiencing troubles. He also helped at the school infirmary whenever his companions were admitted. On the recommendation of doctors, Dominic was sent home to recover from his ill health, but a few days later Bosco found him back at the Oratory. Despite his affection for Dominic, and his wish to allow Dominic to remain at the Oratory, John Bosco decided to follow the recommendation of the doctors, especially since Dominic had developed a severe cough and he wrote to Dominic's father, fixing the date of his departure on March 1, 1857. Though Dominic said that he wanted to spend his last days at the Oratory, he accepted this decision and spent the evening before his departure at John Bosco's side, discussing spiritual matters. (Bosco recorded a part of this conversation in his biography of Dominic). On the morning of his departure, Don Bosco notes that Dominic made the Exercise of a Happy Death with great zeal, even saying that this would be his final such devotion. He said his farewell to John Bosco, asking as a keepsake that Bosco add his name to the list of those who would participate in the Plenary Indulgence that John Bosco had received from the Pope, to which John Bosco readily agreed. He then took leave of his friends with great affection, which surprised them, for his illness was not considered by many of his companions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>serious.</b>|$|E

500|$|The 2006 final was {{the first}} time that Arsenal had reached the showpiece match; in doing so they became the first club from London to feature in the final. Barcelona were {{appearing}} in the final for the fifth time; their last appearance had been in a 40 loss to Milan in 1994. Two more losses preceded the 1994 final (1961 and 1986), and their only success in the competition came in 1992 when they beat Sampdoria. Barcelona went into the final as domestic league champions, having won La Liga a fortnight earlier. They were regarded as being the best side on the continent because they possessed players such as Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o. Barcelona player Deco dismissed the notion of Barcelona being favourites, insisting they would not be complacent: [...] "Milan were winning 30 last year against Liverpool and ended up losing in the end.
