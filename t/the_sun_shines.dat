25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Shines</b> Bright (1953), Ford's first {{entry in}} the Cannes Film Festival, was a western comedy-drama with Charles Winninger {{reviving}} the Judge Priest role made famous by Will Rogers in the 1930s. Ford later {{referred to it as}} one of his favorites, but it was poorly received, and was drastically cut (from 90 mins to 65 mins) by Republic soon after its release, with some excised scenes now presumed lost. It fared poorly at the box office and its failure contributed to the subsequent collapse of Argosy Pictures.|$|E

After several days of bad weather <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> again and Bjarni reaches a wooded land. Realizing that it isn't Greenland, Bjarni decides not to go ashore and sets sail away. Bjarni finds two more lands but neither of them matches the descriptions he had heard of Greenland so he does not go ashore despite the curiosity of his sailors. Eventually the ship does reach Greenland and Bjarni settles in Herjolfsnes.|$|E

25|$|At mid-latitudes, the F2 layer daytime ion {{production}} {{is higher in}} the summer, as expected, since <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>shines</b> more directly on the Earth. However, there are seasonal changes in the molecular-to-atomic ratio of the neutral atmosphere that cause the summer ion loss rate to be even higher. The {{result is that the}} increase in the summertime loss overwhelms the increase in summertime production, and total F2 ionization is actually lower in the local summer months. This effect is known as the winter anomaly. The anomaly is always present in the northern hemisphere, but is usually absent in the southern hemisphere during periods of low solar activity.|$|E
25|$|In Tarbes, fog {{and strong}} winds are rare. These climate {{characteristics}} of Tarbes {{are found in}} the north of the department, but with more fog in winter, and warmer daytime temperatures and lower precipitation in the summer. Conversely on the closer terrain the average quantities of precipitation increase. This varies greatly depending on exposure and slopes, but become abundant near the border ridges. The area between plain and mountain has a more humid climate and less sunny {{than the rest of the}} department. In the mountains <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> frequently above a sea of clouds and the wind blows stronger and more often than on the plain (breezes and sometimes very strong winds from the south).|$|E

Soon after his divorce, de Klerk and Georgiades were married. His divorce and remarriage scandalised conservative South African opinion, especially among the Calvinist Afrikaners.

25|$|One {{reason for}} the unusual clarity of {{tropical}} waters is they are deficient in nutrients and drifting plankton. Further, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> year-round in the tropics, warming the surface layer, making it less dense than subsurface layers. The warmer water is separated from deeper, cooler water by a stable thermocline, where the temperature makes a rapid change. This keeps the warm surface waters floating above the cooler deeper waters. In {{most parts of the}} ocean, there is little exchange between these layers. Organisms that die in aquatic environments generally sink to the bottom, where they decompose, which releases nutrients in the form of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). These nutrients are necessary for plant growth, but in the tropics, they do not directly return to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Wheldrake is in {{the more}} northerly part of England and {{although}} it has a typically English temperate climate which {{is influenced by the}} warming effect of the Gulf Stream, it is slightly cooler than London. In the summer months the average maximum temperature is 20°C and the minimum is 11°C. In the winter the average maximum is 7°C and the minimum is 2°C. Average monthly precipitation varies between 68mm in August and 37mm in March. In May, June and July <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> for an average of six hours a day but in January and February there is an average of only one hour of sunshine.

500|$|The {{canvas of}} The Magpie depicts a solitary black magpie {{perched on a}} gate formed in a wattle fence, as the light of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> upon freshly fallen snow {{creating}} blue shadows. [...] The painting features {{one of the first}} examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eugène Chevreul earlier in the century.|$|E

But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree.

500|$|The [...] "Lorrainers," [...] as the occupying {{forces were}} dubbed, were popularly loathed.

She occupied herself financing and overseeing {{the construction of the}} Cappella dei Principi—started in 1604 by Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany—to the tune of 1,000 crowns per week, and she donated much of her fortune to charity: £4,000 per annum. [...] This is equivalent to £ in present-day terms. On 18 February 1743, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Dowager Electress Palatine, died of an [...] "oppression on the breast".

[...] The royal line of the House of Medici became extinct with her death. Her will, having been completed just months before, according to Sir Horace Mann, left £500,000 worth of jewellery to the Grand Duke Francis and her lands in the former Duchy of Urbino to the Marquis Rinuccini, her main executor and a minister under her father, Cosimo III. She was interred in the crypt that she helped to complete in San Lorenzo; although not entirely finished {{at the time of her}} death, her testament stipulated that part of the revenue of her estate should [...] "be used to continue, finish and perfect...the said famous chapel San Lorenzo".|$|E
