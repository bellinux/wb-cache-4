5|$|Hemming's {{introduction}} {{to his work}} (Prefatio) claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about the things which have been committed to their care, and <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.|$|E
5|$|Pitts and Tuck renamed {{their product}} from Spacewar to Galaxy Game due to anti-war {{sentiment}} and founded {{a company called}} Mini-Computer Applications in June 1971 to operate the game as it neared completion. The development of the prototype machine took around {{three and a half}} months. By August, they were well into development and had gotten permission to place the machine at the Tresidder student union building at Stanford as a test site. It was then that they received a call from Nolan Bushnell, who had heard of their project and wanted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> his similar project he was working on.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{behind the}} house may {{originally}} have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which were {{laid out in the}} Renaissance style popular across Europe. The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming the upper and lower terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> as they might have appeared in 1665. The summerhouse is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of Llanerch's gardens, and the flowerpots are modeled on those found in excavations at Tredegar House.|$|E

5|$|A {{highlight}} of the series in 1959 was when the Russians allowed Moore {{to be the first}} Westerner to see the photographic results of the Luna 3 probe, and <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky at Night, in September 1961, Moore's attempt {{to be the first to}} broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E
5|$|The team worked {{alongside}} {{artists and}} DJ's for incorporation of songs into the game. Neil stated they brought to artists and DJ's working prototypes {{of the game}} and hardware <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> what the sampled music and final mixes sounded like, garnering interest from these groups. This led to securing of rights from several groups for their songs, though this did occur late in the development process. Mixing with celebrity DJ's was performed either though electronic communications, or at FreeStyleGames' studios or the homes or studios of the DJ's themselves; the team outlined the goals {{of the game and}} requested mixes that emphasized the gameplay featured, but avoided hampering the creativity of the artists.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> that the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E

"Why, jest <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>'em</b> we HAVE got money, {{and could}} buy 'em all up {{if we wanted}} to," [...] {{returned}} Maggie, sticking boldly to her guns, albeit with a vague conviction that her fire was weakened through elevation, and somewhat alarmed at the deliberation of the enemy.|$|R

5|$|The Venezuelan intern Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) {{falls in}} love with April (Aubrey Plaza), who convinces him she is feared and very powerful. Jhonny is crazy and fell in love for April and sent her his car to pick her up but she used his car to go to movies with her friends. Meanwhile, Leslie tells the Venezuelans that she is seeking to raise $35,000 to fill in a pit to make a park. Raul and his colleagues start to laugh, telling her they have so much money from oil, they can build {{whatever}} they want. Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them. Instead, they are disgusted, and Raul mistakes the park for the aforementioned pit. Leslie later takes them to a public meeting <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> democracy in action, but all of the citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders where are the armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer to nobody, she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and {{people start to}} clear the streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E

25|$|In his 1613 book Opticorum Libri Sex Belgian Jesuit mathematician, {{physicist}} and architect François d'Aguilon described how some charlatans cheated {{people out of}} their money by claiming they knew necromancy and would raise the specters of the devil from hell <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> to the audience inside a dark room. The image of an assistant with a devil's mask was projected through a lens into the dark room, scaring the uneducated spectators.|$|E

This market was dominated by Douglas which was adept at {{meeting the needs of}} airlines by refining and developing its range of propeller-driven aircraft, and in 1950 was marketing the forthcoming DC-7. Boeing decided the only way to overcome the airlines' suspicion of the jet – and of itself – was <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>them</b> a completed aircraft.|$|E
