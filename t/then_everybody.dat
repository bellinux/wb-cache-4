5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
500|$|In {{the ensuing}} decades, [...] "don't fuck with the formula" [...] has been {{repeated}} in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs. The remark is usually invoked {{to signal the}} conflicts that arose between Wilson and Love when the former began subverting the [...] "formula" [...] that brought the Beach Boys their initial success: songs with lyrics that embraced girls, cars, and surfing. Following the collapse of Smile, Wilson gradually ceded production and songwriting duties {{to the rest of}} the band. [...] "Brian Wilson" [...] and [...] "The Beach Boys" [...] were still viewed as synonymous entities, and he was expected to fulfill the band's commercial interests. Nolan's article inspired a 1978 biography by David Leaf, titled The Beach Boys and the California Myth, which concluded that [...] "If Brian sought refuge within drugs, in reaction to all the pressure, <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> must share the blame—the record company, the family, the Beach Boys, and Brian's entourage." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Clash {{turned down}} a request from British Telecom to use the song for an {{advertising}} campaign in the early 1990s. In 2002, the band incurred criticism when they sold the rights to Jaguar for a car advertisement. In an interview posted on his website, Strummer explained {{the reasons for the}} deal. [...] "Yeah. I agreed to that. We get hundreds of requests for that and turn 'em all down. But I just thought Jaguar... yeah.

A 2001 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch ("Beach Blanket Bizarro") also paid {{homage to the}} series, with Avalon appearing as himself. Avalon and Funicello starred in Paramount Pictures Back to the Beach in 1987, playing off their original roles and subsequent careers. Kelly Killoren Bensimon wrote in The Bikini Book, [...] "It was really all about Annette Funicello.

5000|$|A Canto that Byron {{failed to}} {{complete}} but added {{to in the}} run up to his death, it lacks any narrative and only barely mentions the protagonist.

5000|$|.....We're {{talking about}} my {{personal}} story and his personal story, and there's also a layer of pop culture that {{plays a role in}} the lyrics of the song.

That's just the way things are. We've actually lived through that as a band. All that stuff plays a role.|$|R
2500|$|After tip-off, Troy State scored {{their first}} basket after 54 seconds. Player Paul Bryan later said, jokingly, [...] "It {{was a little}} touch and go there early." [...] Despite their frenetic pace, the Trojans [...] "only" [...] had 15 points after the first three minutes. As the game settled into its soon-to-be record {{breaking}} groove, points came steadily; with 3:14 remaining in the first half, Troy eclipsed the 100-point mark. Guard Tommy Davis said, [...] "When you see one guy hitting, <b>then</b> <b>everybody</b> gets in the act. It becomes contagious." [...] At {{the end of the}} first half, the score was 123–53. They made 21 three-pointers in the first 20 minutes, and their 123 points had already broken their own NCAA single half record from the year before (103), which was also set against DeVry.|$|E

60|$|<b>Then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>everybody</b> {{broke into}} a fury of rage; maledictions and charges of treachery began to fly freely; yes, and even stones: a stone came near killing the Cardinal of Winchester--it just missed his head.

5000|$|... "The Fight Song" [...] was {{released}} as the album's second single on February 19, 2001 in the UK. A remix {{of the song}} by Joey Jordison of Slipknot appeared as its B-side. Its music video was directed by Manson and W.I.Z. and sparked controversy for its violent depiction of an American football game between jocks and goths, with NME accusing it of being exploitative of the Columbine tragedy. Manson dismissed the claims as hype, and said: [...] "I'm trying to show that sports as well as music {{can be seen as}} violent, so I chose a traditional black vs white, good vs evil theme for the video." [...] Manson appeared on an April 2001 episode of The O'Reilly Factor, where he once again denied that the band's music was responsible for Columbine. Bill O'Reilly argued that [...] "disturbed kids" [...] without direction from responsible parents could misinterpret the message of his music as endorsing the belief that [...] "when I'm dead <b>then</b> <b>everybody's</b> going to know me."
