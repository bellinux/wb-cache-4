40|$|Drawing upon a {{preliminary}} analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court’s decisions in environmental cases {{prepared for a}} January 29 Santa Clara Law Review symposium on “Big Business and <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court,” this essay assesses claims that <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court has shown itself to be particularly “pro-business” and hostile to environmental protection. A review of all eighteen environmental cases decided by <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court in its first four years finds little evidence of any “pro-business” inclination. Victories for business interests are balanced by losses. <b>The</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court’s environmental decisions may provide evidence for something else, however: a tendency to side with government agencies and state interests. While {{there is little evidence}} <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court is “pro-business” or “anti-environment,” there is some evidence to suggest it is “pro-government. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court has {{developed}} {{a reputation for being}} a 2 ̆ 2 pro-business 2 ̆ 2 court. This article, prepared for the 29 Santa Clara Law Review symposium on 2 ̆ 2 Big Business and <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court, 2 ̆ 2 seeks to offer a preliminary assessment of this claim with reference to <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions in environmental cases. Reviewing the environmental law decisions of <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court to date reveals no evidence of a 2 ̆ 2 pro-business 2 ̆ 2 bias. This does not disprove the claim that <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court is pro-business, but it may suggest the need to refine conventional descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court. <b>The</b> lack of a pro-business orientation in the environmental context does not mean the Court is not more business-friendly in other areas, such as preemption or securities litigation. Yet while there are no signs of a business-friendly approach to environmental cases, there are signs the Court tends to side with the government. Thus far in <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court, governmental interests have prevailed in environmental cases with greater frequency than business interests. This is only a preliminary assessment because <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court has only decided fourteen environmental law cases to date, and several more are pending. Nonetheless, if this pattern continues, then whether the Court hands down business-friendly decisions may depend on whether the political branches are or continue to be receptive to business interests...|$|R
40|$|This Article, {{prepared}} for the Case Western Reserve Law Review symposium on “Access to the Courts in <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Era,” offers a preliminary look at the standing jurisprudence of <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court. Contrary to claims made by some Court commentators, <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court has not tightened the requirements for Article III standing. To the contrary, insofar as <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court has altered the law of standing, it has {{made it easier for}} at least some litigants to pursue their claims in federal court. The Court’s decisions denying standing have largely reaffirmed prior holdings. By comparison, some of the Court’s decisions on standing, most notably Massachusetts v. EPA and, to a lesser extent, Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services Inc., have lowered the standing bar, perhaps quite significantly. Whatever else has transpired with regard to citizen “access to federal courts” in the first four years of <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court, standing for citizens to invoke the jurisdiction of federal courts remains in place...|$|R

40|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court at Age Three, Dean Erwin Chemerinsky {{offers a}} {{preliminary}} assessment of <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court. Among other things, Dean Chemerinsky reviews {{the effect of}} the Court 2 ̆ 7 s shrunken docket and the role of Justice Anthony Kennedy as the Court 2 ̆ 7 s median justice. Reviewing the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions over the past three years, Dean Chemerinsky concludes that <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court is <b>the</b> the most conservative Court since the mid- 1930 s. This is a substantial overstatement. <b>The</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court appears moderately more conservative than its predecessors in some contexts, but is also quite liberal in others. Its decisions on enemy combatants, capital punishment, and standing, among other issues, could hardly be characterized as conservative, however this term is defined. Furthermore, any assessment of <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court at this point is necessarily tentative. The current roster of justices have sat together for less than three full terms, and the small size of the docket means any single term provides an unrepresentative picture of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence. While <b>the</b> <b>Roberts</b> Court may eventually show itself to be a conservative court, there is no basis at present to claim the Court is the most conservative in over seventy years...|$|R
