Trump had sold all but 36 of the building's 486 residential condos at the end of 2012, and 15 remained unsold at the end of 2013. By May 15, 2014 only six units remained for sale including three that were used as the sales center and sales models.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2008, {{construction}} crews {{made the}} last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower's concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour {{at the top of}} the Trump tower. Though Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the <b>topping</b> <b>off</b> party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for the windows to be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin's critical opinion is that the spire is not aesthetically complementary.|$|E

Then a steady pressure is achieved and held until the [...] "topping-off" [...] phase when the tanks are nearly full. <b>Topping</b> <b>off</b> {{is a very dangerous}} time in handling oil, and the procedure is handled particularly carefully. Tank-gauging equipment is used to tell the person in charge how much space is left in the tank, and all tankers have at least two independent methods for tank-gauging. As the tanker becomes full, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the pumping facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.|$|E
500|$|After {{the closure}} of the 2005 season in October, the White Water Landing log flume ride was retired. [...] Although the ride was disassembled, the station was left intact and now serves as Maverick's on-ride photo booth and queue.

500|$|The {{continued}} {{rapid population}} growth led more businesses to the valley {{to take advantage of}} the labor pool, and manufacturing, particularly in the electronics sector, continued to grow. The convention and tourism industries saw rapid expansion during the 1960s, with tourism becoming the third largest industry by the end of the decade. In 1960 the Phoenix Corporate Center opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, <b>topping</b> <b>off</b> at 341 feet. The 1960s saw many other buildings constructed as the city expanded rapidly, including the Rosenzweig Center (1964), today called Phoenix City Square, the landmark Phoenix Financial Center (1964), as well as many of Phoenix's residential high-rises. [...] In 1965 the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum was opened at the Arizona State Fairgrounds, west of downtown. When Phoenix was awarded a NBA franchise in 1968, which would be called the Phoenix Suns, they played their home games at the Coliseum until 1992, after which they moved to America West Arena. In 1968, the Central Arizona Project was approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, assuring future water supplies for Phoenix, Tucson, and the agricultural corridor in between.

500|$|The skyscraper, {{which has}} shaped Manhattan's {{distinctive}} skyline, has been {{closely associated with}} New York City's identity {{since the end of}} the 19th century. From 1890 to 1973, the title of world's tallest building resided continually in Manhattan (with a gap between 1901 and 1908, when the title was held by Philadelphia City Hall), with nine different buildings holding the title. The New York World Building on Park Row, was the first to take the title in 1890, standing [...] until 1955, when it was demolished to construct a new ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge. The nearby Park Row Building, with its 29 stories standing [...] high took the title in 1899. The 41-story Singer Building, constructed in 1908 as the headquarters of the eponymous sewing machine manufacturer, stood [...] high until 1967, when it became the tallest building ever demolished. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, standing [...] at the foot of Madison Avenue, wrested the title in 1909, with a tower reminiscent of St Mark's Campanile in Venice. The Woolworth Building, and its distinctive Gothic architecture, took the title in 1913, <b>topping</b> <b>off</b> at [...] Structures such as the Equitable Building of 1915, which rises vertically forty stories from the sidewalk, prompted the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, requiring new buildings to withdraw progressively at a defined angle from the street as they rose, in order to preserve a view of the sky at street level.|$|E

2500|$|Balao {{stood out}} of Pearl Harbor on 4 December and rendezvoused with [...] and [...] en route Tanapag Harbor. The trio of {{submarines}} reached port on 15 December and moored in a nest alongside Fulton. After <b>topping</b> <b>off</b> fuel, water, and provisions on 17 December, they got underway to patrol the Yellow Sea in a coordinated attack group. Until 2 January 1945, their only contacts were fishing craft and floating mines. On that day, however, Balao sighted the masts of a sailing vessel. She closed the three masted schooner and surfaced to attack. Her first two torpedoes missed the target, but the third hit squarely amidships and sank the vessel. That day proved to be lucky for Balao because, later that night, {{she picked up a}} larger ship on radar and successfully moved into position. Early on 8 January, she fired six torpedoes, three of which scored; but the stubborn [...] "tanker" [...] remained afloat despite being dead in the water. Balao fired seven more torpedoes for three more direct hits, but the target still refused to sink. The submarine closed in on the badly damaged tanker and fired another trio of fish, one of which struck the final blow. However, Japanese records examined after the war indicate that Balaos victim on this occasion was not a tanker, but the 5,244-ton freighter Daigo Maru.

2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. <b>Topping</b> <b>off</b> the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic power steering unit, the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the Pontiac, Michigan plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production. The 1988 Mera seen as the most sought after model and tops the Fiero list in resale value this model is commonly used to create [...] "kit cars" [...] (replicas of high end sports cars).|$|E

50|$|After touring for The Terror {{wrapped up}} in 2014, {{longtime}} member Kliph Scurlock was supposedly fired from the band because he called out Christina Fallin - musician, friend of Wayne Coyne, and daughter of Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma - for cultural appropriation after Christina wore a Native American headdress.

The following year, they assisted her with recording Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz, and went on tour as her backing band in 2015 {{in support of the}} album. All of this helped accumulate an idea for what Oczy Mlody was going to sound like, which is generally described as a back-to-basics of the pop sensibilities touched upon with 1999's The Soft Bulletin and 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, while also building up on the ambient feel of their last album, The Terror, and <b>topping</b> it <b>off</b> with an influence of Miley Cyrus's most recent album thrown all into one sound.|$|R
