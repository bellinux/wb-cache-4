30|$|The {{objective}} of PPDM is to effectively protect private information while retaining the knowledge contained in <b>the</b> original <b>data.</b> It often uses {{methods such as}} swap (Chun et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2009), modification (Yang and Qiao 2010; Zhu et al. 2009) and deletion (Herranz et al. 2010) operations to protect <b>the</b> original <b>data</b> so that no correlation exists between <b>the</b> original <b>data</b> and <b>the</b> resultant protected <b>data.</b> As a result, it cannot recover <b>the</b> original <b>data</b> from <b>the</b> protected <b>data.</b> If <b>the</b> original <b>data</b> is lost, <b>the</b> users cannot verify the authenticity of <b>the</b> protected <b>data,</b> which then creates issues with knowledge uncertainty (Herranz et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2013; Hong et al. 2010).|$|R
