5|$|The Golden Age of Trucking Museum {{featured}} {{a collection of}} historic trucks, cars and other items related to the trucking operation, with a special focus on trucking in the 1950s. Many of the historic vehicles on display were noted for their rarity or otherwise unique quality. These include the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1902 Merry Oldsmobile, and a 1928 Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company five-to-seven ton dump truck, one of only 55 Pierce-Arrow trucks produced. The displays included a 1916 Mack Paddy Wagon, a 1929 Diamond T truck, a 1931 Ford Model AA Service Car, a 1936 Ford Roadster Deluxe and a Model T Ford <b>Tank</b> <b>Truck.</b> A 1953 Fageol moving van with original owner's banner was located near some surreys and carriages. Other early period vehicles on display included a 1912 Autocar two-cylinder transit bus, a 1914 Trumbull, a 1915 Barker, and a 1917 Republic Model 10 1-ton express and a 1920 3 ½ ton Model AC Mack.|$|E
5|$|The Terminator kills Sarah's {{mother and}} impersonates her when Sarah, {{unaware of the}} Terminator's ability to mimic victims, {{attempts}} to contact her via telephone. When they realize he has reacquired them, they escape in a pickup truck. In the ensuing chase, Kyle is wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Enraged‚ Sarah knocks the Terminator off his motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator hijacks a <b>tank</b> <b>truck</b> and attempts to run down Sarah, but Kyle slides a pipe bomb onto the tanker, causing an explosion that burns the flesh from the Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them to a factory, where Kyle activates machinery to confuse the Terminator. He jams his final pipe bomb into the Terminator's abdomen, blowing the Terminator apart, injuring Sarah, and killing Kyle. The Terminator's still functional torso reactivates and grabs Sarah. She breaks free and lures it into a hydraulic press, crushing it.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} shift {{scheduling}} of <b>tank</b> <b>trucks</b> for a small oil company. Given are a set of <b>tank</b> <b>trucks</b> with different characteristics {{and a set of}} drivers with different skills. The objective is to assign a feasible driver to every shift of the <b>tank</b> <b>trucks</b> such that legal and safety restrictions are satisfied, the total working times of the drivers are within desired intervals, requested vacation of the drivers is respected and the trucks are assigned to more favored drivers. We propose a two-phase solution algorithm which is based on a mixed integer linear programming formulation and an improvement procedure. Computational results are reported showing that the algorithm is able to generate feasible schedules in a small amount of time.

2500|$|Within [...] of Manila, the Army had six airfields (Clark, Nichols, Nielson, Iba, Del Carmen, and Rosales), two {{of which}} were {{auxiliary}} strips nearing completion. Another four auxiliary strips were begun in November: O'Donnell and San Fernando near Clark, San Marcelino northwest of Subic Bay, and Ternate west of Cavite (Ternate and San Fernando were never finished). No strips were planned on Bataan, despite its prominence in strategic war planning. In August and October 1941, the War Department allocated US$9,273,000 (approximately $150 million in 2015 dollars) to construct and improve airfields, most of which was spent constructing a concrete runway at Nichols Field (the only hard-surfaced runway in the Philippines). Additional graded strips were also added or extended to the grass runways at Clark Field, {{with the rest of}} the allocated funds used to build the auxiliary fields. The auxiliary strips were dirt-surfaced and without maintenance, servicing, communications, or control facilities. The dust clouds generated by takeoffs at all strips except Nichols seriously hampered flight operations, with numerous mishaps that destroyed many aircraft, killed pilots, and reduced the assigned strength of already tiny combat missions. The use of expedients to cut down the dust, including a molasses mixture deposited by a <b>tank</b> <b>truck,</b> was unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A local {{municipality}} {{has decided}} to build a sewage pit to receive residential sewage waste arriving by <b>tank</b> <b>trucks.</b> Daily accumulated waste are to be pumped to a nearby waste water treatment facility to be re-consumed for agricultural and construction projects. A discrete-event simulation model using Arena Software was constructed to assist in defining {{the capacity of the}} system in cubic meters, number of <b>tank</b> <b>trucks</b> to use the system, number of unload docks required, number of standby areas needed and manpower required for data collection at entrance checkpoint and <b>truck</b> <b>tank</b> load toxicity testing. The results of the model are statistically validated.
