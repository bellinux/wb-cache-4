A tornado that {{was associated with}} the main supercell touched down briefly near Fulda, Minnesota, at 3:55pm, while the Comfrey tornado was also on the ground. It was rated as an F1 and caused minor damage. Three other tornadoes <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> unrelated to the main supercell were confirmed as well; one in southeast Minnesota near Wabasha and two in Wisconsin.

While both the victims involved {{and the amount of}} the settlement remained confidential, another step was taken to provide justice to those whom had suffered at the hands of Sandusky. As of November 27, 2015, the total amount that Penn State owed victims of the Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal was close to $93 million. An audit of the university’s financial statements for the 2015 year (ending June 30) revealed that Penn State had made new payments totaling $33.2 million <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> related to the actions of Jerry Sandusky. The audit also indicated that Penn State has already paid or agreed to pay 32 claims relevant to this matter.|$|E

After having received [...] "about 40 scripts <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> set in the 60s, or had me playing advertising guys", Hamm was pleased that the movie offered a role [...] "the opposite to Don Draper".

500|$|Art Ross {{feared that}} Conacher {{would not be}} able to return to his {{previous}} form due to losing four seasons to military service when he was in his physical prime and opted to trade him. Prior to the 1946–47 season, Ross sent Conacher to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for Joe Carveth. Conacher excelled with Detroit. He led the team with 30 goals and 54 points, seventh best in the league, and scored four goals in one game <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> assisted by Billy Taylor on a night where the latter player set an NHL record with seven assists. Art Ross, once asked what his biggest mistake as a general manager was, replied [...] "trading Roy Conacher".|$|E
500|$|While {{the ship}} was immobilized, Admiral Ciliax {{transferred}} to Z29. The engine room crews managed to restart the first turbine at 15:49, nearly twenty minutes after the mine explosion.

Once {{the ship was}} back under way, twelve Beauforts launched a 10-minute attack that was beaten off by anti-aircraft fire and the escorting Luftwaffe fighters. The British carried {{out a series of}} attacks <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> unsuccessful; Scharnhorsts anti-aircraft guns were red-hot {{by the end of the}} action, and one 20mm gun had burst from the strain.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{invention}} of movable type, highly variable spacing was created that could create spaces of any size, and allowed for perfectly even justification. Early American, English, and other European typesetters' style guides (also known as printers' rules) specified spacing standards <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> essentially identical from the 18th century onwards. [...] These guides—e.g., Jacobi in the UK (1890) and MacKellar, Harpel, and De Vinne (1866–1901) in the U.S.—indicated that sentences should be em-spaced, and that words should be 1/3 or 1/2 em-spaced. [...] The relative size of the sentence spacing would {{vary depending on the}} size of the word spaces and the justification needs. [...] For most countries, this remained the standard for published work until the 20th century. [...] Yet, even in this period, there were publishing houses (notably in France) that used a standard word space between sentences—a technique called French spacing.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Pip, the Narissa dragon {{was allowed}} {{to be more of}} a fantasy {{character}} while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain. The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch. When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the Woolworth Building while clutching Robert in her claws, a greenscreen rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements. The rig was a [...] "puppeteering" [...] approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} {{were given a}} middling to positive response overall, and the final song, [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know", received the most enthusiastic reception. Bell called it the [...] "highlight of the episode", and it was Hankinson's favorite performance: [...] "Bomer and Criss did a fantastic job bringing it to life". Futterman said that [...] "it was initially disconcerting to envision" [...] two brothers singing about a [...] "former love", but she noted that it [...] "was less weird in context". Flandez felt that with the song's conversion to a [...] "Cain-and-Abel therapy session", despite being [...] "gorgeously sung", it was nevertheless [...] "the most disappointing duet ever", but Slezak gave the performance an [...] and wrote, [...] "I bought the sibling angst in the room, and Matt Bomer really is a charismatic fella, no?" [...] Strecker gave the song an [...] "A" [...] and stated, [...] "Shout-out to the Glee writers this episode for not only picking fun songs, but also tracks <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> really great lyrically in terms of moving the plot forward." ...|$|E
500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, because {{you want to have a}} good time. I hate having to skip a track. I wanted to make an album you can just play." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Eric Goldman {{praised the}} performances of John Slattery and Peyton List, and said the episode [...] "took three of the show's best characters and rocked their worlds in very different ways, telling three separate stories <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> utterly involving and moving, and delivering one of the show's best episodes ever in the process. This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written {{they were kind of}} transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re telling it) is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E

Peter also learns about a pomegranate martini from In Style magazine.

Peter and Brian watch the movie Wild Hogs, which Peter predicts will suck. The western spoof film Blazing Saddles is referenced when Peter and the other men are dancing and singing, [...] "The French Mistake". [...] "Family Gay" [...] makes two references to musicals. While in the doctor's office, Peter's doctor makes a reference to the song [...] "Seasons of Love" [...] from the musical Rent and while reading Flowers in the Attic by V. C. Andrews Peter listens to the song [...] "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" [...] from the musical The Sound of Music, sung by Charmian Carr.|$|E
500|$|Malley's stay {{increasingly}} involved him in {{the fighting}} in China; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940. In May 1938, he advised the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams: [...] "there is a first-class war on here, which must eventually affect Australia and its defence schemes". Williams {{and other members of}} the RAAF may, however, have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role in China, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects. In one letter, he regaled Williams with stories of an inspection tour around the country, declaring: [...] "I... can just imagine how much you would have enjoyed it– landing on aerodromes <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> polished up for inspection. Being met by provincial dignitaries and lavishly entertained. I had to drink every conceivable Chinese wine that was ever made, and to eat foods unheard of in Australia!" [...] At any rate, Malley's reports of Japanese air tactics, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government.|$|E

500|$|Howe and {{his troops}} began to arrive outside New York Harbour {{and made an}} uncontested landing on Staten Island to the west in early July. Howe, whose orders from Lord George Germain, the Secretary of State {{responsible}} for directing the war from Westminster, were fairly clear that he should avoid conflict {{before the arrival of}} reinforcements, then waited until those reinforcements arrived in mid-August, along with the naval commander, his brother Richard. This delay proved to be somewhat costly, since the Americans used this time to improve fortifications on northwestern Long Island (at Brooklyn Heights along the East River shoreline) and increased the size of their Continental Army with additional militia. After moving most of his army by amphibious barges across the Verazzano Narrows to southwestern Long Island without opposition, he attacked the American positions on 27 August in {{what became known as the}} Battle of Long Island. [...] In a well-executed manoeuvre, a large column led by Howe and Clinton passed around the American left flank, through the lightly guarded Jamaica Pass far to the east, (a ridge of hills running east to west bisected the island, with a series of lower entrances <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> guarded by Continentals except inexplicably to the farthest east at Jamaica), catching the Patriots off-guard and routing the Americans from their forward positions back into the entrenchments on Brooklyn Heights. [...] Despite the urging of Clinton and others, Howe decided against an immediate assault on these fortifications, claiming [...] "the Troops had for that day done handsomely enough." [...] He instead began siege operations, methodically advancing on the entrenched Americans. This decision allowed General Washington to successfully orchestrate a nighttime strategic withdrawal across the East River on the night of 29–30 August, aided by a thick morning fog. Historian George Bilias notes that had Howe attacked Brooklyn Heights, the capture of even half of Washington's army, and possibly Washington himself, might have had a significant effect on the rebellion. Some officers, notably General Clinton, were critical of Howe's decision not to storm the American works. Howe was knighted as a reward for his victory on Long Island.|$|E
