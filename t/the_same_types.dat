5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types.</b> Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E

5|$|While various {{religions}} and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through {{concepts such as}} theistic evolution, there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their {{religions and}} who raise various objections to evolution. As had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844, the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> of natural causes as other inherited traits in animals. In some countries, notably the United States, these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creation–evolution controversy, a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education. While other scientific fields such as cosmology and Earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts, evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists.|$|E

40|$|Genomic DNA {{extracted}} from 45 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) isolates was cleaved with HindIII and HaeIII {{and subjected to}} agarose gel electrophoresis. The ability of this method (restriction endonuclease analysis [REA]) to distinguish strains at the subspecies level was compared with results previously determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Chart reviews were performed to provide a clinical correlation of possible epidemiologic relatedness. A likely clinical association was found for 29 patients as part of two outbreaks. REA found 21 of 21 isolates were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>type</b> in <b>the</b> first outbreak, with PFGE calling 19 strains <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>type.</b> In <b>the</b> second outbreak with eight patient isolates, HindIII found six were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>type</b> and two were unique types. HaeIII found three strains were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>type,</b> two strains were a separate type, and three more strains were unique types, while PFGE found three were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>type</b> and five were unique types.

25|$|Writing {{systems were}} preceded by proto-writing, which used pictograms, ideograms and other {{mnemonic}} symbols.
