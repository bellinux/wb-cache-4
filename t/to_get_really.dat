Owen's story and connection with fellow character Cristina has been a topic of discussion. McKidd said: [...] "Between him [...] and her , it’s going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>really</b> complex and kind of tense and explosive."

500|$|The {{production}} {{continued at}} the Westside Theatre with an open-ended commercial {{run with the}} casting strategy of rotating 4-week casts because it enabled the production to pursue higher caliber actors. Nora Ephron stated at one question and answer session: [...] "We keep re-casting it {{so we can get}} really great actresses to come for four weeks. It is really hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>really</b> good people to work Off-Broadway for six months because it does not pay much, but you can get them for four weeks." [...] Other well-known actresses who have performed in the Off-Broadway production include the following: Carol Kane, Debra Monk, Janeane Garofalo, Fran Drescher, Melissa Joan Hart, Brooke Shields, Victoria Clark, Tovah Feldshuh, Loretta Swit, Mary Testa, Nikki Blonsky, Donna McKecknie, B. Smith and Marla Maples. , it was the second-longest running show in the history of Westside Theatre.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>really</b> into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>really</b> depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the critics' final {{scores were}} {{affected}} by the cliffhanger, which most found unsatisfactory, while others left the game unrated until the second episode. Davison wrote that the game is a [...] "fine return to form for the series" [...] that [...] "very much feels {{like one of the}} first two Broken Sword games," [...] but [...] "frustratingly" [...] "ends with a cliffhanger just as things are starting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>really</b> interesting in this regard." [...] Although finding it a [...] "natural break" [...] and saying that [...] "What's here is very good indeed and absolutely well worth your time," [...] he noted that buying the separate episode before the full release depends on [...] "your own tolerance to cliffhangers." [...] Thew was upset with how the game ends with an [...] "egregious cliffhanger" [...] without a [...] "sense of resolution". He still said that [...] "Even if it hasn’t been entirely satisfying," [...] it is a [...] "thoroughly enjoy" [...] game that [...] "has been a lot of fun so far." [...] He closed stating that people unfimiliar with the game being wary because of it being [...] "half-finished", he wouldn't hesitate to recommend the game to fans and hoped and believed that Revolution would deliver a [...] "fulfilling conclusion" [...] and [...] "great finale". Edge wrote that the game [...] "offers much of the same charismatic virtual tourism and intrigue that has held the brand in such high regard for so long" [...] and [...] "certainly take and recreate some of the best elements of their previous adventures," [...] but feared that it did not offer enough innovation to [...] "drag players away from" [...] newer point-and-click offerings and hoped that the second episode would [...] "offer a narrative curveball to shock the series into a new era rather than simply riffing on its past." [...] McDonald felt like the game was [...] "one big title that's been chopped in half" [...] which closes just as [...] "the big mystery is really only beginning to kick off" [...] and doesn't feel [...] "normally self-contained," [...] making it difficult to score the game, as the quality of it [...] "hinges so badly {{on the quality of the}} second episode;" [...] this made him wary of recommending it [...] "too highly" [...] to someone who is not familiar with the series until the second episode's release and finished off writing: [...] "I hope that, when episode two launches, I'll be bemoaning my own idiocy and falling over myself to award the complete game a much higher score [...]" [...] Osborn deemed the first episode of The Serpent's Curse [...] "immensely entertaining so far" [...] and [...] "one of 2013's unexpected pleasures." ...|$|E

60|$|Harold's new-found affection was {{as deep as}} his nature. An {{only child}} who had in his memory nothing of a mother's love, his {{naturally}} affectionate nature had in his childish days found no means of expression. A man child can hardly pour out his full heart to a man, even a father or a comrade; and this child had not, in a way, the consolations of other children. His father's secondary occupation of teaching brought other boys {{to the house and}} necessitated a domestic routine which had to be exact. There was no place for little girls in a boys' school; and though many of Dr. An Wolf's friends who were mothers made much of the pretty, quiet boy, and took him to play with their children, he never seemed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>really</b> intimate with them. The equality of companionship was wanting. Boys he knew, and with them he could hold his own and yet be on affectionate terms. But girls were strange to him, and in their presence he was shy. With this lack of understanding of the other sex, grew up a sort of awe of it. His opportunities of this kind of study were so few that the view never could become rectified.|$|E

I remembered the day when news had been brought me that the old Vitelli, who was then ruler of Castello, had murmured certain things about me which caused my neck to itch uncomfortably--and upon this I had entrusted my little brother to a relative, {{who was one of the}} canons of the cathedral, and the palace to my steward, and mounting my horse, ridden off with all possible haste. I had supposed that a few months would calm the angry Vitelli, but the months had lengthened out into years, and his death had come before his forgiveness. But now I really was back, and I did not mean to go away; my travels had taught me caution, and my intrigues at Forli given me enough excitement for some time. Besides, I was going to marry and rear a family; for, as if Fortune could not give scantily, I had gained a love as well as a home, and everything I wished was granted.|$|E
