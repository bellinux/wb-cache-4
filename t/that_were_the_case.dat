25|$|Mansell's {{return to}} Williams was not straightforward. He {{would agree to}} return only if a list of demands were met, {{including}} undisputed number one status over Riccardo Patrese (who had also been his teammate in 1988), guarantees of support {{in a wide variety}} of areas with each guarantee in writing, and assurances from suppliers such as Renault and Elf that they would do everything necessary to help him win. Frank Williams said the demands were 'impossible'; Mansell concluded that if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> he would be happy to retire. Three weeks later the impossible had happened and Mansell was a Williams driver.|$|E

Instead the sixteen teams were divided into four 'geographical groupings', which also took into account the teams' strengths and even political considerations; the system ensured that Israel and Morocco would not be drawn to face each other after Morocco had earlier threatened to withdraw from the tournament, as they had done from the Olympic football tournament two years earlier, if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

She finished in saying that she [...] "enjoyed" [...] the song played {{at the end of the}} episode, 'Maybe' by Ingrid Michaelson [...] "was both cheery and melancholy enough to fit the moment".

Jack Ford, a former homicide detective, was chosen to head the investigation, with Aubrey Jackson of the Commonwealth Police assisting. The resulting police report was released on 5 January 1968, but did not record any definitive findings {{due to a lack}} of evidence. Senior pathologist James McNamara was consulted about what might have happened to Holt's body, and suggested that it may have trapped by kelp and then consumed by sea creatures (specifically sharks, crayfish, and/or sea lice). If <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> [...] "the body would have been reduced to a skeleton in a period as short as 24 to 48 hours".

2500|$|Compared to {{the first}} {{generation}} Ridgeline, Honda's second attempt at a mid-size truck for the North American market has the automotive press changing its tune, yet it still has an image problem.

[...] If <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the Ridgeline would outsell all of the other midsize trucks by a landslide, boasting the best combination of safety, utility and drivability in the class. [...] But the Toyota Tacoma and Chevrolet Colorado both have something that the Ridgeline almost completely lacks: ...bravado." [...] That being said, Car and Driver magazine proclaimed, [...] "The Ridgeline’s roomy cabin, ample storage, smooth ride, and innovative touches make its rivals seem outdated. ...it not only has cargo space, but also the makings of a great tailgate party..." [...] Motor Trend magazine summed up their view by says they liked [...] "its smooth ride and sharp handling," [...] disliked [...] "the high price, clumsy infotainment system, and plain design," [...] and nominated the new Ridgeline as one of its finalist for their 2017 Truck of the Year competition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease is}} theorized {{to include the}} artery of the ligmentum teres femoris being {{constricted}} or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. [...] The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. [...] LCP disease is a vascular restrictive condition of idiopathic nature. [...] Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. [...] Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area. [...] For example, a child may be six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year- old child, but lacking the bone strength of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics {{do not appear to}} be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a series}} of adventures with Generation X, Howard gets {{a job as a}} {{department}} store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole, where the real Santa Claus has sold out to Hydra. [...] Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of Reed Richards. [...] This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing's swamp. [...] While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard went off on his own and was captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrapped him in swaddling clothes. [...] Although we last saw him in the swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. [...] The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside him, which he knows because it is making him nauseous. [...] Man-Thing enters his gullet, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but the former is left desiccated and practically dead. He then encountered Namor, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explains {{that he would not be}} lugging his friend's body if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> [...] Howard sets Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during the conversation with Namor. [...] Once he sees that Man-Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says he is returning to Cleveland.|$|E

She did not leave the house once except in her aunt's company, and restrained herself even from leaning over the wicket-gate and listening to the voice of Fanny Heisse.
