5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> the basil varies due to the varying types and {{quantities}} of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
25|$|D. ambrosioides {{is used as}} a leaf vegetable, herb, and {{herbal tea}} for its pungent flavor. Raw, it has a resinous, {{medicinal}} pungency, similar to oregano, anise, fennel, or even tarragon, but stronger. <b>The</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> D. ambrosioides is strong but difficult to describe. A common analogy is to turpentine or creosote. It has also been compared to citrus, savory, and mint.|$|E
25|$|The {{story in}} the Vishnu Purana goes that Durvasa, while {{wandering}} the earth {{in a state of}} ecstasy due to a vow he was observing, came by a Vidyadhari(a nymph of the air) and demanded of her a heavenly wreath of flowers she was wearing. The nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on his brow. Resuming his wanderings, the sage came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Durvasa, still in his state of frenzy, threw the garland at Indra, who caught it and placed it on Airavata's head. The elephant was irritated by <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk. Durvasa was enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland was cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa's forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or even soften his curse and went on his way. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and shorn of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods. The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras and work together with them to churn the ocean of milk and obtain the Amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing it with them. Vishnu promised that he would ensure only the devas drank the Nectar and obtained immortality so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu's advice and called their truce with the asuras and thus did the gods and demons begin planning their great enterprise.|$|E

500|$|Tipu Sultan built {{a wooden}} colonnaded palace called the Dariya Daulat Palace (lit, [...] "garden {{of the wealth}} of the sea") in Srirangapatna in 1784. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, the palace is known for its {{intricate}} woodwork consisting of ornamental arches, striped columns and floral designs, and paintings. The west wall of the palace is covered with murals depicting Tipu Sultan's victory over Colonel Baillie's army at Pollilur, near Kanchipuram in 1780. One mural shows Tipu enjoying <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> a bouquet of flowers while the battle is in progress. In that painting, the French soldiers' moustaches distinguish them from the cleanshaven British soldiers. Also in Srirangapatna is the Gumbaz mausoleum, built by Tipu Sultan in 1784. It houses the graves of Tipu and Haider Ali. The granite base is capped with a dome built of brick and pilaster.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> S by Shakira is {{categorized}} as a [...] "transparent oriental", {{and according to}} Shakira's official website, it is inspired by [...] "what is unique and exceptional about her, her light".

The top notes include citrus, peach, and passion fruit chord; the heart notes give a [...] "spicy freshness" [...] through the use of various flowers like gardenia and sambac jasmine, and cinnamon; the base notes consist of amber, musk, sandalwood and vanilla chord. The fragrance is meant to be used by women, and Shakira claimed that [...] "The type of women who feel a connection with this fragrance would be independent and strong, but also a woman with a great capacity to love and a strong sense of who they are. It’s for a woman who believes in herself." ...|$|E

500|$|... "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{was widely}} {{acclaimed}} by contemporary music critics, who applauded Beyoncé's vocal performance {{and called the}} song her best yet. Billboard magazine's critic Chuck Taylor wrote that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is Beyoncé's [...] "most affecting offering" [...] since [...] "Listen" [...] (2006). He praised her vocals as [...] "breathtaking, exquisitely emotive, mournful, and mature" [...] and added that the song [...] "exudes <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> a Grammy Award". According to Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times, [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is Beyoncé's Streisand moment and [...] "a tender, fairly simple ballad that [...] uses to prove she's a great vocal actress". Powers concluded, [...] "This isn't just another breakup song; it's an elegy for female empowerment, Beyoncé's admission {{that no amount of}} money, fame or skill can solve the basic inequity between her man's heart and her own." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] could become as commercially successful as [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] because of its radio-friendly appeal. James Montgomery of MTV News complimented the [...] "tear-jerking power" [...] of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] and noted that it reveals [...] "sides of Beyoncé we never knew existed".|$|E
500|$|According to Inside the Hits, {{the lyrics}} {{refer to the}} commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> her perfume. Jackson's vocal range spanned from a high {{baritone}} to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of [...] "Billie Jean", the singer's vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute {{and is in the}} key of F minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby's eyes resemble Jackson's, a voice laments, [...] "oh no". This is met with Jackson's signature falsetto [...] "hee hee". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson's vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean's child.|$|E
2500|$|In the 4th and 5th centuries, various Church Fathers {{wrote that}} the Gospel of Thomas was highly valued by Mani. In the 4th century, Cyril of Jerusalem {{mentioned}} a [...] "Gospel of Thomas" [...] twice in his Catechesis: [...] "The Manichæans also wrote a Gospel according to Thomas, which being tinctured with <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> the evangelic title corrupts {{the souls of the}} simple sort." [...] and [...] "Let none read the Gospel according to Thomas: for it is the work not of one of the twelve Apostles, but of one of the three wicked disciples of Manes." [...] The 5th century Decretum Gelasianum includes [...] "A Gospel attributed to Thomas which the Manichaean use" [...] in its list of heretical books.|$|E

2500|$|Of a {{study that}} Van Gogh made for Girl in a Wood or Girl in White in the Woods, he remarked at how much he enjoyed the work and {{explains}} how he wishes to trigger the audience's senses and how they may experience the painting: [...] "The other study in the wood is of some large green beech trunks on a stretch of ground covered with dry sticks, and the little figure of a girl in white. There was the great difficulty of keeping it clear, and of getting space between the trunks standing at different distances - and the place and relative bulk of those trunks change with the perspective - {{to make it so}} that one can breathe and walk around in it, and to make you smell <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> the wood." ...|$|E
2500|$|McBride Industrial District is {{the area}} {{incorporating}} the McBride Industrial Park located between Fair Lawn Borough's border with Glen Rock and the Chandler Houses and Fair Lawn Commons communities. It currently houses the former Nabisco cookie factory, which has {{played a major role}} in not only Fair Lawn's identity itself, but also Glen Rock, Ridgewood, Paterson, Prospect Park, Haledon, Hawthorne, and Western Paramus near the Dunkerhook and Saddle River Areas, causing those venturing throughout these areas to coin the nickname [...] "Cookie-City" [...] as a general area term, describing <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> freshly baked cookies that filled these areas on baking days. In the past, the McBride Industrial District took up both sides of Route 208, stretching from Fair Lawn Avenue to the intersection at Maple Avenue and Harristown Road, running up to the Bergen County Line train tracks via the Radburn District, and housing companies such as Nabisco, Kodak, Maxell, and others. More recently the district has been in the process of deindustrialization and corporate gentrification, as older companies fold or move out, replacing industrial properties with residential-commercial [...] "mini-cities", as well as the headquarters of New Jersey's Columbia Savings Bank.|$|E
2500|$|Task Review: Helene and Alex's {{team went}} with a brand called DUAL, which {{evolved from a}} bottle design {{provided}} by their product designer while they had struggled for name ideas. The team struggled on the first day, with Helene constantly arguing with Alex and Kevin being left to make most of the key decisions. Their dynamic greatly improved on the second day, {{to the point that}} they pulled together in time for their presentation. While <b>the</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> caramel and chocolate was loved, the bottle's design was seen as expensive to produce and therefore not fitting of its retail price, despite it being seen as innovative, especially with the feature of a detachable smaller bottle. Meanwhile, Claire and Lee's team named their fragrance R0ULETTE, playing on associations with gambling and James Bond, even using a '0' to give it a connection to a roulette wheel. While the team had no major issues and worked well together, their presentation saw the brand being criticised as likely to be unpopular with women buyers due to the gambling connotation in it, with the fragrance being described as boring in terms of experts regarding it as [...] "retro 50". However, while Sir felt that the theme of the brand was an issue, he declared them the winners of the task, as Helene and Alex's bottle design had proven to be fatally flawed.|$|E
