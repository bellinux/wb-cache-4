5|$|Carrie had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> {{an earlier}} writing {{appointment}} {{that she was}} expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

25|$|Rolfe took an {{interest}} in photography throughout his life, but never achieved any more than basic competence. While he began to experiment with photography when he was a schoolmaster, it was his time in Rome in 1889–90 that introduced him to the work of the 'Arcadian' photographers Wilhelm von Gloeden and Guglielmo Plüschow. His seminary, the Scots College, was quite close to Plüschow's studio in via Sardegna, just off the via Veneto, and when Rolfe was expelled from the College and came under the benevolent patronage of the Duchess Sforza Cesarini, he began his own photographic efforts in imitation of von Gloeden and Plüschow. His models were the local ragazzi from the streets of Genzano di Roma, a town dominated by the Duchess's palazzo. These youths were later to become the principal characters in Rolfe's Toto stories, published first in The Yellow Book in 1895–96 and later collected in Stories Toto <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> 1898 and In His Own Image in 1901.|$|E

500|$|The song's opening lyric {{was taken}} from the title of [...] "Something in the Way She Moves", a track by Harrison's fellow Apple Records artist James Taylor. While musically Harrison {{imagined}} the composition in the style of Ray Charles, his inspiration for [...] "Something" [...] was his wife, Pattie Boyd. In her 2007 autobiography, , Boyd recalls: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful..." [...] Boyd discusses the song's subsequent popularity among other recording artists and concludes: [...] "My favourite [...] was the one by George Harrison, which he played to me in the kitchen at Kinfauns." ...|$|E

500|$|When Philomena Goins Doctor {{found out}} what her son had done, she became enraged and {{threatened}} to disown him, shook him, then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to CBS' 60 Minutes, and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist Ed Bradley. Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore's story and Bradley's television exposé were full of lies. A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, {{to keep them from}} becoming bitter. [...] Michael D'Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, [...] "veryone <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up." [...] Robie Mortin described her past this way: [...] "I knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me. But I wasn't angry or anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{believe the}} police covered up what happened. On January 1, Liston's wife called Johnny Tocco {{and said she}} hadn't heard from her husband in three days and was worried. A few years before Tocco died, he {{allegedly}} told his good friend, Tony Davi, {{that he went to}} Liston's house and found the door locked and his car in the driveway. Tocco called the police, and they broke into the house. Tocco said that the living room furniture was in disarray, but the house did not yet smell of death. He said they found Sonny lying on his bed with a needle sticking out of his arm. Johnny left the house before the police did. [...] "Johnny wasn't a braggart," [...] Davi told Liston biographer Paul Gallender. [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the strictest confidence, but it was like he wanted to get it off his chest." [...] Gallender claims, [...] "A lot of officers knew Sonny was dead before Geraldine returned home on January 5, but they chose to let him rot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Shanghai and Hong Kong {{regularly}} perform highly {{in international}} assessments, Chinese education has both native and international detractors; common areas of criticism include its rigor; {{its emphasis on}} memorization and standardized testing; and the gap in quality of education between students of rural and urban areas. Jonathan Kaiman of The Guardian writes that Chinese parents and educators [...] "see their own system as corrupt, dehumanising, pressurised and unfair"; {{he went on to}} discuss the country's college admission exam (called the gaokao), writing that [...] "many parents consider the gruelling nine-hour test a sorting mechanism that will determine the trajectory of their children's lives." [...] In The New York Times, Helen Gao called China's educational system [...] "cutthroat" [...] and wrote that its positive reputation among admirers is largely built on a myth: While China has phenomenally expanded basic education for its people, quadrupling its output of college graduates in the past decade, it has also created a system that discriminates against its less wealthy and well-connected citizens, thwarting social mobility at every step with bureaucratic and financial barriers. A huge gap in educational opportunities between students from rural areas and those from cities {{is one of the main}} culprits. Some 60 million students in rural schools are 'left-behind' children, cared for by their grandparents as their parents seek work in faraway cities. While many of their urban peers attend schools equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and well-trained teachers, rural students often huddle in decrepit school buildings and struggle to grasp advanced subjects such as English and chemistry amid a dearth of qualified instructors. 'Rural students stand virtually no chance when competing academically with their urban counterparts,' Jiang Nengjie, a friend and independent filmmaker who made a documentary on the left-behind children, <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>In</b> The Chronicle of Higher Education, Lara Farrar argued that the disabled are [...] "shortchanged" [...] in Chinese schools, with very little chance of acceptance into higher educational institutions.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West {{constantly}} {{sought to}} improve Woolf's self-esteem, telling {{her not to}} think of herself as a sickly semi-reclusive who needed to hide herself from the world, but rather praised her for her health, her liveliness and sense of wit, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to a reappraisal of herself, helping her to develop a more positive self-image, and a sense that her writings were the products of her strengths, rather than her weakness. From the age of 15 on, Woolf had been led to believe by her father's doctor and her father that reading and writing had a deleterious effect on her nerves, and she needed to engage in physical labour like gardening to prevent a total collapse of her nerves, leading Woolf to spend her time obsessively engaging in physical labor. Woolf tended to push herself relentlessly until illness, whether real or imagined, became the only way that she could relax without guilt. Sackville-West was the first to persuade Woolf that her nervous aliments had been misdiagnosed, and she was better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves, advice that was taken. Under her influence, Woolf learned to spend her time switching from one form of intellectual activity to another, from writing a novel to a book review to reading a book, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength. In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: [...] "Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people? You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> London that you had at least six novels in your head but were being severe with yourself until you should go to Rodmell. Now you are at Rodmell and what of the six novels? Between Ottoline, Gertrude Stein, and bridal parties which cause you to faint, what time is there for Virginia?" [...] Sackville-West tried to persuade Woolf to learn to relax without guilt, telling her she would feel better if she only learned to rest.|$|E
