ESP released this bass as a signature model, available only in Japan, in the mid-to-late 1980s. Sometime during the late 1980s, he switched to an ESP Surveyor P-bass, which had nearly all the same specifications of his previous basses, but with a finished headstock. He began using Fender basses during {{the beginning of the}} 1990s, due to a falling out with ESP which, according to ESP Vice President Jeff Moore, was due to miscommunication. He began using Fender P-basses around the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Persistence</b> of Time until the release of his signature model. Bello had a signature model Fender Jazz bass. The model combines a Fender Aerodyne body with a Precision Bass-width neck, Alder body wood (as opposed to the Aerodyne's Basswood) and a mix of Precision and Jazz bass pickups along with non-standard custom-chosen hardware. Pickups used on the bass are Seymour Duncan SPB-3 precision bass pickup in the neck position and a Samarium Cobalt Noiseless Jazz Bass pickup in the bridge position, although Bello's personal bass now is equipped with EMG HZ Passive pickups which Bello prefers [...] "as the output is... a lot louder" [...] and he gets [...] "a lot more punch". Bello also had a signature Squier electric jazz bass. It features P/J style pick up combination and a skull inlay/body graphic.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{statistical}} structure of temporal distribution of the turbulent pressure fluctuations {{at the bottom of}} the hydraulic jump, in order to define their influence on the stability of the linings in stilling basins. The researches into the statistical characteristic of the fluctuating pressure have been mainly limited to the study of the instantaneous spatial structure; recently, moving from these results, a design criterion for suitable floor slabs was presented. This criterion was made neglecting the inertia force in the instantaneous equilibrium of the forces acting on the slab. This assumption is corrected if the stability of the slab is assured by its weight only. In the case of slabs anchored with steel bars the inertial force must be considered in the instantaneous equilibrium of the slab since the force acting on the steel bars is proportional to the displacement of the slab. This force depends on the temporal distribution of the turbulent pressure also. Theoretical and experimental analyses are presented and the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> of the pulsating pressure above a defined level and the maximum value of the pressure occurred in this time are defined.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{colonization}} dynamics of ampicillin-resistant and ampicillin-susceptible Escherichia coli strains in the infantile intestinal microbiota. Methods: We followed 128 infants {{over the first}} year of life with regular quantitative faecal cultures and recordings of antibiotic treatment. E. coli strains were quantified, and their resistance pattern and car-riage of b-lactamase genes (TEM, SHV and OXA), phylogenetic group (A, B 1, B 2 or D), virulence gene profile (fimA, papC, sfaD/E, kfiC neuB, hlyA and iutA) and <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> in the microbiota were determined. Results: Twelve percent (n 5 32) of the E. coli strains were resistant to ampicillin, as they carried the blaTEM (84 %) or blaSHV genes. Ampicillin-resistant strains belonged mostly to phylogenetic group D and carried pap genes (P 5 0. 023) significantly more often than ampicillin-susceptible strains due to a strong association between carriage of pap and blaSHV. In 31 of 32 cases, colonization by ampicillin-resistant strains occurred in infants not previously treated with b-lactam antibiotics. Ampicillin-resistant strains were equally capable as susceptible ones of persisting in the intestinal microbiota and did not have lower faecal population counts. Genes encoding b-lactamases were in most cases retained during the entire colonization period. Conclusions: The results suggest that ampicillin-resistant E. coli strains are not hampered in their colonizing capacity, and b-lactamase genes, therefore, may only slowly be eliminated from the com-mensal E. coli strain pool...|$|E

To gain insights into the genome stability of the L. rhamnosus GG in the human gastrointestinal tract and the possible adaption mechanism under different stresses, we first examined the genotype and phenotype of the L. rhamnosus GG grown over 1000 generations under various stresses, including bile salts, osmotic stress or shearing forces. Immunoblotting analysis of L. rhamnosus grown over 1000 generations showed that the production of mucus-binding pili by L. rhamnosus GG was the most impaired when exposed to bile salts. Complementary PCR screening of 13 highly variable chromosomal regions in GG confirmed that the pilus gene cluster had been lost when exposed to bile stress over time.

40|$|The {{detailed}} study of immune effector mechanisms in primate models of infectious disease has been limited by the inability to adoptively transfer lymphocytes from vaccinated animals into naı̈ve immunocompetent recipients. Recent advances {{in our understanding of}} the Major Histocompatibility Complex diversity of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques enabled the establishment of a breeding program to generate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) -identical animals. The current study utilised this resource to achieve an improved model of adoptive transfer of lymphocytes in macaques. The effect of route of transfusion on persistence kinetics of adoptively transferred lymphocytes was evaluated in an autologous transfer system. Results indicated that peripheral persistence kinetics were comparable following infusion by different routes, and that cells were detectable at equivalent levels in lymphoid tissues six weeks post-infusion. In a pilot-scale experiment, the persistence of adoptively transferred lymphocytes was compared in MHC-identical siblings and MHC-identical unrelated recipients.

Using phylogenetic inference, we quantified the proportion of transmitted drug-resistance originating from a treatment-naive source. METHODS:Using a novel phylotype-based approach, 24   550 HIV- 1 subtype B partial pol gene sequences from the UK HIV Drug Resistance database were analysed. Ongoing transmission of drug resistance amongst HIV-positive individuals was identified as phylotypes {{of at least three}} sequences with at least one shared drug resistance mutation, a maximum intra-clade genetic distance of 4. 0 % and a basal branch support at least 90 %. The <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> of the transmission chains was estimated using a fast least-squares molecular clock inference approach. RESULTS:Around 70 % of transmitted drug-resistance had a treatment-naive source. The most commonly transmitted mutations were L 90 M in the protease gene and K 103 N, T 215 D and T 215 S in reverse transcriptase. Reversion to wild type occurred at a low frequency and drug-independent reservoirs of resistance have persisted for up to 13 years. CONCLUSION:These results illustrate the impact of viral fitness on the establishment of resistance reservoirs and support the notion that earlier diagnoses and treatment of HIV infections are warranted for counteracting the spread of antiretroviral resistance. Phylotype-based phylogenetic inference is an attractive approach for the routine surveillance of transmitted drug resistance in HIV as well as in other pathogens for which genotypic resistance data are available...|$|E

Several PAIs {{are found in}} Escherichia coli strains that cause extraintestinal infections, but their role in commensal bowel colonization is unknown. Resident strains are enriched in adhesins (P fimbriae and type 1 fimbriae), capsular antigens (K 1 and K 5), hemolysin, and aerobactin and mostly belong to phylogenetic group B 2. Here, we investigated whether six pathogenicity islands and the virulence determinants malX and usp are associated with fitness of E. coli in the infant bowel microbiota. E. coli strains isolated from stools of 130 Swedish infants {{during the first year}} of life were examined for their carriage of PAI markers, malX, and usp by PCR. Carriage was related to strain persistence: long-term colonizers (≥ 12 months) carried significantly more of PAI II from strain CFT 703 (IICFT 703), IV 536, and IIJ 96 and malX and usp than intermediate colonizers (1 to 11 months) and transient strains (< 3 weeks). The accumulation of PAI markers in each individual strain correlated positively with its <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> in the colon. Phylogenetic group B 2 accounted for 69 % of long-term colonizers, 46 % of intermediate colonizers and 14 % of transient strains.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between radiologic findings and eradication of symptoms after pyloromyotomy in HPS. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty-five (102 boys and 23 girls) patients with suspected infantile HPS were treated surgically by Ramstedt pyloromyotomy between March 21, 2004 and March 20, 2014 at paediatric surgery ward of Tabriz Children′s Hospital, Iran. The demographic features, clinical findings, diagnostic work-up, operation type and postoperative specifications of the patients were studied retrospectively. Results: Male to female ratio was 4 : 1. The patients were 16 - 90 days of old and the mean age was 39 ± 1. 42 days. The range of pyloric canal length was 7. 60 - 29. 00 mm and the mean length was 19. 54 ± 3. 42 mm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bone contusions are {{frequently}} encountered in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) evaluation of knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Their role as indicators of injury severity remains unclear, primarily due to indeterminate levels of joint injury forces and {{to a lack of}} preinjury imaging. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to 1) quantify bone contusion pathogenesis following traumatic joint injuries using fixed imaging follow-ups, and 2) assess the feasibility of using longitudinal bone contusion volumes as an indicator of knee injury severity. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective sequential MRI follow-ups of a goat cohort exposed to controlled stifle trauma in vivo were compared to parallel clinical MRI follow-ups of a human ACL tear patient series. METHODS: Reproducible cartilage impact damage of various energy magnitudes was applied in a survival goat model, coupled with partial resection of anterior portions of medial menisci. Both emulate injury patterns to the knee osteochondral structures commonly encountered in human ACL injury imaging as well as instability from resultant ligament laxity. Longitudinal clinical MRI sequences portrayed stifle bone contusion evolution through 6 months after the inciting event. RESULTS: In the first 2 weeks, biological response variability dominated the whole-joint response with no apparent correlation to trauma severity. Control goats subjected to partial meniscectomy alone exhibited minimal bone response. Thereafter, 0. 6 J impact bone contusions portrayed a faster rate of resolution than those induced by 1. 2 J cartilage impacts.

The tumorigenic potential in vivo of live Eb cells was suppressed through local secretion of interleukin 4 (IL 4) or alternatively by injection of parental cells {{at a site}} refractory to tumor growth. Inoculation of nontumorigenic doses of live Eb or Eb-IL 4 cells led to long-lasting specific and systemic T-cell-mediated antitumor response requiring both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes. Irradiated cells offered only limited short-term protection, which could be marginally improved by IL 4. The more effective protection offered by vaccination with live tumor cells correlated with rapid migration and <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> tumor cells in the bone marrow of host animals after tumor cell inoculation. In contrast, irradiated Eb-lacZ cells had a short persistence. Tumor cells recovered from the bone marrow of host animals injected with live Eb-IL 4 cells still expressed IL 4. These observations indicate that {{in the course of}} vaccination with live Eb or Eb-IL 4 cells, a fraction of these cells escaped destruction by host mechanisms and persisted in a dormant state in the bone marrow for long periods <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Persistence</b> <b>of</b> dormant tumor in the bone marrow correlated with the duration of anti-tumor immunity...|$|R

The paper explores the analytical links between these phenomena. It provides evidence on the dynamics of product market competition in seven emerging economies by <b>time</b> series analysis <b>of</b> <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> corporate profitability during the 1980 s and 90 s. The surprising central finding is that the intensity of competition in emerging markets is no less than in advanced countries. The paper also briefly report on major change in the financing of corporate growth in India and considers its implications for the extant theories of law, finance and corporate governance. competition, persistency of profits, unit roots, emerging markets...|$|R
