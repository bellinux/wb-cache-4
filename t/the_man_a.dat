5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. <b>The</b> <b>man,</b> <b>a</b> Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>a</b> drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E

The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January the RIRA {{attacked}} Ebrington Army Barracks in Derry for {{a second}} time, firing a mortar over a perimeter fence. A mortar {{similar to the one}} used in the attack was found by Gardaí near Newtowncunningham on 13 February, and British army bomb disposal experts made safe another mortar found between Dungannon and Carrickmore on 12 April. On 1 August a 40lb bomb was discovered in a car at the long-stay car park of Belfast International Airport following a telephone warning, and was made safe with two controlled explosions by bomb disposal experts. In December a six-day security operation ended when a 70lb bomb found under railway tracks at Killeen Bridge near Newry was defused. The operation began following telephone warnings, and the road and railway line connecting Newry to Dundalk were closed due to security alerts. A pipe bomb was discovered at a police officer's home in Annalong, County Down on 3 January 2002, and two teenage boys were injured in County Armagh on 2 March when a bomb hidden in a traffic cone exploded. On 29 March 2002 the RIRA targeted {{a former member of the}} Royal Irish Regiment from Sion Mills, County Tyrone, with a bomb attached to his car that failed to explode.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the Axeman's victims were Italian immigrants or Italian-Americans, leading many {{to believe that the}} crimes were ethnically motivated. Many media outlets sensationalized this aspect of the crimes, even suggesting Mafia involvement despite lack of evidence. Some crime analysts have suggested that the killings were related to sex, and that the murderer was perhaps a sadist specifically seeking female victims. Criminologists Colin and Damon Wilson hypothesize that the Axeman killed male victims only when they obstructed his attempts to murder women, supported by cases in which the woman of the household was murdered but not <b>the</b> <b>man.</b> <b>A</b> less plausible theory is that the killer committed the murders in an attempt to promote jazz music, suggested by a letter attributed to the killer in which he stated that he would spare the lives of those who played jazz in their homes.|$|E

The team gave <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>a</b> small hand-held tracking device to pass along to his sister, with instructions for her to activate it when the Taliban leader returned home.

25|$|A Dutch {{vanguard of}} 6,000 Dutchmen, Germans and Scots under Prince William of Nassau was {{dispatched}} {{ahead of the}} main army with orders to capture various forts and redoubts placed on the left bank of the Scheltd river. Initially the army was going to Bergen op Zoom, where Frederick Henry had sent 50 river barges, but then moved to Lillo. On the night of 13/14 June they crossed the Scheldt, landing at Kildreck, and easily occupied the Fort of Liefkenshoek, {{near the village of}} Kallo. According to a Spanish official letter from June 30, 1638, the commander of the fort had previously been bribed with 24,000 silver coins to open the gates as they approached. According to other source, <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>a</b> captain called Maes, was not involved in any treachery but asked permission from the Dutch to save the life. The remaining garrison, caught by surprise, was massacred. William proceeded the following morning to attack the Forts of Sainte Marie and Isabelle, the latter built on the levee of Voorderweert. He also ordered the dykes of the Polder of Melsele to be demolished with the aim of flooding the area, but the low tide prevented this.|$|E

25|$|William Shakespeare was an actor, playwright, poet, and theatre {{entrepreneur}} in London {{during the}} late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras. He was baptised on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England, in the Holy Trinity Church. At age 18 he married Anne Hathaway {{with whom he had}} three children. He died in his home town of Stratford on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52. Though more is known about Shakespeare's life than those of most other Elizabethan and Jacobean writers, few personal biographical facts survive about him, which is unsurprising in the light of his social status as a commoner, the low esteem in which his profession was held, and the general lack of interest of the time in the personal lives of writers. Information about his life derives from public instead of private documents: vital records, real estate and tax records, lawsuits, records of payments, and references to Shakespeare and his works in printed and hand-written texts. Nevertheless, hundreds of biographies have been written and more continue to be, most of which rely on inferences and the historical context of the 70 or so hard facts recorded about Shakespeare <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>a</b> technique that sometimes leads to embellishment or unwarranted interpretation of the documented record.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>a</b> ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Nesbitt co-starred with Liam Neeson in the fact-based {{television film}} Five Minutes of Heaven (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2009). The {{first part of}} the film dramatises the real-life murder of Jim Griffin by Alistair Little in 1970s Lurgan; the second part features a fictional meeting between Little (Neeson) and Jim's brother Joe (Nesbitt) 33 years later. Nesbitt met with Griffin before filming began to learn about how his brother's murder affected him. The film was broadcast on BBC Two in April 2009. He also starred as Colour Sgt. Mike Swift in Peter Bowker's three-part BBC/Kudos television serial Occupation. In Occupation, set over six years, Nesbitt's character is one of three British soldiers who return to Basra, Iraq after their tours have concluded. He researched the role by speaking to Territorial Army soldiers in Belfast, and RAF officers in Morocco, where the serial was filmed. Both performances were commended by Independent journalist Hugh Montgomery; in a review of 2009's television, Montgomery named Nesbitt [...] "Face of the Year", writing, [...] "Just as you had James Nesbitt written off as the gurning embodiment of everything mediocre about British TV drama, he produced two stonking performances, as the transfixingly harrowed sergeant in Occupation, and a nervily vengeful victim's relative in Irish-troubles piece Five Minutes of Heaven.
