The <b>tassled</b> <b>scorpionfish</b> is an ambush predator {{that looks like}} part of a sea floor encrusted with coral and algae. It lies in wait on the sea floor for crustaceans and small fish, such as gobies, to pass by. Another ambush predator is the striated frogfish (right). They lie {{on the bottom and}} wave a conspicuous worm-like lure strategically attached above their mouth. Normally about 10cm (4in) long, they can also inflate themselves like puffers.|$|E
