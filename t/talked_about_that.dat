5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
500|$|... {{some little}} {{inconsistency}} in the defense, {{and the main}} part of it is this: There will be conversations here where Mr. Glasser wasn't present, where people have seen Mr. Kretske and they have <b>talked</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> they gave money to take care of Glasser, that is not binding on Mr. Glasser, and there is a divergency there, and Mr. Glasser feels that if I would represent Mr. Kretske the jury would get an idea that they are together [...] [...] [...] [...]|$|E
500|$|Heated discussions {{during the}} writing of Lions were rare, owing to the Robinson brothers' usual method in which Rich writes the music and Chris writes the lyrics. [...] "Soul Singing" [...] was the only song to cause disagreement; [...] "I'd written this part where {{although}} the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout. [...] I thought we should add something or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one. [...] So we <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> one for a while", Rich recalled.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was well received {{in part because}} of her sex appeal. For that reason, Sniper Wolf ranked as 37th [...] "hottest babe in games" [...] by GameDaily in 2008 and was included in UGO's list of the 50 [...] "hottest babes in games" [...] in 2011. She was ranked as the tenth sexiest PlayStation character by PlayStation Universe in 2010, who added that [...] "this character takes a special place in our hearts," [...] and in 2014 was included among the top 10 [...] "hottest" [...] female villains in gaming and [...] "old school hotties that still got it" [...] by Cheat Code Central's Travis Huber, who stated that [...] "she was so loved and <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Hideo Kojima and the gang have had to create yet another beautiful but deadly sniper character in the upcoming MGSV: The Phantom Pain." ...|$|E

"And back in 2000 when we {{were doing}} {{all of these things}} with the Jubilee 2000 Celebration and the time that I {{appeared}} there on their program, Ray Gates (who was the parish priest at that time at St. Leo's Church here in Murray) when he and I <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> we agreed early on: I'm John and he's Ray. And I didn't mean to be disrespectful and he didn't either. When you call me by my first name I don't consider it disrespectful. Jesus said, 'Don't call any man on Earth father.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Muriel's {{participation}} in the Student Christian Movement (SCM) at McGill was a life-changing experience. [...] "Looking back over the years," [...] she told her biographer, [...] "I've felt always {{that the experience of}} the SCM {{was the most important thing}} that happened to me, probably the most important aspect of my college life, more important than any of the courses that I took." [...] The SCM conducted small study groups in which students were encouraged to discuss their beliefs freely and come to their own conclusions about how to interpret the Gospels. For Muriel, such discussions were unsettling and painful, yet also exciting. [...] "I had always before treated the Gospel as though its authors had set down day by day events in the life of Jesus as they happened," [...] she said. [...] "To face the implication that nothing was written down until after Jesus died was itself a shock. But this question of free and open discussion, that everything needed to be challenged, to be questioned, to be <b>talked</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> was completely opposite to the authoritarian approach in the church." [...] The SCM study groups fostered independent thinking. [...] "This was the beginning of my adult search for truth," [...] Muriel told her biographer, [...] "and my sense that all things must be open to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 27, 2007, both White House Press Secretary Tony Snow and White House {{spokeswoman}} Dana Perino defended Gonzales's Senate Judiciary Committee testimony {{regarding the}} events of March 10, 2004, saying {{that it did not}} contradict the sworn House Judiciary Committee account of FBI director Robert S. Mueller III, because Gonzales had been constrained in what he could say because there was a danger he would divulge classified material. Lee Casey, a former Justice Department lawyer during the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, told The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer that {{it is likely that the}} apparent discrepancy can be traced to the fact that there are two separate Domestic Surveillance programs. [...] "The program that was leaked in December 2005 is the Comey program. It is not the program that was discussed in the evening when they went to Attorney General Ashcroft's hospital room. That program we know almost nothing about. We can speculate about it. …The program about which he said there was no dispute is a program that was created after the original program died, when Mr. Comey refused to reauthorize it, in March 2004. Mr. Comey then essentially redid the program to suit his legal concerns. And about that program, there was no dispute. There was clearly a dispute about the earlier form or version of the program. The attorney general has not <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> program. He refers to it as [...] "other intelligence activities" [...] because it is, in fact, still classified." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We've <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> already, but Uncle Randolph, who is our guardian, {{thinks it}} would prove a wild-goose chase. He says the {{interior}} of Africa is a big place to hunt any man in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have, then. You'll go on {{till you}} get me that <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> I shall be ashamed to show myself. What's the good of me trying to behave, if you keep going on like that?" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{suppose you}} heard from the Desmonds that I didn’t go back to England with them.

60|$|But {{this was}} not the only distant {{expedition}} they had made, for they had once gone down the Stour as far as Harwich with their father when he was called thither on business.
