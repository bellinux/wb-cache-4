5|$|Early in {{the recall}} process, Republican George Rivera {{announced}} his candidacy for Giron's senate seat. Rivera {{was planning to}} run against Giron in the 2014 elections but stated he would put his name on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> during the recall process. Rivera had to turn in a petition with 1,000 signatures {{in order to qualify}} to be on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> and turned in 1,500 signatures on July 26. Sonia Negrete Winn, a Democrat, also sought to be on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> to replace Giron, but failed to obtain the required signatures to be a candidate. In Morse's district, Republican Bernie Herpin announced his interest in replacing Morse and submitted sufficient signatures to qualify for <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eric Sundwall, Chair of the New York Libertarian Party, was the Libertarian {{candidate}} for the seat. However, he was removed from <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures to be on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> The {{vast majority of the}} rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was removed from <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} voting scheme in which shares of <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> {{are sent to}} {{multiple}} talliers. The talliers operate in parallel and cooperate together to count <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> by using <b>the</b> technique of the Secure Multiparty Computations (SMPC) in the Virtual Ideal Functionality Framework (VIFF).

5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had {{to vote for}} recall in order {{to vote for a}} {{replacement}} candidate. At the same time, Libertarian Jan Brooks turned in petitions to be on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> against Morse while Democrat Richard Anglund announced his write-in candidacy against Giron. On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to recall in order to vote for a replacement, but that the Senators could only be recalled by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> leaving only Republican opponents on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b>|$|E

On March 6, 2000, 1,000 of <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> were discovered at a US Postal Service regional distribution center in Bell, California. In response to affected members, AMPAS sent replacement ballots sealed in yellow envelopes, and extended the voting deadline by two days to March 23.|$|R
5|$|After the Democrats' electoral {{victories}} in 1951 and 1955, {{they hoped to}} further solidify their hold on city offices by ousting the few Republicans left in power. At the same time, however, they were faced with growing divisions within their own party. Democrats had won in 1951 by combining with reform-minded Republicans and independents. By 1954, however, some Democrats led by Council President James Hugh Joseph Tate tried to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees {{to become involved in}} electioneering once more. They fell just short of the two-thirds vote in Council to put their amendments on <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> but in 1956, Tate's faction again proposed charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections and this time found the required vote to put it on to <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> for popular approval. The referendum failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|After the announcement, <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> {{results were}} published: London {{gathered}} more {{votes in the}} first, third and final rounds, while Madrid won the second round despite falling short on votes {{in the third round}} and being eliminated. The competitiveness of the bids from Paris and London was ultimately demonstrated by a four-vote difference in the final round.|$|E
5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> boxes. <b>The</b> <b>ballot</b> boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E

The threshold for making <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> is 15% and the party announced that Baker had thus received the nomination {{without the need for}} a primary election. However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy battle. In the primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
