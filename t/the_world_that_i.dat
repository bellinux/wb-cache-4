500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with the weight of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside {{was on the verge of}} fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} in Ainulindalë, Melkor’s discord marred the Music of the Ainur in Heaven. Melkor’s thematic variations in that Music amounted {{to his own}} self-elaboration. (Each Ainu arose from a divine theme, existing beforehand only {{in the mind of}} Eru.) [...] Eä, or <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>that</b> <b>Is,</b> is shaped after the Music. [...] Thus, the evil that Melkor weaves into the Music was mirrored in Eä by the evil he wove into the fabric of reality. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>world</b> Arda was [...] "Marred": the conceptions of the Valar never came about, and Melkor's very essence was present in all creation.|$|R

2500|$|According to Guyer, {{the first}} line says that once {{the speaker of the}} sonnets is dead there should be no {{mourning}}, but it is phrased {{in such a way that}} says the mourning is happening now, at a point in life and living. Guyer's interpretation focuses heavily on time and the importance of that time used for mourning. In the line there is a limit of time being set aside for mourning, only in life, but after life has ended the mourning must stop. The line ends in dead, finality, giving the false sense that the sentence is over and yet it continues through to the second line. The second line gives the brief time between life and the sound of the bell to mourn and it seems to contradict {{the first line}}. The sonnet seems to be firmly against mourning after death, but really it is for mourning the dead but only in a timely manner. [...] "The sonnet's first-person subject demands that mourning—even if it lasts only for one minute or one day—coincides with, rather than succeed, the death knell that will [...] "Give warning to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am fled." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a child, {{he loved}} {{television}} and {{was fascinated by}} his parents' 8 mm film home movie camera. Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. [...] "You hear {{so much about the}} problems with television," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it saved my life." [...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. My parents would sit there and say, 'Don't you see where you come from? You can't be a movie director.' I guess maybe some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My lack {{of fear of}} this barbaric {{methodology}} of death, I rely upon my faith. It {{has nothing to do}} with machismo, with manhood, or with some pseudo former gang street code. This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hamilton {{had set up}} his {{headquarters}} in Paris' The George V Hotel, representing companies like Hamilton Standard, Sikorsky Aviation, Chance Vought Aircraft, and Pratt & Whitney. [...] During the time from 1936–1940, Hamilton was successful in getting licensing rights for foreign countries to build Pratt & Whitney engines and Hamilton Standard variable-pitch propellers. [...] According to Wilson, it was a fight for survival as an American company. [...] He also mentioned {{there was a kind}} of naivete when it came to dealing with countries like Germany, Japan and Russia. [...] For example, a deal was set up with BMW (Bavarian Motor Works) to license them to build a number of Pratt & Whitney engines, which was approved by the United States Congress. [...] This was granted because neither the US businessmen nor governmental officials expected any war in Europe. [...] As Wilson stated, “thanks to Mr. Thomas F. Hamilton moving around through these different ministries, could appraise this situation more clearly than most people. [...] And he came back from one trip and in a meeting of the executive committee of our company he said, ‘Don't discount this fellow Hitler.’ ‘To you, he's got a Charlie Chaplin mustache, but whatever he may look on the outside, either he or somebody behind him has a strategic insight and a political foresight that is not available anywhere else in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know of’ ”. [...] It has also been suggested that Hamilton also tried to convince the United States Congress of the seriousness of doing business with countries like Germany, Japan and Russia. However, at the time business interests came first and Hamilton was asked to continue in his position until the fall of France in 1940, after which Hamilton and his staff had to make an unorthodox exit out of Europe through Spain.|$|E
