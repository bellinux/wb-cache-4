In this study, we evaluate {{the performance of}} a high performance IHP that provides space heating, cooling, and water heating services. Experiments were conducted according to the ASHRAE Standard 206 - 2013 where 24 test conditions were identified in order to evaluate the IHP performance indices. An 8 -in by 8 -in Air Monitor Fan Evaluator is used to measure the volumetric flowrate of air discharged from the air handler unit (AHU) in order to evaluate the airside performance. Empirical curve fits of the unitâ€™s compressor maps are used in conjunction with saturated condensing and evaporating refrigerant conditions to deduce the refrigerant mass flowrate, which, in turn is used to evaluate the refrigerant-side performance.

Winter electrical load is found to be the maximum load. HOMER software tool was used to determine the optimum size and specifications of renewable power system. When Solar radiation and wind speed are at their maximum values of (7 kWh/m 2 /d, 5. 50 m/s) and the fuel price is assumed as a minimum (0. 10 US$), the most feasible power system economically is (PV/Tur/Gen/Battery) with total net present cost (NPC) of 293961 US$, cost of energy (COE) of US$ 0. 191 /kWh, and renewable fraction (RF) of 53 %. When solar radiation, wind speed and fuel price are assumed at average values of (5. 05 kWh/m 2 /d, 4. 84 m/s, and 0. 40 US$) the optimal solution is also (PV/Tur/Gen/Battery) with (NPC) of 384181 US$ and (COE) of US$ 0. 25 /kWh, and (RF) of 79 %.

40|$|Data centers {{represent}} {{a rapidly growing}} and very energy intensive activity in commercial, educational, and government facilities. In {{the last five years}} the growth of this sector was the electric power equivalent to seven new coal-fired power plants. Data centers consume 1. 5 % of the total power in the U. S. Growth over the next five to ten years is expected to require a similar increase in power generation. This energy consumption is concentrated in buildings that are 10 - 40 times more energy intensive than a typical office building. The sheer size of the market, the concentrated energy consumption per facility, and the tendency of facilities to cluster in 'high-tech' centers all contribute to a potential power infrastructure crisis for the industry. Meeting the energy needs of data centers is a moving target. Computing power is advancing rapidly, which reduces the energy requirements for data centers. A lot of work is going into improving the computing power of servers and other processing equipment. However, this increase in computing power is increasing the power densities of this equipment. While fewer pieces of equipment may be needed to meet a given data processing load, the energy density of a facility designed to house this higher efficiency equipment will be as high as or higher than it is today. In other words, while the data center of the future may have the IT power of ten data centers of today, it is also going to have higher power requirements and higher power densities. This report analyzes the opportunities for CHP technologies to assist primary power in making the data center more cost-effective and energy efficient.

40|$|Secondary leach {{concentrate}} (SLC) is {{an important}} bleed stream for minor elements from Anglo Platinumâs Base Metal Refinery (BMR) which produces copper nickel and cobalt sulphate. It contains mainly sulphur, iron jarosites, unleached base metals and platinum group metals (PGMs), which makes the treatment of SLC necessary. The SLC is currently toll-refined at Umicoreâs Hoboken smelter and refinery to recover revenue from entrapped valuable metals. This method of treatment results in excessively high costs due to high transport and toll refining expenses as well as penalties. Thus, an in-house method of treatment by Anglo Platinum itself would prove beneficial in that it would eliminate these excessive costs and also provide a method of treatment {{in the event of}} residues exporting becoming banned or strongly penalised in future. Therefore, a method for treating SLC in-house is investigated. The first stage of the proposed treatment method involves a pyrometallurgical process where the removal of amphoterics by oxidative fuming, followed by reduction to recover base metals from the slag takes place. The PGMs are reported mainly to the metal alloy phase along with the base metals during this process. The project discussed in this report deals with the treatment of this furnace alloy which is referred to as Cu alloy. The Cu alloy is used to produce anodes to be applied to an electrorefining application for the recovery of Cu as a Cu cathode and PGMs in the form of anode slimes. Spent electrolyte from the BMR copper electrowinning section adjusted to specific pH and Cu concentration is used as electrolyte to which dissolvable metals (such as Ni and Fe) are recovered. The purpose of the process is to recover PGMs to anode slimes with a composition suitable to be blended with the final concentrate that is sent to the Precious Metals Refinery (PMR). The performance of this process on the Cu alloy provided is investigated and the anode slimes produced are characterised in order to propose further methods of purification before blending with PMR feed. The <b>typical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> cathodic current efficiency, anodic copper dissolution rate and deportment of elements (especially PGMs) are determined. The effects of various operating parameters on the performance are also investigated in order to propose operating conditions. The operating parameters that are investigated are current density, Cu and H 2 SO 4 concentrations in electrolyte and the use of an additive. A preliminary process design based on knowledge and experience gained during the literature review and test work is given. -PAGE 3 OF 181 The major technical factors in electrorefining are the cathode purity, the production rate and the specific energy consumption. These factors are influenced primarily by anode quality, electrolyte conditions and cathode current density. Design considerations and typical design parameters for other industrial Cu electrorefining applications are studied as well as possible further treatment of anode slimes for the concentration of PGMs. A total of eleven experiments were performed with a variety combinations of Cu concentration (30, 40 and 50 g/l), H 2 SO 4 concentration (110, 130, 160 and 190 g/l) and current density (100, 125, 150, 250, 300 A/m 2). In each experiment only one parameter was changed while all others were kept constant at the base-case setting of 40 g/l Cu, 160 g/l H 2 SO 4, and 125 A/m 2. The testwork showed that electrolytic refining of the Cu alloy, produced by a two stage pyrometallurgical treatment of current SLC, produces a highly concentrated PGM residue at an overall SLC mass reduction of 99. 3 %, with excellent PGM recovery to the anode slimes material. The different operating parameters that were tested successfully, all showed very good repeatability and greater than 99 % PGM recovery from the Cu alloy, which would result in an overall recovery of 98 % from SLC. Very little or none of the base metals that were supplied by the anode or the electrolyte feed reported to the anode slimes. The typical operating conditions (cell potential, current efficiency, anodic Cu dissolution and element deportment) that were observed correlated well with literature and the theoretically calculated values. The characteristics of the anode slimes produced stayed relatively similar throughout the different operating parameters and strong confidence can be placed in the production thereof and the recovery of the PGMs. The characteristics of the spent electrolyte and the Cu cathodes were also found to be suitable for integration in the BMR circuit. The anode slimes composition was 20 to 30 % PGMs, 20 to 30 % base metals, 15 to 20 % Ag, As, Te, Se, Pb and 2 to 5 % Al, Si, Sb, Bi, Zn and Sn. The blending of these slimes with typical PMR feed will result in a new PMR feed where the Pt grade of the feed to PMR is reduced by 4 to 5. 5 %, the Cu grade increased by 2 to 4 % and the Ni content reduced by Â± 4 %. Other concerns are the increase of As, Te, and Pb by between 0. 5 and 1 %. -PAGE 4 OF 181 The PGM-rich (> 60 %) phase in the anode slimes is a mostly amorphous matrix phase containing mostly palladium and other PGMs, arsenic and tellurium [Pd 73 As 6 Te 21] with small amounts of Cu. Anode slimes produced from electrorefining can either be subjected to an additional process step to remove Ag, Pb and base metals before it is blended with the final concentrate (FICO) as feed for PMR, or it can be sent to the metallics section in PMR which includes a roast and a leach stage. The treatment of the anode slimes depends {{on the nature of the}} slimes. A preliminary process design was performed with proposed design parameters of electrolyte concentrations of 40 g/l Cu and 160 g/l H 2 SO 4 at 65 Â°C and a current density of 200 A/m 2. The process consists out of seven cells in series with 55 anode cathode pairs in parallel per cell. The process has a maximum capacity of 127 t/m of anode material which allows 56 days of downtime per year if the current SLC produced (6600 t/a) is treated. The maximum capacity for Cu production is 1349 t/a and anode slimes 50. 3 t/m. The power consumption per kg of anode dissolved will be 0. 175 kWh/kg...|$|E

The model also provides <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> forecasts based on projected production, equipment improvements, and fuels mix. Development of the model began in August 1979 and was preceded by two years of complete auditing of all areas in two manufacturing plants plus specific processing lines in other plants to determine <b>typical</b> <b>energy</b> usage. Extensive analyses of the data resulted in the formulation of standards for the various pieces of equipment which are used as energy performance 'yardsticks'. Monthly reports permit equitable comparisons of plant <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> and isolation of those plants with the lowest efficiencies. The financial impact of increasing <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> of the projected energy use for new plants or plant expansions, and of the effect of process changes on overall <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> can be also evaluated...|$|R
30|$|Our {{previous}} work [17] presents network coding-based reliable disjoint and braided multipath routing (NC-RMR) for sensor networks in which improving reliability of multipath routing with network coding {{is the primary}} aim. In this article, network coding is employed to achieve energy efficiency in WSNs, and the mathematical models of multipath routing with and without network coding are inherited and developed. In [17], we employed two metrics (namely, SDR and NEC) to evaluate the performance of sensor networks. SDR {{is the number of}} successful delivered packets over the total packets sent by the source node, and NEC is normalized <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> which is equal to total <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> divided by SDR. In this article, the two metrics are also employed. There are some differences between this article and the previous study [17]. First, a <b>typical</b> <b>energy</b> model is introduced to evaluate the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of sensor networks, and the influence of different network parameters on performance is also detailed. Second, we provide routing discovery algorithm, data disseminating algorithm, and routing maintenance algorithm to enable network coding to be performed on a braided multipath network model. Third, some additional data and different analysis such as <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> reliability, and optimal scheme for energy efficiency are provided.|$|R
40|$|Nodes in most {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) are {{powered by}} batteries with limited energy. Prolonging network lifetime and saving energy are two critical issues for WSNs. Clustering is an effective technique to improve the energy efficiency and prolong network lifetime of {{wireless sensor networks}}. In this paper, an energy efficient dynamic clustering protocol (EEDCP) based on weight for wireless sensor networks is proposed, which is able to dramatically prolong network lifetime and save energy. In the EEDCP, we introduce the <b>typical</b> <b>energy</b> model to compute <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> virtual grid technology to construct cluster and a long sleeping state to reduce <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> In addition, we use the value of weight to measure the size of residual energy instead of voting, which can significant reduce the voting times {{and the number of}} transmitting information. Further, simulation experiments are conducted to compare the EEDCP with some well-known clustering algorithms and simulation results show that the proposed method overcomes the existing methods in the aspects of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> and network lifetime in wireless sensor networks. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a new {{cooperative}} transmission scheme {{based on}} the data exchange between relays (fDSTC) is proposed. Thorough comparisons of this fDSTC protocol and more classical distributed space-time codes (cDSTC) protocols in case of non-regenerative relays (NR-relays) and regenerative relays (R-relays) are considered in terms of error performance, outage probability, diversity order and <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> via both numerical simulations and mathematical analysis. In addition, the fDSTC protocol is applied to multi-antenna systems and shown to be more energy-efficient than the cDSTC protocol using either a <b>typical</b> <b>energy</b> model widely-used in the literature or a realistic energy model based on the PowWow platform. Besides, a mathematical analysis in terms of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> is complementarily given to show how to choose the best cooperative models to prolong the lifetime of WSNs. As MAC protocols have a great influence on the total <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of the networks, {{that leads to a}} big motivation to design a cooperative MAC protocol, RIC-MAC, by combining preamble sampling and cooperative relay techniques. The analytic results still confirm the interest of using cooperative relay techniques, but their energy efficiency may be affected by the MAC protocol design, the traffic loads of the networks and the desired latency.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to provide a deep {{analysis}} of the potential impact of energy efficiency improvements by focussing on the evaluation of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> and efficiency in various sub-departments at a small brewery – the locus of our research. To thoroughly analyze the specific <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> an analysis of the historical <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> data, as well as an electricity consumption monitoring was carried out. The acquired knowledge significantly adds to the existing body of research, particularly by providing detailed data on <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> by different types of packaging equipment and through an in-depth analysis of energy efficiency in brewing and, uniquely, by analyzing the barriers to implementation of energy efficiency measures over time. The analysis of the brewery's <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> shows that it significantly exceeds recommended benchmarks, so an in-depth analysis of heat losses in the brew house and energy monitoring in the packaging department were performed to identify the source of the inefficiency and the potential improvements. The {{aim of the}} electricity monitoring was also to acquire detailed consumption data to enhance company's stakeholders' awareness and scope for decisions regarding energy efficiency. The results of electricity monitoring show large variation of specific <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> for various types of packaging, with much lower specific consumption for packaging in metal barrels than previously reported in literature. As separate measurements were performed for subsections of packaging lines, it is possible to identify causes for under-implementation of energy efficiency and to propose specific improvements for each of the subsections. In addition to technological aspect, also the energy efficiency barriers were considered. Building on the <b>typical</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency barrier studies, a distinctive approach to analyze the barrier dynamics over time is applied. It is concluded that in the case brewery the main perceived barriers have not changed over five-year period, even though some successful energy efficiency interventions have been implemented. The provided results from electricity monitoring in the packaging department of brewery may be further applied for development of individual process, industry and national benchmarks...|$|R
