Nelson and Simmons also found <b>that</b> <b>students</b> with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B.Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{overseeing}} the new clergy, Soegijapranata {{continued to work}} towards Catholic education and prosperity, similar to his pre-war work. He emphasised <b>that</b> <b>students</b> must not only be good Catholics, but also good Indonesians. The Church began further development of its schools, ranging from elementary schools to universities. Soegijapranata also began reforming the Church in his apostolic vicariate, making it more Indonesian. He advocated the use of local languages and Indonesian during mass, allowing it throughout his diocese beginning in 1956. In addition, he pressed {{for the use of}} gamelan music to accompany services, and agreed to the use of wayang shows to teach the Bible to children.|$|E

5|$|Before {{teaching}} at the Academy, Maeser taught at several different schools in Germany and in Utah. He tutored Brigham Young's children. Maeser incorporated the Monitorial System into his teaching philosophies and believed <b>that</b> <b>students</b> should each have responsibilities. Maeser was influenced by Pestalozzian educational theory, but also advocated that schools should include religion.|$|E
5|$|During her term at the university, Massaquoi {{succeeded in}} {{overcoming}} the requirement <b>that</b> <b>students</b> should adopt foreign names rather than keeping {{those of their}} indigenous families. In connection with this, when she married Ernest Freeman on 26 July 1948, Massaquoi adopted his tribal name Fahnbulleh, calling herself Fatima Massaquoi-Fahnbulleh. Her husband also changed his own name back to Fahnbulleh. To further contribute to the cultural and social development of Liberia, she organized a seminar through the African Studies Program in 1962 to promote the standardization of the Vai script.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except <b>that</b> <b>students</b> were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E

5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported <b>that</b> <b>students</b> carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies <b>that</b> <b>students</b> in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, {{the student}} bodies of Rutgers College and the Seminary began to expand, {{overcrowding}} the space provided at the Queens Campus. The seminary professors realized <b>that</b> <b>students</b> renting rooms at boarding {{houses in the}} city were paying more for their housing than students at other seminaries—over double the costs of housing at New York City's Union Theological Seminary or at nearby Princeton Theological Seminary.

Those who do not must repay the AOG. Marion Military Institute, New Mexico Military Institute, Georgia Military College, Hargrave Military Academy, Greystone Preparatory School at Schreiner University, and Northwestern Preparatory School are approved programs <b>that</b> <b>students</b> attend on the AOG scholarship prior to admission to West Point.|$|E
5|$|The center teaches {{classes in}} four-month semesters {{occurring}} {{three times per}} year. Each semester costs $10,815.

Application requirements state <b>that</b> <b>students</b> must have attended at least two semesters (including the semester immediately preceding the trip abroad) at BYU, BYU-Hawaii, or BYU-Idaho, have a GPA of at least 2.5, and sign an agreement not to proselytize. Married students are not allowed to attend.|$|E

30|$|We present {{two types}} of {{measures}} for the required level of education: mean minimum and mean maximum education. The mean minimum education figures show <b>that</b> <b>student</b> and flexible jobs are offered to less educated individuals in comparison to non-student and traditional jobs. For the maximum level education identified by employers, {{this is not the}} case. For offers aimed at students, but not based on a flexible work contract, the mean maximum education is higher than for offers that are not aimed at <b>students.</b> This suggests <b>that</b> <b>student</b> jobs are not exclusive to a certain educational category but rather are less dependent on the attained education of the prospective applicants. This could also imply <b>that</b> <b>student</b> jobs are unrelated to the field of study or actual skills.|$|R
50|$|However, it {{has been}} argued <b>that</b> <b>student</b> {{achievement}} measures do not necessarily correlate entirely with teacher quality, given that there are various factors <b>that</b> influence a <b>student's</b> performance which are not under the control of a teacher.|$|R
5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall. The second and first floors (the latter of which lies {{partially}} below ground) contained laboratory space while {{the third floor}} consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices. Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 <b>that</b> <b>students</b> had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust-colored.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1899, San Diego Normal School became the first California normal school to offer summer courses, and {{maintained}} this position until 1913. On June 21, 1900, the first class was graduated: 23 women and three men. Later that year, the east wing of the initial building was finished, adding 18 rooms. In 1903, $61,000 was appropriated by the state for a west wing; it included a gym, library, laboratories, lecture rooms, and a museum. The west wing was completed in September 1904. In 1906, the California legislature required <b>that</b> <b>students</b> have {{a high school diploma}} in order to be admitted to a normal school. This was the same requirement as for entry into the University of California.|$|E

However he did not believe that individuals were entitled to exercise their First Amendment rights wherever they pleased. He joined in Adderley v. Florida, which controversially upheld a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He dissented from Brown v. Louisiana, in which the Court held that protesters were entitled to engage in a sit-in at a public library. Likewise, he disagreed with Tinker v.

This was in accordance with the Crime Damage Act, which also stipulated that payments were to be adjusted in relation to other forms of compensation that the students received. Claimants were able to apply if they had suffered a loss of earnings, pain and suffering, or damage or loss to personal belongings {{as a consequence of the}} attack. Relatives were also able to gain compensation for costs incurred whilst caring for those affected, or funeral or hospital bills.|$|E
5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that there was too much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted <b>that</b> <b>students</b> spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E
5|$|The University seal as it {{is today}} is {{symbolic}} of hundreds of years of history. The seal combines attributes from the Bayley Coat of Arms and the Seton family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as 1216 and symbolizes Scottish nobility. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest, which is notable for its three crescents and three torteau. The motto on the seal Hazard Zet Forward (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of Norman French and archaic English meaning at whatever risk, yet go forward. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal {{in the middle of the}} university green. It is said <b>that</b> <b>students</b> who step on the seal will not graduate on time.|$|E
