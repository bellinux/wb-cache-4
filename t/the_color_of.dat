5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It was <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Greece, {{green and}} blue were {{sometimes}} considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the sea and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> trees. The philosopher Democritus described two different greens: cloron, or pale green, and prasinon, or leek green. Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E

Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E

5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E

2500|$|The most logical {{explanation}} for <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American flag {{is that it}} was modeled after the first unofficial American flag, the Grand Union Flag.

To attribute meaning to these colors, Charles Thomson, who helped design the Great Seal, reported to Congress that [...] "White signifies purity and innocence. Red hardiness and valor and Blue... signifies vigilance, perseverance and justice." ...|$|R
