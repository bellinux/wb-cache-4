5|$|The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as {{a nonprofit}} {{corporation}} in October 1994, citing {{a desire to}} give back to the community as {{one of the reasons for}} its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota's nickname, The North Star State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed with <b>the</b> <b>program</b> and performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in <b>the</b> <b>program</b> increased. By 1996, 30 more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for <b>the</b> <b>program</b> was around 200 students.|$|E

50|$|Through {{synchronizing}} {{the audio}} {{and the visual}} effects and combining visual slide effects, <b>the</b> <b>programming</b> process could create a single continuous show that was saved to memory.
