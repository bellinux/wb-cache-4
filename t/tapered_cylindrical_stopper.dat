40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} welding process for joining {{metallic}} alloys and has been employed in several industries such as aerospace, marine and automotive industry for joining aluminium, magnesium and copper alloys. The various parameters such as rotational speed, welding speed, axial force and tool pin geometry play vital roles in FSW process in order to analyse the weld quality. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of different rotational speed and tool pin profile on the weld quality of AA 2014 aluminium which has gathered wide acceptance in the fabrication of light weight structures requiring a high strength-to-weight ratio. Five different tool pin profiles (straight <b>cylindrical,</b> <b>taper</b> <b>cylindrical,</b> straight <b>cylindrical</b> threaded, <b>taper</b> <b>cylindrical</b> threaded, <b>taper</b> <b>cylindrical</b> with concavity) were used, in this research, to fabricate the joint. The appearance of the weld is well and no obvious defect is found using these tools. The welded specimens were tested on UTM machine in order to obtain the ultimate load for getting the tensile strength of welded joint. The joint fabricated using rotational speed of 560 rpm, <b>taper</b> <b>cylindrical</b> threaded pin profile showed higher tensile strength compared to other joint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{conventional}} welding process, {{copper and}} its alloys {{are very difficult}} to weld because of high thermal conductivity and high melting point. To overcome the problems encountered in conventional welding process, friction stir welding (FSW) is used. FSW is a solid state welding process and the welding is done below the recrystalization temperature of the materials. The main objective of this investigation is to apply FSW for joining of 3 mm thick copper sheet. The different tool pin profiles such as <b>taper</b> <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>taper</b> <b>cylindrical</b> with threaded were used to fabricate the joints. The defect free welds were obtained at a tool rotational and traverse speed of 900 rpm and 40 mm/min respectively. Mechanical and microstructure analysis has been performed to evaluate the characteristics of friction stir welded copper. From the investigation {{it was found that the}} joints made by using <b>taper</b> <b>cylindrical</b> with threaded tool pin profile resulted in better mechanical properties compared to the <b>taper</b> <b>cylindrical</b> tool pin profile. The tensile properties of all weld joints showed a relative correspondence to the variation of the hardness in the weld zone. The observed results were correlated with the microstructure and fracture features...|$|R
