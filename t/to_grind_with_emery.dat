The {{following are the}} results. 1. Cell-free extracts prepared from these four strains of S(57) by <b>grinding</b> <b>with</b> <b>emery</b> powder: These extracts prove to have respiratory activity on lactate, succinate, and fumarate. 2. Although four strains of S(57) do not show any marked difference in their respiratory activity on such oxidases as lactate, succinate, and fumarate, oxygen uptake per hour per mg of N in cell-free extract of R-type strain is greatest, followed by that of CM-resistant strain, S-type strain, and SM-resistant strain in the order mentioned. 3. Lactic oxidase contained in all these four extracts of S(57) has been verified to be an entirely different oxidase from that found in animal tissues, yeasts, and other bacteria. 4. The action of inhibitory agents, especially that of malonate, on resting bacteria differs markedly from the same on cellfree extracts; and it is indicated that this phenomenon is possibly caused by permeability of cell membrane of bacteria...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} several {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for the purpose of dis-integrating bacterial cells.

Of the several methods employed in this laboratory, that of disintegrating bac-terial cells by exposure to an ultrasonic field 2 has proved of most value when limited quantities of bacteria were available and when the possibility of preparing cell-free enzyme extracts had to be explored. Further, since irradiation of bac-teria by ultrasound can be carried out under completely aseptic conditions, it becomes possible to analyze pathogenic bacteria with respect to their endotoxins, enzymes, polysaccharides, and other substances which can be extracted from cells only alter disintegration.

40|$|ELID-grinding of cermets {{has been}} carried out on a {{retrofitted}} Jung surface grinder with different cast iron-bonded (CIB) diamond wheels. In case of rough <b>grinding,</b> <b>with</b> a wheel of 46 µm abrasives, ELID-grinding is preferable compared <b>to</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>with</b> a conventional resin-bonded wheel or a CIB wheel without ELID. Resin-bonded wheels are characterized by low G-ratios and are prone to chattering effects. Metal-bonded wheels are very durable, and especially for avoiding glazing effects during longer grinding cycles, ELID-grinding is the best choice. The maximal MRR in ‘ELID-roughing’ on the used surface grinder is measured to be 1 mm³/s, leading to a roughness of about 0. 4 µm Ra. The ‘ELID-finishing’ steps are implemented on the same grinding machine, so the workpiece {{does not need to be}} dismounted. Several sets of experiments based on the Design of Experiments method show that lower axial feeds and higher duty ratios of the power supply improve the surface quality effectively. With the wheel of 10 µm grit size, chattering can be avoided by limiting the theoretical MRR to 0. 05 mm³/s. To obtain a final Sa roughness below 10 nm, the last finishing wheel should remove less than 0. 3 10 - 3 mm³/s. The total processing time of the finishing steps is less than 30 minutes for a workpiece area of 375 mm³. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Following up the {{previous}} experiments, {{with the use}} of extracts and acetone powder prepared from several strains of B. dysenteriae such as SM-resistant strain and SM-susceptible strain of Sh. flexneri Ⅱ, this study has been conducted in order to consider some aspects of their metabolism. The results are as follows: 1. It has been possible to obtain cell-free extracts from Sh. flexneri Ⅱ by <b>grinding</b> <b>with</b> <b>emery</b> powder, the extracts containing oxidases of lactate, succinate, and glycine; and also the same three oxidases have been obtained from the acetone-powder prepared from Sh. flexneri Ⅱ. Moreover, the characteristics of those oxidases obtained by the above two methods are exactly the same. 2. No marked difference can be observed in the properties of these three oxidases contained in extract from SM-resistant strain or in those from SM-susceptible strain, of Sh. flexneri Ⅱ, but there is a quantitative difference in oxygen uptake: namely, in SM-resistant strain oxygen uptake on three substrates per hour per mg of N is greater than the same in the case of SM-susceptible strain. 3. It has been confirmed that the properties of three oxidases of this bacillus, namely, oxidases of lactate, succinate, and glycine, are quite similar to the properties of those oxidases found in animals, plants, and bacteria. 4. Glycine oxidase has been extractable only from animal tissues and from and from a few kinds of bacteria, and the one that has been extracted from this bacillus possesses somewhat similar properties as those of animal tissues and other bacteria in that it is not affected by inhibitory agents of the cytochrome system and possesses a relatively narrow pH range of activity. It has been proven that glycine oxidase prepared from Sh. flexneri Ⅱ is a flavoprotein which produces glyoxylic acid and NH(3) by oxidative deamination of glycine. 5. Inhibitory action of malonate can not at all be seen on succinoxidase in resting cells of Sh. flexneri Ⅱ, while this inhibitory action is observable {{in the case of the}} acetone powder and cell-free extracts of Sh. flexneri Ⅱ. This phenomena seem to be possibly brought about by permeability of the cell membrane...|$|R
