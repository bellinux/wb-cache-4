500|$|Despite Steiger's acclaim as an actor, he was {{frequently}} accused of overacting and won his {{fair share of}} critics, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing, and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch. Steiger once clashed with Armenian director Rouben Mamoulian, during a theatrical production of Oklahoma!, as he was intolerant of Steiger's [...] "unusual acting technique". Steiger ignored the director's concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: [...] "Get out of my theater. Get out of my life!", and fired him. Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio's techniques disagreeable, preferring [...] "more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness". Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely [...] "trying to take the medium of acting to as far as I can go, and <b>that</b> <b>why</b> I sometimes go over the edge".|$|E
500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done <b>that,</b> <b>why</b> don't I just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E
500|$|A major {{rift between}} Johnson and Millererstwhile rivals for the Australian captaincydeveloped during the Fourth Test, played at Kensington Oval in Barbados. During the third day, Miller, bowling fast-medium swingers, had {{dismissed}} Everton Weekes and Collie Smith {{in quick succession}} to leave the West Indies at 6/147 with Denis Atkinson and Clairmonte Depeiaza batting. Johnson, thinking that the two batsmen would be vulnerable to express pace, asked Miller to increase his bowling speed. [...] When Miller refused, Johnson remonstrated with him: [...] "I'll say who bowls and what they bowl". With Miller refusing to bowl as directed, Johnson replaced him in the attack with Ray Lindwall. [...] Walking off the field {{at the end of}} the day's play and continuing in the dressing room, Miller provoked Johnson, telling him he [...] "couldn't captain a team of schoolboys", among other insults. Finally Johnson responded, asking [...] "If you want to go on like <b>that</b> <b>why</b> don't we go around the back and thrash it out?" [...] The much larger Miller declined the offer and the pair travelled back to the team hotel together. [...] The next day, Atkinson and Depeiaza batted throughout the entire day's play. [...] Their partnership of 347runs for the seventh wicket is still a world record.|$|E

Truman told Stevenson [...] "I have been trying since January {{to get you to}} say <b>that.</b> <b>Why</b> should it embarrass me?" [...] Kefauver led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot. Historian John Frederick Martin says party leaders selected him because he was [...] "more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines—so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago."

2500|$|The Quran at its {{several places}} {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone (...) [...] Again, those who deny resurrection and afterlife, and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying <b>that</b> <b>why</b> these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) {{and is about to}} escape the body? (...) [...] It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to Godto go back to life to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted (...) [...] Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: [...] "Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense." [...] At another place, the Quran urges mankind: [...] "And die not except in a state of Islam" [...] (...) because [...] "Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam" [...] (...) [...] Other verses related with this issue are: [...] "He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds.

2500|$|In the Wu-Tang Manual, {{a book by}} the RZA on {{the origins}} of the Wu-Tang Clan, he recalls a concert at which Biggie and Wu-Tang both performed, at which Raekwon and Ghostface were {{reportedly}} under the influence, and angry at some comments B.I.G. made in The Source. In RZA's view, had the artists and their entourages met up that night, things could have gotten violent, but nothing of the sort ever occurred. It is worth mentioning that on B.I.G.'s final studio album Life After Death he took a shot back at Raekwon on the song [...] "Kick in the Door" [...] (which was a diss song to several other rappers as well) with the line; [...] "Fuck <b>that,</b> <b>why</b> try/Throw bleach in ya eye" [...] which was a response to lyrics from Raekwon's song [...] "Ice Water", where Raekwon rhymed; [...] "...To top it all off, beefin' for White/Pullin' bleach out, tryin'a throw it in my eyesight." [...] On the posthumous 1997 song [...] "Victory," [...] released on Puff Daddy's album No Way Out, B.I.G. also rhymes, [...] "Militant/Y'all faggots ain't killin' shit," [...] in response to a Ghostface Killah line on the song [...] "Criminology" [...] where he raps; [...] "RZA baked the track and it's militant/Then I react like a convict, and start killin' shit." [...] It is also worth mentioning that B.I.G. chose RZA to produce the track [...] "Long Kiss Goodnight", a song allegedly aimed at Biggie's longtime rival Tupac Shakur, which appeared on Life After Death.|$|E

2500|$|C.B. Cox writes, [...] "In Elizabethan {{times the}} crime of buggery was {{punishable}} by death. Today this legal term for homosexual intercourse offends our ears, but its use {{draws attention to the}} abhorrence with which many Christians of the time (and since) regarded physical intimacies between men. In these circumstances it's difficult to believe that Shakespeare would not only participate in an active homosexual relation with a handsome young man, but broadcast this affair to the world in sexually explicit sonnets pass round among his friends." [...] The competing view of a bisexual Shakespeare conflicts with Wilde's view. Cox bases his argument on the verb [...] "to have." [...] He argues <b>that</b> <b>why</b> must the verb usage of [...] "to have" [...] mean sexually possess? Elizabethan people had trouble believing [...] "had" [...] meant to have sexually {{when it came to the}} young man, but Cox writes, [...] "It's difficult to refute Pequiney's contention that in these three examples (Sonnet 52, Sonnet 75, and Sonnet 87) there is a sexual innuendo in [...] "had," [...] particularly when in Sonnet 129, which concerns heterosexual love for the Dark Lady, everyone agrees that there is such an implication,. Elizabethan society feared homosexual desire, but embraced heterosexual conquests. Cox writes, [...] "The poems may be based on personal experience but still that doesn't actually prove that Shakespeare 'had' the youth. There's an element of playfulness in the sexual innuendoes, a delight in wit as if Shakespeare is enjoying his own virtuosity and may not have expected to be taken literally... In his poems to the youth he may be using sexual innuendo as a kind of joke, a playful but at times almost serious hint that his affection may even extend to physical desire." ...|$|E
