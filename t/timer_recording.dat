5000|$|Accurate Recording (AR, {{equivalent}} to PDC) - programmes are recorded based on {{signals from the}} broadcaster rather than scheduled time. (Since {{this is based on}} signals from the broadcaster, the broadcaster can prevent recording by sending nonsense signals as a form of copy protection, as already happens on music channels. However, this can be circumvented by specifying a <b>timer</b> <b>recording</b> instead of a programme recording or by connecting the receiver to a traditional videocassette recorder.) ...|$|E

40|$|Summary. What is {{the nature}} of the human timing mecha-nism for perceptual judgements about short {{temporal}} in-tervals? One possibility is that initial periodic events, such as tones, establish internal beats which continue after the external events and serve as reference points for the per-ception of subsequent events. A second possibility is that the <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> the intervals produced by events. Later, the stored intervals can be reproduced or compared to other intervals. A study by Schulze (1978) provided evi-dence favoring beat-based timing. In contrast, our two ex-periments upport an interval theory. The judgements of intervals between tones is not improved when the events are synchronized with internal beats established by the ini-tial intervals. The conflict between the two sets of results may be resolved by the fact that an interval timer can recy...|$|R
30|$|The {{impedance}} {{trajectory of}} this case is shown in Fig.  4. According to the figure, after power swing initiation, impedance moves toward distance zones so that it crosses the CPSB {{for the first time}} and then the <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> the traveling time between outer and inner zones. Therefore, power swing can be detected by comparing the recorded time with threshold value and then distance relay is blocked. As a consequence of power swing, impedance trajectory moves back and gets away from the distance zones and so leaves the outer zone of CPSB. Next a three-phase fault occurs at t[*]=[*] 0.85 [*]s during power swing. This causes the impedance trajectory crosses CPSB again during fault and so a new travelling time is <b>recorded</b> by <b>timer,</b> which can be used for detecting fault individually. Hence, traditional CPSB can detect both power swing and fault during power swing in this case.|$|R
50|$|Skiing is {{a single}} player only game, in which the player uses the {{joystick}} to control the direction and speed of a stationary skier {{at the top of}} the screen, while the background graphics scroll upwards, thus giving the illusion the skier is moving. The player must avoid obstacles, such as trees and moguls. The game cartridge was programmed with five variations each of two principal games. In the downhill mode, the player's goal is to reach the bottom of the ski course as rapidly as possible, while a <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> his relative success. In the slalom mode, the player must similarly reach the end of the course as rapidly as he can, but must at the same time pass through a series of gates (indicated by a pair of closely spaced flagpoles). Each gate missed counts as a penalty against the player's time.|$|R
50|$|The contestants {{must pass}} the midway control {{three hours after}} the start. The maximum time limit for Helsingborg Marathon is six hours. The {{participants}} (four in each team) run in the relay, alongside the marathon runners. The first relay runner will start one hour after the marathon runners. The minimum age for the marathon distance is 18, while age 15 is enough for the relay. Water stations are located regularly along the path. Some of these also offer energy drinks, bananas and oranges. Timing is done with an electronic disposable chip that {{is built into the}} bib number. The <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> the runner's net time, which means that the timing starts when the participant cross the starting line, and stops when he or she runs across the finish line. Sprinters who choose to abort the race are offered free taxi ride down to the finish area.|$|R
5000|$|The tach(ometer) timer is an {{instrument}} used in aviation to accumulate {{the total number}} of revolutions performed by the engine. The unit of measure is equivalent to the number of hours of running at a certain, specific reference speed of rotation.

40|$|The {{test unit}} is a custom photodetector/event timer, PET, {{built for the}} Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, SAO, by Los Alamos which records elapsed time in 10 ps steps. The 1 Kg, 12 cm {{diameter}} PET unit uses 10 watts of electrical power and was tested to SAO`s specified flight conditions. The event timer has two inputs [...] a reference clock oscillator input and a stop signal. Like a stop watch with split timing capability, the event <b>timer</b> <b>records</b> the instant a stop signal arrives. At that sample instant, the number of elapsed clock cycles are stored and the sample instant position between two reference clock edges is interpolated and stored. Then that stored data can be shifted serially to an external computer.

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{research}} into the effect in the consultation {{of the use of}} a computer to prompt opportunistic preventive care a valid, objective, and practical measure of the consultation process was required. After a review of the alternative methods the Time Interval Medical Event Recorder (Timer) was developed, its reliability tested, and applied to 93 control consultations and 49 computer assisted consultations. <b>Timer</b> <b>records,</b> every five seconds, four consultation events: the problems being dealt with, the physical activity, the verbal activity, and the secondary tasks being attempted. Timer showed that control consultations lasted an average of 6 minutes 58 seconds. The doctors spent 35 % of their time on administration, and patients and doctors were both conversational for just 33 % of the consultation. Giving information was the most common verbal activity (48 % of the duration of the consultation) with silence accounting for 21 % of the time. When the computer was used the average consultation was longer, at 7 minutes and 46 seconds. The doctor's contribution to the consultation appeared to have increased. Patient centred speech fell from 36 % in controls to 28 % of the duration of the consultation when the computer was used, while doctor centred speech rose from 30 % to 34. 5 %. Secondary tasks (exploring patient concepts, education, management sharing, and prevention) were attempted during 28 % of the control consultations and 40 % of the computer consultations. This was accounted for by the increase in prevention (p less than 0. 001). Timer is a reliable and practical tool for researching the consultation, and though it has shown validity in detecting differences between consultations that use a computer and those that do not, further applications are required to establish its full value...|$|R

50|$|Standards for {{delivery}} of scheduling information to television-based IPGs vary from application to application, and by country. Older television IPGs like Guide Plus+ relied on analog technology (such as the {{vertical blanking interval}} of analog television video signals) to distribute listings data to IPG-enabled consumer receiving equipment. In Europe, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published standard ETS 300 707 to standardize the delivery of IPG data over digital television broadcast signals. Listings data for IPGs integrated into digital terrestrial television and radio receivers of the present day is typically sent within each station's MPEG transport stream, or alongside it in a special data stream. The ATSC standard for digital terrestrial television, for instance, uses tables sent in each station's PSIP. These tables are meant to contain program start times and titles along with additional program descriptive metadata. Current time signals are also included for on-screen display purposes, and they are also used to set <b>timers</b> on <b>recording</b> devices.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{domestic}} VCRs {{are equipped}} with a television broadcast receiver (tuner) for TV reception, and a programmable clock (<b>timer)</b> for unattended <b>recording</b> of a television channel from a start time to an end time specified by the user. These features began as simple mechanical counter-based single-event timers, but were later replaced by more flexible multiple-event digital clock timers. In later models the multiple timer events could be programmed through a menu interface displayed on the playback TV screen ("on-screen display" [...] or OSD). This feature allowed several programs to be recorded at different times without further user intervention, and became a major selling point.|$|R
50|$|Several {{problems}} exist {{with regard}} to on-screen displays. One of them is diagnostics if a television's display system is damaged. Without any external screens, {{it is almost impossible}} (without opening the TV) to determine the source of the error.

On older VCRs, it was possible to program <b>recording</b> <b>timers</b> without turning on the TV; a modern VCR requires the user to turn on the TV to do so. Usability is generally also decreased with OSDs, as it is necessary to control a multitude of parameters with a few buttons, where earlier, real analog controls with mechanical feedback were available.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Data {{sharing in}} {{clinical}} research {{is critical for}} increasing knowledge discovery. Data and software tools should be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Inter-operable and Re-usable. Many bottlenecks exist {{in the process of}} a clinical investigator using shared data including data acquisition and statistical analysis. The objective of this project is to develop a structure for sharing data and providing rapid automated statistical analysis through creation of a pre-packaged, open-source software container. Methods: We use the open source software container technologies VirtualBox and Vagrant to create a template for sharing clinical data and analysis scripts as a single container. We use a <b>timer</b> to <b>record</b> the time necessary to setup and initialize the software container and view the results. Results: We have created a template for sharing data and analysis scripts together using open source software container technologies VirtualBox and Vagrant. We found the time needed to initialize the container to be 5 minutes and 36 seconds for a macOS-based machine and 7 minutes and 2 seconds for a Windows-based machine. Containers can be downloaded and executed from any Mac or Windows computer allowing both the reuse of and interaction with the data. This greatly reduces the time and effort needed to obtain and analyze clinical data. Conclusion: Reducing the time and effort needed to obtain and analyze clinical data increases the time available for data exploration and the discovery of new knowledge. This can be effectively achieved using software containers and virtualization...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory {{predators and}} {{scavengers}} rely on odors to locate food, and they forage primarily at night. We hypothesized that weather (e. g. wind speed, humidity, and temperature), vegetation, and landscape features affect the dissipation of odors {{in the atmosphere}} and, thus, impact the foraging efficiency of olfactory predators. We tested this hypothesis by assessing what conditions were correlated with the persistence of bait along the dike surrounding Willard Bay Reservoir, Utah. We distributed 124 chicken eggs and 199 dead European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) as bait over 21 separate occasions spanning from May 21, 2009, to August 18, 2009. We used <b>timers</b> to <b>record</b> the time of consumption and cameras to identify which species ate the bait. Sixty-six eggs and 87 dead European starlings were consumed. The bait was consumed mostly at night (83 %) and by striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). We used nest survival models in program MARK to determine which covariates influenced bait persistence. We tested nine variables and found that bait persistence was influenced by section of the dike, time since study initiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed but not bait type (egg or dead European starling), terrain, or visual cover. How quickly scavengers were able to locate food, which was inversely related to rates of bait persistence, decreased with higher temperatures and wind speeds and increased with higher humidity. Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} weather and micro-habitat characteristics impact the ability of olfactory predators and scavengers to locate food...|$|R
50|$|A ramp-compare ADC {{produces}} a saw-tooth signal that ramps {{up or down}} then quickly returns to zero. When the ramp starts, a timer starts counting. When the ramp voltage matches the input, a comparator fires, and the <b>timer's</b> value is <b>recorded.</b> Timed ramp converters require the least number of transistors. The ramp time is sensitive to temperature because the circuit generating the ramp is often a simple oscillator. There are two solutions: use a clocked counter driving a DAC and then use the comparator to preserve the counter's value, or calibrate the timed ramp. A special advantage of the ramp-compare system is that comparing a second signal just requires another comparator, and another register to store the voltage value. A very simple (non-linear) ramp-converter can be implemented with a microcontroller and one resistor and capacitor. Vice versa, a filled capacitor can be taken from an integrator, time-to-amplitude converter, phase detector, sample and hold circuit, or peak and hold circuit and discharged. This has the advantage that a slow comparator cannot be disturbed by fast input changes.|$|R

This led to controversy over the records that Munden claimed to hold and have held in the past. Munden's critics have argued that his records are not sufficiently well documented to be valid, and that he currently holds no official fast draw world record. Fast Draw includes multiple events, {{each with its own}} world record. The record with the shortest time is single shot open freestyle (using a light-weight gun) held by Ernie Hill, of Litchfield Park, Ariz., with a recorded time of [...]208 seconds. Munden has received skepticism mostly due to the absence of both written evidence of his records, and for the absence of his supposed 3,500 trophies. After the advent of digital <b>timers,</b> the world <b>records</b> were reset because the older analog timers were less accurate. Munden claimed to have held many of these older records, with a fastest Walk and Draw Level time of 0.15 seconds that he claimed was the fastest shot in history.
