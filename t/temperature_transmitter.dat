40|$|Oral and {{external}} dosing methods replicating field exposure were developed using the double crested cormorant (DCCO) {{to test the}} toxicity of artificially weathered Deepwater Horizon Mississippi Canyon 252 oil. The majority of previous oil dosing studies conducted on wild-caught birds used gavage methods to dose birds with oil and determine toxicity. However, rapid gut transit time of gavaged oil likely reduces oil absorption. In the present studies, dosing relied on injection of oil into live feeder fish for oral dosing of these piscivorous birds, or applying oil to body contour feathers resulting in transdermal oil exposure and oral exposure through preening. Both oral {{and external}} oil dosing studies identified oil-related toxicity endpoints associated with oxidative stress such as hemolytic anemia, liver and kidney damage, and immuno-modulation or compromise. External oil application allowed for controlled study of thermoregulatory stress as well. Infrared thermal images indicated significantly greater surface temperatures and heat loss in treated birds following external oil applications; however, measurements collected by coelomically implanted <b>temperature</b> <b>transmitters</b> showed that internal body temperatures were stable {{over the course of}} the study period.

The energy {{costs associated with}} body cooling due to diving and ingesting large amounts of cold food were measured in tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula) feeding on zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), using implanted heart rate and body <b>temperature</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The effects of diving depth and food ingestion were measured in two sets of experiments: we measured body cooling and energy costs of six tufted ducks diving to different depths in a 6 -m-deep indoor tank; the costs for food ingestion and crushing mussel shells were assessed under seminatural winter conditions with the same ducks feeding on mussels in a 1. 5 -m-deep outdoor pond. Body temperature dropped during feeding bouts and increased gradually during intermittent resting periods. The temperature drop increased linearly with dive duration. The rate of body cooling increased with feeding depth, but it was lower again at depths below 4 m. Half of the increment in energy costs of diving {{can be attributed to}} thermoregulatory heat production, of which approximately 50 % is generated after diving to warm up the body. The excess costs for ducks feeding on large-sized mussels could be entirely explained by the estimated energy cost necessary to compensate the heat loss following food ingestion, suggesting that the heat production from shell crushing substituted for thermoregulation. Recovery from heat loss is probably a major component of the activity budget of wintering diving ducks...|$|R

The compression cycle consumes large quantities of air and despite intake filtration, small quantities of dust, aerosols and water pass through and deposit onto the blades. These deposits impede air flow through the compressor and over time degrade overall performance of the gas turbine. So a regular washing technique is required for cleaning the turbine. There are two type sof water wash system. Currently, the complete process of handling the valves and acquiring data from sensors is done by Turbine Control Panel. Turbine Control Panel is a DCS that handles lot of skids or systems in the power plant. Complete control and operation by Turbine Control Panel leads to overhead it with unnecessary complications. Any change in the system, such as addition of <b>temperature</b> <b>transmitter</b> or solenoid valves will result in modification of control software in Turbine Control Panel and also needs new cables for interconnection purpose.

A field survey was undertaken on the piping of the FPSO {{to investigate the}} actual pulsation and vibration levels followed by a computer analysis to investigate if fatigue failure, caused by the actual vibrations as measured, would occur.
