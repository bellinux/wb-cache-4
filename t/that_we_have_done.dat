500|$|Lim Kit Siang {{attributed}} the opposition's defeat to Mahathir's liberalism and the government's {{adoption of the}} DAP's stance on issues like [...] "language, culture and education". Some, however, doubted Mahathir's sincerity. One UMNO Youth official suggested that [...] "The Barisan government's flexible move... only shows that we are enjoying {{the highest level of}} tolerance purely based on the level of confidence in terms of political and economic position of the Malays. We share the political power with the Chinese. When they need to increase their political support from their community it is very important for them to serve the main concerns of the Chinese. So, why shouldn't we allow that? We can... achieve a win-win situation. This is a purely political move.... Similarly we UMNO Youth have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests.... However, those finished agendas <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> such as Islam, Bahasa Melayu [...] and the special status of the Malays, should not be questioned in any circumstance because these are very sensitive issues." ...|$|E

6000|$|On {{gaining the}} camp, however, I found, to my sorrow, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> the thing only too vigorously; for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not only put the enemy to flight, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> also frightened away those whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> come to deliver! ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{enough for}} one afternoon, when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> the House of Pansa, and I {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should go and sit down in Congress Park {{and listen to the}} Troy band. I was not without the hope that it would play [...] "Washington Post." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Afghanistan, U.S. {{military}} spokesman Maj. Matt Hackathorn {{denied the}} U.S. {{was involved in}} the strike. [...] "It was completely done by the Pakistani military," [...] he told the Associated Press. A spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Office also denied involvement of any external influence or pressure, saying of the airstrike, [...] "It is something <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and we have been doing for peace and security in our own region".|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} The Return of the King, when Gandalf {{leaves the}} hobbits, he {{mentions}} {{that he wants to}} have a long talk with Bombadil, calling him a [...] "moss-gatherer". Gandalf says, in response to Frodo's query of how well Bombadil is getting along, that Bombadil is [...] "as well as ever", [...] "quite untroubled" [...] and [...] "not much interested in anything <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and seen", save their visits to the Ents. At the very end of The Lord of the Rings, as Frodo sails into the West and leaves Middle-earth, he has what seems to him the very experience that appeared to him in the house of Bombadil in his dream of the second night.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Lucas made {{a further}} {{suggestion}} {{that there would}} be a fifth film, revealing an idea [...] "to make Shia LaBeouf the lead character next time and have Harrison Ford come back like Sean Connery did in the last movie." [...] At the time Last Crusade was filmed, Connery was still only 58. Lucas also said that age need not be a factor, as Ford was [...] "65 and did everything in this movie. The old chemistry is there, and it's not like he's an old man. He's incredibly agile; he looks even better than he did 20 years ago, if you ask me." [...] In August 2008, Lucas was researching potential plot devices, and stated Spielberg was open to the idea of the fifth film. He also changed his mind about continuing the series with a spin-off, joking [...] "Indiana Jones is Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones. If it was Mutt Williams it would be Mutt Williams and the Search for Elvis or something." [...] Two months later, Ford stated that he would not return if the fifth film was an animated film like , because [...] "I'd hate to see it reduced in any way from the movies <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and the way we have done them." [...] He also called Lucas' concept for the fifth film [...] "crazy but great".|$|E

[...] "I don't mind fighting, that comes {{in the way of}} business, but to see men rotting away like sheep with disease is not to my fancy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lee Robinson later said, [...] "I don't {{think it}} was a good script and I don't think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a very strong {{supporting}} cast and it was the first picture <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in which Chips didn't play the lead... I think our mistake there was to make a picture not geared for Chips." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I didn't {{really have}} a sense at <b>that</b> time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{something}} momentous, though it was long overdue ... Looking back now, {{it seems like a}} bigger deal." [...] (Constance Cook in re the 1970 New York State abortion bill; as she recounted to the New York Times in April 2000).|$|R
2500|$|In 2005 a {{team from}} the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, led by Dr. René Larsen, studied the map and its {{accompanying}} manuscripts to make recommendations on {{the best ways to}} preserve the centuries-old parchment. Among other findings, this study confirmed that the two halves of the map were entirely separate, though they might have been joined in the past. A few months earlier, Kirsten Seaver had suggested that a forger could have found two separate blank leaves in the original [...] "Speculum Historiale" [...] volume, from which the first few dozen pages appeared to be missing, and joined them together with the binding strip. On the other hand, at the International Conference on the History of Cartography in July 2009, Larsen revealed that his team had continued their investigation after publishing their original report, and he told the press that [...] "All the tests <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{over the past five years}} — on the materials and other aspects — do not show any signs of forgery". The formal report of his presentation shows that his work ignores rather than contradicts earlier studies. For example, he experimented only with artificial wormholes, and did not follow up the observation made at the 1966 Conference, that live bookworms were a known tool of the fake antiquities trade. Similarly, he claimed that the anatase in the ink could have come from sand used to dry it (the hypothetical source of the sand being gneiss from the Binnenthal area of Switzerland) but his team had not examined the crystals microscopically, and Kenneth Towe responded that this was an essential test, given that crystal size and shape should clearly distinguish commercial anatase from anatase found in sand.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{have it in}} {{your power}} {{to make it more}} {{profitable}} always for me to keep faith with you. It is due to you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so well in Guichen. Oh, I admit it frankly." ...|$|E
60|$|The moment {{their own}} clothes were dry (we {{lived in a}} {{perpetual}} atmosphere of steaming clothes) they would insist upon leaving us, which seemed to me discourteous after all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for them, and would dress themselves once more and start off home, and get wet again before they got there.|$|R
60|$|Now it was I {{understood}} why Simon Kenton had refrained from making any disagreeable remark when Paul told of our movements. He realized <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> a reckless thing, {{but was not}} minded to say what might have hurt our feelings {{at a time when}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> just aided in saving his life.|$|R
5000|$|McComb later said, [...] "When {{we got to}} London I {{think we}} sort of felt <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to make a kind of statement.

6000|$|... "It is annoying, indeed," [...] Gervaise agreed; and {{a murmur}} of {{disappointment}} ran round the assembled knights. [...] "However, {{we have the}} consolation <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> all we could, and I am sure that we shall {{do so in the}} future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And oh, what {{happiness}} {{to think}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with persecution and terror and war, and that I may worship God freely and openly!

5000|$|Movie {{director}} Roman Polanski, {{a survivor}} of the Ghetto, in his 1984 memoir Roman evoked his childhood experiences there before the mass deportations of Operation Reinhard in Kraków. [...] "My own feeling - Polański wrote - was that if only one could explain to them <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> nothing wrong, the Germans would realize that it all was a gigantic misunderstanding." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{make sure}} whether I wrote to you yesterday, and told you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{very well at}} the first reading after all, even in money. The {{reception}} was prodigious, and the readings are the town talk. But I rather think I did actually write this to you. My doubt on the subject arises from my having deliberated about writing on a Saturday.|$|R
60|$|The Lutherans have {{retained}} the Cross within their churches: {{it is to}} be regretted <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not <b>done</b> the same.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{the legions}} go no Roman would feel {{that his life}} was safe here. For all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> it is none the less the truth {{that it is no}} country of ours, and that we hold it as we won it by the sword." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{call that}} a mighty neat trick, and if so be you lads {{are lucky enough to}} turn the tables once more on the Britishers in the same clean fashion <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to-night, you can count yourselves on the way to earn {{commissions}} in the American Army." ...|$|E
6000|$|Great was the {{stir in the}} Mission. 'Now he and the gracious lady will <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{good work}} with their own eyes see, and--yes--we will him our {{converts}} in all their new clothes by their own hands constructed exhibit. It will a great day be--for the Lord always,' said Justus; and Lotta said 'Amen.' ...|$|E
60|$|No less {{a soldier}} than General Lafayette himself told us four, for <b>we</b> insisted on <b>having</b> Uncle 'Rasmus with us when an orderly came {{to say that}} the young French general would speak with those who had befriended the Jerseyman--even General Lafayette himself told us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in coming to the town of York that which advantaged the Cause, and asked what should be given us by way of reward.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have hired}} eight {{men in the}} market, today, to come out {{tomorrow}} to aid in gathering in the figs," [...] he said; [...] "and your mother has just sent down, {{to get some of}} the fishermen's maidens to come in to help her. It is time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with them, and we will then set about the vintage. Let us reap while we can, there is no saying what the morrow will bring forth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir.

60|$|I {{do not say}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so; but we may; {{for human}} nature is just the same now as it was then; and {{therefore}} it is as well for us to look round--at least once now and then, and see whether we too {{are in danger of}} falling, while we think that we are standing safe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or I," [...] said Ivo Taillebois, [...] "till I see Hereward's head on Bourne gable, {{where he}} stuck up those Norman's heads seven years ago. But what the Lord Abbot means by saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with English saints I do not see, for the villains of Crowland have {{just made a}} new one for themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they had}} fallen silent again--"I {{would have you}} remember," [...] he cried, [...] "that Pier Luigi was the Pontiff's son, and that the Pontiff will make haste to avenge his death and to re-establish here in Piacenza the Farnese sway. So that all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> this day may go for naught unless we take our measures." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got down seventy fathoms, or {{four hundred and}} twenty feet of {{perpendicular}} ladders, we stopped at another landing-place, just broad enough to afford standing room for us three. Here, the miner, pointing to an opening yawning horizontally in the rock at one side of us, {{said that this was}} the first gallery from the surface; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with the ladders for the present; and that a little climbing and crawling were now to begin.|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR FRIEND--I began a {{long letter}} {{to you from}} Lisle, giving a {{description}} of all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> and seen, but, finding it very dull, and knowing that you would show it again, I threw it aside and it was lost. You see by {{the top of this}} letter <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are at Paris, and (as I have often heard you say) <b>we</b> <b>have</b> brought our own amusement with us, for the ladies {{do not seem to be}} very fond of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> yet seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} about that boat," [...] he remarked. [...] "Though I don't know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it, <b>we</b> ought to <b>have</b> tried to pull her out." ...|$|R
