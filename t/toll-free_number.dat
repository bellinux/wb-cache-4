5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a <b>toll-free</b> <b>number</b> to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E

Southern Bell forced Johnson to stop after he had run up Falwell's telephone bill an estimated $500,000.
