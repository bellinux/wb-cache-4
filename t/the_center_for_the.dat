5|$|Later on November30, the {{depression}} further intensified into a tropical cyclone {{and was given}} the name Trina by the FMS. At this time, gale-force winds were only present in one quadrant of the storm. In previous years, gale-force winds had to be present all around <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> system to receive a name. Upon receiving its name, Trina attained its peak intensity with winds of 65km/h (40mph) along with a barometric pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.38inHg). Remaining nearly stationary, Trina succumbed to strong wind shear during the evening of November30. The JTWC only classified Trina as a tropical storm for 12hours before downgrading the system and issuing their final advisory early on December1. However, according to the FMS, the system retained gale-force winds through December2, by which time it was situated about 70km (45mi) northwest of Mangaia. Now significantly displaced from any convective activity, the remnants of Trina persisted in the same general area for several more days before completely dissipating.|$|E
5|$|The vulture is {{minimally}} sexually dimorphic, with {{no difference}} in plumage and little in size between males and females. The juvenile vulture has a dark bill and eyes, and a downy, gray neck that soon begins to turn the orange of an adult. Younger vultures are a slate gray overall, and, while they look similar to the adult by the third year, they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around {{five or six years}} of age. Jack Eitniear of <b>the</b> <b>Center</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Study of Tropical Birds in San Antonio, Texas reviewed the plumage of birds in captivity of various ages and found that ventral feathers were the first to begin turning white from two years of age onwards, followed by wing feathers, until the full adult plumage was achieved. The final immature stages being a scattered black feathers in the otherwise white lesser wing coverts.|$|E

5|$|After {{attaining}} {{tropical storm}} status, the maximum sustained winds fluctuated {{for three days}} between 40mph (65km/h) and 50mph (85km/h). This {{was due to the}} large size of Florence; the overall wind field reached a diameter of 460miles (745km), and the radius of maximum winds reached about 110miles (170km). By September 6, a well-defined cloud swirl became evident, with thin rainbands developing in the southeast and northwest quadrants. As a result, hurricane forecasters anticipated Florence would develop significantly and attain major hurricane status. Though convection gradually migrated closer {{to the center of the}} storm, forecasters could not detect a well-defined center of circulation by late on September 6. On September 7, convection developed over and to the west of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in its duration. However, Florence failed to intensify further, as its wind field had increased to more than 1,035miles (1,670km) in diameter. This led to difficulties in forecasting, as its environment favored further strengthening; the storm tracked through an area of 84°F (29°C) water temperatures and light shear, and the system maintained a large low-level cyclonic envelop with abundant convection. By early on September 8, the storm consisted of an elongated, shapeless cloud pattern atypical of a tropical cyclone. Later that day, as an anticyclone developed over Florence, the storm began to consolidate around a vorticity center on the western side of the large cyclonic envelope. It began to strengthen more steadily as it turned to the northwest. Early on September 10, an eye began developing within a round central dense overcast over the center, and shortly thereafter Florence attained hurricane status while located about 390miles (630km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of <b>the</b> <b>Center</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E
5|$|From 1987 through 1994 {{the award}} was given {{out by a}} panel of science fiction experts led by Orson Scott Card. Beginning in 1995, the {{committee}} was replaced by a group of jurors, who vote on the nominations submitted for consideration. The initial jurors were James Gunn, Frederik Pohl, and Judith Merril. Merril was replaced on the jury by former winner Kij Johnson in 1997, one of Sturgeon's children—Noel Sturgeon in most years—was added to the panel in 1999, and George Zebrowski was added to the panel in 2005. Nominations are submitted by reviewers, fans, publishers, and editors, and are collated by the current Director of <b>the</b> <b>Center</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Study of Science Fiction, Christopher McKitterick, into a list of finalists to be voted on by the jury. The maximum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Campbell Award. Winners are always invited to attend the ceremony. Since 2004 winners have received a personalized trophy, while since the inception of the award a permanent trophy has recorded all of the winners.|$|E
