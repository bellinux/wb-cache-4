MPL is a significant development as it is based on competency-based approach to training professional pilots. It represents the first time in 30 years that ICAO had significantly reviewed the standards for the training of flight crew.|$|E

The response instructions are of two types: behavioral tendency and knowledge. Tests with behavioral tendency instructions ask respondents to identify how they would likely behave in the situation.

40|$|The {{point of}} {{departure}} {{in this study is}} the question: do teachers who develop <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the variation theory change the way(s) they offer their pupils the object of learning due to the theoretical framework. The aim of the study is to describe this development, i. e. to find if and how teachers developed <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> when planning <b>instruction,</b> and in what way(s) this has an impact on the pupils' learning outcome when using contrasts in the instruction. The theoretical framework is strongly content related, and by analysing the learning object's critical aspects the teachers are guided to focus on the content in this particular way. The question "what does it take to develop knowledge about the object of learning?" has to be answered by the teachers before choice of teaching method is made. The research method used is Learning Study, a fusion between lesson study and design experiment. The teachers (6) have carried out nine research lessons in three Learning Study cycles (containing three lessons each). The pupils belong to three different classes and are between 9 and 11 years old. The result shows how the teachers gradually use the variation theory when planning instruction and how the learning outcomes shown by the pupils improve. The developed theoretical insight seems to affect the teachers' ways of seeing the object of learning, such as subtle changes of how to organize the critical features of the learning object, are discerned. In every learning study cycle contrasts are used in one lesson, and in the analysis of the effect of the contrasts, the two remaining lessons are used as control groups. The results show the impact of contrasts in the pupils' learning outcomes. The need to complement a lesson study with a theoretical perspective on learning is that the teachers are then given the opportunity {{to make use of the}} theory when planning instruction individually, not only in a lesson study. There again, the Learning Study model seems to be a powerful model with which to develop teachers' understanding of the theoretical framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{value and}} {{function}} of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> is an important and disputed issue, which has received surprisingly little scholarly attention. I attempt to clarify the notion of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and examine its general relationship to learning. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> is not necessarily distinguished by any particular content; the adjective “theoretical” can just as well signify a particular methodological approach or a {{way of dealing with}} a topic, including the way it is conceptualized. I further argue that <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> can be merely implicit and non-propositional. Though I reject a radical constructivist view, according to which knowledge acquisition consists in socialization, it must be admitted that socialization and the acquisition of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> do turn out to go closely hand in hand, inasmuch as <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> is often a precondition of successful socialization. Concepts, principles, models and symbolic systems support the acquisition of both theoretical and other kinds of knowledge, but also help the learner to find her way about in an environment that is already formed by theories and conceptual understandings. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> is both a learning instrument and a tool for navigatio...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of the evidence to guide pain management practices, practices are often sub-optimal with children experiencing moderate to severe pain post-operatively. Limited <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> about managing pain has been suggested as one reason for this. Several studies have identified gaps in nurses' <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge.</b> However, the affect of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> on pain management practices has not been explored. This explored whether there is a relationship between nurses' <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and the quality of their practices. Nurses (n= 13) on one children's surgical ward were shadowed for a five-hour period during two-four shifts. Data about post-operative pain management practices were collected using a pain management checklist and field notes. Nurses (n= 12) also completed the revised pain management knowledge test. Questionnaire scores were compared to the observational data. No positive relationship was found between nurses' level of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and how well they actually managed pain. Nurses did not appear to routinely apply <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> in practice. This may explain, at least in part, why pain management practices remain poor despite the evidence to guide practice being readily available.

40|$|Background/aim: Practice {{education}} is a compulsory component of all entry-level programmes in the health professions. It {{is used as a}} teaching strategy to connect <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge,</b> such as occupation-focussed models with practice. The study aimed to explore students' perceptions about the influence of practice educators on their understanding of the use of occupation-focussed models in practice. Methods: Using a phenomenological approach, semi-structured interviews gained an understanding of six participants' experiences of their practice education. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically. Findings: Three themes emerged from participants' experiences of practice education. 'Explaining the theory-practice nexus' referred to participants' difficulties in distinguishing between different forms of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge,</b> it described educators struggle to fulfil the dual roles of educator and practitioner' when articulating the <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> underpinning practice. This often led participants taking an active role in their own learning. 'Experiencing dissonance between university-based studies and the real-world' described the difference between the importance university studies placed on theory in comparison to practice. 'Creating a positive mindset for the use of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> in practice for future practice' illustrated strategies used by some practice educators to articulate the use of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Conclusions: The study highlighted practice educators role in shaping students' perceptions of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> use in professional reasoning. The increased recognition of practice educators on the implicit curricula creates an onus on the university sector to provide discussion and information exchanges to increase educators' opportunities to develop, update and increase their skills in describing and using <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> to underpin practice...|$|R

40|$|Objective : The European Paediatric Life Support (EPLS) {{provider}} course aims at training {{doctors and}} nurses in the efficient and prompt management of cardiopulmonary arrest in children. EPLS is a 2 -day European Resuscitation Council course, involving the teaching of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and practical skills. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the retention of <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> and certain skills of EPLS providers 4 months after the course. Materials and methods : In total, 80 {{doctors and nurses}} who attended three EPLS provider courses, from May 2012 to December 2012, were asked to participate in the study and only 50 responded positively. Demographic data (age, sex, occupation) of the participants were collected. The European Resuscitation Council-approved EPLS written test was used to assess <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> right after the course and after 4 months. The retention of certain skills (airway opening, bag-mask ventilation, chest compressions) was also examined. Results : The <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> decreased significantly (P < 0. 001) 4 months after the course. Age, sex and occupational status (medical or nursing profession) had no effect in <b>theoretical</b> <b>knowledge</b> retention.
