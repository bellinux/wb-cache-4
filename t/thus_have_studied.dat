40|$|Frustration and the {{associated}} phenomenon of "avoided criticality" have been proposed as {{an explanation for the}} dramatic relaxation slowdown in glass-forming liquids. To test this, we have undertaken a Monte-Carlo study of possibly the simplest such problem, the 2 -dimensional XY model with frustration corresponding to a small flux, $f$, per plaquette. At $f= 0 $, there is a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T^*$, but at any small but non-zero $f$, this transition is avoided, and replaced (presumably) by a vortex-ordering transition at much lower temperatures. We <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the evolution of the dynamics for small and moderate $f$ as the system is cooled from above $T^*$ to below. While we do find strongly temperature dependent slowing of the dynamics as $T$ crosses $T^*$, and that simultaneously the dynamics becomes more complex, neither effect is anywhere nearly as dramatic as the corresponding phenomena in glass-forming liquids. At the very least, this implies that the properties of supercooled liquids must depend on more than frustration and the existence of an avoided transition. Comment: 11 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

We argue that high identifiers {{are more concerned about}} how radical action could harm their social identity than low identifiers. By contrast, low identifiers are more willing to confront the disadvantage by radical means, adopting a nothing-to-lose mindset. Consistent with this, support for radical action was strongest among low identifiers, especially when the in-group accepted the disadvantage as legitimate (creating a more desperate situation: Studies 1 and 2) and when they were not dependent on the out-group (and <b>thus</b> <b>had</b> nothing-to-lose: <b>Study</b> 2) ...|$|R

40|$|As {{beta-carotene}} is transported via micelles {{across the}} intestinal lumen for absorption, {{the factors that}} regulate uptake into micelles could also regulate {{at least in part}} beta-carotene absorption in humans. <b>Thus,</b> we <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the effect of different dietary lipids on beta-carotene uptake into mixed micelles in vitro. Using this method, the effects of fatty acids of increasing degrees of unsaturation, vitamin A, cholesterol, and vitamin E on beta-carotene uptake into micelles were studied. Uptake of beta-carotene into micelles was stimulated by cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids (uptake correlated with degree of unsaturation). beta-Carotene solubilization into micelles was inhibited by vitamin A and vitamin E. These results suggest that the absorption of beta-carotene may be partly regulated at the level of formation of intestinal micelles by the presence of different dietary components...|$|R
