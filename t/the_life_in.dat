5|$|There is {{no single}} British {{language}}, though English {{is by far the}} main language spoken by British citizens, being spoken monolingually by more than 70% of the UK population. English is therefore the de facto official language of the United Kingdom. However, under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Cornish, Irish Gaelic, Ulster Scots, Manx, and Lowland Scots languages are officially recognised as Regional or Minority languages by the UK Government. As indigenous languages which continue to be spoken as a first language by native inhabitants, Welsh and Scottish Gaelic have a different legal status from other minority languages. In some parts of the UK, some of these languages are commonly spoken as a first language; in wider areas, their use in a bilingual context is sometimes supported and/or promoted by central and/or local government policy. For naturalisation purposes, a competence standard of English, Scottish Gaelic or Welsh is required to pass <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom test. However, English is used routinely, and although considered culturally important, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are much less used.|$|E

25|$|In America, Episcopalian Dennis Bennett is {{sometimes}} cited {{as one of}} the charismatic movement's seminal influence. In the United Kingdom, Colin Urquhart, Michael Harper, David Watson and others were in the vanguard of similar developments.

25|$|Most {{of what we}} {{know about}} Columbanus is based on Columbanus' own works (as far as they have been preserved) and Jonas of Bobbio's Vita Columbani (Life of Columbanus), which was written between 639 and 641. Jonas entered Bobbio after Columbanus' death but relied on reports of monks who still knew Columbanus. A {{description}} of miracles of Columbanus written by an anonymous monk of Bobbio is of much later date. In the second volume of his Acta Sanctorum O.S.B., Mabillon gives <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} Wetz had {{preferred}} <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> provincial Erfurt {{to that of}} the real music metropolises, and that he was never moved to create popular compositions which could have increased his reputation, did little to bring Wetz and his works to the broader general public. Indeed, some conductors questioned the quality of his compositions until the 1990s (especially during the arrangements for celebrations in his honour in Erfurt in 1955, 20th anniversary of his death and what would be his 80th birthday). Only recently have his creations been rediscovered. For example, the requiem of the composer was performed {{for the first time in}} sixty years in September 2003 at the Erfurt church's music festival, under the direction of George Alexander Albrecht.|$|E
25|$|The emblem for the 2006 annual {{meetings}} of the IMF and the World Bank Group is gold in colour, with lines and a bud in the emblem. Gold is selected for the emblem {{as it relates to}} the financial sector and the country's contributions to the world economy. It exemplifies excellence and strength, which characterise Singapore as a regional business and financial centre. The tones point towards the increase in the wealth of the nations, with expanding richness and scope for the people. The bud may appear to represent the plurality of ideas and cultures at the event. It also symbolises <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the city-state, that brings forth its potential for growth in the global market. With its curve, the spine depicts the horizon of the world. The stylised lines are the longitudes, to represent the connection of countries and world leaders at the {{annual meetings}}. Petals are to signify the unity of leaders to have a common goal at the meetings. The lines also depict the congruent roles countries have to achieve international cooperation for growth in the world.|$|E
