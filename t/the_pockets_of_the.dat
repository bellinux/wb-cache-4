25|$|Despite his success, Tarchaneiotes was resented by {{the local}} magnates, who had mostly profited from the {{previous}} situation and were most affected from his reforms and his honest administration, {{as well as by}} the anti-Arsenite establishment of the Church. In the end, some of the pronoia holders, who were deprived of land through John's reforms, approached the anti-Arsenite bishop of Philadelphia, Theoleptos, and accused Tarchaneiotes of plotting a revolt. Facing the hostility of the local aristocracy, Tarchaneiotes was forced to flee—probably in mid-1300—to Thessalonica, where the emperor resided. Apparently Tarchaneiotes was imprisoned again, for he is last recorded as being released again from prison in 1304. Following his flight, the situation in Asia Minor deteriorated rapidly as his reforms were abandoned and reversed, and the army's pay was diverted into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local elites. Consequently, within a short time the Byzantine army disintegrated, especially as the numerous mercenaries deserted it for want of pay, opening the path for the complete collapse of Byzantine authority in Asia Minor over the next decade.|$|E
500|$|Communications scholar Arthur Kroker {{argues that}} Innis's {{study of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he {{attempted}} to demonstrate that [...] "technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence". [...] It also reflected Innis's lifelong interest {{in the exercise of}} economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that this National Policy funnelled money from Prairie farmers into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern business establishment. [...] "Western Canada", Innis wrote, [...] "has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement." ...|$|E

In the books, his income is derived from <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ungodly" [...] (as he terms those who live by a lesser moral code than his own), whom he is given to [...] "socking on the boko".

2500|$|In 2012, Cohen {{sponsored}} the Cohen Amendment reducing infrastructure funding to Afghanistan.

When {{another member of the}} House said the funding was essential to bringing our troops home, Cohen replied “The {{truth of the matter is}} that it has nothing to do with whether we can bring our troops home or not. [...] The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. [...] The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it’s good enough to bring them home permanently.” The Amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.|$|E

The riot put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation, mugging the city and making off with incalculable value in jobs, earnings taxes, corporate taxes, retail dollars, sales taxes, mortgages, interest, property taxes, development dollars, investment dollars, tourism dollars, and plain damn money. The money was carried out in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> businesses and the white people who fled as fast as they could. The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterwards it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosionthe outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand. In 1968 the figure hit eighty-thousand, followed by forty-six thousand in 1969.|$|E

2500|$|Gladstone {{steadily}} reduced Income tax {{over the}} course of his tenure as Chancellor. In 1861 the tax was reduced to ninepence (£0–0s–9d), in 1863 to sevenpence, in 1864 to fivepence and in 1865 to fourpence. Gladstone believed that government was extravagant and wasteful with taxpayers' money and so sought to let money [...] "fructify in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people" [...] by keeping taxation levels down through [...] "peace and retrenchment". [...] In 1859 he wrote to his brother, who was a member of the Financial Reform Association at Liverpool: [...] "Economy is the first and great article (economy such as I understand it) in my financial creed. [...] The controversy between direct and indirect taxation holds a minor, though important place". He wrote to his wife on 14 January 1860: [...] "I am certain, from experience, of the immense advantage of strict account-keeping in early life. It is just like learning the grammar then, which when once learned need not be referred to afterwards".|$|E
2500|$|Yang {{states that}} people's democracy, unlike {{parliamentary}} democracy, realises {{the principle of}} [...] "popular sovereignty". The basis for {{the argument is that}} in a parliamentary democracy, a system in which ordinary people can vote for different parties, the parties available are in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bourgeoisie. Parties can only win, Yang claims, if they have enough money—when parties have money, they get it from the bourgeoisie. This relationship turns the political parties contesting the election to subservient tools of the bourgeoisie, and makes them govern in their interest. While a system with multi-party elections, rotational government and parliaments looks more democratic, it is in fact beholden to the interests of the bourgeoisie, and not the people. In contrast, the people's democratic system with People's Congresses realises popular sovereignty through a mixture electoral and consultative democracy. Unlike in parliamentary democracies Yang adds, people standing for elections for seats in people's congresses are financed state, thus giving every candidate an equal chance of getting elected. Yang claims that;All political parties [...] bear the trust of the people, all implement their duties according to the law and under the leadership of the Communist Party, and serve the people.|$|E
