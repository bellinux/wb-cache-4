5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many <b>types</b> <b>and</b> traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gastric carcinomas can {{be divided}} into {{intestinal}} <b>and</b> diffuse <b>types,</b> with the last type having a worse prognosis. AIMS: To investigate whether specific patterns in the expression of apoptosis related proteins correlate with carcinoma type and/or prognosis METHODS: The expression of Fas, Bcl- 2, Bax, Bcl-xl, cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was studied immunohistochemically and the extent of apoptosis and proliferation was investigated in 11 cases of intestinal <b>type</b> <b>and</b> in eight cases of diffuse type carcinoma. RESULTS: Fas was expressed in all intestinal <b>type</b> <b>and</b> in one diffuse type carcinoma. Bcl-xl was expressed in 10 of 11 intestinal <b>type</b> <b>and</b> in one of eight diffuse type carcinomas. Bcl- 2 was expressed in lamina propria immune cells. iNOS was expressed in six of 11 intestinal <b>type</b> <b>and</b> in four of eight diffuse <b>type</b> carcinomas, <b>and</b> COX- 2 was expressed in eight of 11 intestinal <b>type</b> <b>and</b> in six of eight diffuse type carcinomas. CONCLUSION: Fas and Bcl-xl expression can differentiate between intestinal <b>type</b> <b>and</b> diffuse <b>type</b> gastric carcinomas.
