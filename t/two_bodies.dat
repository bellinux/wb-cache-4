5|$|The 2:3 {{resonance}} {{between the}} <b>two</b> <b>bodies</b> is highly stable, and is preserved {{over millions of}} years. This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the <b>two</b> <b>bodies</b> can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the <b>two</b> <b>bodies</b> could never collide. The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull between the two causes angular momentum {{to be transferred to}} Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to Kepler's third law. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto orbit relative to Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nucleon-nucleon interaction {{by using the}} meson exchange model and the <b>two</b> <b>body</b> Dirac equations of constraint dynamics. This approach to the <b>two</b> <b>body</b> problem has been successfully tested for QED and QCD relativistic bound states. An important question we wish to address {{is whether or not}} the <b>two</b> <b>body</b> nucleon-nucleon scattering problem can be reasonably described in this approach as well. This test involves a number of related problems. First we must reduce our <b>two</b> <b>body</b> Dirac equations exactly to a Schrödingerlike equation in such a way that allows us to use techniques to solve our <b>two</b> <b>body</b> Dirac equations already developed for Schrödinger-like systems in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Related to this we present a new derivation of Calogero’s variable phase shift differential equation for coupled Schrödinger-like equations. Then we determine if the use of nine meson exchanges in our <b>two</b> <b>body</b> Dirac equations give a reasonable fit to the experimental scattering phase shifts for n − p scattering. The data involves seven angular momentum states including the singlet states 1 S 0, 1 P 1, 1 D 2 and the triplet states 3 P 0, 3 P 1, 3 S 1, 3 D 1. Two models that we have tested give us a fairly good fit. The parameters obtained by fitting the n − p experimental scattering phase shift give a fairly good prediction for most of the p − p experimental scattering phase shifts examined (for the singlet states 1 S 0, 1 D 2 and triplet states 3 P 0, 3 P 1). Thus the <b>two</b> <b>body</b> Dirac equations of constraint dynamics presents us with a fit that encourages the exploration of a more realistic model. We outline generalizations of the meson exchange model for invariant potentials that may possibly improve the fit. 1...|$|R
