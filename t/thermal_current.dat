50|$|Léon Brillouin in 1950 {{discussed}} {{an electrical}} circuit analogue {{that uses a}} rectifier (such as a diode) instead of a ratchet. The idea was the diode would rectify the Johnson noise <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> flucuations produced by the resistor, generating a direct current {{which could be used}} to perform work. In the detailed analysis it was shown that the thermal fluctuations within the diode generate an electromotive force that cancels the voltage from rectified current fluctuations. Therefore, just as with the ratchet, the circuit will produce no useful energy if all the components are at thermal equilibrium (at the same temperature); a DC current will be produced only when the diode is at a lower temperature than the resistor.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the polarimetric {{emission}} parameters for anisotropic media are derived using the generalized Kirchhoff's law for media with a uniform temperature and the fluctuation-dissipation theory for media with a temperature profile. Both finite-size objects and half-space media are considered. When the object has a uniform temperature across its body, the Kirchhoff's law, {{based on the}} condition of energy conservation in thermal equilibrium is generalized to obtain the emission parameters of an anisotropic medium, which can be interpreted as the absorptivity or the absorption cross section of the complementary object with a permittivity that is the transpose of the original object. When the medium has a nonuniform temperature distribution, the fluctuation-dissipation theory is applied for deriving the covariances between vector components of the <b>thermal</b> <b>currents</b> and, consequently, the covariances of the polarizations of electric fields radiated by the <b>thermal</b> <b>currents.</b> To verify the formulas derived from the fluctuation-dissipation theory, we let the temperature of the object be a constant and show that the results reduce to those obtained from the generalized Kirchhoff's law...|$|R

40|$|According to {{constructal}} area-point {{heat conduction}} model, the <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> {{in the high}} conductive link increases only at conjunction points. If the optimum number of the lower order constructs which formed higher order constructs is finite, {{the number of the}} conjunction points is finite and the <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> in the high conductive link increases discretely. The cross-section of the high conductive link should be adapted with the change of the <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> through it. For minimizing the thermal resistance, the more <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> flows into the high conducting path, the wider the cross-section of the high conducting path should be. A new method based on discrete variable cross-section conducting path is introduced in this paper. Both the case of the elemental area with constant cross-section conducting path and the case of the elemental area with variable cross-section conducting path are discussed. The results show that the minimum of maximum thermal resistance which is obtained through assembling can be obtained by changing the cross-section conducting path based on constructal theory and in each assembly, the optimized minimum thermal resistance based on variable cross-section conducting path element is smaller than that based on constant cross-section conducting path element. When the optimum number of the lower order constructs (niÂ [greater-or-equal, slanted]Â  4) which formed higher order constructs is fixed, at the same construct, the constructal optimal method based on discrete variable cross-section conducting path can reduce the thermal resistance further.

40|$|Spin {{currents}} are paramount {{to manipulate}} the magnetization of ferromagnetic elements in spin-based memory, logic and microwave devices, and to induce spin polarization in non-magnetic materials. A unique approach to create spin <b>currents</b> employs <b>thermal</b> gradients and heat flow. Here we demonstrate that a <b>thermal</b> spin <b>current</b> can be tuned conveniently by a voltage. In magnetic tunnel contacts to semiconductors (silicon and germanium), it is shown that amodest voltage (∼ 200 mV) changes the <b>thermal</b> spin <b>current</b> induced by Seebeck spin tunnelling {{by a factor of}} five, because it modifies the relevant tunnelling states and thereby the spin-dependent thermoelectric parameters. The magnitude and direction of the spin current is also modulated by combining electrical and <b>thermal</b> spin <b>currents</b> with equal or opposite sign. The results demonstrate that spin-dependent thermoelectric properties away from the Fermi energy are accessible, and open the way towards tailoring <b>thermal</b> spin <b>currents</b> and torques by voltage, rather than material design. Spin currents—the flow of spin angular momentum—are acrucial ingredient of spintronics 1, 2, in which digital informa-tion is represented by the spin degree of freedom. Tradition-ally, a spin current is generated by a spin-polarized charge current, through spin–orbit interaction, or by magnetization dynamics 3 – 5.

40|$|By {{investigating}} the nonequilibrium transport across a metal/superconductor junction in both nonrelativistic and relativistic cases, we {{reveal that the}} asymmetric Andreev reflection with anisotropic superconductors is able to induce the electric and thermal Hall-like effect, {{in the absence of}} magnetic field. That is, a longitudinal electric voltage or temperature bias can induce transverse electric or <b>thermal</b> <b>currents</b> merely through the asymmetric Andreev reflection, respectively. In particular, a transverse thermoelectric effect, i. e., the Ettingshausen-like effect, is identified, although the conjugate Nernst effect is absent. The direction change of these electric and <b>thermal</b> Hall-like <b>currents</b> is also discussed. The Hall-like effects uncovered here do not require the conventional time-reversal symmetry breaking, but rather originate from the mirror symmetry breaking with respect to the interface normal due to the anisotropic paring symmetry of the superconductor.
