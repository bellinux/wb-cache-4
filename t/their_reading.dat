In these, he defended the High Romantics against neo-Christian critics influenced by such writers as T. S. Eliot, who became a recurring intellectual foil.

25|$|Althusser's {{influence}} is also {{seen in the}} work of economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick, who have interpreted that Marx's mature works hold a conception of class different from the normally understood ones. For them, in Marx class refers not to a group of people (for example, those that own the means of production versus those that do not), but to a process involving the production, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labor. Their emphasis on class as a process is consistent with <b>their</b> <b>reading</b> and use of Althusser's concept of overdetermination in terms of understanding agents and objects as the site of multiple determinations.|$|E

Gabl, Kaiser, Long and Roemer found similar results when providing reading intervention in the form of guided reading groups to grade two and grade four students. The results showed an increase in reading fluency and comprehension after using flexible grouping in guided reading.|$|E

25|$|Critical opinion has {{generally}} held Avellaneda's work in low regard, and Cervantes himself is {{highly critical of}} {{it in his own}} Part 2. However, it is possible that Cervantes would never have completed his own continuation {{were it not for the}} stimulus Avellaneda provided. Throughout Part 2 of Cervantes' book Don Quixote meets characters who know of him from <b>their</b> <b>reading</b> of his Part 1, but in Chapter 59 Don Quixote first learns of Avellaneda's Part 2, and is outraged since it portrays him as being no longer in love with Dulcinea del Toboso. As a result of this Don Quixote decides not to go to Zaragoza to take part in the jousts, as he had planned, because such an incident features in that book. From then on Avellaneda's work is ridiculed at frequent intervals; Don Quixote even meets one of its characters, Don Alvaro Tarfe, and gets him to swear an affidavit that he has never met the true Don Quixote before.|$|E
25|$|While a bowler, {{with the}} use of {{variations}} in his/her delivery aims to target the concentration of batsmen as well as their skill and technique of batting, anticipation of the delivery is crucial for the batsman, as emphasised by Jodi Richardson. Richardson reveals the world class batsman's dilemma while facing fast bowlers, stating that the time between the batsmen's anticipation of the trajectory of the ball and positioning themselves for the appropriate shot can be twice as long as the interval between the ball leaving the bowler's hand and reaching the batsman's crease. Side by side, Richardson alludes to the research undertaken by Dr. Sean Müller in Australia which was partly funded by Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence. The results of the research demonstrated the importance of anticipation of the delivery for batsmen in cricket. They revealed that experienced batsmen possessed a unique ability which enabled them to adjust their feet as well as their positioning on the crease accordingly based upon <b>their</b> <b>reading</b> of the body language and movements enacted by the bowler prior to the release of the ball. This foresight that batsmen use while on the crease is referred to as 'advance information' by Richardson. Moreover, Müller's research outlined that the presence of this 'advance information' was not as evident among the lesser skilled batsmen in comparison to the experienced ones.|$|E

500|$|Research has {{suggested}} that cognitive flexibility is related to other cognitive abilities, such as fluid intelligence, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. Fluid intelligence, described {{as the ability to}} solve problems in new situations, enables fluid reasoning ability. [...] When one is able to reason fluidly, they are in turn more likely to be cognitively flexible. Furthermore, those who are able to be cognitively flexible have been shown {{to have the ability to}} switch between and/or simultaneously think about sounds and meanings, which increases <b>their</b> <b>reading</b> fluency and comprehension. Cognitive flexibility has also been shown to be related to one’s ability to cope in particular situations. For example, when individuals are better able to shift their thinking from situation to situation they will focus less on stressors within these situations.|$|E
500|$|Trimmer's {{first book}} was An easy {{introduction}} to the knowledge of nature, and reading the holy scriptures, adapted to the capacities of children (1780), which built on the revolution in children's literature begun by Anna Laetitia Barbauld. In the [...] "Preface", Trimmer writes that Isaac Watts's Treatise on Education was {{the inspiration for the}} work and that [...] "a book containing a kind of general survey of the works of Nature would be very useful, as a means to open the mind by gradual steps to the knowledge of the SUPREME BEING, preparatory to <b>their</b> <b>reading</b> the holy scriptures". In the text, the reader follows a mother and her two children, Charlotte and Henry (perhaps named after two of Trimmer's own children), on a series of nature walks during which the mother describes the wonders of God's creation. In 1793, a version of this book was added to the catalogue of the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge; after 77 years, it had sold over 750,000 copies.|$|E

Rather than finding any merit in the book, the boys are angry when they find the material inoffensive, prompting Cartman to declare he has been [...] "tricked" [...] into reading an entire book. Through {{the rise and fall of}} Butters' career as an author, the episode also demonstrates the perils of literary success and hoaxes. The episode also lampoons the notion that a book can be identified as the sole reason for a reader to kill somebody, particularly through Butters' reaction to The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs. Butters experiences blackouts after reading The Catcher in the Rye and chanting [...] "Kill John Lennon/Ronald Reagan!", until he disappointedly learns they are already dead. Later, a reader of Butters' book The Poop That Took a Pee goes out and murders the Kardashians.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, {{developmental}} psychologist Maryanne Wolf took up {{the cause}} of defending reading and print culture in her book , approaching the subject matter from a scientific angle in contrast to Birkerts' cultural-historical angle. A few reviewers were critical of Wolf for only touching upon the Internet's potential impact on reading in her book; however, in essays published concurrent with the book's release she elaborated upon her worries. In an essay in The Boston Globe, Wolf expressed her grave concern {{that the development of}} knowledge in children who are heavy users of the Internet could produce mere [...] "decoders of information who have neither the time nor the motivation to think beneath or beyond their googled universes", and cautioned that the web's [...] "immediacy and volume of information {{should not be confused with}} true knowledge". In an essay published by Powell's Books, Wolf contended that some of the reading brain's strengths could be lost in future generations [...] "if children are not taught first to read, and to think deeply about <b>their</b> <b>reading,</b> and only then to e-read". Preferring to maintain an academic perspective, Wolf firmly asserted that her speculations have not yet been scientifically verified but deserved serious study.|$|E
500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at <b>their</b> <b>Reading</b> and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard and Maria Edgeworth {{state that}} [...] "She [...] was of {{opinion that the}} art of {{education}} {{should be considered as}} an experimental science", and that the failures of the past were due to [...] "following theory rather than practice". Richard Edgeworth and Honora then set about applying the emerging principles of educational psychology to the actual practice of education. From <b>their</b> <b>reading</b> of theory they determined that the reason Barbauld was successful was that the child's reading was rewarded (thus departing radically from Rousseau), because it was associated with pleasure. Honora Sneyd conceived of the title of their work therefore as Practical Education. With her husband, Honora wrote the first version of Practical Education as a children's book Practical education: or, the history of Harry and Lucy for Honora her daughter, which was begun in 1778 and privately published in February 1780 in Lichfield as Practical Education, vol 2. The book tells a simple story of two parents and their two model children, Harry and Lucy, who carry out domestic chores and ask their parents many questions, the answers to which may be deemed educational. The children explain their discoveries and how they learn, the whole presented as nine forms of learning. As originally conceived it was intended to be the second part of a series of three books, but the remaining parts remained unwritten. The original plan had been for a collaborative work, contributed to by various members of the Lunar Society. it was an ambitious project designed to fill what they perceived of as major deficiencies in the field of both technical and scientific education and to introduce early ideas on morality, science and other academic disciplines into the developing mind of the young child. After Honora Sneyd's premature death, her sister Elizabeth continued the work, in her role as the third wife of Richard Edgeworth. The final version of the book was authored by Richard and Maria Edgeworth and published after both Honora and her sister Elizabeth's deaths, in 1798, and further revised under Maria's name as Early lessons (1801–1825). In reality this was a family project contributed to by a number of their members that would extend over 50 years, beyond Richard Edgeworth's death in 1817 (c.1774–1825).|$|E
