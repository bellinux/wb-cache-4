40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} if A and B form a nontrivial K-pair, {{then there is}} a semi-computable set C such that A ≤e C and B ≤e C. As a consequence, we obtain a {{definition}} of the total enumeration degrees: a nonzero enumeration degree is total if and only if it is the join of a nontrivial maximal K-pair. We also obtain a definition of the “c. e. in ” relation of total <b>degrees</b> in <b>the</b> enumeration <b>degrees.</b> <b>The</b> total <b>degrees</b> are <b>the</b> image of <b>the</b> Turing <b>degrees</b> under their natural embed-ding into <b>the</b> enumeration <b>degrees.</b> <b>The</b> question of whether <b>the</b> total <b>degrees</b> are definable in <b>the</b> enumeration <b>degrees</b> as a partial order is almost old as <b>the</b> enumer-ation <b>degrees</b> themselves.

5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact.

Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure.
