5000|$|From 1776 to 1783, {{no state}} {{government}} had a passport requirement. The Articles of Confederation government (1783-1789) {{did not have}} a passport requirement. From 1789 through late 1941, the government established under the Constitution required United States passports of citizens only during the American Civil War (1861-1865) and during and shortly after World War I (1914-1918). The passport requirement of the Civil War era lacked statutory authority. After the outbreak of World War I, passports were required by executive order, though there was no statutory authority for the requirement. The <b>Travel</b> <b>Control</b> Act of May 22, 1918 permitted the president, when the United States was at war, to proclaim a passport requirement, and a proclamation was issued on August 18, 1918. Though World War I ended on November 11, 1918, the passport requirement lingered until March 3, 1921. There was an absence of a passport requirement under United States law between 1921 and 1941. World War II (1939-1945) again led to passport requirements under the <b>Travel</b> <b>Control</b> Act of 1918. A 1978 amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 made it illegal to enter or depart the United States without an issued passport even in peacetime. [...] Note that the amendment does permit the President to make exceptions; historically, these exceptions have been used to permit travel to certain countries (particularly Canada) without a passport.

The passport requirement of the Civil War era lacked statutory authority. During World War I (1914-1918), European countries instituted passport requirements. The <b>Travel</b> <b>Control</b> Act of May 22, 1918, permitted the president, when the United States was at war, to proclaim a passport requirement, and President Wilson issued such a proclamation on August 18, 1918.

He held a variety of positions in the Department of Justice, including as general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, director of the alien enemy control unit, and administrator of foreign <b>travel</b> <b>control.</b> His role made him the administrator of the Japanese American internment. Ennis chose not resign from his role at that time, but he did help American Civil Liberties Union head Roger Baldwin to come up with legal strategies to oppose the internment, and testified at the trial of Gordon Hirabayashi about the Department of War's withholding of evidence relating to Japanese Americans' loyalty to the United States.|$|E
50|$|On July 26, 1917, the State and Labor Departments {{issued a}} joint order that {{attempted}} to “legally control {{the entry of}} aliens to the United States,” by requiring them to have visas issued by a United States consul. However, the Attorney General later determined that the executive branch, namely the President, {{did not have the}} authority to implement such regulations. This led to the second instance in which strict regulations were placed on passport travel for citizens of the United States. On May 22, 1918 the Wartime Measure Act, also known as the <b>Travel</b> <b>Control</b> Act, was signed by Woodrow Wilson just one year following the United States’ entrance into World War I. Following the Act, the continued discretion of passport officials made it nearly “impossible to travel in the 1920s and 1930s without securing the necessary documents.” The necessity of this Act stemmed primarily from the “unregulated flow of people across borders” during the war, which was seen as a potential national security threat for countries around the world, including the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Dating {{from the}} {{election}} of President Ramón Grau San Martin in June, 1944, the Cuban Government experienced a complete turnover {{in the administration of}} its executive, military and police branches. Under the Batista government, SIS personnel in Cuba had established a close, efficient liaison with officials of the Cuban National Police, which afforded the Bureau perhaps better coverage in Cuba than in any other Latin American nation. Most of these officials were forced into exile with the change in government, but SIS representatives have been very successful in building new contacts and establishing effective relationships with the new government and police officials so that coverage in Cuba is still excellent.The political situation in Cuba is unsettled at present, principally due to the inability of the Grau administration to solve shortages in meat, milk and other essentials. One of the most unique results of the reported inefficiency of the Grau administration is the present shortage of sugar in Cuba, which has necessitated the freezing of all sugar supplies until a system can be devised whereby the Cuban people will receive a sufficient supply. Internal dissension within Grau ranks has been evidenced by the open enmity of his revolutionary adherents for his so-called “Palace Clique” which is led by Chief of Police Jose Carreno (Fiallo), Sub-Secretary of Defense. Luis Collado and Army Chief of Staff General Genovevo Perez. The revolutionary groups have served notice on Grau that they consider this clique is responsible for blocking the “true revolution” in Cuba, and if not eliminated, the revolutionaries will be forced to take things in their own hands. On April 24, 1945, Erique Enriquez, head of the Cuban Palace Secret Police which serves as a bodyguard to the President, was murdered in downtown Havana by three assailants who machine-gunned him from a passing automobile. It was generally acknowledged the assailants were members of the revolutionary group, and the murder was a warning to Grau that the revolutionaries would stop at nothing to accomplish their ends. It is of interest to note that Enriquez, who was assassinated at 10:30 a.m. had a luncheon engagement for 1:00 p.m. with our Legal Attache on the same day.The revolutionary groups in Cuba are the offspring of numerous secret organizations formed in 1932 and 1933 to combat the dictatorship of former Cuban President Gerardo Machado. Ramon Grau San Martin, a professor in the University of Havana Medical School, at that time, was regarded as a true exponent of the principles professed by these revolutionary organizations. Throughout the succeeding years, the revolutionary groups have opposed the various administrations set up in Cuba, and have resorted to blackmail, kidnapping and terrorist activities {{in the name of the}} “sacred revolution.” Under the Batista administration, a special Police unit, under Major Mariano Faget, was established to control these elements, and numerous revolutionaries were arrested and convicted of violent crimes. These same elements, through their continued support of Grau San Martin, are now in control of many branches of the Cuban government, and although it is stated that Grau is not in favor of their violent methods, he is reportedly unable to restrain them successfully.The SIAE Division (Servioio de Investigaciones de Actividades Enemigas) of the Cuban National Police, which is the branch with which Bureau personnel has cooperated closely in its hemispheric security program, was under the control of Major Mario Salabarria during the past year. Salabarria, although he is a revolutionary with no previous police experience, proved to be a valuable source of information and was most cooperative with our representatives in Cuba. President Grau, himself, advised our Legal Attache that it was his intention to establish the Cuban Police as an efficient, military, non-political organization similar to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Throughout the year, numerous cases within the primary jurisdiction of the Bureau have been referred to SIS personnel in Havana. During the last eight months of the fiscal year, twenty-four Selective Service cases have been forwarded to Cuba for investigation. Other Federal violations which have been handled by SIS personnel in Cuba included White Slave Traffic Act cases, Passport and Visa matters, Impersonation, Custom Laws and Smuggling, NSPA, UFAP, Servicemen’s Dependence Allowance Act, Illegal Wearing of the Uniform, Theft of Government Property, Federal Reserve Act, Censorship Violations and others. In February, 1945, one Thomas Desmord Paul Manion, a Canadian national, was apprehended by Cuban National Police at the request of our Legal Attache, due to the numerous conflicting stories he had told concerning his background and because he had in his possession documentation made out in several different names as well as both R.C.A.F. and United States Naval uniforms. Inquiry of the Bureau reflected Manion was a fugitive from process issued by the United States Commissioner at Newark, New Jersey, for illegally wearing the uniform of a friendly power, i.e., Canada. Further investigation at Miami, Florida, reflected subject had stolen the United States Naval property, had illegally worn the uniform of a Canadian officer in Florida and had married (name redacted) of Summit, New Jersey, under an alias and succeeded in getting his wife to withdraw her savings of approximately $1200 which subject promptly spent. Arrangements were made to return the subject to the United States, where he was sentenced to sixteen months’ imprisonment by the Federal Court at Miami, Florida on June 1, 1945. Deportation proceedings are pending against the subject after he serves his prison sentence.Prior to the termination of the European war, the SIS personnel in Havana maintained an extensive Foreign <b>Travel</b> <b>Control</b> program, which was closely coordinated with the program established by the Bureau. Members of the Office of the Legal Attache, in conjunction with Cuban Police agents, interviewed all passengers arriving in Cuba from Europe and forwarded interrogation reports to the Bureau. These passengers disembarked in Havana from Spanish vessels which arrived every six weeks carrying an average of 150 passengers to Cuba on each trip. Passengers were interrogated for data of value to the war effort, as well as information concerning their background, political sympathies and reason for travel to this hemisphere. The Havana office also prepares memoranda regarding passengers proceeding by air from Havana to Miami, Florida, which are forwarded directly to the Miami Field Division so these data are available when the passengers arrive. The names of all passengers embarking at Havana for Europe on Spanish vessels are searched against our Havana office indices and arrangements are made for the interrogation of those passengers concerning whom derogatory information is recorded.(paragraph redacted)Informant coverage on Communist matters in Cuba has been very productive and of great value to the Bureau, inasmuch as Cuba is the center of extensive Communist activities. For a time, it appeared that the administration of President Grau San Martin would curb the Communist influence over the Cuban labor unions, but the control of the Confederacion de Trabajadores de Cuba (which effectively dominates practically all the Cuban labor unions) has remained in Communist hands, and recently, the Grau Government has allotted $725,000 for the construction of a Cuban labor palace. This has been regarded as a payment to the Communists for their continued support of the present administration. Russian diplomatic representatives have been very active in promoting cultural and propaganda activities in Cuba directed at the intellectual elements as well as the Cuban masses. Extensive coverage is being maintained on this phase of Communist activities. (More complete data on Communist matters in Cuba may be found in the section of this report dealing with Communism).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{classical}} Ross-Macdonald model, {{in this paper}} we propose a periodic malaria model to incorporate the effects of temporal and spatial heterogeneity on disease transmission. The temporal heterogeneity is described by assuming that some model coefficients are time-periodic, while the spatial heterogeneity is modeled by using a multi-patch structure and assuming that individuals travel among patches. We calculate the basic reproduction number R 0 and show that either the disease-free periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 ≤ 1 or the positive periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 > 1. Numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the analytical results and explore the effect of <b>travel</b> <b>control</b> on the disease prevalence. 1. Introduction. Malari...|$|E
