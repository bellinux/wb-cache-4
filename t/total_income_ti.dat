40|$|Increased {{adoption}} of climbing beans (Phaseolus vulgaris check for this species in other resources L.) in Kabale district, south-western Uganda, {{has been limited}} by scarcity of staking materials, despite the crop's higher yield potential compared to bush bean types when grown on fertile soils. There is therefore need to explore other appropriate mechanisms such as intecropping, that could substitute use of stalks. A field experiment was conducted at Kachwekano near Kabale town for two seasons: second rains of 1996 (1996 b) and first rains of 1997 (1997 a), to determine the appropriate plant population density (PPD) of maize that would maximize bean yield in an intercrop system. The treatments were: (a) maize PPD ranging from 25 000 to 40 000 plants ha- 1, and (b) bean PPD ranging from 57 142 to 95 238 plants ha- 1. Sole crops were planted at the recommended PPD of 44 444 and 111 111 plants ha- 1 for maize and climbing beans, respectively. Maize in mixtures was planted in single rows 1. 0 m apart. Two rows of beans were planted {{in the space between}} maize rows, 10 days after maize emergence. Plant densities were achieved by varying the within-row spacing from 0. 25 to 0. 40 m for maize and 0. 30 to 0. 50 m for beans. Maize PPD significantly affected bean yield only during the second rains (1996 b), probably due to a favourable moisture regime. Bean PPD significantly affected maize yield only during the first rains (1997 a), presumably due to drought stress. The highest intercrop bean yield of 1. 075 t ha- 1 was realised from a final mixture of 24 575 and 66 666 plants ha- 1 of maize and beans, respectively, during the second rains. Intercropping significantly reduced maize yield during the second rains and bean yields in both seasons. The intercrop system had a yield advantage of 26 % (i. e., LER = 1. 26) over pure stands of the component crops only during the second rains, presumably due to complementary use of resources. However, there were no yield advantages observed during the first rains probably due to drought stress. Mean <b>total</b> <b>income</b> (<b>TI)</b> from the mixtures was 226. 8 and 31. 8 % higher than income from sole bean and maize crops, respectively, during the second rains. Income from the mixtures was 58. 7 and 72. 5 % higher than income from sole bean and maize crops, respectively, during the first rains. Peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 An {{integrated}} framework of Family Resource Management and Household Economic theory was utilized {{to develop a}} model of relationships between human capital, family characteristics and resources, number of income sources, hours spent in home production, <b>total</b> <b>income</b> and subjective well-being. This study utilized a sample of 129 women systematically selected from Machinga and Zomba Districts in Malawi. Results of Path analysis showed that place of residence, primary education and secondary education or above had positive direct relationships to number of income sources. Variables which had significant negative relationships with hours spent in home production were place of residence and age. Access to farm technologies had a positive relationship. The positive predictors of <b>total</b> <b>income</b> were: primary education, secondary education or above, number of income sources, place of residence, land holding size and access to farm technologies. Home production time and health status were negatively related to <b>total</b> <b>income.</b> <b>Total</b> <b>income</b> and hours spent in home production were significant and positively related to a well-being score, derived from four measures of well-being. Health status was negatively related to this score. Five variables: place of residence, age, primary education, secondary education or above and access to farm technologies had indirect effects on <b>total</b> <b>income</b> through number of income sources and home production. All independent variables entered had indirect effects on the well-being score through <b>total</b> <b>income</b> and hours spent in home production. Number of income sources only mediated the effects on the well-being score jointly with <b>total</b> <b>income.</b> On the whole, both intervening variables did a fair job of mediating the effects of independent variables on <b>total</b> <b>income</b> and subjective well-being (well-being score). Finally, household size, health status and subjective well-being significantly affected overall satisfaction with life.
