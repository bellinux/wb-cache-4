Whilst the engineers were setting up the station's 50-watt transmitter in the town being visited, salesmen would sign up advertisers for the fortnight that 3YB would broadcast from that region.

40|$|Fungus gnats of {{the genus}} Bradysia (Diptera: Sciaridae) are {{ubiquitous}} pests in greenhouse crop-production systems. Because of their association with decaying vegetation, fungus gnats are commonly found to coexist with diseased plants, and their role as vectors of plant pathogens has been questioned for decades. Studies have demonstrated that adult fungus gnats can acquire and mechanically <b>transmit</b> <b>aerial</b> spores of various fungal plant pathogens. However, {{a significant role in}} the transmission of pathogens that do not generate large numbers of readily transmissible propagules has not been demonstrated. The ultimate objective of this dissertation was to elucidate the role played by fungus gnats, Bradysia impatiens (Johannsen), in transmission of Pythium spp. to floriculture crops. Fungus gnat adults strongly preferred to lay their eggs on plant material infected/infested with a wide array of microorganisms, including Pythium, Thielaviopsis, Trichoderma, Beauveria, and Xanthomonas. Although fungus gnats were highly attracted to microbial activity, adults are unlikely crop-to-crop or greenhouse-togreenhouse vectors of Pythium root rot pathogens. Studies revealed that adult fungus gnats do not pick up or transmit infectious Pythium propagules from diseased to healthy plants. Furthermore, adult gnats do not likely carry Pythium internally as they are generally described as aphagous, and experiments revealed that Pythium ingested by fungus gnat larvae is not carried beyond the pupal stage. Larval fungus gnats are capable of vectoring some species and strains of Pythium in the laboratory, although this slow-moving life stage is unlikely to account for significant transmission of Pythium spp. in the greenhouse setting. Feeding damage by fungus gnat larvae induced resistance to Pythium infection, significantly reducing seedling mortality compared with undamaged controls. The findings from these studies enhance our understanding of the association between fungus gnats and Pythium in greenhouse floriculture...|$|R

Based on these two markers, transmission of CSD was obtained, not only when budwood for graft-inoculation was taken from symptomatic, sweet orange trees on Rangpur, but also when the budwood sources were asymptomatic sweet orange trees on Cleopatra mandarin, indicating that the latter trees are symptomless carriers of the CSD agent. For natural transmission, 80 young indicator plants were planted within a citrus plot severely affected by CSD. Individual insect-proof cages were built around 40 indicator plants, and the other 40 indicator plants remained uncaged. Only two of the 40 caged indicator plants were affected by CSD, whereas 17 uncaged indicator plants showed CSD symptoms and were infected with the marafivirus. An additional 12 uncaged indicator plants became severely affected with citrus variegated chlorosis and were removed.
