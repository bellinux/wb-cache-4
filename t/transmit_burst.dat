This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract This paper describes {{the efforts of}} our Inter-Disciplinary Scientist (IDS) team to (a) establish the large-scale context for reconnection diffusion region encounters by MMS at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail, including the distinction between X-line and O-line encounters, that would help the identification of diffusion regions in spacecraft data, and (b) devise possible strategies {{that can be used}} by MMS to capture and <b>transmit</b> <b>burst</b> data associated with diffusion region candidates. At the magnetopause we suggest the strat-egy of transmitting burst data from all magnetopause crossings so that no magnetopause reconnection diffusion regions encountered by the spacecraft will be missed. The strategy is made possible by the MMS mass memory and downlink budget. In the magnetotail, it is estimated that MMS will be able to <b>transmit</b> <b>burst</b> data for all diffusion regions, all reconnec-tion jet fronts (a. k. a. dipolarization fronts) and separatrix encounters, but less than 50 % of reconnection exhausts encountered by the spacecraft. We also discuss automated burst trig-ger schemes that could capture various reconnection-related phenomena. The identification of candidate diffusion region encounters by the burst trigger schemes will be verified and improved by a Scientist-In-The-Loop (SITL). With the knowledge of the properties of the region surrounding the diffusion region and the combination of automated burst triggers and further optimization by the SITL, MMS should be able to capture most diffusion regions it encounters...|$|E

By designing a joint detection (JD) structure for consecutive symbol vectors {{in the same}} <b>transmit</b> <b>burst,</b> more a priori information is exploited when updating the estimated posterior marginal probabilities for each symbol per iteration. Therefore the proposed PDA detector (denoted as PDA-JD detector) outperforms the conventional PDA detectors {{in the context of}} correlated input bit streams. Moreover, the conventional PDA detectors are shown to be a special case of the PDA-JD detector. Simulations and analyses are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method...|$|E
40|$|The BGU 7007 is a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) for GNSS {{receiver}} {{applications in}} a plastic leadless 6 -pin, extremely small SOT 886 package. The BGU 7007 requires only one external matching inductor and one external decoupling capacitor. The BGU 7007 adapts itself to the changing environment resulting from co-habitation of different radio systems in modern cellular handsets. It has been designed for low power consumption and optimal performance when jamming signals from co-existing cellular transmitters are present. At low jamming power levels it delivers 18. 5 dB gain at a noise figure of 0. 85 dB. During high jamming power levels, resulting for example from a cellular <b>transmit</b> <b>burst,</b> it temporarily increases its bias current to improve sensitivity.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{tracking}} {{techniques are}} investigated for an oculometer. Two methods {{are reported in}} detail. The first is based on measurements of time {{from the start of}} a <b>transmit</b> <b>burst</b> to a received echo. Knowing the sound velocity, distance can be calculated. In the second method, a continuous signal is transmitted. Target movement causes phase shifting of the echo. By accumulating these phase shifts, tracking from a set point can be achieved. Both systems have problems with contoured targets, but work well on flat plates and the back of a human head. Also briefly reported is an evaluation of an ultrasonic ranging system. Interface circuits make this system compatible with the echo time design. While the system is consistently accurate, it has a beam too narrow for oculometer use.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the use of}} the self-demodulation (S-D) signal as a mean of {{microbubble}} excitation at the subharmonic (SH) frequency to enhance the SH emission of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) is studied. SH emission from the UCA is of interest since it is produced only by the UCA and is free of the artifacts produced in harmonic imaging modes. The S-D wave is a low-frequency signal produced by nonlinear propagation of an ultrasound wave in the medium. Single element transducer experiments and numerical simulations were conducted at 10 MHz to study the effect of the S-D signal on the SH response of the UCA by modifying the envelope of the excitation bursts. For 6 and 20 transmitted cycles, the SH response is increased up to 25 dB and 22 dB because of the S-D stimulation for a burst with a rectangular envelope compared with a Gaussian envelope burst. Such optimized excitations were used in an array-based micro-ultrasound system (Vevo 2100, VisualSonics Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) at 18 MHz for in vitro validation of SH imaging. This study suggests that a suitable design of the envelope of the transmit excitation to generate a S-D signal at the SH frequency can enhance the SH emission of UCA and real-time SH imaging is feasible with shorter <b>transmit</b> <b>burst</b> (6 - cycle) and low acoustic pressure (- 150 KPa) at high frequencies (> 15 MHz) ...|$|E
40|$|The Systems Integration, Test, and Evaluation (SITE) {{facility}} at NASA Lewis Research Center is presently configured as a satellite-switched time {{division multiple access}} (SS-TDMA) network simulator. The purpose of SITE is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced communication satellite technologies, presently embodied by POC components developed under NASA contracts {{in addition to other}} hardware, such as ground terminals, designed and built in-house at NASA Lewis. Each ground terminal in a satellite communications system will experience a different aspect of the satellite's motion due mainly to daily tidal effects and station keeping, hence a different duration and rate of variation in the range delay. As a result of this and other effects such as local oscillator instability, each ground terminal must constantly adjust its <b>transmit</b> <b>burst</b> timing so that data bursts from separate ground terminals arrive at the satellite in their assigned time slots, preventing overlap and keeping the system in synchronism. On the receiving end, ground terminals must synchronize their local clocks using reference transmissions received through the satellite link. A feature of the SITE facility is its capability to simulate the varying propagation delays and associated Doppler frequency shifts that the ground terminals in the network have to cope with. Delay is ahcieved by means of two NASA Lewis designed and built range delay simulator (RDS) systems, each independently controlled locally with front panel switches or remotely by an experiment control and monitor (EC/M) computer...|$|E

Rather than either relying only on known pilot symbols multiplexed within the <b>transmitted</b> <b>burst</b> or exploiting the specific signal structure in a blind mode, the estimation algorithm we pursue is derived from the maximum likelihood principle and takes advantage of both pilot symbols and also the unknown information-bearing symbols through specific differential decision-directed processing.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{approach}} for cognitive radio. In the usual approach the secondary network {{is in charge of}} monitoring the channel {{to determine whether or not}} the primary network is active in the area. If not, the secondary network is allowed to use the spectrum. In the new scheme we propose, the primary network encompasses the techniques which allow it to capture the bandwidth even if the secondary network is transmitting in the area. The access scheme of the primary network is preemptive towards the secondary network. In this paper we present a scheme which is preemptive over the IEEE 802. 11 decentralized access scheme. This protocol is a generalized Carrier Sense Multiple Access scheme using active signaling. Instead of only sensing the carrier, this algorithm also <b>transmits</b> <b>bursts</b> of signal which may be sensed by the other nodes. If so, they give up the selection process. We show that this scheme is preemptive over the IEEE 802. 11 decentralized access scheme if the <b>bursts</b> <b>transmitted</b> by the node in the primary network are built with special sequences which alternate bursts of signal and periods of sensing. These sequences called (d, k) sequences [1] encompass a maximum number of zeros during which the node senses the channel to find other possible concurrent transmissions.

It dynamically varies the whole set of stream Burst Durations according to input stream data, available channel bandwidth, receiving buffer size and eventually stream priority. Burst Durations are derived by the minimization of a Total Loss Function (TLF) representing the amount of losses of the whole service set.
