5|$|All this time, Bradbury {{remained}} nominally {{a professor}} in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> contract {{three months after the}} end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.|$|E

5|$|Between 1978 and 1980, the DoD and USN {{repeatedly}} attempted <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> AV-8B program. There {{had previously}} been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole F/A-18 Hornet). Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan. The USN declined {{to participate in the}} procurement, citing the limited range and payload compared with conventional aircraft.|$|E

The airline {{stated that they}} wished to renegotiate the agreement with the Braathens family and KLM to reduce the price. Because there had arrisen a situation with high over-capacity of aircraft, the value of planes had fallen. In addition, SAS demanded that Braathens reduce its fleet from 33 to 23 aircraft if the deal was to go through, threatening <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> purchase if the airline did not abide.|$|E

That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the breaking point for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> series following that game.

The permanent transfer went through in May 2006 for a fee of £1.2million, with Horsfield commenting that he and Warnock had resolved their differences.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, DoD {{officials}} {{met with}} the White House Military Office to discuss the program's future; the Pentagon had apparently wanted <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems. The White House overruled a decision to cancel; the program was effectively placed on hold while options were considered. In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010. The {{second phase of the}} development, VH-71B (Increment 2) was expected to start entering service in 2017.|$|E

In those circumstances, new legislation is countersigned by the prime minister instead {{of the president and}} a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. This situation occurred after the death of Franjo Tuđman on 10 December 1999, when Vlatko Pavletić became the acting president. After the parliamentary elections of 2000, the role was transferred to Zlatko Tomčić, who filled the office until Stjepan Mesić was elected President of Croatia in 2000.|$|E

In declining to report to the Gulls, Raymond and the Ducks mutually agreed <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> remainder of his contract on November 3, 2016. In an interview with SportsNet on January 3, 2017, Raymond revealed that he refused to report to the AHL largely to spend time with his wife, who had been diagnosed with Lyme disease.|$|E
5|$|The British were {{formally}} {{awarded the}} mandate {{to govern the}} region in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929, and 1936. In 1947, following World War II and The Holocaust, the British Government announced its desire <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> Mandate, and the United Nations General Assembly adopted in November 1947 a Resolution 181(II) recommending partition into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem.

5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion.

Following the President’s decision <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded {{it would be more}} cost effective and less time consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Leo {{broke his}} promise {{and refused to}} return Bagras to the Templars. He also decided <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> union of the Armenian Church with Rome. On the other hand, he granted fortresses to the Teutonic Knights in Cilicia. He also {{arranged}} the marriage of Raymond-Roupen with Helvis, sister of Hugh I of Cyprus. Leo ambushed a caravan which had been transporting provisions to the Templars in 1211. In the skirmish, Guillaume de Chartres, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, was badly injured. News of Leo's action shocked Pope Innocent, who forbade all Christian rulers to assist Leo and urged John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, to intervene on the Templars' behalf. John sent fifty knights to Northern Syria to fight against Leo. Leo expelled the Latin priests from Cilicia and gave shelter to the Orthodox Patriarch, Symenon, who had been driven out of Antioch. He dispatched Raymond-Roupen to plunder the region of Antioch in 1212.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Icelandic airline Loftleidir {{was granted}} the {{concession}} to fly from Keflavík Airport outside Reykjavík to New York and Chicago in the United States, and to Oslo, Copenhagen and London. The company established a hub at Keflavík. Braathens SAFE and Loftleidir {{made an agreement}} where Braathens SAFE would lease personnel and mechanical services to Loftleidir, and the two would split profits from the joint venture evenly. This allowed the two airlines to have a continual route between Hong Kong and New York as long as Braathens SAFE's concession lasted. In 1954, another DC-4, LN-HHK, was bought. This aircraft was sold to Loftleidir the following year. In 1956, another DC-4, LN-SUP, was bought, and used for charter and by Loftleidir. In 1959 and 1960, Loftleidir received two new Douglas DC-6B aircraft, with a five-year mechanical agreement with Braathens SAFE. In 1960, the two companies agreed <b>to</b> <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> cooperation from 1 January 1961.|$|E
