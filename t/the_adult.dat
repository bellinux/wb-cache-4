5|$|If {{the infant}} is found {{alongside}} <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> {{with the head}} oriented {{in the same direction}} as <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> then the infant was delivered, whether naturally or by caesarian incision, around the time of death, and thereafter interred.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} resembles <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> in plumage, but {{the areas}} corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin {{around the eyes}} are greyish green. It could possibly {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>adults</b> {{may live}} {{for three months}} or more and have few predators, {{excluding}} large orb weaving spiders (Nephila species) and some small birds. Adults feed at flowers providing a broad platform for <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> to land on, including Hibiscus. <b>The</b> <b>adults</b> are powerful fliers most active {{in the early morning}} and again at dusk when they actively feed at flowers.|$|R
5|$|Although it was {{originally}} believed that neurons could not regenerate in <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> brain, neurogenesis {{has been shown to}} occur in mammalian brains, including those of primates. However, neurogenesis is limited to the hippocampus and SVZ, and the RMS is one mechanism neurons use to relocate from these areas.|$|E

5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>adults</b> {{provide no}} further {{assistance}} to the larvae and they are described as lecithotrophic. <b>The</b> <b>adults</b> are herbivorous and feed with their rhipidoglossan radula on macroalgae, preferring red or brown algae.|$|R

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> of {{both sexes}} have a {{distinct}} winter and summer plumage, {{whether or not the}} male differs from the female, the young resemble <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> {{of both sexes}} in their winter dress, or much more rarely in their summer dress, or they resemble the females alone. Or the young may have an intermediate character; or again they may differ greatly from <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> in both their seasonal plumages.|$|R

5|$|During the pupal stage, the {{morphology}} of <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> {{is developed}} through elaboration from larval structures. The general aspect of <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> is visible before the outer surface hardens – the head, {{resting on the}} thorax, the eyes, antennae (brought forward over the head), the wings brought over the thorax and the six legs between the wings and the abdomen. Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye-pieces, antennae, palpi and the maxillae. The pupal thorax displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows and axillary tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.|$|E
5|$|Dyadic joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in.

Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, {{and in the case of}} <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> speech.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} {{may be less}} ambiguous {{when the}} fetal remains are found to lie within the pelvic outlet of <b>the</b> <b>adult,</b> thus indicating that partial extrusion had occurred during decomposition.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>adults</b> have <b>the</b> {{characteristic}} 3 tails. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> {{are generally}} 5- 15 mm. They have reduced mouthparts because <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> just emerge to mate and then die shortly after. They have two front wings and two reduced hind wings. Their wings are membranous and heavily veined to add strength since <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> must find one another through flight. <b>The</b> eyes of <b>adult</b> Ephemerellids {{are large and}} sit above two setaceous antennae. Their lightly sclerotized abdomen contains many segments for ease of mating positioning. The main feeding stage for these insects is the larval stage. The larvae have operculate gills-- which just means that they are hardened. These gills allow them to breathe under water which makes them semi aquatic. <b>The</b> larvae and <b>adults</b> are soft bodied so they must be contained.They filter out debris and extract nutrients from that.|$|R
