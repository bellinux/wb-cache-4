5|$|Most of the population, {{urban and}} rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation's Vietnamese population. Lon Nol's call for 10,000 volunteers {{to boost the}} {{manpower}} of Cambodia's poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> the military with over 70,000 recruits. Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself. Paranoia flourished and this set off a violent reaction against the nation's 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Several minutes later, {{the main}} body of the raid reached the {{southern}} shore of Førde Fjord travelling north. To their surprise, the Allied planes passed directly over the German ships and came under intense attack from anti-aircraft guns, though no aircraft were hit. In response, Milson wheeled his force to the right in an attempt to attack the ships from east to west as planned. The steep walls of the fjord protected Z33 from attack from this direction, however. As a result, Milson led the force west to near the mouth of the fjord and ordered the Beaufighters to attack in relays from west to east. This required the aircraft to fly into the face of alerted German defences and then escape over steep mountains. The narrow confines of the fjord also meant that the Beaufighters had to attack individually from a single direction and would not be able <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> the German defences as they normally sought to do.|$|E

25|$|Jahangir {{also kept}} {{detailed}} records of his hunts. From {{the ages of}} 12 (1580) to 48, 28,532 animals had been hunted with 17,167 by himself. These included 86 tigers (and lions), 9 bears, leopards, foxes, otters (ubdilao) and hyaenas, 889 – blue bulls (nilgai) and 35 mhaka. Salim Ali suggests that the mhaka must refer <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> deer.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} {{used to make}} the baskets—including but not limited <b>to,</b> <b>swamp</b> canes, saguaro cactuses, rye grass, black ash, willow shoots, sedge roots, the bark of redbud, the root of bulrush, and the root of the gray pine—were harvested annually. After being picked, the materials are dried, cleaned, split, soaked, and dyed. Sometimes the materials are also boiled over a fire and set in the sun to dry.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} submarines were {{an attempt}} to gain an edge over the Greek navy (which had only one Nordenfelt submarine, a smaller and older version). However, it was quickly realized that – like the other Nordenfelt submarines ordered by Russia – they suffered from stability problems and were too easy <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> on the surface. The Turks {{could not find a}} crew that was willing to serve on the primitive submarines. Abdül Hamid ended up rotting at dock, while Abdül Mecid was never fully completed.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, most {{historians and}} economists are {{conditioned}} {{to believe that}} steadily and sharply falling prices must result in depression: hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity and economic growth during this era. For they have overlooked {{the fact that in}} the natural course of events, when government and the banking system do not increase the money supply very rapidly, freemarket capitalism will result in an increase of production and economic growth so great as <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> the increase of money supply. Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, and the spread of the increased living standard to all the consumers.|$|E
25|$|Past this intersection, PA 313 {{continues}} southeast, {{passing through}} more rural areas.

The road crosses PA 113 in Kulps Corner, at which point {{there are a few}} businesses. PA 313 heads into the borough of Dublin at the Rickert Road intersection and becomes Main Street, where it passes homes and businesses. The route runs past more residences before it leaves Dublin and becomes the border between Bedminster Township and Hilltown Township again, with the name changing back to Dublin Pike. The road heads into rural areas with some development and becomes the border between Plumstead Township to the northeast and Hilltown Township to the southwest at the Applebutter Road intersection, at which point the name changes <b>to</b> <b>Swamp</b> Road. At the intersection with Stump Road/Upper Stump Road, PA 313 becomes the line between Plumstead Township to the northeast and New Britain Township to the southwest, continuing through farmland with some woods and homes.

That night, Mayerik autopsies the old sheriff and finds a bullet. He tries to tell Williams, but he is back at the swamp, unreachable. Mayerik tells Richards, and she goes <b>to</b> the <b>swamp</b> <b>to</b> tell Williams. Meanwhile, Ploog had returned <b>to</b> the <b>swamp,</b> trying <b>to</b> get a picture of the monster.

25|$|Perhaps, {{the biggest}} upset {{in the history}} of One Day Internationals, Mashrafe Mortaza shocked the Sophia Gardens crowd when he had Adam Gilchrist plumb on the second ball of the second ODI, taking the first Australian wicket without a run yet on the {{scoreboard}} – and it was to set the tone of the match. Most people would have expected Australia <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> Bangladesh, especially after the 10-wicket defeat the Bangladeshi Tigers endured in the opening match with England, but a maiden from Mortaza gave them some hope, at least. Things looked to be going the right way for Australia when Matthew Hayden took a boundary off Tapash Baisya, but another maiden followed, and in the sixth over Ricky Ponting padded up to Tapash Baisya – resulting in an lbw decision given, and Australia were 9 for 2. Cautious batting from Hayden and Damien Martyn followed, but some expensive bowling from Baisya relinquished the initiative, as Australia recovered. They survived through 15 overs, Hayden being caught off a no-ball from Tapash, but in the 16th, he was bowled by Nazmul Hossain for 37 off an inside edge, just as Hayden were looking to get himself in. Some economical bowling from Mohammad Rafique who bowled ten overs for 31 runs, along with excellent bowling from Mortaza at the death, resulted in Australia finishing on 249 for 5, losing Martyn to Baisya for 77 and Clarke to the same man for 54. In fact, Michael Hussey with 31 not out off 21 balls and Simon Katich with 36 not out off 23 ensured that they got a competitive target.|$|E
500|$|Susanna Lazarus of Radio Times {{argues that}} the episode is memorable {{specifically}} for the alligator footage.

Mark Pickavance of the website Den of Geek is critical from a visual standpoint, suggesting that the use of scale sets and young crocodiles, [...] "shot in super close-up to make them seem huge", does not produce a convincing illusion of giant, re-sized alligators.

500|$|Ambient {{corrections}} {{are difficult}} to achieve with this system and are not usually done. So {{it is not as}} accurate as a conventional precision thermometer. [...] Rather, it is typically used for low-cost applications such as private houses. [...] The main issue with accuracy is that if the bulb and the stem are at different levels, there is a change in reading due to the change in pressure head. [...] A further problem is that changes in the ambient temperature of the indoor part of the device can cause a change in reading as well as the temperature of the outdoor part of the device. [...] This effect can be minimised by making the bulb large and the capillary a small diameter. [...] This ensures that changes in the outside temperature produce large changes in the column of liquid in the stem and will tend <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> the smaller changes caused by the changes in the indoor temperature.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's presidential primary campaign, Emanuel was {{appointed}} to direct the campaign's finance committee. Emanuel insisted that Clinton schedule time for fundraising and delay campaigning in New Hampshire. Clinton embarked on an aggressive national fundraising campaign that allowed the campaign to keep buying television time as attacks on Clinton's character threatened <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> the campaign during the New Hampshire primary. Clinton's primary rival, Paul Tsongas (the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds. Richard Mintz, a Washington public relations consultant who worked with Emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: [...] "It was that [...] million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in New Hampshire [...]" [...] Emanuel's knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with [...] "heavily Jewish" [...] donors helped Clinton amass a then-unheard-of sum of $72 million. While working on the Clinton campaign Emanuel was a paid retainer of the investment bank Goldman Sachs.|$|E

Claudrena N. Harold of PopMatters also praised the diverse sound, which, according to her, is a mixture of [...] "Motown pop, the blues, British rock, and Southern Soul", although she cited [...] as Redding's best album. Rolling Stone described the album as [...] "Redding's true dictionary of soul, a stunning journey through the past and future vocabulary of R... documenting a masterful artist rising to... the immense challenge of his times." [...] In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rolling Stone journalist Paul Evans gave Otis Blue five out of five stars and cited the album as Redding's [...] "first masterwork".|$|E
500|$|The Reform Act {{strengthened}} the House of Commons {{by reducing the}} number of nomination boroughs controlled by peers. [...] Some aristocrats complained that, in the future, the government could compel them to pass any bill, simply by threatening <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> the House of Lords with new peerages. The Duke of Wellington lamented: [...] "If such projects can be carried into execution by a minister of the Crown with impunity, {{there is no doubt that}} the constitution of this House, and of this country, is at an end. [...] here is absolutely an end put to the power and objects of deliberation in this House, and an end to all just and proper means of decision." [...] The subsequent history of Parliament, however, shows that the influence of the Lords was largely undiminished. They compelled the Commons to accept significant amendments to the Municipal Reform Bill in 1835, forced compromises on Jewish emancipation, and successfully resisted several other bills supported by the public. It would not be until decades later, culminating in the Parliament Act 1911, that Wellington's fears would come to pass.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{considers}} [...] "Photograph" [...] a [...] "gorgeous collaboration" [...] between Starr and Harrison, a {{track that}} [...] "ranks... {{among the very}} best post-Beatles songs {{by any of the}} Fab Four". Robert Rodriguez describes it as [...] "an elegantly produced ballad" [...] and Starr's [...] "signature tune as a solo artist". Rodriguez continues: [...] "The ersatz Wall of Sound somehow managed not <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> the lead vocal and Harrison harmony, while embodying the best qualities of the Beatles' singles: hummable and familiar, yet fresh and enduring." [...] In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote of how the song's [...] "grand, sweeping arrangement" [...] was reminiscent of Harrison's [...] "own recent cosmic productions". Author Elliot Huntley similarly acknowledges the extent of Harrison's influence on this and other tracks on Ringo while rueing that [...] "Photograph" [...] marks the only formal co-composition by the two ex-Beatles. Huntley describes the song as the album's [...] "stand-out track" [...] and [...] "by a country mile, the commercial high-point" [...] for Starr as a songwriter. Former Mojo editor Mat Snow recognises it as [...] "perhaps the single best song of [...] career" [...] and the [...] "emotional heart" [...] of the album.|$|E
500|$|Asquith {{attempted}} {{to curtail the}} power of the Lords through constitutional reforms, which were again blocked by the Upper House. A constitutional conference on the reforms broke down in November 1910 after 21 meetings. Asquith and Lord Crewe, Liberal leader in the Lords, asked George to grant a dissolution, leading to a second general election, and to promise to create sufficient Liberal peers if the Lords blocked the legislation again. If George refused, the Liberal government would otherwise resign, which would have given the appearance that the monarch was taking sides– with [...] "the peers against the people"– in party politics. The King's two private secretaries, Lords Knollys and Stamfordham, gave George conflicting advice. Knollys, who was Liberal, advised George to accept the Cabinet's demands, while Stamfordham, who was Unionist, advised George to accept the resignation. Like his father, George reluctantly agreed to the dissolution and creation of peers, although he felt his ministers had taken advantage of his inexperience to browbeat him. After the December 1910 election, the Lords let the bill pass on hearing of the threat <b>to</b> <b>swamp</b> the house with new peers. The subsequent Parliament Act 1911 permanently removed– with a few exceptions– {{the power of the}} Lords to veto bills. The King later came to feel that Knollys had withheld information from him about the willingness of the opposition to form a government if the Liberals had resigned.|$|E
