5|$|A heated {{public debate}} followed, which {{resulted}} in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions. The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a change in law.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{outstanding}} {{problems associated with}} the currently favored cold dark matter model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem. Alternative theories have been proposed <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold dark matter proposal in explaining all extant observations.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, {{there was a}} proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted {{only a few years}} while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E

5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{was the first of}} these; however at this time few players had seen or played on synthetic pitches. Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> water are being researched.|$|E

5|$|In physics, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is justified}} on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{an appeal to}} physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, {{but there is another}} version of mirror symmetry in the context of topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, mirror symmetry states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating them. Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E
5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} those <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions {{are part of}} natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults {{with a variety of}} diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E
