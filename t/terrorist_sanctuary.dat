40|$|In {{the current}} fight against Islamic extremism, the United States is {{challenged}} {{in its ability}} to isolate and target specific individuals and groups in select regional environments - efforts that are arguably symptomatic of broader shortfalls in US global influence and strategic reach. These particularly troublesome environments are characterized by a lack of State control and are populated with fiercely independent, largely Muslim, and decidedly anti-western communities. Unable to consistently penetrate and influence these "ungoverned" regions, operational intelligence remains sporadic and opportunities limited. No broader, structural change has yet been made that would weaken or sever the links among Islamic extremists and their regional hosts over a sustained period or enable greater cooperation between the US or its allies with indigenous tribal populations. Accordingly, these regions continue to provide ideal locations for <b>terrorist</b> <b>sanctuary,</b> bases of support and operation, and freedom of movement. A supplemental US policy option is required. The challenge thus becomes one of how to create more effective opportunities to gain influence and control over these select tribal regions while countering the influence of competitors over a sustained period. A policy of manipulating tribal fractures and rivalries in order to induce or heighten internal conflict could provide these opportunities...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophySecurity Studies Interdepartmental Program - Political ScienceEmizet N. KisanganiThe {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is two-fold. First, is {{to investigate}} {{the relationship between the}} consequences of state failure and terrorist sanctuaries, which is the prevailing explanation in extant literature. Post 9 / 11 United States counterterrorism policy has focused {{on the role of the}} state in providing safe haven or sanctuary to transnational terrorist organizations. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that both weak and strong states host terrorist sanctuaries. Thus, no clear explanation for why transnational terrorist sanctuaries are in some weak and strong states but not present in others currently exists. Second, this dissertation seeks to fill this gap by adopting Migdal’s (1988) state-society interaction approach to explain the presence of terrorist sanctuaries. This dissertation hypothesizes that the role of society’s structure and societal strongmen’s interactions with the state are an important determinant in whether or not transnational terrorist organizations will seek to establish safe haven within a given territory. Sageman’s (2008) hub and node approach on the operational capacities of transnational <b>terrorist</b> <b>sanctuary</b> networks helps to explain differences in types of sanctuaries. Using a newly constructed dataset on terrorist sanctuaries for quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis through case studies, this dissertation intends to show that the presence of terrorist sanctuaries in both weak and strong states can be understood through four state-society interaction typologies. The implications of this study are relevant for policymakers seeking to understand and counter the enduring threat of transnational terrorism across the globe...|$|E

These activities are also robbing thousands of Afghan children of their right to education, and prevent health workers from doing their jobs in Afghanistan. In addition he promised to eliminate opium-poppy cultivation in the country, which helps fuel the ongoing insurgency. He has repeatedly demanded that NATO and U.S.-led coalition forces take more care when conducting military operations in residential areas to avoid civilian casualties which undermine his government's already weak standing in parts of the country.|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the counter-terrorist operations {{carried out}} by Captain (later Major General) Orde Wingate in Palestine in 1938, and considers whether these might inform current operations. Wingate's Special Night Squads were formed from British soldiers and Jewish police specifically to counter terrorist and sabotage attacks. Their approach escalated from interdicting terrorist gangs to pre-emptive attacks on suspected <b>terrorist</b> <b>sanctuaries</b> to reprisal attacks after terrorist atrocities. They continued the British practice of using irregular units in counter-insurgency, which was sustained into the postwar era {{and contributed to the}} evolution of British Special Forces. Wingate's methods proved effective in pacifying terrorist-infested areas and could be applied again, but only in the face of 'friction' arising from changes in cultural attitudes since the 1930 s, and from the political-strategic context of post- 2001 counter-insurgent and counter-terrorist operations. In some cases, however, public opinion might not preclude the use of some of Wingate's techniques...|$|R
5000|$|After {{winning a}} {{democratic}} mandate in the 2004 election, {{it was thought}} that Karzai would pursue a more aggressively reformist path in 2005. However, Karzai has proved to be more cautious than was expected. After his new administration took over in 2004, the economy of Afghanistan began growing rapidly {{for the first time in}} many years. Government revenue began increasing every year, although it is still heavily dependent on foreign aid.During the first term in Karzai's Presidency, public discontent grew about corruption and the civilian casualties in the 2001-14. In May 2006, an anti-American and anti-Karzai riot took place in Kabul which left at least seven people dead and 40 injured. In May 2007, after as many as 51 Afghan civilians were killed in a bombing, Karzai asserted that his government [...] "can no longer accept" [...] casualties caused by U.S. and NATO operations.In September 2006, Karzai told the United Nations General Assembly that Afghanistan has become the [...] "worst victim" [...] of terrorism.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of U. S. counterterrorist operations {{throughout the world}} coincides with a growing sense among some U.

S. defense strategists suspect that the lawlessness of failed states may do more to undermine security in the United States than direct confrontation by hostile governments. Denying <b>terrorists</b> the <b>sanctuary</b> they seek in failed states may become a central feature in the war on terror, and it is likely that the United States will use preemptive force against suspected terrorists inside a state that is incapable of policing itself.

5000|$|A {{study of}} the Cligendael Center for Strategic Studies {{explains}} why states that are subject to failure serve as sanctuaries (used to plan, execute, support, and finance activities) for terrorist organisations. When {{the government does not}} know about the presence of the organisation or if it is not able to weaken or remove the organisation, the sanctuary is referred to as a [...] "Terrorist Black Hole". However, next to governmental weakness there need to be [...] "Terrorist Comparative Advantages" [...] present for a region to be considered as a [...] "Terrorist Black Hole". According to the study, social tensions, the legacy from civil conflict, geography, corruption and policy failure, as well as external factors contribute to governmental weakness. The comparative advantages are: religion and ethnicity, the legacy from civil conflict, geography, economic opportunities, economic underdevelopment and regional stimuli. Only the combinations of the two factors (governmental weakness and Terrorist Comparative Advantages) explain what regions <b>terrorists</b> use as <b>sanctuaries.</b>|$|R
