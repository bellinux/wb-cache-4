25|$|The SA 103 {{lands on}} a single forward skid and <b>tail</b> <b>bumper</b> but a monowheel {{was added to the}} SA 104.|$|E
25|$|MSN1795 will {{undertake}} simulated icing {{tests and}} cold-weather tests in Canada, noise assessment, autoland testing and high angle-of-attack, minimum-unstick checks during rotation with a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{undercarriage}} was conventional, with a nose skid, fixed monowheel and <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b> A simple-friction wheelbrake {{is applied}} to the mainwheel by pulling on the airbrake lever {{at the end of its}} furthest travel.|$|E
50|$|In September 2006, the E83 {{received}} a facelift with revised headlights, grille, front <b>bumper,</b> <b>tail</b> lights, rear <b>bumper,</b> and interior.|$|R
5000|$|A skeg, (skegg or skag) is a sternward {{extension}} of the keel of boats and ships which have a rudder mounted on the centre line. [...] The term also applies to the lowest point on an outboard motor or the outdrive of an inboard/outboard. [...] In more recent years, the name {{has been used for}} a fin on a surfboard which improves directional stability and to a movable fin on a kayak which adjusts the boat's centre of lateral resistance (it moves the center of resistance relative to the center of effort). [...] The term is also often used for the fin on water skis in the U.S. and for the <b>tail</b> <b>bumpers</b> of aircraft in the US Navy.|$|R
50|$|A diagram shows {{a version}} of the Bertina II with a {{fuselage}} extending conventionally ahead of the wing, though always beneath it. It had a standard single skid undercarriage, with wing tip and <b>tail</b> <b>bumpers.</b> A second form, seen the diagram and also in all the photographs has the glider with a shortened fuselage ending under the wing at around the one third chord point, reducing the overall length to about 3.70 m. This version also had vulnerable, lozenge shaped, fixed end plate fins on its tips, extending both above and below the wing, and a double skid undercarriage, forming a sledge-like arrangement held well away from the fuselage and suitable for snow. In both forms the pilot sat in an almost rectangular small, open, unscreened cut-out cockpit in the wing near mid-chord.|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} 901s built {{retained}} the curved vertical {{tail of the}} 900 but the third had a straight topped shape with a rudder that was straight edged except at the heel. The 901's undercarriage is a retractable monowheel, fitted with a brake, plus a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
25|$|Its {{fuselage}} was {{a simple}} rectangular cross section wooden structure skinned with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The landing skid was mounted {{on the front end}} of a curved, deep, covered frame on the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where there was a small <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b> The tail was {{different from that of the}} BS.16; although the same triangular tailplane and parallel chord, cropped tipped elevators were used, they were mounted on top of a low, straight edged fin. A new, large, balanced, angular rudder, hinged at the extreme tail extended down to the keel, operated in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the 703 {{was entirely}} ply skinned, tapering gently from a blunt {{nose to the}} tail. There, a small, ply skinned fin carried a largely fabric covered, rounded, wide chord, balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The straight tapered tailplane, also largely fabric covered, was set forward of the fin {{and at the top}} of the fuselage, so the elevators required only a small cut-out for the rudder to move in. The pilot sat upright just ahead of the wing leading edge under a multi-piece canopy which merged into the aft fuselage. The 703 had no landing wheel but just a sprung skid from the nose to behind the cockpit, on the deepest part of the fuselage. It was assisted by a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
50|$|B5 Passat models built after late 2000, {{also known}} as B5.5 models, {{received}} minor styling and mechanical revisions including revised projector-optic headlights, <b>bumpers,</b> <b>tail</b> lights, and chrome trim.|$|R
50|$|The canoes are {{specifically}} designed for polo and are faster and lighter than typical kayaks which give them fantastic maneuverability. The blades of a polo paddle have thick rounded edges to prevent injury. Paddles are also very lightweight and designed with both pulling power and ball control in mind. Nose and <b>tail</b> boat <b>bumpers,</b> body protection, helmets and face-guards are all compulsory.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2015, the F3 was {{facelift}}ed again {{known as}} the [...] "third generation" [...] F3. The facelift included new headlights and <b>tail</b> lights, <b>bumpers</b> and a new dashboard. It started production in 2016. It runs on the same 1.5 BYD473QE engine. The turbocharged engine was not available. Transmission are a 5 speed manual or 6 speed automatic gearbox. Pricing ranges from 55,900 yuan to 77,900 yuan.|$|R
2500|$|The {{undercarriage}} was retractable, {{with a pair}} {{of small}} wheels {{on the end of a}} trailing arm, each fitted with a vertical shock absorber; the arm was slightly kinked to tuck the wheels almost entirely within the fuselage when retracted and also to act as a protective skid on rough ground. [...] There was a small <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Ka 1 has a ply-covered, rounded wooden-framed {{fuselage}} {{but that}} of the Ka 3 is more angular, steel tube-framed, fabric covered and slightly longer. [...] Both have a simple, deep, sprung landing skid reaching from the nose to under {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, assisted by a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b> [...] Their cockpits are under the wing leading edge, into which the clear canopy extends.|$|E
2500|$|The metal {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage had {{a forward}} section which contained the cockpit {{ahead of the}} wing leading edge but became markedly slimmer aft, in pod and boom style. The KAI-14 had a 90° butterfly tail with straight tapered surfaces, squared tips and externally mass-balanced elevators. [...] It landed on a fixed monowheel, faired into the fuselage underside, which had a brake operated via the airbrake lever. The rear fuselage was protected by a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
50|$|B5 Passat models built after late 2000, {{also known}} as B5.5 models (3BG in Europe), {{received}} minor styling and mechanical revisions including revised projector-optic headlights, <b>bumpers,</b> <b>tail</b> lights, and chrome trim. The non-turbo 1.8 was discontinued, with an eight-valve 1.6-litre now being the least powerful petrol engine.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2014, the F3 was facelifted {{and started}} {{production}} that year. It {{was given a}} new grille, headlights, <b>tail</b> lights, <b>bumpers,</b> wheels and mirrors. Pricing starts from 63,900 yuan to 70,900 yuan. It runs on a 1.5L four cylinder engine known as the BYD473QE producing 107 horsepower. This engine has been the signature for the F3 since 2011. A turbocharged 1.5L engine is also available as the BYD476ZQA producing 151 horsepower. Transmission choices for the this model are 5 speed manual, 6 speed manual or a 6 speed automatic gearbox.|$|R
50|$|The new Panamera {{no longer}} has its predecessor's oft-criticized, elephantine {{hatchback}} wagon styling, with {{the tail of the}} vehicle developing a clear link to the Porsche 911 through the full width rear LED light bar, and the sharply creased <b>tail</b> and upper <b>bumper.</b> This improvement in design has helped clarify the model's identity as a sports-oriented GT car.|$|R
2500|$|The A 210 {{is powered}} by a Rotax 912 flat four engine driving a two blade propeller. [...] The cabin has {{uninterrupted}} transparencies fore and aft, with a slender fuselage behind. [...] The canopy is forward hinged. The tailplane is set just above the fuselage and the fin is swept. [...] A small ventral fin doubles as a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b> [...] The A 210 has a fixed tricycle undercarriage. Its mainwheels are fitted with hydraulic brakes and [...] mounted on spring steel legs from the fuselage. The nosewheel has rubber suspension and is steerable; speed fairings are fitted on all wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The Deltaviex {{was first}} flown 30 April 1954 by Robert Fouquet, {{followed}} by a period of testing and modification at the SCNASO's airfield at Brétigny-sur-Orge. Details of the development are sparse but photographs from the later stages show the revised cockpit and also {{the addition of a}} rectangular ventral fin in place of a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper</b> wheel used in the early tests. The first flight with the blown flaps was made on 21 September 1955. [...] The aircraft received no publicity for two years until it appeared with other SNCASO aircraft at a Brétigny press event on 8 November 1956. Shortly afterwards, Flight [...] reported it was soon to be scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{shoulder}} wing competition sailplane. [...] The first aircraft, the Phoebus A, {{was designed to}} [...] Standard Class rules, with a span of 15 m. [...] Its straight tapered wings have an aspect ratio of 17.1; airbrakes are fitted at 70% chord. [...] The fin and rudder are straight edged and only slightly tapered, with a high aspect ratio all moving T tail mounted at the tip. The fuselage is a monocoque. with the cockpit, ahead of the wings, enclosed with a one piece canopy. The Phoebus A has a monowheel plus <b>tail</b> <b>bumper</b> undercarriage, but in the later variants the main wheel is retractable. [...] The [...] Phoebus C has a braking parachute.|$|E
50|$|The first Starlet {{assembled}} outside Japan was the 1985 1.0 XL {{built in}} Indonesia. A year later, the 1.3 litre model joined {{the production line}} there. A minor change for Japanese models was given in 1987 with new nose, <b>tail</b> lights, bigger <b>bumpers,</b> and revised interior. Indonesian-built Starlet received this minor changes in 1988, however the European and general market models retains the older appearance.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Red Line" [...] {{uses the}} same 3.6 litre V6 from the [...] "XR", adding several {{sporting}} changes, including manual shifting of the six speed automatic transmission, a reduction in ride height of approximately 1 in, and a sport tuned suspension. Exterior appearance changes for the [...] "Red Line" [...] include 18 inch alloy wheels, and a more aggressive front <b>bumper,</b> <b>tail</b> lamps and exhaust tips.|$|R
50|$|In August 2015, Toyota {{launched}} an updated, face lifted {{version of the}} J200 Land Cruiser in Japan, which was rolled out globally. The face lifted version includes a new 8-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission (ECT-i) for the 5.7 L 3UR-FE V8 petrol engine while other engine option's and transmission remains unchanged. There were also updates to the front fascia, grill, headlamps (with daylight running lamps), rear <b>tail</b> lamps and <b>bumpers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Orlik is a semi-monocoque of deep oval cross-section, tapering to the tail. [...] The single-seat cockpit, placed {{just ahead}} of the wing, is covered by a side-hinged blown canopy. [...] Its tail is conventional with a straight-edged, ply-covered and foam-filled all-moving tailplane, fitted with an anti-balance tab, mounted on top of the fuselage and ahead of the small fin which is constructed in the same way. The fabric-covered, balanced rudder is broad and taller than the fin, reaching down to the keel. Overall, the vertical tail has almost upright straight edges and a blunt tip. [...] The Orlik has a fixed, semi-recessed monowheel ahead of the wing leading edge, assisted by a small <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} seemed notably {{long and}} slender at the time, and the tail unit small. It was a semi-monocoque spruce structure, plywood covered {{apart from the}} G.R.P in the cockpit area, with the single piece canopy hinged on the starboard side. [...] The original tail unit was again a spruce structure with G.R.P. leading edges, its all moving tailplane mounted low on the fin, though later aircraft used a metal framed tailplane. The rudder and the rear part of the tailplane were fabric covered, the latter carrying trim tabs. On early aircraft the undercarriage was a non-retractable single wheel placed under {{the leading edge of}} the wing, plus a short skid under the nose and a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} is a flat-sided Warren girder structure, plywood covered {{apart from}} the curved glass fibre rear decking. [...] Wing attachment involves some aluminium fittings. The single seat cockpit is ahead of the wing leading edge under a single piece canopy. [...] All 460 series aircraft use a fixed, unsprung monowheel main undercarriage. [...] On the first four prototypes at least, this was mounted below the fuselage in a fairing which exposed only {{the edge of the}} wheel. [...] On the 463s, the wheel is unfaired but assisted by an integral skid. [...] The 465s have no skid and the wheel mounting is instead raised into the fuselage. [...] All have a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper</b> with a [...] "roller skate" [...] tailwheel.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} received a modest restyle and other production changes in 1992, including {{changes to the}} <b>bumpers,</b> <b>tail</b> lights and interior. GT/GTi versions were equipped with larger sway-bars, and the camshafts were now solid. Production for the North American market ended in 1994. From 1995 onward, the redesigned North American-exclusive Suzuki Swift was built at CAMI Automotive, receiving all the modifications of its Pontiac and Geo/Chevrolet siblings – only ever available in the three-door body style, however.|$|R
50|$|The final {{iteration}} {{was released}} in August 1996. It had a revised front <b>bumper,</b> <b>tail</b> lights, 15-inch wheels and interior. The mechanical and safety package received minor changes, such as {{the addition of a}} driver's side airbag, seat belt pre-tensioners, and some changes in the wiring and ECU. Three levels of 180SX were offered: Type X, Type S and Type R, with the Type S being the first 180SX to be offered without a turbocharged engine.|$|R

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} is ply {{covered and}} of teardrop cross section, deep around the generously dimensioned cockpit. [...] The canopy is multi-framed with a rather upright windscreen; the fixed glazing extends rearwards to mid wing and the forward section, including the screen, instruments {{and a small}} surrounding portion of the fuselage, hinges to starboard for access. [...] The narrow fin is also ply covered {{but the rest of}} the empennage is fabric over wood framing. [...] The rudder, like the fin, is straight tapered with a rounded tip; it extends down to the keel. [...] A straight tapered tailplane and elevators are placed on top of the fuselage, the elevators having a cut-out for rudder movement. [...] The Rhönsperber has no landing wheel, only a curved main skid reaching from the nose to behind mid-chord, and an integral, pronounced <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The wing {{is mounted}} on a low pedestal, faired aft into the main fuselage. This is {{slightly}} shorter {{than that of the}} Baby and for centre of gravity reasons the Rhönbussard's open cockpit is under {{the leading edge of the}} wing, restricting the pilot's upward and rear view. [...] The fuselage tapers to the rear and is ply covered all over apart from a metal nose cone, including the fin and <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b> [...] The fin is narrow and straight edged but the fabric covered rudder, extending down to the keel, is full and more rounded. [...] The fabric covered, straight tapered and square tipped horizontal tail is placed on top of the fuselage, with its trailing edge forward of the rudder hinge. The Rhönbussard took off on a jettisonable two wheeled dolly, leaving a long skid for landing.|$|E
2500|$|The Meteor has a pod-and-boom style {{fuselage}}, with a long, single-piece canopy {{above the}} upper fuselage line, {{forward of the}} wing, under which the pilot sits in a reclined position. [...] The under-wing, retractable monowheel undercarriage is assisted by a short, retractable, forward skid. [...] Retraction is manual; there is a wheel brake. [...] Behind the wing the fuselage has a circular cross-section. [...] There is a long, shallow fillet or sub fin between fuselage and fin, both straight edged, and both rudder and fin extend well below the lower fuselage line to form a <b>tail</b> <b>bumper.</b> The rudder is horn balanced. Later revisions slightly increased rudder area. The high aspect ratio, straight tapered tailplane is mounted above the fuselage on the fillet forward of the fin's leading edge. [...] The elevators are also aerodynamically balanced and originally carried a ground adjustable trim tab, later removed.|$|E
50|$|The Tata Sierra, {{and later}} Tata Sierra Turbo, was a three-door {{sport utility vehicle}} {{produced}} by Tata Motors of India. It {{was based on the}} Tata TL. It was the first automobile to be designed and produced in India. The vehicle also forms the basis for DC Design's Arya Concept vehicle. The Sierra was initially powered by a 1948 cc naturally aspirated engine. Tata Motors later launched Sierra Turbo, which was powered by turbocharged version of 1948cc diesel engine. Sierra Turbo was sported plastic flared wheel arches, headlight from Tata Estate, rear wipers and extra <b>tail</b> lamps on <b>bumper.</b> Tata launched Sierra Turbo 4x4 before pulling the plug.|$|R
5000|$|Only minor styling changes {{occurred}} {{from the}} 1975 to the 1978 model years, most notably, during the 1977 model year when quad stacked square headlights (see photo) replaced the previous round dual beam headlights, the front turn signals, previously on the outboard {{edges of the}} grille, were moved over to the cutouts in the front <b>bumper.</b> <b>Tail</b> lights received amber turn signal lenses {{in place of the}} previous red turn signal lenses. Various 2-door models had no centerposts and some of them were true hardtops with roll-down rear windows. Other 2-door models had fixed rear windows even though they had no centerposts. For the most part, the Plymouth Fury 2-door models, during the 1975 and the 1978 model years, were labeled as [...] "hardtops."The Plymouth Fury, 1975-1978, shared its B-body and unibody structure with the Dodge Coronet (1975-1976), Dodge Monaco (1977-1978) and the corporation's new personal-luxury coupe models, Chrysler Cordoba (1975-1979) and Dodge Charger SE (1975-1978). All the four-door models, wagons and sedans alike, continued with the basic body shells, which date back {{to the start of the}} 1971 model year, rode on a 118 in wheelbase, while the various 2-door models—which were restyled with new and more formal sheetmetal and rooflines—rode on the 115 in wheelbase.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the year}} of 1989, {{modifications}} to the wastegate actuator, feed location and engine management netted another [...] on the turbo model. The engine mount and brace were also changed in late 1989, with the exact date not known as of this writing. The changes made to the cross member and mounts made to accommodate the 1JZ engine for Japan models. The protective body molding was also changed by taking away the steel reinforcement. This made the molding lighter and prevented the rusting problem on the previous years. The [...] "white package" [...] was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white [...] "saw blade" [...] wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3-point seat belts to replace the previous years' two-point lap belts. New <b>tail</b> lights, front <b>bumper</b> with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years' detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering wheel, door panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo. Addition of coat hooks on B-pillar and removal of rear seat pockets round out interior changes. Turbo models received three piece spoiler with an integrated LED brake light. 1989 also {{marked the end of}} headlight washers in the US and SuperMonitor; an advanced system offered by Toyota able to calculate miles able to be traveled on current tank, ability to check vehicle codes from inside the cabin, among other features.|$|R
