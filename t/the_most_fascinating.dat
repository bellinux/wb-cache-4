Colbert {{writes about}} the connections between Rowling's novels and folklore, Greek mythology, and the cultures of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, and the Aztec. For example, he explains that Rowling got the name for the character Draco Malfoy from the Latin word for dragon, draco. One of the connections to folklore that Colbert find <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> {{is the name of}} the evil wizard family The Malfoys. They are named after the Latin word for [...] "evil-doer", maleficus, which was used in medieval times to describe witches. In addition, there is a chapter in the book that explains the origins of the names of the spells featured in the Harry Potter series. Expelliarmus, for example, is a spell that disarms the opponent; it comes from the Latin words expello and arma, which mean [...] "to drive out" [...] and [...] "weapon".|$|E

Gibson thereby imagined a worldwide communications network years before the origin of the World Wide Web, although related notions had previously been imagined by others, including science fiction writers. At the time he wrote [...] "Burning Chrome", Gibson [...] "had a hunch that [...] would change things, {{in the same way that}} the ubiquity of the automobile changed things." [...] In 1995, he identified the advent, evolution and growth of the Internet as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> and unprecedented human achievements of the century", a new kind of civilization that is– in terms of significance — on a par with the birth of cities, and in 2000 predicted it would lead to the death of the nation state.|$|E
500|$|After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra {{believed}} {{he needed to}} go solo, with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby, but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry. [...] A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1943. On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bid farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, [...] "I hope you fall on your ass". He replaced Sinatra with singer Dick Haymes. Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, holding {{a gun to his}} head. Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times the salary of Dorsey. Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never patched up their differences before Dorsey's death in 1956, worsened by the fact that Dorsey occasionally made biting comments to the press such as [...] "he's <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> man in the world, but don't put your hand in the cage".|$|E

It gushed out into the pop ecosystem like a million barrels of renegade crude — ominous, mesmerizing and of great consequence." [...] Critics were very kind to Yeezus regarding critical reviews, but others viewed the release as [...] "musical and commercial suicide," [...] and [...] "fans live-blogged their own befuddlement on Twitter and Facebook." [...] The New Yorker Sasha Frere-Jones suggests that Yeezus may be preferred over any of West's previous works in coming decades by a new generation due to the [...] "lean vibrancy" [...] of the album. [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> aspects of Yeezus arrival is the discursive crisis it's caused, produced by a fast-react culture colliding with a work of art so confounding," [...] wrote The Atlantic columnist Jack Hamilton.|$|E

500|$|Also in 2008, Beckinsale {{starred in}} Nothing but the Truth as a {{journalist}} who refuses to reveal her source.

500|$|Ken Barnes from USA Today {{noted that}} major events in Madonna's life were {{repeated}} throughout the book. He complimented O'Brien's writing style, especially the portions chronicling {{the death of}} Madonna's mother, as well as dissecting the recording process of the albums {{and the development of}} her concert tours. He concluded by saying that overall the biography seemed [...] "too familiar. Maybe that's because, at least since she hit the mass-culture spotlight in 1983 with 'Holiday' and hijacked it wholesale the next year with 'Like a Virgin' and 'Material Girl', Madonna, now 49, has lived her life in public like few other artists. The records, tours and videos have been thoroughly documented, as have the liaisons and the controversies (from the Sex book {{all the way up to}} the Malawi orphan adoption)." [...] Lyn Barber from The Daily Telegraph gave a negative review of the book, calling it far inferior to author J. Randy Taraborrelli's , released in 2002. Like Churchwell, Barber did not understand why over-emphasis was given on the singer's albums, leaving out details about her personal life. The reviewer listed one positive aspect of the book, the info on Madonna's childhood and a detailed insight into her family. She concluded by saying, [...] " [...] remains one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> women of our time but not, alas, in this pedestrian account." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews. Chris Williams of Billboard {{said the}} song is [...] "Max Martin and Spears at their best: a stomping dance floor beat with building synths prodding the song along and the singer sounding like she's having a blast being the bad girl". Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz called the song one of the standout tracks of the album. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that her stronger and confident delivery in the chorus was noticeably lacking {{in the rest of}} the album. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle also said that the [...] "more aggressive, pointed persona" [...] Spears adopts in {{the song is}} one of the high points of the album. The Emory Wheels writer Julia Cox called it [...] "the album's strongest and most unorthodox song". Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post named the song <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> track of the album and commented on the euphemism, saying [...] "It's trashy and clever, and it's also quite fun. And fun is exactly what Spears should be aiming for". However, there were also some negative reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the song is [...] "a Katy Perry-styled exercise in crass commercial carnality that is at once the best and worst song here". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "" [...] and added that [...] "it'll be a middle-school sensation". NME named it one of the filthiest songs of all time.|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have commented on Shikamaru's character. IGN stated that Shikamaru {{was one of their}} favorite characters in the series, and referred to him as [...] "the poster child for any card-carrying member of Generation X" [...] due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential. In a review of episode 110, IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair. Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru's emergence as [...] "an unlikely hero" [...] {{one of the highlights of}} the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru's team were critically injured, IGN lauded the [...] "great moment" [...] in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich celebrated his [...] "sheer intellect", calling him [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> characters in the series" [...] and [...] "one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen anime". Dani Moure, another reviewer from the same site, noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was [...] "one of the better fights involving the supporting players".|$|E
500|$|Website reviewers deemed Soul Reavers {{gameplay}} too non-linear and {{its objectives}} too unclear. GameSpot criticized the warp system for using confusing symbols that did {{little or nothing}} to indicate the warp's destination, and weighed the fun of impaling vampires with the Soul Reaver against the lack of challenge presented by bosses and most enemies. Next Generation Magazine considered the game challenging due to [...] "difficult puzzles and lack of a map", requiring the player to backtrack. The Tampa Tribune also criticized the camera controls, though noted that the [...] "auto-facing" [...] feature made the difficulties negligible. PC Zone criticized the PC port of the game for [...] "chunky" [...] graphics and bad camera controls, stating [...] "it feels too much like a PlayStation release ported hurriedly on to the PC". Computer Gaming World similarly felt that the limitations of the PlayStation carried over in the PC port, rendering the latter's visuals [...] "mind-numbingly boring". The publication praised the Lucifer-based story for engaging players, but was disappointed that [...] "it peters out in an unsatisfying climax". Game Informer stated, [...] "Even after years in development, Soul Reaver doesn't feel finished. It feels rushed." [...] 1UP.com ranked Soul Reaver second on its [...] "Top 5 Games That Ended Halfway Through", stating [...] "it's pretty clear that the plot {{would have been a lot}} different if the money hadn't inconveniently run out." [...] GamesRadar placed Soul Reaver at #4 on a 2007 list of the top seven video game apocalypses, regarding the post-apocalyptic Nosgoth as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> wastelands we've ever explored".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Chuck Dixon’s Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey (1996) {{led to the}} comic series Birds of Prey {{starring}} the two title characters. During Chuck Dixon's crossover series Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle, Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form {{the nucleus of the}} Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: [...] "Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator and one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She’s fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she’s tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place." [...] Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon’s origin with the miniseries [...] Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer is {{generally}} considered to be among the most talented actresses in Hollywood, and one of the greatest actresses of her generation. Despite acknowledging that she lacks the film credits of Anjelica Huston and Meryl Streep, Bastién wrote that [...] "of her generation, she’s the actress with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> thematic through line." [...] Coined one of the industry's [...] "most interesting" [...] actresses by The Daily Beast, Pfeiffer is known for her versatility, boasting a diverse filmography that includes period, romance, fantasy and comedy genres. During the 1980s, Pfeiffer typically played smart, funny and strong female characters who also happen to be [...] "more than a little sexy." [...] New Woman observed that Pfeiffer's characters tend to [...] "play the world at a distance, mostly, and are often wise beyond their years. They get romanced, but are not overtly romantic. They may be trashy ... but they all retain an air of invulnerability, a certain classical poise." [...] Comparing Pfeiffer's resume to that of actress Barbara Stanwyck, Elizabeth Kaye of The Daily Beast wrote that Pfeiffer's vulnerable characters share a common theme: [...] "the only reasonable expectation is to not expect much". Apart from The Witches of Eastwick, few of the actress' films during this period had been box office successes, an observation Pfeiffer never mentioned to studio heads in fear that they would stop hiring her altogether. However, her performances continued to garner consistently positive reviews despite lackluster ticket sales and several films that critics dismissed as [...] "forgettable". Pfeiffer has managed to establish herself as a [...] "major star" [...] despite having yet to receive top-billing in a blockbuster film.|$|E

Joanne Dorken of MTV UK who described [...] "I Miss You" [...] as [...] "heartfelt ballad" [...] with her vocals being [...] "on point", as she delivers the song with [...] "raw emotion". Ben Cardew of Music Week appreciated [...] "the influence of Frank Ocean", which according to him, made it feel like [...] "the first track on the album to have a modern feel". He went on praising the fact that the ballad is constructed from [...] "a stripped down beat and washes of synth, making a very simple track but one that benefits from its simplicity". Describing [...] "I Miss You" [...] as a [...] "gently pulsing, sci-fi ballad", Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle called the song [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> moments amid a dozen tracks".

500|$|Del Toro and Bickford hired screenwriter Benjamin A. van der Veen {{to write}} the screenplay's first drafts, and their {{extensive}} research took them to Cuba where they met with several of the remaining members of Guevara's team in Bolivia {{as well as the}} revolutionary's wife and children. [...] It was during this phase of development that the filmmakers discovered Terrence Malick had been in Bolivia as a journalist in 1966 working on a story about Che. [...] Malick came on as director and worked on the screenplay with van der Veen and Del Toro, but after a year-and-a-half, the financing had not come together entirely and Malick left to make The New World, a film about Jamestown, Virginia. Afraid that their multi-territory deals would fall apart, Bickford and Del Toro asked Steven Soderbergh, who was previously on board as producer, to direct. The filmmaker was drawn to the contrast of [...] "engagement versus disengagement. Do we want to participate or observe? Once Che made the decision to engage, he engaged fully. Often people attribute that to a higher power, but as an atheist, he didn't have that. I found that very interesting". Furthermore, he remarked that Guevara was [...] "great movie material" [...] and [...] "had one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> lives" [...] that he could [...] "imagine in the last century". Bickford and Del Toro realized that there was no context for what made Guevara decide to go to Bolivia. They began looking for someone to rewrite the screenplay; [...] Peter Buchman was recommended to them because he had a good reputation for writing about historical figures, based on a script he worked about Alexander the Great. He spent a year reading every available book on Guevara in preparation for writing the script. The project was put on hold when Bickford and Del Toro made Traffic with Soderbergh.|$|E

Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote, [...] "Don't they grow up fast?", referring to soap opera rapid aging syndrome.
