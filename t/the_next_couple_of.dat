40|$|We {{examine the}} {{distributional}} and e ciency impacts of climate {{policy in the}} context of fiscal consolidation in a dynamic general-equilibrium overlapping generations model of the US economy. The model includes a disaggregated production structure, including energy sector detail and advanced low- or zero-carbon energy technologies, and detail on government taxes and spending. In contrast to revenue-neutral carbon tax swaps, using the carbon revenue for deficit reduction implies a relaxation of future public budgets as debt repayment results in lower interest obligations. While we show that the intergenerational welfare impacts depend importantly on what tax recycling instrument is used, we find that combining debt consolidation with a carbon policy entails the possibility of sustained welfare gains for future generations. We thus argue that combining fiscal and climate policy may o er the chance for positive societal gains (without considering potential benefits from averted climate change). Importantly, this may enhance the political support for revenue-raising climate policies that are framed over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> decades...|$|R

During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure.

During this time, the focus was on producing off-dry, clean, and crisp wine that was mostly neutral in flavor and could capitalize on the wine market's demand for white wine. Near the end of the 20th century, several Chenin blanc specialist producers emerged and worked with vineyard managers to isolate older Chenin vines on suitable terroir. Their goal was to produce wines that exhibited Chenin's unique aromas and traits. While plantings of Chenin blanc have decreased, the work of these producers resulted in improved quality profiles of South African Chenin blanc.|$|R

This paper highlights several challenges, current results and future steps of our work in optimization of Exoskeleton based factory environments. “JackEx” is the enhancement of the standard digital humanoid “Jack” with concepts and elements of passive Exoskeletons. For the development of JackEx, a new digital manufacturing resource, the intimate <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the Exoskeleton digital model to the humanoid “Jack” components was realized. First the CAD model of the Exoskeleton was decomposed in its elementary compound parts, by creating its corresponding kinematic model. As <b>the</b> <b>next</b> step, <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> Exoskeleton digital models to the humanoid was a real challenge since the humanoid and Exoskeleton kinematics are heterogeneous and autonomous. In order to define a common kinematic model of humanoid with integrated Exoskeleton, complex calculus and tests were performed resulting in a new kinematic model. JackEx was deeper validated in a virtual and digital environment through real test cases simulations. The comparison between the simulation results with those performed for the same task but without integrated Exoskeleton, revealed from an ergonomically perspective the benefits of employing the Exoskeleton in manufacturing factories...|$|R
40|$|Cement is a {{strategic}} commodity. Indonesia as {{a developing country}} continues, cement becomes something absolute. Particularly, in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few years, infrastructure development continues announced. To it, we need to anticipate the occurrence of scarcity (shortage) of cement {{to meet the needs}} in the country in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> years. Fears <b>of</b> a shortage of cement in the country are quite groundless. Currently installed production capacity of the national cement industry around 47. 5 million tons per year, spreads over nine locations in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the average utilization rate of production capacity cement plant reaches between 80 % - 85 % or about 38 - 40 million per year. Meanwhile, the current level of cement consumption reached about 33 million tons (still a surplus of about 5 - 7 million tons). The problem is, if the shortage is met from imports, it could damage the domestic cement industry. Therefore, to meet the interests of industry and consumers, the best way is the expansion of the new plant. And to support the expansion of the factory in the country, clearly requires a major investment. Based on the assumptions above, Holcim as a newbie in the national cement market, which previously bought cement Cibinong also takes part in the national market. Now, Holcim is not half-hearted continuously expanding its new factory in Tuban to increase the strength of its two plants that are already running. A series of innovations in marketing activities are carried out, ie not just treating cement as a commodity but rather providing a range of service solutions to users via the outlet solution that provides aid earthquake resistant building design, material supply multi-brand, as well as a series of cooperation in the process of financing by establishing cooperation to the bank.    </p...|$|R
