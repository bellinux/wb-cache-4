5|$|Chappell's battles {{against the}} short-pitched bowling of Snow {{during the season}} {{compelled}} him to reappraise his game. Following a conversation with Sir Donald Bradman, he decided <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> the hook shot and spent the winter months practising the stroke by hitting baseballs thrown by his brother Greg. Although he still regularly lost his wicket after playing the shot, Chappell felt that the psychological benefit of showing aggression to opposing bowlers offset the times that he was dismissed for a low score.|$|E
5|$|Following the French colonization, the {{language}} of instruction and media changed from Malagasy to almost exclusively French. Moreover, the first French governor-general, Gallieni, also encouraged the French officials to learn Malagasy as well. After {{the advent of the}} Malagasy independence, the Madagascans tried <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> Malagasy as a language of instruction especially in secondary schools. However, {{the language}} policy was inadequately planned and Malagasy was struggling to surpass French as {{the language of}} instruction.|$|E
5|$|His {{enthusiasm for}} {{teaching}} at the university ebbed in his final years there.

Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> his original salary.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier for}} police officers who had been off the force {{for more than a year}} to apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Lincoln was {{concerned}} that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.|$|E

He helped Celtic draw 0–0 against FC Sion at home, but then lost 3–1 in the away leg, only for UEFA <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> Celtic into the Europa League with 3–0 wins in both legs after Sion were found to be fielding ineligible players, thus allowing Forster to keep his only clean sheets in Europe for the season, as he conceded in all the five group matches he played in.|$|E
5|$|After the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{ruled in}} his favour, {{the book was}} made {{available}} in the UK. However following the publication, the British Government obtained a High Court order to confiscate all proceeds from the book, {{on the grounds that}} the government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson. In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal objection to the publication of The Big Breach, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. However, it still refused <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> him or compensate him for the loss of his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Gates McFadden {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Doctor Beverly Crusher in the third season, the character had been written out for season two and replaced with Diana Muldaur playing Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Roddenberry had ensured that Crusher was not written out permanently to allow for her return in the future. Keith DeCandido blamed her departure on Maurice Hurley. After he left the series, McFadden returned. Fans started a letter-writing campaign <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> McFadden throughout the second season. Both Roddenberry and Berman decided {{that it would be better}} to bring back McFadden than to look for a third doctor in three years as they agreed that the Pulaski character was not working.|$|E

Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI in spite of it.|$|E

The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent. At 2.34pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against the new prime minister in the House, which instructed the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to advise Kerr <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> Whitlam.|$|E

The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton had been able <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E

5|$|Judge Green {{presided over}} a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> William Bolden, a {{minority}} trooper who had been dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a consent decree that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E
5|$|Lacrosse {{is governed}} internationally by the 52-member Federation of International Lacrosse, which {{sponsors}} the World Lacrosse Championships once every four years. A former Olympic sport, {{attempts by the}} international governing body <b>to</b> <b>reinstate</b> it to the Games have been hampered by insufficient international participation and by the existence of separate governing bodies for the men's and women's versions of the sport until 2008. Field lacrosse is played professionally in North America by Major League Lacrosse. It is also played on a high amateur level by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States, the Australian Senior Lacrosse Championship series, and the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association.|$|E
