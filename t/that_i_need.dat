500|$|In 1999, Westley {{bought a}} {{controlling}} interest in Farnborough Town and appointed himself as manager. He managed {{the club to}} a 12th-place finish {{in his first season}} in charge, but enjoyed success in the Isthmian Cup; winning the competition in 2000. The following season, Westley guided the club to more success, winning the Isthmian League Premier Division; securing 31 victories out of a possible 42 and amassing a total of 99 points. Westley overhauled the squad shortly after the club's promotion to the Football Conference – something which he now states as a [...] "huge regret". At this point, he also tried to arrange a merger with Kingstonian – citing the club's [...] "Football League rated ground" [...] as the reasoning behind his proposed idea, although it never happened due to [...] "fans resistance". [...] During the 2001–02 season, the club consolidated their position in the first tier of non–league football; with Westley guiding the club to a 7th-place finish in the league. The following season was to be a memorable campaign for Westley, reaching the Third Round of the FA Cup after a 3–0 victory at Southport, where they faced Football League competition in the form of Darlington at Feethams. Westley guided the side to a 3–2 win over Darlington, and the club were rewarded with a Fourth Round tie at home to Arsenal. The tie, however, was controversially moved to Highbury – because the tie stood to make around £600,000 in gate receipts from playing at Highbury, whereas playing at Cherrywood Road would only have generated the club an estimated £50,000. Westley left the club after the sell-out 'home' tie at Highbury, which they lost 5–1. Shortly after his resignation, he became manager at Football Conference rivals Stevenage in January 2003, signing a three-year contract. Westley confirmed he would be leaving his shareholding in Farnborough to other existing shareholders, and would also be withdrawing his financial backing at the club. On moving to Stevenage, Westley said [...] "I've enjoyed my time at Farnborough, but I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to move on now and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to concentrate on football management, which is where my ambitions lie". He went on to state that Stevenage's [...] "long-term potential" [...] was another key factor behind the move.|$|E

[...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud."

[...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost.
