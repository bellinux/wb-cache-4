5|$|Former Indian player Prabhakaralso {{publicly}} {{claimed that}} Kapil wanted <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> a match against Pakistan. Prabhakar's allegations against an unknown team member was not new {{as he made}} these allegations to a magazine The Outlook in 1997 based on which BCCI instituted the Chandrachud Inquiry, a one man commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Prabhakar did not reveal names or provide evidence of his charges (match fixing and phone tapping allegation on then cricket manager Ajit Wadekar). When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The reaction of the Indian public resulted in PILs and International Cricket Council and the BCCI were called to respond in the Delhi and Calcutta High Courts. In response to the crisis, the Indian government initiated a CBI inquiry on 28 April 2000. Former BCCI President Inderjit Singh Bindra revealed on 4 May 2000 that Prabhakar told him that Kapil asked him <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> the match. During the ensuing exchanges between various parties, Kapil Dev broke down {{in an interview on}} BBC's Hard Talk with Karan Thapar.|$|E
5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote {{a defense}} of his {{decision}} to duel {{while at the same}} time intending <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His desire to be available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E

5|$|The {{logistics}} of the referendum were organised and supervised by Diệm's brother and confidant, Nhu, {{who was the}} leader of the family's secret Cần Lao party, which supplied the Ngôs' electoral base. Reports of violence and intimidation were widespread. During the referendum, Nhu's staff told voters <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water sometimes being forced into their nostrils. The violations were particularly flagrant in central Vietnam, a region over which another of Diệm's younger brothers, Ngô Đình Cẩn, ruled. Cẩn was based in the former imperial capital city of Huế, home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of support for Bảo Đại. He stifled this support by ordering the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In the city of Hội An, several people were killed in election violence {{on the day of the}} poll. Voting started at 07:00 and ended at 17:00.|$|E
5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

25|$|In 1799, Russian and Austrian forces {{swept across}} the Po River valley, recapturing lands taken by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796. The French troops in Italy were badly {{defeated}} at the major battles of Magnano, Cassano and the Trebbia. Subsequently, French and Cisalpine Italian troops retreated into Genoa and the Ligurian Republic. A new French government placed Joubert {{in command of the}} reformed Army of Italy and ordered him to take the offensive. Accordingly, the French army moved north across the mountain crests and assembled on high ground at Novi Ligure on 14 August. To Joubert's dismay, it was clear that large Coalition forces were nearby. The next morning Paul Kray's Austrian corps assaulted the French left flank and the battle was on. After a delay, Suvorov committed a Russian corps to attack the center and Michael von Melas' Austrian corps to attack the French right flank. Kray's troops suffered heavy losses but by evening the French army was badly beaten and the French hold on the Italian Riviera was gravely weakened. However, the Coalition planners proceeded <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> their advantage by sending Suvorov's Russians to Switzerland, a change of strategy that ended badly.|$|E
25|$|The game {{started with}} the Badgers kicking off to the Gamecocks. South Carolina would pickup three first downs but would punt after {{they go to the}} Wisconsin 36–yard line. The Badgers would then pickup two first downs on their first drive but stalled at the South Carolina 30–yard line. Wisconsin lined up in a punt {{formation}} and attempted a fake but Badgers punter Drew Meyer's pass was incomplete. The Gamecocks' next drive would result in a punt. On the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave was trying <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> a pass into the ground as he was pressured but the pass deflected off a leg of his own lineman and into the hands of a South Carolina defender. On the very next play, South Carolina QB Connor Shaw threw a 39–yard touchdown pass to WR Bruce Ellington. The first quarter came to an end as the Badgers started their drive. Wisconsin would answer with a 1–yard touchdown pass to TE Sam Arneson from Joel Stave. South Carolina then drove 86 yards on 12 plays scoring on a reverse throwback to the quarterback. Wide receiver Bruce Ellington threw a 9–yard pass to quarterback Connoer Shaw. The extra point failed because of a low snap then caused the holder for South Carolina to try and run for the conversion but was tackled well short of the goal line. The Badgers answered again on their next drive with a 16 play, 75 yard drive that used up over six and a half minutes. The drive was capped by a 3–yard touchdown pass to WR Jeff Duckworth from Joel Stave. After the kickoff and a South Carolina kneel down, the Badgers led 14–13 at halftime.|$|E

500|$|Before {{beginning}} work, {{the development}} team commissioned {{two pieces of}} music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game to guide their efforts. They created a number of prototypes, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and removed elements that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players too excited. The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world, but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as [...] "almost like we wanted <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> the traditional game design, but we end up picking up all the pieces we threw away and putting them back because we know those are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of {{that time in the}} prototyping stage. After deciding on the game elements, Flower was produced in only six months.|$|E

500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa.

[...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|October started {{no better}} for the Blades as they were easily beaten 2–0 at home by league leaders Charlton Athletic and needed a last second goal to {{progress}} in the Football League Trophy as they struggled against League Two side Rotherham United. Meanwhile, Danny Wilson boosted his squad ahead of the Steel City derby, with Marcus Williams agreeing to stay on loan for a further two months and Matt Phillips and Billy Clarke arriving for a month each from Blackpool. The new arrivals failed to halt the disappointing run of results however as the Blades let a 2–0 lead slip to end up drawing with their cross–city rivals. [...] Despite this disappointment the team bounced back to score an emphatic away win at Preston {{a few days later}} with both new signing Matt Phillips and old hand Lee Williamson netting two goals apiece. [...] With increased competition for first team places, youngsters Danny Philliskirk and Corey Gregory were allowed to go out on loan to Oxford United and Hucknall Town respectively; swiftly followed by Connor Brown who joined Eastwood Town on a months deal. [...] Back in the league, the disappointing results continued as United threw away a lead once again, allowing ten-men Leyton Orient to snatch a draw with the last kick of the game. [...] Once again the Blades quickly responded to the setback by beating fellow promotion rivals MK Dons 2–1 at Bramall Lane, but then conspired <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> yet more points, allowing Exeter City to come from behind twice in the closing minutes of the next game to snatch a 4–4 draw.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>away</b> the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
