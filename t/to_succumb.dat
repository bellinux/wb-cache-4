5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. Fancy rats experience different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus are less likely <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> {{to many of the}} same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E

The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a report}} by the Diário de Notícias, Portugal had allowed {{considerable}} slippage in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy, together with the US subprime mortgage crisis and the eurozone crisis, Portugal {{was one of the first}} economies <b>to</b> <b>succumb,</b> and was affected very deeply.|$|E
5|$|Both Chelsea and Stuttgart {{ended their}} seasons in fourth place of their {{respective}} leagues, the FA Premier League and the Bundesliga. Chelsea beat Bolton Wanderers 2–0 on the last matchday, while Stuttgart oversaw a 1–0 win over Werder Bremen. Both sides also progressed in their cup competitions – Chelsea lost against Manchester United with three to five in the 1997–98 FA Cup third round, but found success with a 2–0 victory over Middlesbrough in the 1998 Football League Cup Final. Stuttgart saw themselves overrun 0–2 by Bayern Munich in the 1997 German League Cup Final, only <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to Bayern again with a 0–3 deficit in the 1997–98 German Cup semi-final.|$|E
5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} {{now had to}} deal with Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, to the effect that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to the inevitable, recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E

Filming was rescheduled to allow Tennant to be present when she died and was buried; she died on 15 July and was buried on 21 July. During Tennant's absence, scenes in the Titanics reception area were filmed at the Exchange in Swansea and the Coal Exchange in Cardiff Bay. Tennant filmed his scenes in the area on 16 and 17 July. The last use of the Coal Exchange was on the 18th; scenes depicting the ship's collision with meteors were filmed on that day.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{priests of}} {{different}} religious orders {{set out to}} evangelize the Americas, bringing Christianity to indigenous communities. Two of these missionary orders were the Franciscans and the Jesuits, both of which eventually arrived in the frontier town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra {{and then in the}} Chiquitania. The missionaries employed the strategy of gathering the often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called reductions in order to more effectively Christianize them. This policy sprang from the colonial legal view of the “Indian” as a minor, who had to be protected and guided by European missionaries so as not <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to sin. Reductions generally were construed as instruments to enable the natives adopt European lifestyles and values; {{this was not the case}} in the Jesuit reductions, however, where the Jesuits allowed the inhabitants to retain many pre-colonial cultural practices.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} Test of the 2009 Ashes at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, Collingwood scored 64 {{in the first}} innings as England totalled 435. On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of Brad Haddin caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England slid to 70 for 5 and seemed certain <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5¾ hours (nearly {{the whole of the}} final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth man out, edging Peter Siddle to gully, but final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match to secure an {{improbable}} draw.|$|E

Brooke soon lusts for Nell, and his increased interest in her leads to unconventional encounters. They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration and love for the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E
5|$|Although Utor tracked {{back over}} water on December10, the storm began to weaken due to {{increasing}} wind shear and dry {{air from the}} west. As a result, the JMA downgraded Utor to severe tropical storm intensity upon its emergence into the South China Sea. Despite these hindering conditions, the storm's improved outflow was sufficient enough to enable redevelopment. At 18:00UTC on December11, the JMA once again upgraded the system to typhoon strength southeast of Hainan. Intensification continued until Utor peaked with winds of 155km/h (100mph) and a minimum pressure of 945mbar (hPa; 27.91inHg) the next day. This strength was held for only twelve hours before Utor's outflow began <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to the wind shear and dry air stemming from the monsoonal flow it had previously suppressed. Traveling in a tight clockwise loop, the typhoon rapidly weakened on December13; by the following day Utor was a minimal tropical storm. At 06:00UTC on December14, the storm degenerated into a tropical depression and continued to execute a small anticyclonic loop before dissipating on December15.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft {{carrying}} the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to exposure, {{and at least one}} officer drowned {{in a desperate attempt to}} swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the day by the cutter Aiguille.|$|E

In Bad Boys Love, it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian future—in which a pandemic of a deadly, mutated strain of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, nearly wipes out mankind in the year 2068. The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers {{in a desperate attempt to}} stop the spread of the disease, ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to the disease. Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is diurnal and chiefly an ambush predator, {{though it has}} been {{recorded}} as hunting partly by pursuit, such as catching pigeons at a watering hole before they can fly high enough to escape. It usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return, if the hunting is good {{and it is not}} disturbed. It hunts mainly by sight and in doing so it commonly will raise much of its length well off the ground. The black mamba does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and waiting for it <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to paralysis and die. This however depends on the type of prey; for example, it typically will hold onto a bird till it stops struggling to escape. If prey tries to escape or defend itself, the black mamba often may follow up its initial bite with a rapid series of strikes to incapacitate and quickly kill its prey. The snake has been known to prey on hyrax and rock hyrax, bushbabies, and bats. The black mamba has a potent digestive system and has been observed to digest prey fully within eight to ten hours.|$|E

5|$|The remnant {{circulation}} {{continued to}} move slowly and erratically as it emerged {{off the coast}} on May31, before accelerating east-northeastwards and reintensifying slightly. Amidst light wind shear and high sea surface temperatures (SSTs), organization improved as convection persisted near the center, and Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression at 00:00UTC on June2. The next day, despite worsening conditions, a burst of convection around the center led to Bonnie once again being declared a tropical storm, simultaneously attaining a new minimum pressure of 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg). Increasing northwesterly shear and cooling SSTs soon became evident as the LLCC became exposed to the west, however Bonnie continued to maintain tropical storm strength. On the afternoon of June4, Bonnie began <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to the unfavorable conditions, and the storm weakened into a tropical depression. Early the next day, Bonnie degenerated once more into a post-tropical cyclone as it tracked east-southeastward over the Atlantic Ocean. The storm eventually transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on June7, and eventually dissipated south-southwest of the Azores, just after 18:00UTC on June9.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning <b>to</b> <b>succumb</b> to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E
