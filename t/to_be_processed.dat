5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E
5|$|The game sold a {{total of}} 300,000 units for the ZX Spectrum and {{generated}} £1 million in revenue for Ultimate Play the Game, which enabled the Stamper brothers to gain {{a foothold in the}} early video gaming market. After the game's release, Jetpac was parodied in a long-running Crash comic strip named Lunar Jetman. The strip, designed by John Richardson, lasted from July 1984 to October 1991 and gained popular reception from readers. To develop the comic, photographs had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> manually on a photo-mechanical tone and then transferred to paper, later being fully colourised in the late 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating {{of the coffee}} bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of the coffee is impaired. They built the first station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E
5|$|The data/messages {{from the}} {{aircraft}} are transmitted by the aircraft's Satellite Data Unit (SDU) and relayed via satellite to a ground station, {{where they are}} routed to other communication networks to reach their destination. Messages may also {{be sent to the}} aircraft, in reverse order. When passing through the satellite, the signals are amplified and translated in frequency—mixed with the signal from an oscillator in the satellite, leaving the satellite at the combined frequency. Transmissions from the aircraft are made on one of several channels (frequencies) near 1.6GHz, combined with frequency of the satellite's oscillator, and transmitted to the GES at the combined frequency (one of several channels near 3.6GHz). The ground station then translates the received signal before it reaches equipment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed.</b> The ground station keeps a log of transmissions and some data about them.|$|E

5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E
5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E
5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of punched cards <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E

5|$|While Pinkerton and Allen were {{building}} the southern extension, Thomas Gaunt had {{been active in}} the area. He was extracting iron ore <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> in new furnaces at Pembrey, had obtained Kilrhedyn colliery, and had constructed a harbour on the sands at Pembrey. Rennie and Bankes had dismissed the idea of a connection to Gaunt's harbour, as it was not felt to be adequate for the likely volumes of coal traffic, but Gaunt was keen for a canal link. Between late 1823 and April 1824 he built two miles (3.2km) of canal, including a lock at Cross Lane cottage. At its northern end it joined the Kidwelly and Llanelly canal at Ty Gwyn, just {{to the north of the}} disused Ashburnham Canal, and at its southern end, a short tramway linked its terminus to Gaunt's harbour. The Cambrian newspaper carried reports of a ceremonial opening on 30 April 1824, and a formal opening on 26 May. By 1843, the canal had become disused, with traffic going to the new harbour at Pembrey instead.|$|E
