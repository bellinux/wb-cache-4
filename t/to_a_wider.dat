5|$|A team of {{scholars}} worked from 1040 to 1044 to compile the Wujing Zongyao {{with the intent}} to collect all known military knowledge and to disseminate it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> government audience. Its chief editor, Zeng Gongliang, was assisted by the prominent astronomer Yang Weide and the scholar Ding Du. After five years, the book was published with a preface authored by Emperor Renzong himself. Lorge remarks that Zeng Gongliang, the chief editor, was a government official rather than a military general, implying that the Wujing Zongyao was likely written for other government officials.|$|E
5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten was {{published}} in 1924 by the Fischer Verlag. In 1931 Döblin began working on a radically simplified and shortened version, {{in order to make}} the difficult work more accessible <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> audience; the new version {{was published}} by the Fischer Verlag in May 1932 under the title Giganten (Giants). 2006 saw the release of a new critical edition of Berge Meere und Giganten by the Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (Munich), edited by Gabriele Sander. The original manuscript and Döblin's extensive notes for the novel are preserved in the German literary archive in Marbach am Neckar. As of 2017, there is no English translation available.|$|E

5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors {{from the}} Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.|$|E
5|$|Fortune saw her occult novels as an {{important}} part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into the realms of occultism by speaking to their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects occult teachings. She thus perceived them as a means of disseminating her teachings <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> audience. Each was related to one of the Sephirah on the Qabalic Tree of Life: The Winged Bull was associated with Tiphareth, The Goat-Foot God with Malkuth, and The Sea Priestess with Yesod.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
5|$|Leonard's Bakery is a Portuguese bakery in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{known for}} popularizing the malasada. The fried pastry, {{slightly}} crispier and chewier than a doughnut {{and with no}} hole, {{is known as a}} cuisine of Hawaii. Though Portuguese immigrants brought the malasada to Hawaii {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, Leonard's opened in 1952 and brought it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> audience. Leonard's is a household name in Hawaii and is well known in the continental United States and internationally. A franchise location opened in Japan in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Meretzky {{conceived}} Hodj 'n' Podj in {{the late}} 1980s, {{as a way to}} revive simpler games that had become hard to obtain. It began production in 1994, and was the first product developed by Meretzky's company Boffo Games. Production was troubled, thanks to a $100 million securities fraud scandal at Media Vision, which led to the project's sale to Virgin. During development, Boffo discovered that Hodj 'n' Podj appealed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> demographic than Meretzky's past work, and Meretzky has since cited it as an early casual game.|$|E

5|$|Musically, glam metal {{combines}} a traditional heavy metal sound with elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal {{songs of the}} 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power balladsslow, emotional songs that gradually build to a strong finale. These {{were among the most}} commercially successful singles in the genre and opened it up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> audience {{that would not have been}} attracted to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, with songs often directed at a particular woman.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> range of foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings {{can serve as a}} good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E
5|$|Since no {{consensus}} could be reached, the committee {{decided to put}} these three definitions <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from {{two of the three}} proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between planet and rock (or, in the new parlance, small Solar System body), called dwarf planet and placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris. The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers taking part in the ballot.|$|E
