Several hundred more families who had employment but no housing were accommodated in a [...] "civil village" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>Rivesaltes</b> camp during <b>the</b> 1960s. In 1963, a forestry village was also created in Rivesaltes for about 25 families of former auxiliaries (about a hundred people). The next decade saw the bulk of this population moved to the HLM (rent-controlled housing) of Rearte, built in <b>the</b> city of <b>Rivesaltes</b> to finalize <b>the</b> situation of these families.

5000|$|Serge Klarsfeld called <b>the</b> <b>Rivesaltes</b> camp [...] "the Drancy of {{the free}} zone", noting that from September 4 to October 22 it played the same role as the Drancy camp in the {{occupied}} zone: a transit camp for deportees whose ultimate destination was the Nazi extermination camps.

50|$|After the Anschluss in March 1938, {{many of his}} {{relatives}} were arrested. At his mother’s insistence, he fled on a train to Trier, Germany, where he was met by a smuggler. He swam across the Sauer River into Luxembourg, where he spent five nights in a Franciscan monastery. He was arrested two days later {{in a coffee shop}} and chose to be taken to the Belgian border over arrest or being sent back to Germany. He arrived in Antwerp, Belgium, on November 11, 1938. He stayed in Antwerp for a peaceful eighteen months where he went to a public trade school to become an electrician as an alternative to being sent to an internment camp. He learned to speak Dutch. On May 9, 1940, he entered a hospital in Antwerp to have surgery on a hernia, but Antwerp was bombed the next morning before he could be operated on. Upon being discharged from the hospital, he was arrested as an enemy alien. Now that the war had reached Antwerp, he was an enemy to Belgium because he was an Austrian (now German) citizen. He was sent to St. Cyprien, an internment camp near the Spanish border. His friend Leon Osterreicher came to visit him and instructed him to escape by climbing under the camp’s fence. While living with distant relatives nearby, he was sent to an assigned residence in Cauterets, France, near the Pyrenees Mountains. He stayed at this residence for eight to ten months until on August 26, 1941, when the deportation began from this town. Upon a warning from the mayor of Luchon, he hid with his uncle overnight in the Pyrenees, returning the next day to find half of the ghetto’s population deported. He walked across the Swiss border with his cousin Albert Hershkowitz in October 1942, under the name Paul Meunier, only to be stopped by a Swiss Mountain Patrol and sent back to France. He was sent to <b>the</b> <b>Rivesaltes</b> internment camp where he remained for two weeks before being sent to Drancy, a large-scale deportation camp in the suburbs of Paris.|$|R
50|$|In October 1940, Field {{resigned}} {{his post}} in Geneva and in 1941 became {{director of the}} American Unitarian Universalist Service Committee's relief mission in Marseilles, providing relief for endangered Jewish refugees including antifascists and leftists, and helping many to flee to Switzerland. Field began a major collaboration with the Organization to Save the Children (OSE), a French Jewish humanitarian organization, and its Marseilles director, Joseph Weill. The two organizations later shared the same offices in Marseilles and Noel Field, with help from his wife, set up kindergartens in <b>the</b> Camp de <b>Rivesaltes.</b> <b>The</b> Fields worked {{with a number of}} French Jewish women and collaborated with OSE to liberate Jewish children from French internment camps both openly if possible and covertly if the camp director would not cooperate. Also beginning in early 1941, Noel Field established an extensive medical program to provide aid to Jewish refugees in hiding, those waiting to emigrate or those held in internment camps. Drawing on the medical expertise of some of the Jewish refugees, Field developed a team of about 20 medical doctors, dentists, and nurses, some with international reputations. From his contacts in Switzerland, he acquired medicines and nutritional supplements that were extraordinarily hard to obtain. With the American Friends Service Committee, and his lead doctor, Rene Zimmer, Field implemented a nutritional survey of many thousands of the refugees interned in French camps and provided additional food for those in greatest need.|$|R
5000|$|The French {{government}} did not plan for the Harkis after independence, and for some years it did not recognize any right for them to stay in France as residents and citizens. The Harkis were kept in [...] "temporary" [...] internment camps surrounded by barbed wire, such as <b>the</b> Camp de <b>Rivesaltes</b> (Joffre Camp) in Rivesaltes outside of Perpignan and in [...] "chantiers de forestage" [...] — communities of 30 Harki families {{on the outskirts of}} forests which the men maintained. The French government has since enacted various measures to help the Harki community (notably the 1994 Romani law and the 2005 Mekachera law); although in the views of community leaders these laws are often too little, too late.|$|R
