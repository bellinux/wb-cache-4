5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a handicap match- a tag team match in which a team of two wrestlers face a team of three. WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty defended their titles against The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) and Shaniqua. During the match Hotty attempted a worm on Shaniqua, but Shaniqua countered by clotheslining Hotty. The challengers had the advantage until Hotty clotheslined the Bashams, causing them to flip over the <b>top</b> <b>ring</b> rope and into ringside. Afterwards, Rikishi delivered a Samoan drop. Rikishi then covered Shaniqua to retain the championships. Next was a Singles match, in which Jamie Noble was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend Nidia. Nidia would take advantage of Noble's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall. Eventually, Noble was able to apply the guillotine choke on Nidia. Noble won the match after he forced her to submit with this move.|$|E
5|$|On the December 22, 2006 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, King Booker and Finlay demanded a rematch against Batista and John Cena. General Manager Theodore Long {{informed}} the pair {{that they would}} instead be facing Kane and The Undertaker later that night in a match, which Kane and The Undertaker won. At the Royal Rumble, the Royal Rumble match was held, where the winner is the final person left in the ring after the other twenty nine wrestlers are eliminated by being thrown over the <b>top</b> <b>ring</b> rope. The Undertaker won the Royal Rumble match to earn a title shot at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, he defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship and maintain his WrestleMania undefeated streak.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{the most common}} {{mounting}} system used twisted strips of cowhide as rope. The skin was attached with rings made of cowhide; one ring was sown into {{the perimeter of the}} skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together. A long strip of cowhide was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the <b>top</b> <b>ring</b> and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.|$|E
25|$|The skin is held {{in place}} by being trapped between the <b>top</b> <b>ring,</b> called the crown ring, and the ring below it, called the flesh ring. A third ring (the bottom ring) is placed around the stem. The rings are {{commonly}} made from 6–8mm (¼–⅓in) rebar. A series of cow hitches on the crown ring and bottom ring form loops. Through these loops, a length of rope connects the crown ring and the bottom ring; tightening this rope applies tension. As the vertical rope is tensioned, the cow hitches on the crown ring press the skin against the flesh ring below; this attaches the skin to the flesh ring very securely and stretches the skin over the bearing edge of the drum.|$|E

50|$|Most {{automotive}} pistons {{have three}} rings: The top two while also controlling oil are primarily for compression sealing (compression rings); the lower ring is for controlling {{the supply of}} oil to the liner which lubricates the piston skirt and the compression rings (oil control rings). At least two piston rings are found on most piston and cylinder combination. Typical compression ring designs will have an essentially rectangular cross section or a keystone (right angled trapezoidal) cross section. The periphery will then have either a barrel profile (<b>top</b> compression <b>rings)</b> or a taper napier form (second compression rings or scraper rings). There are some taper faced <b>top</b> <b>rings</b> and on some old engines simple plain faced rings were used.|$|R

5000|$|The {{apparatus}} {{is based}} on the principle which Ilizarov called [...] "the theory of tensions". Through controlled and mechanically applied tension stress, Ilizarov was able to show that the bone and soft tissue can be made to regenerate in a reliable and reproducible manner. The <b>top</b> <b>rings</b> of the Ilizarov (fixed to the healthy bone by the tensioned wire) allow force to be transferred through the external frame (the vertical metal rods), bypassing the fracture site. Force is then transferred back to the healthy bone through the bottom ring and the tensioned wires. This allows the Ilizarov apparatus to act as a sort of bridge, both immobilizing the fracture site and relieving it of stress, while allowing for the movement of the entire limb and partial weight-bearing. Middle rings (and tensioned wires) act to hold the bone fragments in place and to give greater structural support to the apparatus and limb. However, the critical load bearing <b>rings</b> are the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>rings</b> which transfer the force from the healthy bone down to the healthy bone, bypassing the fracture site.|$|R

The lower ring(s), {{of which there are}} usually two, are for a second rein to be attached, and they provide the gag action.
