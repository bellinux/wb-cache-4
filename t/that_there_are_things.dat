500|$|Vampire Weekend {{concentrated}} {{their efforts}} on giving each recording [...] "warmth", feeling that modern digital recordings lacked the sound quality of older records. In {{an attempt to make}} the tracks sound less harsh, the band and their recording engineers used a spectrum analyzer, Sonnox SuprEsser and heavily automated EQs to edit out harsher, colder frequencies and soften the mix. Vampire Weekend painstakingly listened to the record several separate times using technology from standard commercial iPod earbuds to professional equipment to ensure the record sounded nice regardless of equipment the listener owned. Desiring to [...] "check the relative warmth levels", the engineers would [...] "go in and perform surgery and automate EQs" [...] {{in order to make the}} mixes listenable. The band felt the finished product was something of a third chapter and a continuation of material explored in their previous two efforts. [...] "We thought these three albums should look like they belong together on a bookshelf", said Batmanglij. [...] "We realized <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> connecting the songs across three albums, like an invisible hand was guiding us. It does feel like we've been able to create three distinct worlds for each album, and yet have them be interconnected." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{critique}} {{contained in the}} book Tragedy in Transition it is mentioned that Harrison's play with its chaotic, lively, dynamic and sometimes fragmented verses, to match {{the condition of the}} papyri, contrasts with the stilted coverage of classics during the Edwardian era. In that sense Harrison may be pointing toward a neoclassicism which could indicate to a complacent and ignorant modern society <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> which cannot be [...] "assimilated". Harrison uses one of the satyrs in his work to hint that the classical world may be neglected in the modern era: ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1980, Christian critic R. Chris Hassel, Jr. {{offered a}} Christian {{view of the}} play. The {{experience}} of the lovers and that of Bottom (as expressed in his awakening speech) teach them [...] "a new humility, a healthy sense of folly". They realise <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that are true {{despite the fact that}} they can not be seen or understood. They just learned a lesson of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus' speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] Sybil answered, softly, for though Mary's tone {{had been}} cold enough, she had {{nevertheless}} {{for a single}} moment lifted the curtain, and Sybil understood in some vague manner <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> behind into which she {{had no right to}} inquire.|$|R
2500|$|The M*A*S*H (TV series) episode [...] "Bottoms Up" [...] (Season 9, Episode 15) {{featured}} a side {{story about a}} Nurse (Cpt. Helen Whitfield) who {{was found to be}} drinking heavily off-duty. By the culmination of the episode, after a confrontation by Maj. Margaret Houlihan, the character swears off her alcoholism and presumably quits immediately. At mealtime, an unspecified time later, Whitfield becomes hysterical upon being served food in the Mess tent, claiming <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> crawling onto her from it. The characters of Margaret and Col. Sherman Potter, subdue her. Potter, having recognized the symptoms of Delirium Tremens (which he abbreviates [...] "D.T."), orders 5ml of Paraldehyde from a witnessing nurse.|$|E
2500|$|B. H. Roberts {{declared}} that {{certain aspects of}} the endowment ceremony were intended to be [...] "secret from the world". In this regard, Facsimile No. 2 in the Book of Abraham (part of the LDS Church standard works) clarifies <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that [...] "cannot be revealed unto the world; but is to be had in the Holy Temple of God." [...] This information includes, in the initiation and instructional/testing phases of the endowment ceremony, certain names and symbolic gestures called tokens and signs. Prior to revisions in 1990, the LDS Church's version of the endowment also included a gesture called a [...] "penalty." [...] The ceremony stated that the [...] "representation of the execution of the penalties indicates different ways in which life may be taken". However, the LDS Church has removed the [...] "penalty" [...] portions of the ceremony, protecting the [...] "names", [...] "tokens," [...] and [...] "signs" [...] by a simple [...] "covenant and promise." [...] Still, such information has been published in various sources, unauthorized by the LDS Church.|$|E

5000|$|Petry had {{a strong}} family {{foundation}} with well-traveled uncles, who had many stories to tell her when coming home; her father, who overcame racial obstacles, opened a pharmacy in the small town; and her mother and aunts set a strong example: Petry, interviewed by the Washington Post in 1992, says about her tough female family members that “it never occurred to them <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>things</b> they couldn’t do because they were women.” ...|$|R
