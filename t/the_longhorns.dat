5|$|The secondquarter {{started with}} <b>the</b> <b>Longhorns</b> driving only sixyards and {{being forced to}} punt again.

5|$|Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Texas {{to begin the}} game, and <b>the</b> <b>Longhorns</b> {{returned}} the kick to the 35-yard line.

Texas regained the yardage after Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then Longhorns running back Ricky Williams gained six yards on a run up the middle. A third-down pass fell incomplete, and <b>the</b> <b>Longhorns</b> went three and out on the first possession of the game. Texas punted, and the Hokies returned the kick to their 26-yard line.|$|E
