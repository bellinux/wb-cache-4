At 0. 9 MAC of both anesthetics, LCGUs with enflurane were 38 - 92 % higher <b>than</b> those <b>with</b> isoflurane in 16 of 30 structures studied. At 1. 8 MAC, LCGUs with enflurane were higher <b>than</b> those <b>with</b> isoflurane in 12 structures, the difference being most pronounced (156 %) in the corpus callosum.
