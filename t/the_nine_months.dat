The 15th and 23rd Companies were detached from the 5th Marine Regiment and assigned permanently to the 6th Machine Gun Battalion. After two months of intense training, in March the battalion was committed to the fighting against the Germans.

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was again}} activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven {{of the ten}} original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was {{necessary in order to}} fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term. To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during <b>the</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> term was substantially the same as the 90-day term. Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at Camp Henry Wilson in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship Plymouth Rock. Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> program {{plan is to}} {{document}} all the activities that are scheduled for January-September, 1986 at FMPC. The intent of preparing <b>the</b> <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> program plan was to prepare a description of authorized work, budget the work on a month-to-month basis and schedule the completion of work. The milestones in the WMCO Transition Plan that included the gathering of FY 86 work scope and budget information in addition to issuing the 9 -month Program Plan assumed {{the existence of an}} existing budget program that priced and budgeted work monthly. In the absence of a budget computer program, an IBM P. C, with extended memory was leased to handle the volume of budget data. The planning concept in <b>the</b> <b>nine</b> <b>month</b> program was based on defining manageable work, scheduling small increments of work, and estimating the resources in labor, material and services required to accomplish the work. Then, as the work plan is implemented, the accomplishments and actual costs are reported against the plan and significant variances are identified for management action, if required. The two work tasks which were scheduled in the Transition Plan for preparing <b>the</b> <b>Nine</b> <b>Month</b> Program Plan were: (1) collect FY 86 - 88 financial data, production levels and capital construction schedules for FMPC, and (2) coordinate the preparation of the program plan consistent with C/SCSC where practical...|$|R

25|$|Several of {{the younger}} members of the Nyasaland African Congress had little faith {{in the ability of}} its leader, T D T Banda, who they also accused of dishonesty, and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda then living in the Gold Coast.

Dr Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise quite moderate and far less radical that the younger Congress members. In <b>the</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> between his return and the declaration of a State of Emergency, he combined opposition to Federation with more popular causes, such as the African smallholders' dislike of agricultural practices imposed on them to promote soil conservation and also the remnants of thangata.
