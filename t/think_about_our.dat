Knight uses the 'good to great' idea as a theoretical framework for institutional improvement. Knight asserts that, “We are called to a really high level of excellence based on the exceeding excellence of God Himself. Therefore, we {{have an important role}} to play as pacesetters and models of best practices in higher education." [...] The January, 2011 edition of the Pacific Union Recorder reports on renovations to the campus accomplished under Knight's leadership. [...] Pacific Union College's dining commons and campus center, a major hub of student life, had not been updated in 30 years. The Recorder quotes Knight, “When I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> campus going from good to great, I’m including every area of campus, including our facilities. My vision is that within the next several years the entire campus will be transformed.” ...|$|E

[...] "It makes us <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> audiences and what the audience wants," [...] he stated. [...] "We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment." [...] Although he felt Avatar would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic, he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: [...] "If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience." [...] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that Avatar would need significant [...] "repeat business" [...] just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed Avatar could inspire the same [...] "sharing" [...] reaction as Titanic. He said that film worked because, [...] "When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the court}} case {{a number of}} emails between Woolas and his {{campaign}} team emerged. In one, Woolas' agent, Joe Fitzpatrick, emailed Woolas and campaign adviser Steven Green, to say: [...] "Things are not going as well as I had hoped... we need to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> first attack leaflet." [...] A reply from Fitzpatrick said: [...] "If we don't get the white vote angry he's gone." [...] Some have criticised these tactics in light of significant existing racial tensions in the area. The court hearing finished on 17 September 2010, with the judges reserving their judgement until 5 November 2010. On that day Woolas {{was found to have}} breached section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 in relation to three of the four statements complained about, and the judges ruled that his election was void. Phil Woolas applied for a judicial review into the ruling, stating that [...] "this election petition raised fundamental issues about the freedom to question and criticise politicians." [...] and that it [...] "will inevitably chill political speech". He succeeded in overturning the finding in respect of one of the three statements but the main findings of the election court judgment were upheld. A by-election on 13 January 2011 resulted in the election of Debbie Abrahams (Labour).|$|E

That is not faith, my friends, to see God only in what is strange and rare: but this is faith, to see God in what is most common and simple; to know God's greatness not so much from disorder, as from order; not so much from those strange sights in which God seems (but only seems) to break his laws, as from those common ones in which he fulfils his laws.|$|E
