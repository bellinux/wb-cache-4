Half the field was running <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the track while the other half was running the high line. The field largely rode around until the second caution of the race flew on lap 85. It was a planned competition caution. Brian Scott opted not to pit under the caution and assumed the lead. Kyle Larson and Ricky Stenhouse Jr. were both tagged for speeding on pit road and restarted the race from {{the tail end of}} the field.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} walls to a squash court. The front wall, on which three {{parallel}} lines are marked, {{has the largest}} playing surface, whilst the back wall, which typically contains {{the entrance to the}} court, has the smallest. The out line runs {{along the top of the}} front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball is out. In this way the tin can be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The middle line of the front wall is the service line and is only relevant during serves.|$|E
2500|$|The voice flute was {{a popular}} size of {{recorder}} in the eighteenth century, especially in England. It offered an alternative instrument for amateurs to play music written for the transverse flute, since both instruments are at the same pitch. The usual clef used for recorder parts was the French violin clef, with G on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the staff. Imagining this clef {{in place of the}} treble clef and using the normal F-alto fingerings on a voice flute renders music composed for flute or violin in the original key [...] Although the rather large number of surviving eighteenth-century voice flutes suggests this may have been a common practice at that time, there is little documentary evidence to support the idea ( [...] ; [...] ). Parts intended for this instrument were also often written in transposed notation, so the player could imagine he was playing an ordinary alto in F ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E

Actor Bee Vang said [...] "Hmong around the country were furious about its negative stereotypes and cultural distortions" [...] and that they confronted him when he spoke at events. Vang added that he engaged in [...] "explaining my obligation as an actor while also recognizing that, as a Hmong-American, I didn't feel that I could own the lines I was uttering." [...] Brauer said that in an opinion editorial released in 2011, Vang [...] "isn't kind to the Clint Eastwood film". Krissy Reyes-Ortiz of <b>The</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> the University of California Santa Barbara said, based on Vang's testimony in a 2011 program, that [...] "Though {{many of the people}} who have seen the film may have gotten a sense of satisfaction and joy from seeing that Walt overcame his racism, the people who acted as the Hmong members in the movie did not" [...] and that [...] "They were offended by the traces of racism that were included in the movie and that they experienced themselves on set".

6000|$|The {{fractions}} (1) and (2) {{being both}} greater than (3), {{it follows that}} the relationships between the two thumbs, or between the two fore-fingers, are closer than that between the thumb and either fore-finger; {{at the same time it}} is clear that neither of the two former relationships is so close as to reach identity. Similarly as regards the other couplets of digits. The tabular entries fully confirm this deduction, for, without going now into further details, it will be seen from the [...] "Mean of the Totals" [...] at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Table VIb that the average percentage of cases in which two different digits have the same class of patterns, whether they be on the same or on opposite hands, is 59 or 57 (say 58), while the average percentage of cases in which right and left digits bearing the same name have the same class of pattern (Table VIa) is 72. This is barely two-thirds of the 100 which would imply identity. At the same time, the 72 considerably exceeds the 58.|$|E

Considering the tradition accounting value of conservatism and the firm size, the price and return models are operationalized using a sample of the most actively traded companies on the Egyptian Stock Market in the period from 2007 - 2009. Three important conclusions captured from the results; first, <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial statements are value relevant and the accrual components are upper handed over the cash flow in estimating the market value of those firms. Second, conservatism practices is still alive in the Egyptian context; however, it does not prevent the accounting information from being value relevant. Third, the promulgation of the new version of EASs shifts the value relevance towards book value over the other accounting information. These results should be interpreted {{in the light of the}} rapid shift towards capitalism and the deregulation program followed by the Egyptian government in the recent years. Also, these results might possibly be attributed to a significant improvement in the familiarity of the preparers of accounting information with the new accounting practices and the needs of financial reporting users in Egypt. As such, this study contributes to the existing literature by investigating and operationalizing the value relevance of accounting information in an emerging market such as Egypt after the introduction of the new version of EASs of 2006...|$|R
