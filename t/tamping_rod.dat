5000|$|In 1784, Félix Vicq-d'Azyr, {{discovered}} a black colored {{structure in the}} midbrain. In 1791 Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring alluded to this structure, calling it the substantia nigra. [...] In the same year, Luigi Galvani described the role of electricity in nerves of dissected frogs. In 1808, Franz Joseph Gall studied and published work on phrenology. Phrenology was the faulty science of looking at head shape to determine different aspects of personality and brain function. In 1811, [...] studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the medulla oblongata. In the same year, Charles Bell finished work on what would later {{become known as the}} Bell-Magendie law, which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the spinal cord. In 1822, Karl Friedrich Burdach distinguished between the lateral and medial geniculate bodies, as well as named the cingulate gyrus. In 1824, F. Magendie studied and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum’s role in equilibration to complete the Bell-Magendie law. In 1838, Theodor Schwann began studying white and grey matter in the brain, and discovered the myelin sheath. These cells, which cover the axons of the neurons in the brain, are named Schwann cells after him. In 1848, Phineas Gage, the classical neurophysiology patient, had his brain pierced by an iron <b>tamping</b> <b>rod</b> in a blasting accident. He became an excellent case study in the connection between the prefrontal cortex and behavior, decision making and consequences. In 1849, Hermann von Helmholtz studied the speed of frog nerve impulses while studying electricity in the body.|$|E

30|$|When {{the fresh}} {{pervious}} concrete was moulded, both the tamping and vibrating methods {{were used in}} the study. The <b>tamping</b> <b>rod</b> was utilized to tamp the fresh pervious concrete for 3 times in the procedure when the material reached 1 / 3, 2 / 3 and all of the mould volume. Then the mould was put onto the vibrating table for 5  s of vibration, after which the surface was carefully smoothed by a steel disc. When the moulding process was finished, all the specimens were immediately coated with a plastic membrane which had been brushed with oil to minimize the influence of water evaporation on cement hydration and strength growth. Demoulding started as soon as the specimens were cured in the curing room for 24  h, and then the specimens were cured by the method of sprinkling water until the 28  days age was reached.|$|E

30|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out on the test specimens to study the strength properties as a result of replacing fine aggregate by WS and FS in various percentages namely 5 %, 10 %, and 15 %. The test specimens were cast in steel molds. The inside of the mold was applied with oil to facilitate the easy removal of specimens. The raw materials were weighed accurately. The concrete was mixed thoroughly in dry condition. Initially, 75 % of water was added to the dry mix, and they were mixed thoroughly. Then the remaining 25 % of water was added to the mix. The mixing was continued until a uniform color was obtained. Fresh concrete was placed in the mold in three layers, and each layer was compacted using <b>tamping</b> <b>rod.</b> Then, the mold were placed in vibrator and compacted. The concrete specimen cast is a 150 × 150 × 150 -mm cube. After 24 h from casting, the test specimens were taken out and placed in a curing tank, until the age of the specimens. The prepared specimens were analyzed for workability and compressive strength as per IS standards.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the shear strength parameters of the pond ash samples consolidated undrained triaxial shear test were carried out as per the procedure given in IS: 2720 -Part 12 [7]. Here, moist tamping technique has been employed for the preparation of 50  mm diameter and 100  mm height pond ash samples at relative density of 50 and 65  %. Selection of quantity of water for a particular density has been chosen based on the ability of the sample to stand by itself. Each sample was prepared in three layers by compacting with <b>tamping</b> <b>rod</b> (nearly 48  mm diameter) and giving fixed number of blows to each layer. Then filter paper and porous stone was placed on top and bottom of the sample. After this rubber membrane was pulled over the sample and the assembly was sealed with o-ring. Then saturation process was continued until the B (Pore Pressure Parameter B, B = Δu/Δσc, Δu = change in pore pressure, and Δσc = change in confining pressure) value reached beyond 0.98. After that consolidation process was carried out to a desired effective confining pressure and the change in volume was recorded. Finally, shearing was done under confining pressure of 100, 200 and 300  kPa.|$|E
