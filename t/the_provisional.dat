5|$|Bowling Green, Kentucky, was {{designated}} the Confederate capital of Kentucky at a convention in nearby Russellville. Due {{to the military}} situation in the state, <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> government was exiled and traveled with the Army of Tennessee {{for most of its}} existence. For a short time in the autumn of 1862, the Confederate Army controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General Braxton Bragg attempted to install <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> government as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General Don Carlos Buell ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> government from the state for the final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper and was dissolved {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Lovejoy {{was elected}} in 1848 to {{what would be the}} final session of <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Legislature, which was held in late 1848 into early 1849. However, Lovejoy now {{representing}} Vancouver District north of the Columbia River resigned before the session started. In September 1848, he traveled with a group to California during the California Gold Rush, but returned aboard the brig Undine in January 1849 after six weeks in California. During the same session he resigned from, he was selected by <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Legislature as Supreme Judge of the government on February 16, 1849, but never served and <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> government was dissolved the following month {{with the arrival of the}} territorial government.|$|E
5|$|South Korea {{joined the}} UNESCO World Heritage program on 14 June 1950. There are nine {{cultural}} and one natural world heritage sites in South Korea as of 2013, with 15 additional items on <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> list. World heritage sites include the Pulguksa temple complex and the Changdeokgung palace, and <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> list includes sites like the ancient mountain fortresses in Central Korea.|$|E
5000|$|Both the Officials and <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals</b> {{also saw}} <b>the</b> Easter Lily {{as a symbol}} of remembrance for their members who died on [...] "active service". With the decline in the Official IRA, the Easter Lily became more and more {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mekeel was {{involved}} in the study and authentication of the 1895 discovery of St. Louis Postmaster <b>Provisionals,</b> which verified <b>the</b> plating of <b>the</b> <b>provisionals</b> and <b>the</b> authenticity of the 20 cent value. Based on his study of <b>the</b> <b>provisionals,</b> Mekeel wrote <b>The</b> History of the Postage Stamps of the St. Louis Postmaster, 1845-1847 in 1895.|$|R
5000|$|The rarest of <b>the</b> <b>provisionals,</b> {{known in}} {{but a single}} copy, are those of Boscawen and Lockport. Unique as well is the Alexandria [...] "Blue Boy" [...] variant, the only {{surviving}} example printed on blue paper. According to census data supplied by Siegel Auctions, only six additional copies of <b>the</b> Alexandria <b>Provisional</b> are known, all on buff-colored paper. Notably rare as well are <b>the</b> <b>provisionals</b> of Annapolis (2 copies extant), New Haven (11 copies) and Millbury (19 copies). Baltimore 10¢ labels are also scarce (7 copies). Five hundred copies of the Brattleboro issue were produced, but only 52 are known. Providence printed at least 5,500 5¢ stamps and 500 10¢ stamps. The first two printings of <b>the</b> St. Louis <b>provisional</b> produced 2,000 5¢ stamps, 3,000 10¢ stamps and 1,000 20¢ stamps; the final printing probably added 1,500 5¢ stamps and 1,500 10¢ stamps, making {{a grand total of}} 9,000 <b>provisionals</b> produced. Among <b>the</b> eleven <b>provisionals,</b> <b>the</b> New York issue was produced in the largest quantity by far, with 143,600 stamps delivered to the New York Post Office.|$|R
5|$|The delegates {{representing}} <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> government {{departed for}} Ottawa in March. Although they initially met with legal difficulties {{arising from the}} execution of Scott, they soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier. An agreement enshrining the demands {{in the list of}} rights was quickly reached, and this formed the basis for the Manitoba Act of 12 May 1870, which formally admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation. However, the negotiators could not secure a general amnesty for <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> government.|$|E
5|$|As {{chief of}} general staff of <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Army of Germany, and later major general (after 1811) he was {{appointed}} 13 March 1812 as director-general of military conscription, a position which he held until the peace of 1814.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Curtis Piʻehu Iʻaukea (December 13, 1855 – March 5, 1940) {{served as}} a court official, army officer and diplomat of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. He later became an {{influential}} official for the subsequent regimes of <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Government and the Republic and Territory of Hawaii.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{formally}} on ceasefire (except for [...] "defensive actions") since 1972, the Official IRA continued some {{attacks on}} British forces up until mid-1973, killing seven British soldiers {{in what it}} termed [...] "retaliatory attacks". In addition, the OIRA's weapons were used intermittently in the ongoing feud with <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals.</b> This flared up into violence on several occasions, notably in October 1975. 11 republicans on either side {{were killed in the}} feud and a nine-year-old girl was shot dead by <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals</b> when they tried to shoot her father.|$|R
25|$|Initially {{there was}} much {{confusion}} among republicans on the ground; Martin McGuinness for example, joined the Official IRA in 1970, unaware {{that there had been}} a split and only later joined <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Provisionals</b> eventually extended their armed campaign from defence of Catholic areas. Despite the reluctance of Cathal Goulding and the OIRA leadership, their volunteers on the ground were inevitably drawn into the violence. The Official IRA's first major confrontation with the British Army came in the Falls Curfew of July 1970, when over 3,000 British soldiers raided the Lower Falls area for arms, leading to three days of gun battles. The Official IRA lost a large amount of weaponry, and their members on the ground blamed <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals</b> for starting <b>the</b> firing and then leaving them alone to face the British. The bad feeling left by this and other incidents led to a feud between the two IRAs in 1970, with several shootings carried out by either side. The two IRA factions arranged a truce between them after the OIRA killing of Provisional activist, and Belfast brigade D-Company commander, Charlie Hughes (a cousin of <b>the</b> well-known <b>Provisional</b> Brendan Hughes).|$|R
25|$|A {{key factor}} in the split was the desire of those who became <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals</b> to make {{military}} action the key object of the organisation, rather than a simple rejection of leftism.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} {{progress on the}} political front, the Canadian party continued to plot against <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> government. However, they suffered a setback on 17 February, when forty-eight men, including Boulton and Thomas Scott, were arrested near Fort Garry.|$|E
5|$|Fearful {{of arrest}} as a rebel once {{he left the}} Senate, Benjamin quickly {{departed}} Washington for New Orleans. On the day of Benjamin's resignation, <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Confederate States Congress gathered in Montgomery, Alabama, and soon chose Davis as president. Davis {{was sworn in as}} provisional Confederate States President on February 18, 1861. At home in New Orleans for, it would prove, the last time, Benjamin addressed a rally on Washington's Birthday, February 22, 1861. On February 25, Davis appointed Benjamin, still in New Orleans, as attorney general; the Louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> Congress. Davis thus became the first chief executive in North America to appoint a Jew to his Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{nomination}} as Secretary of the Navy {{was submitted}} to <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Congress {{as soon as}} the act establishing a navy was passed. Despite his evident qualifications, it drew significant opposition; his detractors cited the Fort Pickens incident as evidence that he was not strongly pro-secession. Ultimately, however, he was confirmed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Latvian <b>Provisional</b> National Council was {{constituted}} on {{the basis}} of the law of self-government which <b>the</b> Russian <b>Provisional</b> Government granted to Latvia on 5 July 1917. <b>The</b> Latvian <b>Provisional</b> National Council first met on 16 November 1917 in Valka. On 30 November 1917, the Council declared an autonomous Latvian province within ethnographic boundaries, and a formal independent Latvian republic was declared on 15 January 1918.|$|R
50|$|Greaves became {{associated}} with Roy Johnston, a Dublin-born {{member of the}} Irish Workers' Party who had migrated to England. They and their theories came to have an influence over 1960s Irish republicanism through Cathal Goulding and Tomás Mac Giolla, who also adhered to a Marxist perspective. During the split within the Irish republican movement in 1969, Greaves' Connolly Association supported Official Sinn Féin (later known as the Workers' Party) and the Official Irish Republican Army, rather than <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals.</b> This was done under the rationale of anti-sectarianism, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals</b> were representative of just the Catholic nationalist community.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> early <b>provisional</b> {{governments were}} created {{to prepare for the}} return of royal rule. Irregularly convened {{assemblies}} during the English Revolution, such as Confederate Ireland (1641-49), were described as [...] "provisional". The practice of using [...] "provisional government" [...] as part of a formal name can be traced to Talleyrand's government in France in 1814. <b>The</b> numerous <b>provisional</b> governments during <b>the</b> Revolutions of 1848 gave the word its modern meaning: A liberal government established to prepare for elections. <b>The</b> most notable <b>provisional</b> government was <b>the</b> Russian <b>Provisional</b> Government in 1917 ...|$|R
5|$|On 18 September 1944, <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> {{government}} {{formed by}} the National Committee of the Republic of Estonia in Tallinn re-declared the independence of Estonia. Estonian military units clashed with German troops in Tallinn, seizing the state offices at Toompea. The government appealed to the Soviet Union to recognize {{the independence of the}} republic.|$|E
5|$|On 9May1988, {{a larger}} and {{permanent}} Parliament House was opened on Capital Hill as part of Australia's bicentenary celebrations, and the Commonwealth Parliament moved there from <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Parliament House, now known as Old Parliament House.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, the General Council called new {{elections}} to choose delegates {{to determine the}} fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12.|$|E
5000|$|During <b>the</b> Russian <b>Provisional</b> Government in 1917, the {{official}} {{title of the}} prime minister was [...] "Minister-Chairman of <b>the</b> Russian <b>Provisional</b> Government". This position was held by only two people, Georgy Lvov and Alexander Kerensky.|$|R
50|$|He died on August 9, 1970 {{the year}} after the IRA split, in which he sided with <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals.</b> He was {{one of the leaders of}} the 1969 split, being {{critical}} of the leadership of the time.|$|R
40|$|The {{maladministration}} of <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority in its duty, {{with respect}} to its failure {{to take steps to}} prevent financial criminal activities, led to the generation of illegal funds in occupied Iraq. This maladministration, and consideration of possible methods for depriving criminals of those funds and recovering them for the Iraqi State, remains largely unexplored by the literature. This thesis addresses this gap by first, establishing the maladministration of <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority to meet its obligations as an occupying administration, and second, proposes mechanisms {{to deal with the problem}} and recovery of corruptly obtained funds during <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority’s tenure. It is argued that <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority did not take proper and feasible measures in order to prevent financial criminal activities. This maladministration led to the widespread propensity in criminal activities that generated vast amounts of illicit money in occupied Iraq. This thesis has two Parts. Part One explores the problem of the maladministration of <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority of its duty to prevent financial criminal activities (that generated substantial amounts of illicit funds). It examines the state of military occupation of Iraq, and the duty upon the occupant to create <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority. It demonstrates that there was a duty on <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority to take affirmative steps to prevent financial criminal activities. It considers certain types of financial criminal activities that generated illegal funds, and shows how <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority failed to prevent those activities. In light of the huge amounts of illegal funds generated, Part Two offers solutions for their recovery by examining the feasibility of the criminal forfeiture of corruptly obtained funds generated in Iraq territory and found in US territory; and by showing that civil action is the best alternative mechanism for recovering Iraqi funds that disappeared as a result of corrupt activities during <b>the</b> Coalition <b>Provisional</b> Authority’s tenure...|$|R
5|$|On March 16, 1861, soon {{before the}} American Civil War broke out, a {{convention}} in Mesilla voted that <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> territory should secede from the Union {{and join the}} Confederate States of America. Lewis Owings remained as territorial governor.|$|E
5|$|Press {{comment was}} less critical; nevertheless, after one more {{performance}} the opera was withdrawn. Shortly afterwards <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Theatre temporarily closed its doors, as {{the threat of}} war drew closer to Prague.|$|E

5000|$|The IRA signed all its {{statements}} 'J.J. McGarrity' {{up until}} 1969 when the organisation split into the 'Official' and 'Provisional' movements.

5000|$|According to Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, it was Mac Stíofáin, {{as chief}} of staff of <b>the</b> <b>Provisionals,</b> who invented <b>the</b> name [...] "P. Ó Néill". P. O'Neill is the name {{appended}} to IRA declarations to show that the statement is genuine.|$|R
5|$|The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain {{specifies}} that 2.5 μg/kg {{body weight}} is a {{tolerable weekly intake}} for humans. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has declared 7 μg/kg bw to be <b>the</b> <b>provisional</b> tolerable weekly intake level.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Provisional</b> Government also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed. This Supreme Court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original jurisdictional matters when the amount in controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Provisional</b> Legislature of Oregon was the single-chamber {{legislative}} body of <b>the</b> <b>Provisional</b> Government of Oregon. It served the Oregon Country of the Pacific Northwest of North America from 1843 until early 1849 {{at a time}} when no country had sovereignty over the region. This democratically elected legislature became the Oregon Territorial Legislature when the territorial authorities arrived after the creation of the Oregon Territory by the United States in 1848. The body was first termed the Legislative Committee and later renamed the House of Representatives. Over the course of its six-year history the legislature passed laws, including taxation and liquor regulation, and created an army to deal with conflicts with Native Americans.|$|E
