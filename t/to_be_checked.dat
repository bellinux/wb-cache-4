5|$|During the trial, {{evidence}} was presented that Wang often had trouble staying awake during AWACS missions. In fact, {{the problem was}} considered serious enough that the military had referred Wang to medical authorities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>checked</b> for narcolepsy. Wang had also previously failed two check rides.|$|E
5|$|Most {{countries}} require diving cylinders <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>checked</b> on {{a regular}} basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test. The inspection and testing requirements for scuba cylinders may {{be very different from}} the requirements for other compressed gas containers due to the more corrosive environment.|$|E
5|$|The 1975–76 {{season was}} Orr's final {{season with the}} Bruins and it was tumultuous. Orr's {{contract}} was ending after the season, potentially making him a free agent. The Bruins were sold by Storer Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr {{as a condition of}} the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over. The agreement was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>checked</b> out as to whether it would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league would approve it.|$|E

5|$|In September 1966, Olds {{was tapped}} to command an F-4C Phantom wing in Southeast Asia. En route he {{arranged}} with the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, (where Col. James was now Deputy Commander of Operations) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>checked</b> {{out in the}} Phantom, completing the 14-step syllabus in just five days. His instructor was Major William L. Kirk, the 4453rd CCTW's Standardization and Evaluation officer, who {{had been one of}} Olds' pilots at RAF Bentwaters, and who later commanded the United States Air Forces Europe as a full general. Kirk accompanied Olds for practice firing of AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles on the Point Mugu missile range while Olds was en route to Travis Air Force Base for his charter flight overseas. Olds rewarded Kirk by granting him a transfer to his command in Thailand in March 1967.|$|E
5|$|The French were infuriated at King Leopold III's open {{declaration}} of neutrality in October 1936. The French Army saw its strategic assumptions undermined; it could no longer expect closer cooperation with the Belgians in defending the latter's eastern borders, enabling a German attack <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>checked</b> well forward of the French border. The French were dependent on how much cooperation they could extract from the Belgians. Such a situation deprived the French any prepared defences in Belgium to forestall an attack, a situation which the French had wanted to avoid as it meant engaging the German Panzer Divisions in a mobile battle. The French considered invading Belgium immediately {{in response to a}} German attack on the country. The Belgians, recognising the danger posed by the Germans, secretly made their own defence policies, troop movement information, communications, fixed defence dispositions, intelligence and air reconnaissance arrangements available to the French military attaché in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>checked</b> prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the overall}} population, a slight {{majority}} of melanomas do not form in an existing mole, but rather create a new growth on the skin. Somewhat surprisingly, this also applies to those with dysplastic nevi. They are at {{a higher risk of}} melanoma occurring not only where there is an existing mole, but also where there are none. Such persons need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>checked</b> regularly for any changes in their moles and to note any new ones.|$|E
25|$|Most simply, given {{a list of}} polyominoes {{of order}} n, squares may be added next to each polyomino in each {{possible}} position, and the resulting polyomino of order n+1 {{added to the list}} if not a duplicate of one already found; refinements in ordering the enumeration and marking adjacent squares that should not be considered reduce the number of cases that need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>checked</b> for duplicates. This method may be used to enumerate either free or fixed polyominoes.|$|E
