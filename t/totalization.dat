40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} postmodern American novels by Ishmael Reed (Mumbo Jumbo), Kathy Acker (The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec by Henri Toulouse Lautrec), and Don DeLillo (White Noise) exemplify postmodern theory 2 ̆ 7 s refiguring of authorship, text, and reader, while also embodying the modernist ethical, political and historical tenets—including ideological critique—much postmodern theory rejects. Much postmodernism {{is informed by}} French poststructuralism, which uses concepts like discourse, discursivity, difference, and intertextuality to undermine unitary authorship, the singular text, and the unified autonomous subject. Such postmodernism rejects all grand narratives and <b>totalizations,</b> as well as truth statements normally associated with modernism and modernity. Ethical, political, or historical claims therefore have no grounding because all such claims are themselves totalizing and comprehensive. The dissertation begins by examining Mumbo Jumbo 2 ̆ 7 s refiguring of authorship and African-American identity via Haitian voodoo, which strongly resembles postmodern theory 2 ̆ 7 s dissolution of unitary authorship and identity. However, Reed 2 ̆ 7 s refiguring is characteristically modernist; representing a sustained ethical, political, and historical critique of dominant white western culture 2 ̆ 7 s definitions of these concepts. Acker idiosyncratically uses postmodern theories to critique <b>totalizations,</b> including the unitary text, {{as well as the}} reified and coherent self. Employing the detective genre, which fetishizes reason and causation via strong hermeneutic and proaretic codes, Acker uses intertextuality to reveal that behind unified self, text, and genre, stands a pervasive phallogocentrism, which is also the at the heart of capitalism 2 ̆ 7 s oppression of both women and the poor. Using the frame of the college mystery novel genre, DeLillo 2 ̆ 7 s White Noise offers a sustained critique of contemporary consumer culture and subject 2 ̆ 7 s place within it, while also addressing associated issues, such as the university 2 ̆ 7 s complicity with capitalism, as everything-including the university 2 ̆ 7 s subject matter and enlightenment mission-becomes commodified and part of society 2 ̆ 7 s general crisis of legitimation. The critique speaks to many readers because the novel appeals both to individuals who desire coherent, closed narratives, as well as those readers seeking experimental literature. The dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s closing specifically addresses problems with categorizing the novels as postmodern, addressing Reed 2 ̆ 7 s relation to African-American literary tradition, Acker 2 ̆ 7 s problematic usage of postructuralism, and DeLillo modernist ethical-political appeal. ...|$|R

40|$|Emmanuel Levinas’s Totality and Infinity (1961) is {{explicitly}} con-cerned with {{the suppression of}} the voice of the Other by the synoptic <b>totalizations</b> of the voice of western philosophy. Levinas contests this emergence of Being and the systems of totality it indicates with the irruption of the face of the other, which signifies through contact and sensibility the presence of infinity within the human situation. Derrida’s reading of this fundamental testing of western ontology rests on the accusation that western philosophy already has a term for this: empiricism. That is, Derrida exposes an alien voice within Levinas’s exposure of the voice alienated from ontological formulations. In the later Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence (1974) Levinas implic-itly recognizes the truth of Derrida’s demonstration of a residual con-ceptualism, and shifts from the thematization of infinite exteriority given by the Other, alterity and the face-to-face relation, to the search for a signifyingness that will breach the noema’s identificational closure, that is, to the direct and exposed gesture of saying. Both the limit terms of Totality and Infinity and the response they produced in Derrida have become the starting-point of Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence: the testimony that is irreducible to a thematizing knowledge. What saves this saying from becoming in its turn another theme is that, in addition to its acting in the text, it acts upon and a...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} aesthetics and ethics {{of attempts to}} formalize and coordinate modern-i. e., disenchanted, antagonistic, contingent-understandings {{of the self and}} the social, the sexual and the political. In Part One, "Coordinating Private and Public Contingencies," I delineate an intellectual genealogy of attempts by cultural and social theorists to account for a modern recognition of the self and society as both riven by innate internal antagonisms and both subject to anarchic contingencies in development. I focus on Marx's and Baudelaire's resonant reflections on the popular failure of the 1848 revolution in France, and sketch an ensuing aesthetic-theoretical tradition of reading literary forms as cognate with and offering insights into the ideological <b>totalizations</b> of social and political forms. In Part Two, "The Resistance to Contingency," I critique the content and critical reception of Walter Benjamin's highly influential dismissals, on supposedly progressive political grounds, of Baudelaire's aesthetic and ethical insights, grounding my analysis in a comparative reading of Benjamin's transcendental historical schemas in his political work against Baudelaire's decidedly immanent ones in his lyrics. In Part Three, "Contingency and/as Liberty," I explore this congruence of political and literary aesthetics further in an analysis of three George Orwell novels. I develop an argument about how the critical reception of these novels has not consistently considered their narrative structures' insinuation that conceptualizations and formalizations of the domestic decisively condition and constrain those of the political. In the conclusion, "Modernity, not 'Modernism,'" I offer an argument about the need to think of a literary "modernity" more capacious than the conventional confines of literary "modernism" by juxtaposing the "high modernist" Virginia Woolf's Three Guineas with a text of the Weimar-era legal theorist Carl Schmitt. I bring out their shared recognition of innate interpersonal antagonisms and their shared concern for the unprogrammable contingencies of political developments, but note their strikingly contrasting accounts of responsible decision-making given such awareness. Against Schmitt's aporetic distinction of an organic community of friends, I expound Woolf's more trenchant ethical vision of political community, one grounded in her less idealistic vision of domestic politics...|$|R

Many of the essays in this volume attempt to undercut figural <b>totalization,</b> the notion that one can control or dominate a discourse or phenomenon through metaphor. In de Man's discussion of Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, for instance, he claims that [...] "genetic" [...] conceptions of history appearing in the text are undercut by the rhetorical strategies Nietzsche employs: [...] "the deconstruction does not occur between statements, as in a logical refutation or a dialectic, but happens instead between, on the one hand, metalinguistic statements about the rhetorical nature of language and, on the other hand, a rhetorical praxis that puts these statements into question." [...] For de Man, an [...] "Allegory of Reading" [...] emerges when texts are subjected to such scrutiny and reveal this tension; a reading wherein the text reveals its own assumptions about language, {{and in so doing}} dictates a statement about undecidability, the difficulties inherent in <b>totalization,</b> their own readability, or the [...] "limitations of textual authority." ...|$|E

US TN status workers in Canada are also subject to corresponding income tax liabilities and end-of-year filing of returns in Canada. In general, there will be income tax liabilities in accordance to where the employee works regardless of where legal or physical residence is maintained during employment. This is much like US citizens who live in one state but work in another who are then subject to state income and other taxes {{in the state in}} which they work. If their legal residence is still in their home country, workers may also be required to file a return in their home country. Based on income tax treaties, credit is normally available in the home country for income and other payroll taxes paid in the foreign country. Bilateral treaties exist to allow workers to regain benefits. For example, after a minimum of 1.5 years of work in the US, workers become eligible for a pro-rata Social Security benefit under what is known in the US as a <b>Totalization</b> agreement. After more than 10 years of work in the US, the regular Social Security benefit calculation minus the Windfall Elimination Provision will be applied. Therefore, the worker may receive 3 cheques, one each from the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security and US Social Security.|$|E

Robert J. {{was a bit of}} a showboat and made gambling fun to the public. After his death, his son, Robert Y. Dienst who was conservative, took over and rebuilt the track, especially the backside when a fire broke out circa 1959. He poured the profits right back into the track, making it a showplace, not just for the general public but for the horsemen. Around 1959, an all wood barn with 40 horses perished in a night time blaze. Because of this Robert Y. Dienst built almost all concrete block with tin roof barns from then on—having a full- time construction crew just for that purpose. Horsemen and Horsewomen appreciated the care that was taken towards their horses. Robert Y. was a true horseman and loved the sport just for the sport's sake. He had a small stable, River Divide Farm, of about a dozen horses that he raced with the guidance of Trainer & Starter Don Rose up until his death on Nov. 7, 1996 (when Robert Y. was hours shy of his 80th birthday). Robert Y. Dienst's son, [...] "Bob M."
