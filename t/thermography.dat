5|$|The winds on Saturn are {{the second}} fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. Voyager data {{indicate}} peak easterly winds of 500m/s (1800km/h). In {{images from the}} Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering. <b>Thermography</b> has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known {{example of such a}} phenomenon in the Solar System. Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185°C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as −122°C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish Raynaud's disease (primary Raynaud's) from phenomenon (secondary Raynaud's). Looking for signs of arthritis or vasculitis {{as well as a}} number of laboratory tests may separate them. If suspected to be secondary to systemic sclerosis, one tool which may help aid in the prediction of systemic sclerosis is <b>thermography.</b>|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} test {{is available}} for CRPS, which is diagnosed primarily through observation of the symptoms. However, <b>thermography,</b> sweat testing, x-rays, electrodiagnostics, and sympathetic blocks {{can be used to}} build up a picture of the disorder. Diagnosis is {{complicated by the fact that}} some patients improve without treatment. A delay in diagnosis and/or treatment for this syndrome can result in severe physical and psychological problems. Early recognition and prompt treatment provide the greatest opportunity for recovery.|$|E
25|$|The McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle is a two-seat, dual-role, totally {{integrated}} fighter for all-weather, air-to-air {{and deep}} interdiction missions. The rear cockpit is upgraded to include four multi-purpose {{cathode ray tube}} displays for aircraft systems and weapons management. The digital, triple-redundant Lear Siegler aircraft flight control system permits coupled automatic terrain following, enhanced by a ring-laser gyro inertial navigation system. For low-altitude, high-speed penetration and precision attack on tactical targets at night or in adverse weather, the F-15E carries a high-resolution APG-70 radar and LANTIRN pods to provide <b>thermography.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{company is}} {{structured}} {{to focus on}} six specific business segments. The Surveillance group addresses high-end military and other governmental thermal imaging markets. The Instruments segment produces <b>thermography</b> cameras for building inspection, predictive maintenance, and R, as well as test and measurement tools. Development of OEM camera cores and components, new technologies, and new applications for existing technologies are served by the OEM & Emerging Markets group. Marine electronics including thermal cameras under both the FLIR and Raymarine brands fall under the Maritime segment. Thermal and visible light cameras for industrial, commercial, and residential security are serviced under the Lorex by FLIR brands by the Security segment. The Detection segment produces sensors for chemical, biological, radiation, and explosive detection.|$|E
25|$|Aerial {{survey is}} {{conducted}} using cameras attached to airplanes, balloons, UAVs, or even Kites. A bird's-eye view {{is useful for}} quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document {{the status of the}} archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. Plants growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as middens) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening grain, which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs ultraviolet, infrared, ground-penetrating radar wavelengths, LiDAR and <b>thermography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pro-authenticity {{journals}} {{have declared}} this hypothesis to be unsound, stating that X-ray fluorescence examination, {{as well as}} infrared <b>thermography,</b> did not reveal any pigment. It was also found that 25 different solvents, among them water, do not reduce or sponge out the image. The Shroud Center of Colorado argues that paint pigments came from painted copies that were overlaid by artists during the Middle Ages in order to validate them as accurate copies of the Shroud. The non-paint origin has been further examined by Fourier transform of the image: common paintings show a directionality that is absent from the Turin Shroud. However, analyzing fragments of the shroud brought to the US, McCrone and others observed the presence of pigments, of types commonly used in medieval paints, on the shroud.|$|E
500|$|The Celebration {{has often}} been criticized with {{allegations}} of soring of horses at the event, an abusive practice designed to make horses step higher and illegal under federal law by the Horse Protection Act of 1970. The sponsors of the Celebration have consistently denied the allegations. Every horse entered in the Celebration must undergo an inspection designed to detect sored horses conducted by an APHIS-employed inspector before the horse is allowed to show. Inspectors may use hoof testers (plier-like tools which direct pressure on {{an area of the}} foot to find any source of pain), leg swabs and other tools such as <b>thermography</b> to detect signs of horses being sored. In 2006, the concerns escalated between trainers and inspectors from APHIS. [...] Initially, trainers refused to submit their horses for inspection, creating a stand-off that required law enforcement intervention. Then, prior to the World Grand Championship finals, inspectors disqualified all but three of the finalists. [...] A group of approximately 150 people gathered, demanding that the disqualified horses be allowed to show. However, citing safety concerns, the show management cancelled the class altogether and no World Grand Champion was crowned that year.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{discipline}} {{and in its}} widest sense, {{it is part of}} biological imaging and incorporates radiology which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, [...] medical ultrasonography or ultrasound, endoscopy, elastography, tactile imaging, <b>thermography,</b> medical photography and nuclear medicine functional imaging techniques as positron emission tomography (PET) and Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).|$|E
2500|$|Thoughtography, {{also called}} {{projected}} <b>thermography,</b> psychic photography, nengraphy or nensha , is the claimed ability to [...] "burn" [...] images from one's mind onto surfaces such as photographic film by psychic means. While the term [...] "thoughtography" [...] {{has been in}} the English lexicon since 1913, the more recent term [...] "projected thermography" [...] is a neologism that originated from the 2002 U.S. film The Ring, a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror film Ring.|$|E
2500|$|Presently, {{established}} {{empirical evidence}} suggests against thermography's efficacy as a reliable tool for diagnosing CRPS. Although CRPS may, in some cases, lead to measurably altered blood flow throughout an affected region, many other factors can {{also contribute to}} an altered thermographic reading, including the patient's smoking habits, use of certain skin lotions, recent physical activity, and prior history of trauma to the region. Also, not all patients diagnosed with CRPS demonstrate such [...] "vasomotor instability" [...] — less often, still, those in the later stages of the disease. Thus, <b>thermography</b> alone cannot be used as conclusive evidence for - or against - a diagnosis of CRPS and must be interpreted {{in light of the}} patient's larger medical history and prior diagnostic studies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of the solid saddle tree was significant; it raised the rider above the horse's back, and distributed the rider's weight {{on either side of}} the animal's spine instead of pinpointing pressure at the rider's seat bones, reducing the pressure (force per unit area) on any one part of the horse's back, thus greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life. The invention of the solid saddle tree also allowed {{development of}} the true stirrup as it is known today. [...] Without a solid tree, the rider's weight in the stirrups creates abnormal pressure points and makes the horse's back sore. <b>Thermography</b> studies on [...] "treeless" [...] and flexible tree saddle designs have found that there is considerable friction across the center line of a horse's back.|$|E

A coin of Quintus Labienus, who was in service of Parthia, minted circa 39 BC depicts on its reverse a saddled horse with hanging objects. Smith suggests they are pendant cloths, while Thayer suggests that, considering the fact that the Parthians were famous for their mounted archery, the objects are stirrups, but adds {{that it is difficult to}} imagine why the Romans would never have adopted the technology.|$|E
2500|$|Medical imaging is the {{generating}} {{of visual}} {{representations of the}} interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. Medical imaging reveals details of internal physiology that help medical professionals plan appropriate treatments for tissue infection and trauma. [...] Medical imaging is also central in supplying the biometric data necessary to establish baseline features of anatomy and physiology so as to increase the accuracy with which early or fine-detail abnormalities are detected. [...] These diagnostic techniques are often performed in combination with general pathology procedures and are themselves often essential to developing new understanding of the pathogenesis of a given disease and tracking the progress of disease in specific medical cases. [...] Examples of important subdivisions in medical imaging include radiology (which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray radiography) magnetic resonance imaging, [...] medical ultrasonography (or ultrasound), endoscopy, elastography, tactile imaging, <b>thermography,</b> medical photography, nuclear medicine and functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography. [...] Though they do not strictly relay images, readings from diagnostics tests involving electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and electrocardiography often give hints as to the state and function of certain tissues in the brain and heart respectively.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} other terms widely used all {{referring}} to infrared <b>thermography,</b> the adoption of one or other term depends on the author’s background and preferences. For instance, video <b>thermography</b> and thermal imaging {{draw attention to the}} fact that a sequence of images is acquired and is possible to see it as a movie. Pulse-echo <b>thermography</b> and thermal wave imaging are adopted to emphasize the wave nature of heat.

The FDA has issued a public warning notice stating that breast <b>thermography</b> is not an alternative to mammography and has ordered Joseph Mercola to stop making excessive claims for <b>thermography.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Transient <b>thermography</b> (step <b>thermography,</b> thermal wave method). In principle, the {{excitation}} {{and evaluation}} {{are similar to}} the pulse <b>thermography,</b> however, the pulse length is much bigger. Less powerful excitation sources are required compared to the pulse <b>thermography.</b> It is therefore possible to analyze larger areas and the measurement time is shorter than in the case of Lock-In <b>thermography.</b> As in the pulse <b>thermography,</b> the sensitivity of the method is limited by the geometrical orientation of defects. Halogen lamps are the suitable excitation source for this type of evaluation.|$|E

50|$|Both the {{qualitative}} and quantitative approaches can be applied in terms of passive or active <b>thermography.</b> If the object temperature is not artificially affected during its measuring, {{it is called the}} passive <b>thermography.</b> If an artificial excitation using an external source is applied on the measured object, it is called active <b>thermography.</b> The external excitation causes temperature contrasts associated with material inhomogeneities or defects occurrence or it can be used for material properties identification. The active <b>thermography</b> is the important technique used for finding defects in materials, so called infrared non-destructive testing (IRNDT). Active <b>thermography</b> can be also applied for material thermal properties determination.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thermography</b> can be {{classified}} as qualitative or quantitative, and passive or active. Qualitative <b>thermography</b> usually does not require an accurate temperature measurement. It only evaluates temperature differences between particular components, between different spots on the same object or between the measured object and the background. Qualitative <b>thermography</b> has many important applications, for example a thermal leaks diagnostics, thermal components diagnostics, searching for persons or in medicine. In contrast, the goal of quantitative <b>thermography</b> is an accurate temperature measurement of inspected objects. Knowledge of thermo-optical properties of the measured objects is essential in this case. Moreover, the thermo-optical properties often depend on temperature {{and it is also}} necessary to take into account an influence of environment.|$|E
