5|$|Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, {{split into}} four {{geographic}} sections, known as <b>the</b> <b>Famous</b> Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. <b>The</b> <b>Famous</b> Five and South Stands are the oldest {{part of the}} present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep {{within the boundaries of}} the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the stands were built, <b>the</b> <b>Famous</b> Five Stand was above pitch level and the South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed. Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of <b>the</b> <b>Famous</b> Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before the stands were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it.|$|E
