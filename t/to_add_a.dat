5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E
5|$|From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni {{organised}} {{a series}} of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs.

A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall.

In the 2000s, another proposal resurfaced <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> PATCO line along the Route55 corridor. The alternative called for {{park and ride}} lots to be constructed along the Route55 corridor, providing access to the line.

Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E

5|$|In a 2007 report, ConnDOT {{outlined}} {{plans to}} turn SLE into a full-service bidirectional regional rail line, with full-day service and all trains extended to New London. This involves incremental improvements, {{similar to those}} that have already been put into place. One of the first priorities is <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> second platform at all stations, which is mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E

These {{were used in}} all subsequent Franciscan writing, and are occasionally seen even today. In 1605, Alonso Urbano doubled consonants for ejectives in Otomi (pp, tt, ttz, cc / cqu), and similar systems were adapted to Mayan. Another approach, in Yucatec, was <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> bar to the letter, or to double the stem.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, a {{real estate}} {{developer}} approached the Cacchios with an offer to purchase the theater. A 501(c) nonprofit organization was formed in March 2010 to preserve the building, which secured a $50,000 grant from PepsiCo to help take out a $385,000 mortgage. Since completing its purchase of the theater on August 19, 2010, the Rosendale Theatre Collective has added a digital projector, surround sound system, stage thrust, and retractable screen. The group plans <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> concession stand and move the ticket booth outside during warm months.
