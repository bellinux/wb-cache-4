The sixty-six lines of Stevens's [...] "Peter Quince at the Clavier" [...] are complex but reward a reader who actively participates in making sense of them.Peter Quince, the poem's persona, is the speaking voice and is an extremely unreliable narrator. He begins by addressing a woman in blue silk, whom he seems to be trying to seduce. His approach wanders off into telling his intended paramour the biblical story of Susanna, who is celebrated as a righteous and beautiful woman. Peter's version, however, portrays her as a lecher, no more chaste than the red-eyed elders who are lusting after her. As Peter concludes Susanna's story, his half-hearted seduction ends. Since this is a modernist poem it does not need to arrive at a narrative conclusion to the [...] "seduction." ...|$|E

One of Blau’s most memorable and significant contributions {{to the field of}} sociology came in 1967. Working together with Otis Dudley Duncan and Andrea Tyree, he co-authored The American Occupational Structure, which provided a meaningful sociological contribution to the study of social stratification, and won the highly touted Sorokin Award from the American Sociological Association in 1968. Blau is also known for his contributions to sociological theory.

Recent findings from the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) have documented increased teen birth rates, escalating births to unwed mothers, and STIs ascribed to one in four adolescent females, are reasons to enhance effective prevention efforts.

40|$|Objective: Sarcopenia, fatigue, and {{depression}} {{are associated with}} higher mortality rates and adverse outcomes in the aging population.

Method: We used cross-sectional data from 2012 SABE (Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento) -Bogotá study, which included 2, 000 participants of ages ≥ 60 years. Sarcopenia and its elements were taken as the dependent variable, while fatigue {{and depression}} were the main independent variables. We tested <b>the</b> <b>association</b> <b>among</b> these through multiple logistic regression models, which were fitted for each dependent variable and adjusted for confounding variables. Results: Our findings showed that gait speed was associated with fatigue (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1. 41, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = [1. 05, 1. 90], p =. 02) as well as abnormal handgrip strength (adjusted OR = 1. 40, 95 % CI = [1. 02, 1. 93], p =. 04). No other associations were significant. Conclusion: While sarcopenia and fatigue are not associated, two of the sarcopenia-defining variables are associated with fatigue; this suggests that lack of sarcopenia does not exclude undesirable outcomes related to fatigue in aging adults.

Socioeconomic differences in mean carotid IMT and odds ratios for carotid stenosis prevalence were estimated. In women, <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> <b>among</b> educational level, occupational status, and IMT were weak.

Women with low education had an increased odds of carotid stenosis compared with women with high education (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 04, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 53, 2. 73), while this pattern was weaker among men. Women in manual occupations had an increased odds of carotid stenosis compared with women in high- or medium-level nonmanual occupations (OR = 1. 75, 95 % CI: 1. 29, 2. 36), which could not be seen among men.

40|$|Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) {{and solar}} flares are {{energetic}} events {{taking place at}} the Sun that can affect the space weather or the near-Earth environment by the release of vast quantities of electromagnetic radiation and charged particles. Solar active regions are the areas where most flares and CMEs originate. Studying <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> <b>among</b> sunspot groups, flares, filaments, and CMEs is helpful in understanding the possible cause and effect relationships between these events and features. Forecasting space weather {{in a timely manner}} is important for protecting technological systems and human life on earth and in space. The research presented in this thesis introduces novel, fully computerised, machine learning-based decision rules and models that can be used within a system design for automated space weather forecasting. The system design in this work consists of three stages: (1) designing computer tools to find <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> <b>among</b> sunspot groups, flares, filaments, and CMEs (2) applying machine learning algorithms to the associations' datasets and (3) studying the evolution patterns of sunspot groups using time-series methods. Machine learning algorithms are used to provide computerised learning rules and models that enable the system to provide automated prediction of CMEs, flares, and evolution patterns of sunspot groups. These numerical rules are extracted from the characteristics, associations, and time-series analysis of the available historical solar data. The training of machine learning algorithms is based on data sets created by investigating <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> <b>among</b> sunspots, filaments, flares, and CMEs. Evolution patterns of sunspot areas and McIntosh classifications are analysed using a statistical machine learning method, namely the Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

Methods—In {{the second year of}} a longitudinal study, women completed questionnaires that included menopausal status and symptoms, participation in sexual activities, dyspareunia, marital status, and race. We used univariable and multivariable ordered logistic regression models to examine <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> <b>among</b> the frequency of sexual intercourse, vaginal dryness, use of lubrication during sex, and dyspareunia. Results—In multivariable analyses of the 363 sexually active women with complete data, women reporting more frequent dyspareunia, but not vaginal dryness, also reported less frequent intercourse.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> <b>among</b> self-absorption and two dysfunctional forms of negative self-evaluation (comparative self-criticism and internalized self-criticism), adaptive perfectionism (high standards and orderliness), and maladaptive perfectionism (discrepancy). The maladaptive equivalent of self-awareness is conceptualized as self-absorption by Ingram (1990). One hundred and seventy-four university students and graduates attending a teacher certificate program completed the Self-Absorption Scale (SAS, McKenzie and Hoyle, R. H., 2008), the Levels of Self-Criticism (LOSC, Thompson and Zuroff, 2002) and the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R; Slaney et al., 2001). Self absorption was measured by using the Turkish version of the Self-Absorption Scale. The factor structure of the Self-Absorption Scale was evaluated using exploratory factor analyses in the Turkish culture. The analyses yielded two factors namely, private self-absorption and public self-absorption. Multiple regression analyses showed that private self-absorption was positively predicted by discrepancy and internalized self-criticism. Public self-absorption was positively predicted by discrepancy, internalized self-criticism and comparative self-criticism. These findings provide evidence about <b>the</b> <b>associations</b> <b>among</b> self-absorption and maladaptive affect and cognition...|$|E

40|$|The primary task of {{association}} rule mining is to detect frequently co-occurring groups of items in transactional databases. The {{intention is to}} use this knowledge for prediction purposes. So many researches has focused mainly on how to expedite the search for frequently co-occurring groups of items in "shopping cart " and less {{attention has been paid}} to the methods that exploit these "frequent itemsets " for prediction purposes. This paper contributes to the latter task by proposing a technique that uses the partial information about the contents of a shopping cart for the prediction of what else the customer is likely to buy, for example, If bread, butter, and milk often appear in the same item, then the presence of butter and milk in a shopping cart suggests that the customer may also buy bread. More generally knowing which items a shopping cart contains, we want to predict often items that the customer is likely to add before proceeding to the checkouts. So this paper presents a technique called the "Combo Matrix " whose principal diagonal elements represent <b>the</b> <b>association</b> <b>among</b> items and looking to the principal diagonal elements, the customer can select what else the other items can be purchased with the currently contents of the shopping cart and also reduces the rule mining cost. <b>The</b> <b>association</b> <b>among</b> items is shown through Graph. The frequent itemsets are generated from the Combo Matrix. Then association rules are to be generated from the already generated frequent itemsets. <b>The</b> <b>association</b> rules generated form the basis for prediction.
