The fragments were sent to a lab, where they were identified as pieces of human bones and a charred portion of a human tooth. The DNA tests proved inconclusive, but an examination by the dental experts established that the filling of this <b>tooth</b> <b>portion</b> matched that of a very rare filling material used by Katie's dentist. The researchers stated that the tooth belonged to a young female, and the chance of it belonging to Katie was quite high.|$|E

40|$|The {{finite element}} (FE) {{analysis}} {{is an effective}} method to study the strength and predict the fracture risk of endodontically-treated teeth. This paper presents a rapid method developed to generate a comprehensive tooth FE model using data retrieved from micro-computed tomography (μCT). With this method, the inhomogeneity of material properties of teeth was included into the model without dividing the tooth model into different regions. The material properties of the tooth were assumed {{to be related to}} the mineral density. The fracture risk at different <b>tooth</b> <b>portions</b> was assessed for root canal treatments. The micro-CT images of a tooth were processed by a Matlab software programme and the CT numbers were retrieved. The tooth contours were obtained with thresholding segmentation using Amira. The inner and outer surfaces of the tooth were imported into Solidworks and a three-dimensional (3 D) tooth model was constructed. An assembly of the tooth model with the periodontal ligament (PDL) layer and surrounding bone was imported into ABAQUS. The material properties of the tooth were calculated from the retrieved CT numbers via ABAQUS user's subroutines. Three root canal geometries (original and two enlargements) were investigated. The proposed method in this study can generate detailed 3 D finite element models of a tooth with different root canal enlargements and filling materials, and would be very useful for the assessment of the fracture risk at different <b>tooth</b> <b>portions</b> after root canal treatments...|$|R
40|$|Vertical root {{fractures}} in endodontically treated teeth {{have long been}} reported and pose diagnostic difficulties. A h emisection/Root resection procedure which removes the fractured fragments completely, and retains {{a portion of the}} compromised tooth offers a predictable treatment option. The key to this rests in ideal case selection invol ving balancing all indications and contraindications. The success of the treatment depends on careful case selection based on a firm set of guidelines. This article presents a case with vertical root fracture in an endodontic treated molar. This article de scribes the case of a 60 - year - old man with a vertical root fracture on the mesial root and a healthy periodontium supporting the distal root making it ideal for retention as well as restoration and support of the final prosthesis. Also, the patient was mot ivated to try and save as much of the tooth as possible.

40|$|Tooth {{fractures}} {{constitute a}} considerable fraction of all tooth diseaes. Out of 5370 dogs treated during four years, 492 (9 %) patients were treated for dental problems. Out of this number, 139 (28. 3 %) dogs were treated for tooth fractures. The most frequently affected teeth were canines, 54 cases (38. 8 %) succeeded by 46 premolar teeth (33. 1 %), 36 incisors (25. 9 %) and 3 molars (2. 2 %). From among the patients with canine and incisor fractures, 61 (67. 7 %) were large breed dogs. Frontal teeth fractures occurred during training, guard and police work or in play. On the other hand, the premolar fractures (especially 108, 208) were divided evenly among large and medium (small) breeds. The results of nonsurgical endodontic treatment showed 100 % success with incisors and canines. Periapical lesions were seen infrequently in the above-mentioned teeth. Out of 24 endodonticaly treated incisors and canines with necrotic pulp the periapical lesions were present only in 3 cases (12. 5 %).

Several disarticulated elements are also known including <b>teeth,</b> <b>portions</b> of the snout and poscranial elements. Helveticosaurus is about 2 meters long from snout to tail.

The long, flexible tail is similar to what can be seen in other extinct marine reptiles such as thalattosaurs, and it probably propelled itself through the water by means of lateral undulation. However, Helveticosaurus also possessed a robust pectoral girdle and forelimbs that were well adapted for paddle like propulsion as a supplementary method of locomotion, as seen in secondarily aquatic tetrapods. This unique combination of undulation and paddling is highly unusual for an aquatic reptile.|$|R

40|$|During cold {{precision}} forging of helical gears, the die experiences high {{forming pressure}} resulting in elastic deformation of the die, a main factor affecting dimensional accuracy of a formed gear. The divided flow method in material plastic deformation {{is an effective}} way to reduce the forming force and the die pressure during cold precision forging of helical gears. In this study, by utilizing the flow-relief-hole method, a billet design with different initial diameters of the relief-hole is developed to improve the dimensional accuracy of cold forging gears. Three-dimensional Finite Element (FE) models are established to simulate the plastic deformation process of billet during cold precision forging of a helical gear and to determine the forming force acting on the die. Further models of die stress analysis are developed to examine the die elastic deformation and distribution of the displacement. Effects of the relief-hole diameters on die elastic deformation are studied. The results show that the elastic deformation of the die is different in the addendum, dedendum, and involute parts of forging gear using different relief-hole diameters. The die elastic deformation increases firstly and then decreases when the relief-hole diameter increases. The <b>tooth</b> <b>portions</b> are of larger elastic deformation and the peak value locates in the addendum. It shows the importance of optimizing the relief-hole diameter to minimize the dimensional inaccuracy of forging gears caused by the die elastic deformation...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the influence of varying amounts of air/water spray and the energy used by an erbium, chromium:yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) 2, 780 nm laser when treating dental tissues. The morphological effects produced by the laser interaction on healthy human enamel were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The vestibular and lingual surfaces of ten molars were treated with laser at different power settings; each surface was subdivided into cervical, median, and occlusal parts and treated with different proportions of water spray; the series contained 60 <b>tooth</b> <b>portions.</b> Treatment differed in terms of power setting and air/water percentage. All specimens were then subjected to dehydration and metallisation. At SEM evaluation, the classic aspect of laser-treated enamel was visible: grooves, flakes, shelves and sharp edges, indicative of micro-explosion rather than melting. Vaporisation of the tissue created a clear delimitation from surrounding healthy tissue, with partial respect to the prismatic structure of the treated enamel. The aspect of the enamel was rarely type 1 Silverstone but more frequently type 2 or 3, with prismatic structure not respected and/or completely disordered. These morphological differences appeared to be correlated with the inclination of the laser beam aimed at the enamel prisms and with the percentage of air/water used. The laser system analysed showed itself to be effective at removing human dental enamel.

2500|$|Genasauria is a clade of extinct beaked, {{primarily}} herbivorous dinosaurs. Paleontologist Paul Sereno first named Genasauria in 1986.

According to Sereno (1986), Genasauria represents all ornithischians except for the most primitive ornithischian, Lesothosaurus Sereno’s formal definition is, “Ankylosaurus, Triceratops, their most recent common ancestor and all descendants.” It is hypothesized that Genasauria had diverged from Lesothosaurus by the Early Jurassic.
