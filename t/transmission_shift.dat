2500|$|The first 1997 Grand Prix {{was built}} on August 12, 1996. There were two trim levels {{available}} from 1996; the SE and GT (GT available in coupe and sedan body styles). The Grand Prix came as a base SE sedan or a sportier GT coupe and sedan, {{as well as with}} a high-performance GTP package—available for GT models in either body style. Coupes and sedans shared similar styling, except for rear doors and quarter panels. The GTP was an option package under the GT trim level and later became its own trim level. The base engine on the SE was the only engine carried over from the previous generation, the 3.1L V6. The GT had a 3.8L V6 (3800 Series II) which was an option on the SE. The 3800 SeriesII was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 1995–1997. The GTP added an Eaton M90 supercharger (also used in the 1996–2003 Bonneville) to the 3.8L, boosting power from [...] to [...] GTP trim level featured a [...] "performance shift" [...] button on the shifter that raised the <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> points. Front bucket seats came standard, while a 45/55 split bench seat was available as an option on the SE sedan only.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  6, the {{simulation}} and experimental results consist well with each other. Both curves from simulations and experiments {{are similar to}} pulse curves. However, {{the tops of the}} experimental curves are not quite stable comparing to the simulation ones. The reason for the instability is high stiffness of hydraulic system. There will be disturbance when the pistons of pneumatic- hydraulic <b>transmission</b> sharply <b>shift.</b> In addition, slight lag happens when the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifts</b> phase, and that is because in the hydraulic chambers the left hydraulic fluid left blocks the motion of the pistons.|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, {{overdrive}} is {{the highest}} gear in the transmission. Overdrive allows the engine to operate at a lower RPM for a given road speed. This allows the vehicle to achieve better fuel efficiency, and often quieter operation on the highway. When it is switched on, an automatic <b>transmission</b> can <b>shift</b> into overdrive mode after a certain speed is reached (usually 70+ km/h mph or more depending on the load). When it is off, the automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> {{is limited to the}} lower gears. Overdrive should usually be selected when the average speed is above 70 km/h (40-45 mph).|$|R

50|$|A dog-leg gearbox is {{a manual}} <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> pattern {{distinguished}} by an up-over-up shift between {{first and second}} gear. The layout derives its name from a dog's hind leg, with its sharp angles.

50|$|The Police Interceptor engine {{calibration}} {{includes a}} slightly higher idle speed (by approximately 40 rpm) and minor changes in the emissions settings. The computer is tuned for more aggressive <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> points, and the transmission itself is built for firmer and harder shifts. The EGR system is controlled differently on 03+ vehicles than on 03+ non-police vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Shift by wire is {{the system}} by which the {{transmission}} modes are engaged/changed in an automobile through electronic controls without any mechanical linkage between the gear shifting lever and the <b>transmission.</b> The <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> was traditionally accomplished by mechanical links to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive positions through a lever mounted on the steering column or a gear shifter near the center console.|$|R
5000|$|Fluid Drive {{could also}} be mated to the {{semi-automatic}} transmission, which was not automatic in any way {{and should not be}} confused with Fluid Drive. With the semi-automatic <b>transmissions,</b> the driver <b>shifted</b> manually, selecting reverse or a low range and a high range. Each 'range' had two speeds. To shift between them, the driver accelerated then released pressure on the accelerator. In high range, this shift point was about 23 mph (37 kmh). The <b>transmission</b> <b>shifted</b> into high speed range, the driver then depressed the accelerator pedal, and continued accelerating. The solenoids on the transmission connected to the carburetor and ignition system and momentarily interrupted engine operation to allow trouble-free shifting.|$|R

50|$|A {{parking pawl}} is a device fitted to a motor vehicle's {{automatic}} transmission {{in order for}} it to lock up the transmission. It is engaged when the <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> lever selector {{is placed in the}} Park position, which is always the first position (topmost on a column shift, frontmost on a floor shift) in all cars sold in the United States since 1965 (when the order was standardised by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)) through SAE J915, and in most other vehicles worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Electrohydraulic manual {{transmission}} {{is a type}} of semi-automatic transmission system, which uses an automated clutch unlike conventional {{manual transmission}}s where the driver operates the clutch. The clutch is controlled by electronic computers and hydraulics. To change gears, the driver selects the desired gear with the <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> lever, and the system automatically operates the clutch and throttle to match revs and engage the clutch again. Also, many such transmissions operate in sequential mode where the driver can only upshift or downshift by one gear at a time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shifting}} sequence {{was very}} different and much rougher than the Hydra-Matics that preceded it, or the Super Turbines and Turbo Hydramatics that followed it. The shift from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd range was long and drawn-out, ending with a harsh shift. The reason for this was that three things were happening. Not only was the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> to a very much higher range ( [...] 2.93 to 1.56, {{but it was also}} simultaneously emptying the fluid coupling and making a mechanical lock-up. The wide gap in the reduction ratio between first and second gears combined with the direct mechanical connection to the engine to create a shift that could be firm enough to lug the engine. Because of the mechanical lock-up, there was sometimes a shudder felt as the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifted</b> into third gear (fourth range) by refilling the fluid coupling. Direct drive (1:1 ratio) is achieved by splitting engine power between the fluid coupling (used for first gear) and the front clutch (used for second gear), which are both applied to provide third gear, effectively locking the planetary gearsets and forcing them to spin at engine speed. The design is unique in that it provides third gear by applying first and second gears at the same time.|$|R

50|$|Shift quality: Shift {{quality is}} the driver’s {{perception}} of the vehicle to an automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> event. This {{is influenced by the}} powertrain (engine, transmission), and the vehicle (driveline, suspension, engine and powertrain mounts, etc.) Shift feel is both a tactile (felt) and audible (heard) response of the vehicle. Shift quality is experienced as various events: Transmission shifts are felt as an upshift at acceleration (1-2), or a downshift maneuver in passing (4-2). Shift engagements of the vehicle are also evaluated, as in Park to Reverse, etc.|$|E

50|$|One unique {{feature of}} this {{transmission}} is its use of both a modulator valve and a throttle valve (TV) cable. Most transmissions either use {{one or the other}} to control shift points and shift smoothness.

30|$|Recently, binary and ternary {{photonic}} crystals were {{proposed in}} temperature sensing. The author of Ref. [12] found {{that with a}} binary photonic crystal, a temperature peak shift of 0.350  nm may be obtained, whereas with a ternary photonic crystal, a peak shift of 0.355 may be obtained. His ternary photonic crystal has a working layer of Bi 4 Ge 3 O 12. No doubt {{that this was a}} fascinating result. In this work, a much higher peak shift was obtained using a polymer as a working layer. The proposed ternary photonic crystal was assumed to have the structure Si/polymer/SiO 2. Transmission profile of this photonic structure was investigated at different temperatures. It was found that with the increase in temperature, the <b>transmission</b> peak <b>shifts</b> toward higher wavelengths. This can be attributed to thermo-optic and thermal expansion coefficients. When the polymer “polycarbonate” was used, a <b>transmission</b> peak <b>shift</b> of 0.368  nm per degree rise in temperature was obtained, whereas when the polymer (Polystyrene) was employed, a <b>transmission</b> peak <b>shift</b> of 0.380  nm per degree rise in temperature.|$|R
