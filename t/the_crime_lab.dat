Calleigh is {{a veteran}} MDPD Detective and the longest serving member of <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>lab.</b> She is a {{ballistics}} specialist.

500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>lab</b> and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party for him because he was not the sort of person who people would get deeply involved with. He also says to Warrick in season two ("Ellie") that when he left there would not be a cake in the break room—he would just pick up and leave.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the scandal, nine Crime Lab {{technicians}} were disciplined with suspensions and one analyst was terminated. [...] However, that analyst was fully reinstated to her previous position in January 2004, less than one month after her December 2003 termination. [...] Many HPD supervisors and Houston residents called for more stringent disciplinary actions against <b>the</b> <b>Crime</b> <b>Lab</b> employees. [...] However, the city panel responsible for disciplining the lab technicians repeatedly resisted these arguments and instead reduced the employees' punishments [...] [...] Irma Rios was hired in 2003 as Lab Director, replacing Interim Lab Director Frank Fitzpatrick.|$|E

2500|$|During interrogation, it was {{suggested}} that Sven had channeled his anger at his father through the miniature found at the crime scene. [...] When shown pictures of the miniature, however, the boy fainted {{at the sight of the}} real blood in the miniature. [...] To make sure that Sven was not pretending to be repulsed as he was by the sight of blood, a test was run on him, which involved artificially increasing the flow of adrenaline through his system to simulate his seeing blood. [...] Sven fainted once again, proving his innocence. [...] <b>The</b> <b>crime</b> <b>lab</b> was left with no more leads for some time afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2002, the CBS local TV station KHOU began {{broadcasting}} a multi-part {{investigation into}} {{the accuracy of the}} HPD Crime Lab's findings. Particularly of interest to the reporters were criminal cases that involved DNA analysis and serological (body fluid) testing. Night after night journalists David Raziq, Anna Werner and Chris Henao presented case after case in which the lab's work was dangerously sloppy or just plain wrong and may have been sending the innocent to prison while letting the guilty go free. As a result of those broadcasts, {{at the end of the}} week the Houston Police Department declared they would have a team of independent scientists audit the lab and its procedures. However, the audit's findings were so troublesome that one month later,in mid- December, HPD closed the DNA section of the laboratory. Not only did the audit bolster KHOU's report but also found that samples were contaminated and the lab's files were very poorly maintained. [...] The audit revealed that a section of the lab's roof was leaking into sample-containment areas, lab technicians were seriously undereducated or unqualified for their jobs, samples had been incorrectly tagged, and samples had been contaminated through improper handling. [...] Worse, many people had been convicted and sent to prison based upon the evidence contained in <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>lab.</b> [...] The New York Times asked the question, [...] "Worst Crime Lab in the Country?" [...] in a March 2003 article.|$|E

5000|$|Whitehurst's whistleblowing in the 1990s and {{the adverse}} {{publicity}} trials, in which FBI Lab employees were revealed as incompetent or disingenuous, led to major changes. According to John F. Kelly & Phillip K. Wearne's book Tainting Evidence: Inside the Scandals at <b>the</b> FBI <b>Crime</b> <b>Lab</b> (1998), <b>the</b> FBI <b>Crime</b> <b>Lab</b> {{had been hurt}} {{by a lack of}} funding and an institutional entropy rooted in Lab employees' belief that they were the best forensic experts in the country, if not the world.
