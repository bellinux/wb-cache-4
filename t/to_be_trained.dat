5|$|Built as {{a hunting}} lodge for George II by the {{architect}} Roger Morris, White Lodge {{was completed in}} 1730. Its many famous residents have included members of the Royal Family. The future Edward VIII was born at White Lodge in 1894 and his brother Prince Albert, Duke of York (the future George VI), and the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother), lived there in the 1920s.

Her father, Edward Randles, the organist at the Holywell parish church of St. James, lost his sight {{at the age of}} three as a result of small pox.

Although the Sathyalingams {{received}} a tip-off {{that they had been}} targeted and managed to escape the violence, 80 Sinhalese rioters attacked and burned their home. Having lost their abode and all their possessions, they resettled in Colombo. In 1969 Neila returned to Kalakshetra <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> as an instructor and to take up a postgraduate diploma course.

5|$|Frank Oz voices Yoda, the centuries-old {{leader of}} the Jedi Council who is {{apprehensive}} about allowing Anakin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained.</b> Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls. Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted In & Out. A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis portrays him in the scene in which Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight. Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough. On the Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda {{similar to the one}} from the other prequels is used instead.|$|E

5|$|Raw {{attempted}} {{to join the}} Royal Australian Navy as an electrical artificer in 1941, but was rejected and told to reapply in twelve months. Instead, he joined the RAAF on 15 August that year. He departed Sydney bound for Southern Rhodesia in November 1941 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> as a pilot under the Empire Air Training Scheme. Arriving in Southern Rhodesia in January 1942, Raw completed his training and was commissioned as an officer in December that year. He subsequently served as a flying instructor in Southern Rhodesia. In May 1944 Raw became engaged to Dorothy Maggs, whose family lived in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Teachers {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> at {{the college}} (officially called the Chichester Diocesan Training College for Schoolmistresses) until 1939. As World War II approached, the institution closed and the building was auctioned; but {{before it could be}} sold, the Royal Engineers requisitioned it for their use during wartime. They used it as a base for their operations, then after the war it became their archives and records office. In 1987, they moved out, and the vacant building was threatened with demolition. A local campaign helped it receive listed status, offering a degree of protection, and the building's future was secured when it was bought and converted into a complex of serviced offices. It opened in November 1988 as the Brighton Business Centre, and was later renamed the Brighton Forum.|$|E

5|$|The Italian Regia Aeronautica was {{equipped}} {{for a while}} with the Stukas. In 1939, the Italian government asked the RLM to supply 100 Ju 87s. Italian pilots were sent to Graz in Austria <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> for dive-bombing aircraft. In the spring of 1940, between 72 and 108 Ju 87 B-1s, some of them ex-Luftwaffe aircraft, were delivered to 96° Gruppo Bombardamento a Tuffo. The Italian Stuka, renamed Picchiatello, was in turn assigned to Gruppi 97°, 101° and 102°. The Picchiatelli were used against Malta, Allied convoys in Mediterranean and in North Africa (where they took part in conquering Tobruk). They were used by the Regia Aeronautica up to 1942.|$|E
5|$|The film's animators {{had little}} {{experience}} with computer-animation and feature-length films, and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> by the producers {{over the course}} of the film's production. Since none of the animators were specialists, they were not divided into specific teams, but instead each worked on all areas of the animating process. The filmmakers found this to be a poor method though, because it kept the individual skills of the animators from being optimized. Due to their independent backgrounds, the animators were accustomed to working at fast paces, and despite their small numbers, each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time. Still, schedule and budget restraints led the filmmakers to enlist Prana Studios in Mumbai, India to perform lighting and compositing.|$|E
5|$|While {{growing up}} in Calgary, Sing {{attended}} numerous Stampede Wrestling events with her mother. She knew {{she wanted to be}} a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children. As a teenager, Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained,</b> but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time. Bret Hart, however, claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts. During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport. She later wrote to Mildred Burke, after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's contact information, and sent her a biography and photo. Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in Encino, California.|$|E

5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted some recommendations. Aircrew had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders landing before the main force had to have enough time to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified, with complete brigades landing on one drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used in Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following the friendly fire incident over the convoy, more training was given to ships' crews in aircraft recognition, and Allied aircraft were painted with three large white stripes on their wings. Training for pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication.|$|E
5|$|February saw the issuing of {{equipment}} and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short of men {{who were able to}} serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers because the majority of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.|$|E
5|$|In 1963 and 1964 the Egyptians {{had five}} squadrons of {{aircraft}} in Yemen at airfields near San'a and Hodeida. They were using Yak-11 piston-engined fighters, MiG-15 and MiG-17 jet fighters, Ilyushin Il-28 twin-engined bombers, Ilyushin Il-14 twin-engined transports and Mil Mi-4 transport helicopters. They were also flying four-engined Tupolev bombers from bases in Egypt, such as Aswan. All the air crew were Egyptian, {{except for the}} Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel. The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews. Throughout the war, the Egyptians relied on airlift. In January 1964, when royalist forces placed San'a under siege, Egyptian Antonov heavy-lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region. The Egyptians estimate that {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars were spent to equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces, and in addition, Moscow refurbished the Al-Rawda Airfield outside San'a. The politburo saw a chance to gain a toehold on the Arabian Peninsula and accepted hundreds of Egyptian officers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> as pilots for service in the Yemen War.|$|E
