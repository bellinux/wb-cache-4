5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. <b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The Merlin {{consumed}} {{an enormous}} volume of air {{at full power}} (equivalent to the volume of a single-decker bus per minute), and with <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gases exiting at 1,300mph (2,100km/h) it was realised that useful thrust could be gained simply by angling the gases backwards instead of venting sideways.|$|E
5|$|The casing {{was tested}} in a wind tunnel, and {{retained}} after it {{was found to be}} as good as other forms of streamlining.

5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust.</b>|$|E

The majority of this was spat out of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effect of lit-moxa {{stimulating}} acupoint Guanyuan (CV 4) on lactic acid and super-oxide dismutase (SOD) in skeletal muscle after exercise exhaustion. MethodsTwenty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control group, exhausted control group, exercise group and moxibustion group using exercise training and mild heating with lit-moxa stick as treatment methods. <b>The</b> <b>exhausted</b> control group, moxibustion group and exercise group received an exhaustive swimming after 20 days of intervention. Swimming exhausted times were recorded. Lactic acid and SOD concentration in soleus muscle were detected and compared between every two groups. ResultsThe swimming <b>exhausted</b> times of <b>the</b> moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly increased compare to <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> control group (P < 0. 05). The lactic acid of <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> control group was significantly increased comparing with the normal control group (P < 0. 05), and the lactic acid of the moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly {{lower than that of}} <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> control group (P < 0. 05). The SOD level of <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> control group was significantly decreased comparing with the normal control group (P < 0. 05), and the SOD level of the moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly higher than that of <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> control group (both, P < 0. 05). There was no statistical difference between the moxibustion group and the exercise group.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{is equipped}} with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of modular construction, which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers driven by <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas. Fifteen fuel tanks are located throughout the submarine: they must be used in specific sequences to preserve the submarine's buoyancy and trim.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the impact of total soy saponins (TS) on the myocardial antioxidant capacity in rats exercised to exhaustion. MethodsThe one-time exhausted treadmill model was used. All rats were divided into 4 groups: the control group, the TS group, <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> group, and <b>the</b> TS <b>exhausted</b> group. <b>The</b> TS and TS exhausted groups were fed TS at a dosage of 20 [*]mg/kg body weight, once a day, for 2 weeks. <b>The</b> <b>exhausted</b> group was given a placebo, and the control group was not given any treatment. The treadmill speed was set at 30 [*]m/min, and <b>the</b> rats (<b>exhausted</b> and TS exhausted groups) were trained at this speed until <b>exhausted.</b> <b>The</b> rats were decapitated and anatomized immediately after exhausted. A 10 % homogenate of the myocardial tissue was prepared. ResultsTS significantly increased the exercise time by 20. 62 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). As compared with the control group, the enzyme activities for catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GR) were significantly enhanced in the TS group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01); GR and GSH-Px activity was significantly enhanced in <b>the</b> TS <b>exhausted</b> group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01); malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased in <b>the</b> TS <b>exhausted</b> group (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). As compared with <b>the</b> <b>exhausted</b> group, <b>the</b> GSH-Px activity was significantly enhanced in <b>the</b> TS <b>exhausted</b> group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01); CAT, GSH-Px, and GR activities were significantly enhanced in the TS group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). As compared with the TS group, the CAT and GR activity in <b>the</b> TS <b>exhausted</b> group was significantly decreased (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). ConclusionTS can improve the exercised rats' antioxidant activity in their cardiac muscle to varying degrees, decrease MDA and serum AST and LDH levels, increase the exercise time, and delay the occurrence of sports fatigue...|$|R

5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} vented by {{swivelling}} funnels posed {{a danger to}} the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of small installations, {{convenience}} may outweigh cost. There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E
