2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd like to know what the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E

In receiving no clear answers from Bannon herself, women were left <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> these questions out for themselves. Hamer writes, [...] "What Bannon did {{was to provide a}} range of possible trajectories to lesbianism... Bannon, by constructing fictional biographies for her lesbian characters, produced a new knowledge about how one arrives at a lesbian identity." ...|$|R

50|$|Miller and Modigliani derived the theorem {{and wrote}} their {{groundbreaking}} article {{when they were}} both professors at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA) of Carnegie Mellon University. The story goes that Miller and Modigliani were set to teach corporate finance for business students {{despite the fact that they}} had no prior experience in corporate finance. When they read the material that existed they found it inconsistent so they sat down together <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> it out.

50|$|As {{the skill}} set {{of those in}} the {{ambulance}} increased, so did the importance of information. Ambulance service moved from 'first come...first served' or giving priority to whoever sounded the most panicked, <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what was actually happening, and the assignment of resources by priority of need. This occurred slowly at first, with local initiatives and full-time ambulance dispatchers making best guesses. Priority codes developed for ambulance dispatch, and became commonplace, although they have never been fully standardized. As it became possible for those in the ambulance to actually save lives, the process of sending the closest appropriate resource to the person in the greatest need became very important. Dispatchers needed tools to help them make the correct decisions, and a number of products initially competed to provide that decision-support.|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} compared collaborative {{and individual}} recall. In Experiment 1, participants encoded pictures and words {{with a deep}} or shallow processing task, then recalled them twice either individually or collaboratively. Collaborative groups recalled more than individuals, but less than nominal groups (pooled individuals), thus exhibiting collaborative inhibition. However, group recall appeared to be more stable over time than individual recall. Groups and individuals both showed a picture-superiority effect, a level-of-processing effect, and hypermnesia. In Experiment 2, participants recalled the story "War of the Ghosts " (from F. C. Bartlett, 1932), and again collaborative groups recalled more than individuals, but less than nominal groups. Both the individual and collaborative recalls were highly organized. There was evidence that the collaborative groups tended {{to rely on the}} best individual to a greater extent in story than in list recall. Possible social and cognitive mechanisms are considered.

It took me ages <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> that out, and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita that made me realise what it was. Our idea of Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield in the chariot. So {{this is the point}} - that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body ... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says, [...] "Please Krishna, you drive the chariot" [...] because unless we bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of our spiritual guides ... we're going to crash our chariot, and we're going to turn over, and we're going to get killed in the battlefield.

5000|$|Many {{perceived}} his [...] "party at an Olympic level" [...] attitude as {{a violation}} of the [...] "Olympic Spirit." [...] When Nike's 2006 advertising campaign urged consumers to [...] "Join Bode," [...] Washington Post sportswriter Sally Jenkins asked, [...] "Where? At the bar?"

[...] Some have argued that Miller's management and PR team were partly to blame for his crash-and-burn publicity, pointing out that they facilitated the media blitz {{in the months leading up}} to the Olympics. The overexposure was bound to backfire knowing Miller's uneven commitment to performing. Miller himself said: Olympic hype is going to be a tough thing for me to manage. My actions are not always consistent. I'm super-mellow and laid back, but I'm always thinking and running 100,000 scenarios through my head. Sometimes I'm disciplined, but I like to be a total slacker, too. I party hard, but I train hard.

50|$|Although she {{initially}} {{chooses to}} take up a new identity, Myfanwy eventually chooses {{to take up}} the first Myfanwy's life and discover who wants her dead. She is left with a binder that outlines the organization known as the Checquy, which combats the supernatural and unnatural forces that threaten Great Britain. Many of the members possess supernatural powers; only the ones with such powers are allowed to hold any true positions of power. Myfanwy finds that her specific power is control over other people's bodies through touch, which her predecessor never truly fully explored. The first Myfanwy was a lower member of the inner court of the Checquy, a Rook, which allowed her {{to do a lot of}} research into the workings of the organization. Myfanwy uses the binder heavily throughout the book, especially when it comes <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out which people she can or cannot trust. She quickly discovers that while the first Myfanwy was exceedingly skilled at organization and management, she was very timid and shy when it came to interpersonal relationships. This is partially a result of how she was inducted into the Checquy as a nine-year-old girl, as she was interrogated quite thoroughly in a manner that was not shown to the reader.|$|R
5000|$|The Fair Housing Act is {{enforced}} by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (commonly known as [...] "HUD"), whose regulations governing reasonable accommodations are found at 24 C.F.R. § 100.204.
