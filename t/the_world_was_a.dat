5|$|Didsbury has two rugby union clubs, Toc H R.F.C. and Old Bedians. Toc H, {{founded in}} 1924, plays at Simons Fields, on Ford Lane. Its first team {{plays in the}} North Lancashire and Cumbria league. The club runs four senior teams and a youth section, and has run a 10-a-side {{competition}} every May since 1951, as a charity fund raiser for local hospices. Old Bedians is based in East Didbury, and was founded in 1954. It regularly fields three senior teams {{as well as a}} junior section. Desmond Pastore, believed to be the oldest rugby player in <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> founder member of the club, and later became its president. Formerly a player for Sale and Cheshire, Desmond played his last game for Manchester club Egor on his 91st birthday. Bedians AFC (an amateur football club founded in 1928) share the Underbank Farm ground with Old Bedians RUFC.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|It rained. The {{procession}} of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for {{he saw that}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> world for him, though many discovered it {{to be made of}} oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E

5|$|After being {{admitted}} to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following in much of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature {{a significant number of}} MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.|$|E

25|$|After India {{achieved}} {{its independence}} in 1947, {{the country has}} moved to support Palestinian self-determination following the partition of British India.

Though it started to waver in the late 1980s and 1990s as the recognition of Israel led to diplomatic exchanges, the ultimate support for the Palestinian cause was still an underlying concern.|$|E

Developed by restaurateur Joe Baum and designed initially by Warren Platner, Windows on the World occupied 50,000 square feet (4,600 m²) of space in the North Tower. The restaurants operated from April 19, 1976 until September 11, 2001 when they were destroyed in the September 11 attacks.|$|E

25|$|A {{possible}} non-literary but graphic {{indication that}} people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth (or perhaps <b>the</b> <b>world)</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sphere is the use of the orb (globus cruciger) in the regalia of many kingdoms and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is attested {{from the time of the}} Christian late-Roman emperor Theodosius II (423) throughout the Middle Ages; the Reichsapfel was used in 1191 at the coronation of emperor Henry VI. However the word 'orbis' means 'circle' and there is no record of a globe as a representation of the Earth since ancient times in the west till that of Martin Behaim in 1492. Additionally it could well be a representation of the entire 'world' or cosmos.|$|E
500|$|For the game's writing, Fox {{was partly}} {{influenced}} by the silliness of internet culture, as well as comedy shows like Mr. Bean (1990–1995). He was also inspired by the unsettling atmosphere of EarthBound (1994). Fox's desire to [...] "subvert concepts that go unquestioned in many games" [...] further influenced Undertale development. Fox found that the writing became easier after establishing a character's voice and mood. He also felt that creating <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> natural process, as it expressed the stories of those within it. Fox felt the importance to make the game's monsters [...] "feel like an individual". He cited the Final Fantasy series (1987–present) as the opposite; [...] "all monsters in RPGs like Final Fantasy are the same ... there's no meaning to that".|$|E
500|$|In 1899 Vaughan Williams {{passed the}} {{examination}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Music at Cambridge; the title was formally conferred on him in 1901. The song [...] "Linden Lea" [...] became {{the first of his}} works to appear in print, published in the magazine The Vocalist in April 1902 and then as separate sheet music. In addition to composition he occupied himself in several capacities during {{the first decade of the}} century. He wrote articles for musical journals and for the second edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited the first volume of Purcell's Welcome Songs for the Purcell Society, and was for a while involved in adult education in the University Extension Lectures. From 1904 to 1906 he was music editor of a new hymn-book, The English Hymnal, of which he later said, [...] "I now know that two years of close association with some of the best (as well as some of the worst) tunes in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> better musical education than any amount of sonatas and fugues". Always committed to music-making for the whole community, he helped found the amateur Leith Hill Music Festival in 1905, and was appointed its principal conductor, a post he held until 1953.|$|E

2500|$|Eichendorff shared Schlegel’s {{view that}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{naturally}} and eternally [...] "self-forming artwork", Eichendorff himself used the metaphor that [...] "nature [...] a great picture book, which the good Lord has pitched for us outside."

In other words, Anaximander viewed [...] "...all coming-to-be {{as though it were}} an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance". (Ibid., § 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish.|$|E

At that point, only one broadsheet newspaper was left in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} since the end of World War II, eroticism had been {{gradually}} making its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film—discreetly half-hidden by an umbrella—caused a national sensation in 1946. Although throughout the 1940s and early 1950s nudity in Japanese movie theaters, as in most of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> taboo, some films from the mid-50s such as Shintoho's female pearl-diver films starring buxom Michiko Maeda, began showing more flesh than would have previously been imaginable in the Japanese cinema. During the same period, the taiyozoku films on the teen-age [...] "Sun Tribe", such as Kō Nakahira's Crazed Fruit (1956), introduced unprecedented sexual frankness into Japanese films.|$|E
