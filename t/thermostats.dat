5|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and <b>thermostats.</b> Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in <b>thermostats</b> in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.|$|E

The public space included a registration area, a casino, two bars, a coffee shop, a restaurant, various commercial shops and services, and a broadcasting station for K-RAM radio. Guest rooms were located in wings situated behind the main building, surrounding the figure-eight swimming pool.

5|$|In several countries, {{fire safety}} {{officials}} encourage citizens {{to use the}} two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, particularly in autumn, just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires.

25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the <b>thermostat</b> does not restrict {{flow to the}} heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator {{is used as a}} bypass to the <b>thermostat,</b> flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the <b>thermostat</b> opens, and allows the heater to function before the <b>thermostat</b> opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the <b>thermostat</b> fails.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{new things}} {{connected}} to the Internet will be Sentrollers. Sentrollers are either actuators, sensors, controllers, or combinations of these three things. One simple example is a home <b>thermostat.</b> A <b>thermostat</b> is a sentroller as it senses {{the temperature in the}} home, checks whether the home or room in which the <b>thermostat</b> is monitoring temperature is at the desired temperature, and if not, turns on the heater or the air conditioner. Therefore, a <b>thermostat</b> is a sensor and a controller - a sentroller. No human interaction with the <b>thermostat</b> or the cloud will be necessary for the <b>thermostat</b> to keep the heat in the home at the right level.|$|R

5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater <b>thermostats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable <b>thermostats</b> with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E

40|$|A new configurational {{temperature}} <b>thermostat</b> {{suitable for}} molecules with holonomic constraints is derived. This <b>thermostat</b> has a simple set of motion equations, can generate the canonical ensemble in both position and momentum space, acts homogeneously through the spatial coordinates, {{and does not}} intrinsically violate the constraints.

25|$|In the {{regulation}} of heating and cooling, <b>thermostats</b> that operate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures are used. In these, one end of the bimetallic strip is mechanically fixed and attached to an electrical power source, while the other (moving) end carries an electrical contact. In adjustable <b>thermostats</b> another contact is positioned with a regulating knob or lever. The position so set controls the regulated temperature, called the set point.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common example of purely {{mechanical}} <b>thermostat</b> technology in use today is {{the internal combustion engine}} cooling system <b>thermostat,</b> used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator. This type of <b>thermostat</b> operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax. Once the operating temperature is reached, the <b>thermostat</b> progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range. On many automobile engines, including all Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the <b>thermostat</b> does not restrict flow to the heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator is used as a bypass to the <b>thermostat,</b> flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the <b>thermostat</b> opens, and allows the heater to function before the <b>thermostat</b> opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the <b>thermostat</b> fails.|$|R

50|$|While the <b>thermostat</b> is closed, {{there is}} no flow of coolant in the {{radiator}} loop, and coolant water is instead redirected through the engine, allowing it to warm up rapidly while also avoiding hot spots. The <b>thermostat</b> stays closed until the coolant temperature reaches the nominal <b>thermostat</b> opening temperature. The <b>thermostat</b> then progressively opens as the coolant temperature increases to the optimum operating temperature, increasing the coolant flow to the radiator. Once the optimum operating temperature is reached, the <b>thermostat</b> progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range as engine heat output, vehicle speed, and outside ambient temperature change. Under normal operating conditions the <b>thermostat</b> is open to about half of its stroke travel, {{so that it can}} open further or reduce its opening to react to changes in operating conditions. A correctly designed <b>thermostat</b> will never be fully open or fully closed while the engine is operating normally, or overheating or overcooling would occur.|$|R
40|$|The {{widely used}} Nose-Hoover chain (NHC) <b>thermostat</b> in {{molecular}} dynamics simulations is generally believed to impart the canonical distribution {{as well as}} quasi- (i. e., space filling) ergodicity on the <b>thermostatted</b> physical system (PS). Working with the standard single harmonic oscillator, we prove analytically that the two chain Nose-Hoover <b>thermostat</b> with unequal <b>thermostat</b> masses approach the standard Nose-Hoover dynamics and hence the PS loses its canonical and quasi-ergodic nature. We also show through numerical simulations over substantially long times that for certain Poincare sections, for both the equal and unequal <b>thermostat</b> mass cases, the bivariate distribution function of position and momentum (x,p) and of reservoir degrees of freedom (ξ,η) lose their Gaussian nature. Further, the 4 -dimensional x-p-ξ-η extended phase space exhibits two holes of non-zero measure. The NHC <b>thermostat</b> therefore does not generate the canonical distribution or preserve quasi-ergodicity for the PS. Comment: 10 pages 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} novel <b>thermostat</b> {{applicable}} to any particle-based dynamic simulation. Each pair of particles is thermostated either (with probability P) with a pairwise Lowe-Andersen <b>thermostat,</b> or (with probability 1 -P) with a <b>thermostat</b> that is introduced here, {{which is based}} on a pairwise interaction similar to the Nose-Hoover <b>thermostat.</b> When the pairwise Nose-Hoover <b>thermostat</b> dominates (low P), the liquid has a high diffusion coefficient and low viscosity, but when the Lowe-Andersen <b>thermostat</b> dominates, the diffusion coefficient is low and viscosity is high. This novel Nose-Hoover-Lowe-Andersen <b>thermostat</b> is Galilean invariant and preserves both total linear and angular momentum of the system, {{due to the fact that}} the thermostatic forces between each pair of the particles are pairwise additive and central. We show by simulation that this <b>thermostat</b> also preserves hydrodynamics. For the (non-interacting) ideal gas at P= 0, the diffusion coefficient diverges and viscosity is zero, while for P> 0 it has a finite value. By adjusting probability P, the Schmidt number can be varied by orders of magnitude. The temperature deviation from the required value is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), while the equilibrium properties of the system are very well reproduced. Applications of this <b>thermostat</b> include all standard molecular dynamic simulations of dense liquids and solids with any type of force field, as well as hydrodynamic simulation of multi-phase systems with largely different bulk viscosities, including surface viscosity, and of dilute gases and plasmas...|$|R

25|$|If the <b>thermostats</b> in such {{a system}} are {{reversed}} - warm feed from the top, hot from the center - it may not only affect the energy efficiency of the system, feeding scalding water to a domestic hot water outlet may be dangerous, or if directed to warm-feed washers damage them beyond repair.|$|E
40|$|Insulation reduces {{marginal}} heating {{cost and}} {{may lead to}} a takeback effect of higher wintertime <b>thermostat</b> settings, with a consequent dilution of energy savings. Alternatively, additional insulation could permit a lower <b>thermostat</b> setting by reducing drafts and radiation while increasing moisture retention, thereby enhancing comfort. This paper evaluates <b>thermostat</b> net takeback, the difference between takeback and enhanced comfort. Evidence supports the existence of both effects, with net takeback {{at the low end of}} literature estimates. Net <b>thermostat</b> takeback is on the order of 0. 05 degrees F, leading to an energy takeback that ranges from 1 - 3 % of potential energy savings, depending on climate and house size.
