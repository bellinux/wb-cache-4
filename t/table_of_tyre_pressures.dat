40|$|It is well {{understood}} that fuel economy directly influences the CO 2 emissions in vehicles. Thus, a straightforward approach {{to reduce the}} tailpipe CO 2 emissions {{is to reduce the}} overall fuel consumption of the vehicle. In this thesis work the role <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> on the fuel economy is investigated. Apart from the benefits of reduced fuel consumption, <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> also {{plays an important role in}} deciding vehicle handling and passenger comfort. Three mathematical vehicle models have been developed in the Matlab/Simulink® interface, to capture and represent the influence <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> on fuel consumption, vehicle handling and ride characteristics. The first model is a full-vehicle model developed to enable quick and reliable estimation of fuel consumption with the change in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The second model is a two-track vehicle model developed to study the changes in vehicle lateral behaviour when the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> is changed. The third model is a half-car model that is designed to evaluate the changes in vertical acceleration response of the vehicle with change in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> When the full-vehicle model was simulated for the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC city cycle), fuel consumption reduction up to 5 % was observed simply by increasing the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> from 2 bar to 3 bar. The vehicle handling also improved considerably especially when <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> was maintained higher on the outer wheels and lower on the inner wheels of the vehicle in a turn. For smooth roads found within city limits, it was observed that the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> affected the ride comfort only marginally. However as road roughness increased, the impact <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> on ride comfort also increased. Through these findings, a foundation is established for the development <b>of</b> a dynamic <b>Tyre</b> <b>Pressure</b> Regulating System (TPRS) that is capable <b>of</b> regulating the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> in all four wheels, independently and continuously...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of optimal slip ratio {{is crucial to}} vehicle control systems. Many studies have verified there is a definitive impact <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> change on the optimal slip ratio. However, the existing method of optimal slip ratio prediction has not taken into account the influence <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> changes. By introducing a second-order factor, an improved optimal slip ratio prediction considering <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> is proposed in this paper. In order to verify and evaluate {{the performance of the}} improved prediction, a cosimulation platform is developed by using MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim software packages, achieving a comprehensive simulation study of vehicle braking performance cooperated with an ABS controller. The simulation results show that the braking distances and braking time under different <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> and initial braking speeds are effectively shortened with the improved {{prediction of}} optimal slip ratio. When the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> is slightly lower than the nominal pressure, the difference of braking performances between original optimal slip ratio and improved optimal slip ratio is the most obvious...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{overinflated}} <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and {{the effect}} of increased heavy vehicles' axle load on flexible pavements responses have become a subject of great concern because of the higher stress level induced causing more damages to the pavements. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects <b>of</b> various <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> on the determination <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> contact/footprint area for flexible pavement. A survey to collect data on current levels <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> was carried out at two major expressways in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The full scale experiment was then conducted on a heavyvehicle with 1 : 1 : 2 axle configuration, 10 R 20 tyre size and attached trailer with constant axle load. The data showed that the operational levels and maximum recommended <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> heavy vehicles in that area were as high as 827 kPa (120 psi). The effect <b>of</b> varying <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> at different measured temperature on tyre contact area by conducting full-scale field experimental work revealed that the increase <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> resulted to a decrease on the images <b>of</b> the <b>tyre</b> footprint area [...] The analysis carried out to compare the tyre contact area values obtained from the fullscale field experimental work on morning session with the conventional circular area method showed that there is a big difference when the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> start to increase. KENPAVE linear elastic program was used to analyse the effects of measured actual tyre-pavement contact area and the results was compared using conventional circular tyre contact area. It was found that high <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> produced less contact area (actual), giving more detrimental effect on the flexible pavement compared to the conventional circular tyre contact area method. Meanwhile, it was also found that the temperature <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> when the heavy vehicles were in operational gave less significant impact on <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> for the Malaysian condition. It is recommended that for future research in this area, the scope of this study is needed to be enlarged to other expressways throughout Malaysia and other types of heavy vehicles, size <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> and different pavement thickness to obtain additional data and higher confidence level of the effects <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Tyres are a {{final output}} torque {{of the vehicle}} before all the forces are {{distributed}} to the road surface as a tractive force. When the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> changed, it had a direct effect on rolling resistance force of the vehicle and reduced the tractive force. Moreover, it {{had an effect on}} a rate of fuel consumption and driving comfort. This research had tested the effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 25 psi and 45 psi to determine the total resistance force between the vehicle speed from 40 km/hr to 100 km/hr and compare with the reference <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 35 psi by using the “coast-down technique”. The results from calculation showed the total resistance force when the vehicle speed was zero from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 25 psi increased by 48. 52 % from reference value and the total resistance force from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 45 psi decreased by 13. 46 % from the reference <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The different resistance force from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 35 psi with the other 2 values <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> in the research were called the different rolling resistance force because the vehicle changed only <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> which had no effect on aerodynamics drag. The relationship of the different rolling resistance force along the test speed from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 25 psi and 45 psi decreased while the vehicle speed increased. The relationship can be fitted with a linear equation. The slope from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 25 psi was 0. 2358 which was steeper than the slope of 0. 0828 from 45 psi <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> These were the effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> characteristic that made from rubber. When the vehicle speed was low, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> deformation was also low and resulted in high energy loss from hysteresis phenomena. Therefore high rolling resistance force was generated. Considering the effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> under high vehicle speed, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> deformation increased and made the molecule of rubber vibrate more than low vehicle speed. These effects made the tyre stiffer than low frequency and resulted in decreasing the rolling resistance force.

40|$|A {{pavement}} strength {{rating system}} is internationally adopted {{in order to}} protect aircraft pavements from inadvertent overload. The system has two elements. The primary element is designed to protect the pavement against subgrade rutting and the second is intended to protect asphalt pavement surfaces. The surface-protection element is arbitrary and empirical, placing category-based limits on aircraft <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures.</b> In 2008, increases in the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> limits were proposed by aircraft manufacturers and these were approved in 2013. The research reported in this paper assesses the impact <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and individual wheel load increases on calculated flexible pavement stress indicators, as well as identifying an improved surface layer protection element. Stresses were calculated near the surface, at the surface layer interface and at the subgrade. <b>Tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and wheel load combinations included current (18 t and 1. 35 MPa), imminent (33 t and 1. 75 MPa) and future (40 t and 2. 15 MPa) aircraft. Surface layer stress increased significantly (20 – 30 %) with increases in both <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and wheel load. The subgrade stress increased near-equally (97 %) with wheel load but was insensitive (< 1 %) to <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> changes. The ability of the current aircraft pavement strength rating system to protect pavements from the increasing demands of aircraft was demonstrated to be limited to the subgrade. It is recommended that the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> rating be amended to reflect the combined impact <b>of</b> both <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> rating and individual wheel load. It is also recommended that ongoing efforts to incorporate additional asphalt surface failure modes into routine pavement design be given high priority.

40|$|International audienceThe rolling {{resistance}} and the effective radius <b>of</b> a vehicle's <b>tyre</b> are two important characteristics that affect its dynamics, performances and comfort. Thanks to {{their dependence on}} <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure,</b> the online estimation of such parameters {{could be used to}} monitor <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> using an indirect approach. By considering rotational and longitudinal dynamics models, this paper proposes to apply observers for this online estimation using measurements of wheel angular velocities and engine torque. These latter signals being available on major vehicle Controller Area Networks (CAN), the proposed solutions do not require additional sensors. These nonlinear observers are based, first, on high gain approach, and then on high order sliding mode approach allowing robustness and finite time convergence. The originality of the presented results consists in providing a joint estimation of both variables, wheel effective radius and {{rolling resistance}} force. The observers offer the very-first solution for dynamical estimation of rolling resistance in standard driving conditions, the rolling resistance being very difficult to estimate by an online procedure.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with producing a simple method to design low volume roads (LVR) {{by means of a}} rationale which accounts for permanent deformation development in granular layers. Rutting is regarded as the main distress mode in unsealed and thinly sealed pavements. Hence, it is desirable that it be analytically approached rather than empirically, as in most design methods. The overall aim of this PhD thesis was to look into the behaviour of in-service roads and from a newly developed process, to advance, in a systematic manner, the elements required to produce a simple mechanistic design procedure. The study took as its basis an assessment of the proximity of the stress distribution in the pavement to the material’s failure envelope. After a literature review on unbound granular materials mechanical behaviour and on low volume roads pavement design methods, Chapters 4 and 5 discuss full scale trials carried out in Scotland on typical forest roads. The overall goal of the trials carried out within the Roads Under Timber Transport project was to establish the effect of weather and seasonal effects on the rutting of forest roads and to improve their performance while enabling the roads to be economically constructed and maintained. It appears that most of the rutting occurring in the sites surveyed came shortly after their construction/resurfacing, leading to the assumption that workmanship may be a highly important variable. Lack of compaction of the layer {{could be one of the}} likely reasons for the high initial rutting rates. Establishing the effect of weather on rutting further to the existing knowledge was, however, difficult to achieve; this was mainly due to the difficulties faced in monitoring traffic conditions. A newly developed method was needed to quantify permanent deformation development due to wandering traffic on a non-level pavement; this was achieved by the use of wheel path areas, and seemed to be a way forward in the analysis of rutting in unsealed roads. Accelerated pavement trials are reported that aimed to evaluate the performance of aggregate under soaked conditions and the relative pavement deformation caused by different timber haulage vehicles. A road segment simulating a standard forest road section was constructed in a purpose-built facility located at the Ringour Quarry facility. Ten different trials were carried out combining three different aggregate materials and five types <b>of</b> vehicles. <b>Tyre</b> fitment, axle configuration and <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> were assessed and demonstrated to play an important role on the study of rutting development. Conclusions drawn from the results suggest that management <b>of</b> the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> and axle overload may be one of the most economic means of managing pavement deterioration in the forest road network. A mechanistic analysis of a variety of unsealed pavements was carried out in Chapter 6; and the newly proposed methodology is described in Chapter 7. With changing loading conditions – e. g. as a consequence of the introduction <b>of</b> <b>Tyre</b> <b>Pressure</b> Control Systems and super single tyres – more detailed analyses are required, so that their effect can be analytically assessed. Then an analytical method is introduced for evaluating the stress-strain condition in thinly surfaced or unsurfaced pavements as typically used in LVR structures. It aims to improve the understanding of the effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and contact area in regard to permanent deformation. To achieve this, several scenarios were modelled using Kenlayer software varying aggregate material, thickness, stiffness, <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> & arrangement. The results usually show a fairly well defined locus of maximum stresses. By comparing this stress envelope with failure envelope, conclusions could be established about the more damaging effect of super singles over twin tyres and, likewise, the greater damage inflicted by high <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> compared to that incurred by lower <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures.</b> Finally, the framework of the proposed method contributes to LVR pavement design procedures mainly due to its simplicity. It still treats the pavement analytically, permitting a more fundamental description of the behaviour of granular layers than in simple linear elastic analysis, but by simplifying the elasto-plastic analysis for routine use it thereby reduces demands of material characterization and computational skills, thus increasing its utility in practical application.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the work in this thesis is {{concerned}} with the investigation and development of indirect measurement techniques. The methodology adopted is a combination of practical experimental, analytical deductive reasoning and simulation studies. This has led to proposals for a number <b>of</b> indirect <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring systems, which are able to detect pressure loss under specific circumstances. The outcome overall is a proposal for a new supervisory system comprising of a modular framework, allowing various algorithms and techniques to be implemented in a complementary manner as they emerge and data sources become available. A number of contributions to the field have been made, which to the knowledge of the author, provide potential for further algorithm development and are imminently applicable given the above. The methods include a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> diagnosis via a wheel angular velocity comparator, the development <b>of</b> a model-based <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> diagnosis via application of an unknown input observer and a parameter estimation scheme, a model-based <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> diagnosis approach via an enhanced Kalman filter configured to estimate states including the input, a model-based <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> diagnosis via cautious least squares, an investigation and critique {{of the effects of the}} choice of sampling interval on discrete-time models and estimation thereof. It is considered, that the extensive literature review provides a valuable historic insight into the tyre fault detection problem. It is clear, from the development and testing of the algorithms (and also the literature), that no single indirect pressure detection method is able to reliably detect changes in all driving scenarios which the regulations typically stipulate (depending on jurisdiction). In the absence of any information about the road input, the majority of the detection work must be shouldered by the wheel angular velocity comparator algorithm. As image recognition and sensor technology develops, it becomes possible to make estimates about the road surface and this removes some of the uncertainty on the input of the model-based parameter estimation approaches. Further work is detailed which goes some way towards realising the next steps in a development cycle suitable for a vehicle manufacturer to take through to the implementation stage...|$|R

The present study aimed to investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> and wheel load on the traction performance of a mechanical front wheel drive MFWD tractor (65 kW engine power) on an agricultural clay (C) Vertic Cambisol on the basis of results of traction tests and simulations with a semi-empirical soil-tyre interaction model adapted for MFWD vehicles. The traction tests were carried out using four tractor configurations with two tractor weights (40. 8 kN and 50. 2 kN) and two <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> (60 kPa and 160 kPa). Traction performance was considered in terms of drawbar pull, traction coefficient, tractive efficiency, power delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption in relation to wheel slip. A decrease in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and an increase in wheel load resulted in higher drawbar pull however, only the former produced improvements in terms of coefficient of traction, tractive efficiency, power delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption, while the only significant benefit resulting from the latter was a reduction in specific fuel consumption at a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> 160 kPa and a slip of under 15 %. </p...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Vehicles used in military, agricultural, forestry, or {{construction}} applications often encounter different road surfaces {{during a}} single journey. In order to optimise {{the mobility of}} these vehicles, different <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> are required for different types of terrain (sand, mud, cross country, tar road, etc.). An in-motion <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> control system will enable the vehicle's operator to change the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> without leaving the vehicle. Such a system will not only allow optimum surface contact between the tyres and the terrain - thus improving vehicletraction, {{but it can also}} increase the lifespan <b>of</b> the <b>tyres</b> and reduce fuel consumption. The key design criteria for such a system are: quick reaction times, an effective operator interface, and reliability. In case of system failure, the operator must be able to override the control, and the tyres should be inflated to a pre-set default pressure. When the fault had been corrected, the system can be restarted from within the cabin, to inflate or deflate the tyres as required. The focus of this thesis is on the design criteria <b>of</b> a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> control system, receiving inputs from the driver and from onboard vehicle sensors; and then adjusting individual <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> if necessary, while the vehicle is on the move. Based on the inputs to the control system, the optimum setting for the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> is determined from a look-up table stored in memory of an onboard computer. This table contains the pressure-speed and pressure-axle load relationship. A unique relation is programmed into the microprocessor for each different vehicle. To install a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> control system on a vehicle, a computer program is used to control the following hardware which are necessary to inflate or deflate tyres: An air compressor and storage tank. Pneumatic valve. Rotating seal. Pressure and speed sensing elements. Electronic control unit. An experimental set-up was built, from various components or sub-systems, which were integrated systematically until the system was working as a unit. The functionality of the system was tested, and although the results obtained do not yet justify the commercial manufacturing of such systems, it is trusted that this research has contributed towards the increased emphasis that is placed upon vehicle safety and comfort systems...|$|R
40|$|Road {{safety is}} a very {{important}} topic for research and development divisions in the automotive industry. As the tyre is the only link between road surface and vehicle, it plays a very significant role in accident mitigation and prevention. This thesis investigates the influence <b>of</b> internal <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> on the brake distance both experimentally and theoretically. Brake tests were performed using a robotic system and a winch was used to pull a car with locked wheels. For both experiments, the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> were changed. A rubber friction law is presented which can be used for tyre and vehicle dynamics calculations. The friction law was tested by comparing numerical results to the full rubber friction theory of Persson and to experimental data. A two-dimensional (2 D) tyre model is introduced that combines the rubber friction law with a simple mass-spring description <b>of</b> the <b>tyre</b> body. The tyre model is very flexible and can be applied to different manoeuvres. It can be used to calculate μ-slip curves, self aligning-torque, braking, and cornering, or combined motion (e. g. braking during cornering). The theoretical predictions have been compared to measured data from indoor tyre testing on sandpaper substrate. Additionally simulations of anti-lock braking system (ABS) using two different control algorithms are presented. In addition a method for rapidly changing the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> while a vehicle is in motion is presented. This method can be used for novel safety system approaches...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft <b>tyre</b> {{inflation}} <b>pressures</b> and {{wheel loads}} have increased {{over time and}} this trend {{is not expected to}} abate in the future. With increased <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> has come increased shear forces induced by braking aircraft. An increase in reports of interface debonding and delamination failures of asphalt surfaces on runways has followed in Australia, Japan and South Africa. Octahedral shear and normal stresses were calculated for extreme braking aircraft <b>of</b> various <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> and wheel loads. The historical increase in <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> around 50 % was shown to have resulted in a moderate 10 % increase in the stress-strength ratio associated with the surface layer interface. The factor of safety associated with interface shear strength was shown to be negligible. New interface construction techniques or tack coat materials with increase adhesion are required {{to reduce the risk of}} further shear-related delamination of asphalt surfaces in high stress applications such as runways...|$|R

There is a minimum pressure for each vehicle based on tyre type and size and differing load in the vehicle. In some cases tyyre pressure also need to be altered with speed. <b>Tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring systems (TPMS) are electronic systems designed to monitor the air pressure inside all the pneumatic <b>tyres</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to present recently measured <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> and axle loading data and to utilize this information in the structural investigation of three different pavements structures on the N 3 Toll Road by employing a sensitivity analysis approach to mechanistic design. Results <b>of</b> extensive <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> and axle loading measurements will be presented and discussed. The measurements are employed in a statistical approach to current mechanistic design principles to develop conclusions as to the most appropriate choice and application of stress and load parameters. 1. AIM The current practice of pavement design is generally reliant on a mechanistic-empirical approach. This design methodology relies on the specification of a number of design parameters and materials characteristics, which combined with linear elastic or similar analysis methods, have a significant effect on the outcome of any analysis.
