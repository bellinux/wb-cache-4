25|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Route</b> Planning Acceleration Act (Verkehrswegeplanungsbeschleunigungsgesetz) adopted {{specifically}} for the new transport routes in the new federal states, {{it was possible to}} put the first planning approval decision for the Erfurt–Arnstadt section into effect at the end of 1994. The planning approval decisions for the new routes were adopted between 24May 1995 and 15April 1997. In the middle of 1996, 75kilometres of the new line and 25kilometres of the rail power line were approved. The approvals were finalised in 1998 apart from the Erfurtstadt and Bad Staffelstein sections. In the middle of 2007, the approvals were finalised for all sections. The planning approval decision for the southern section of the railway power line from the 19December 1995 lost its effect because the construction work had not commenced within the limited period of validity. As a result, a plan for the southern section of the railway power line to the Roth substation was reapplied for in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Japanese fighters {{based in}} central Burma began to {{challenge}} <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>route</b> near Sumprabum {{at the end}} of the summer monsoon. On 13 October 1943, a large number of fighters assisted by ground observers evaded U.S. fighter patrols and shot down a C-46, a C-87, and a CNAC transport while damaging three others. Despite the doubling of U.S. fighter patrols, similar interceptions on 20, 23, and 27 October shot down five more C-46s. Japanese pilots referred to the shooting down of vulnerable transport aircraft as tsuji-giri ("cutting down a casually met stranger") or akago no te wo hineru ("twisting a baby's arm"). On the last of the interceptions a formation of B-24s on a reverse Hump mission, mistaken for C-87s, claimed eight fighters shot down. Tenth Air Force immediately began attacks on Japanese airfields (Myitkyina was attacked 14 times before the end of the year, mostly by strafers and P-40s using 1000-lb bombs) and ICW moved its route to Kunming even farther north. Only two more C-46s were shot down during the remainder of 1943, both in December.|$|E

40|$|Measurements from {{an array}} of current meter {{moorings}} along a section between Norway and Bear Island indicate that the seasonal mean of inflowing Atlantic Water extends further to the north during the summer than during the winter. To further investigate this seasonal divergence and <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>routes</b> of Atlantic Water in the western Barents Sea, numerical experiments of tracer advection have been performed. The numerical results agree with the observations by showing a more northerly <b>transport</b> <b>route</b> of tracer water masses in the western Barents Sea during summer. The tracer water masses originate {{in the core of}} the Atlantic Water inflow at the Norway-Bear Island section, thus represents an indication of <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>routes</b> of <b>the</b> Atlantic Water. The main reason for this change from summer to winter is probably the seasonal changes in the atmospheric fields...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{settlements}} built along a route, the route probably predated the settlement, and then the settlement grew up at some way station or feature, growing along <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>route.</b> Often, {{it is only a}} single street with houses {{on either side of the}} road. Mileham, Norfolk, England is a good example of this. Later development may add side turnings and districts away from the original main street.

These economic pressures - in part driven by the General Motors plant located in Zaragoza - have in recent years resulted in heavy truck and car traffic on the roads of the upper Gave d'Aspe valley, and increased accidents.|$|E

50|$|National Grid plc is {{the network}} {{operator}} (transmission system operator) in Great Britain. National Grid {{is responsible for}} the physical transportation of gas, as shippers are required only to nominate quantities entering and/or exiting the network, and not <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>route</b> which the gas should physically follow. National Grid has the power to bring the system into balance, if shippers as a whole are out of balance. This is achieved by trading on the OCM (see below) and passing the cost onto gas shippers through the cash-out system. When the system is short of gas it tends to force prices at the NBP up. When the system is long gas, the price is forced down. This can provide an advantageous trading environment to a shipper which has flexible flow contracts.|$|E
