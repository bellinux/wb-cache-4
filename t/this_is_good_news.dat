2500|$|As many sprinters are now 20 years old, TOCs are {{beginning}} to replace them. For example, London Midland have decided to replace their ageing Class 150 fleet with Class 172s from 2010. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the passenger as most Sprinters lack air conditioning [...] and have {{a top speed of}} only 75mph. They can be noisy inside, as opening windows are needed for ventilation and there are no pressure doors {{at the end of each}} carriage, next to the external doors.|$|E

We {{do seem to be}} setting bodily into the bay, and if we can only get clear of that island, I do not see what is to hinder it. Here is a famous fellow of a {{mountain}} to the northward, coming down before the wind, as one might say, and giving us a cant into the passage. I should think that chap must produce some sort of a change, whether it be for better or worse." ...|$|E
50|$|After a {{sequence}} has been programmed {{it needs to}} be saved, as when you switch the power off the memory is not stored. The MC-4 had an optional digital cassette recorder called the Roland MTR-100. The owners manual shows that a programmed sequence could also be saved to a standard stereo cassette deck or portable cassette recorder. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> as the MTR-100 is quite rare to find.|$|E
50|$|Burwood Highway {{is part of}} Melbourne's Tram Network. Tram Route 75 {{originally}} terminated at {{the intersection}} of Blackburn Road and Burwood Highway until July 2005, with the completion of the 3 km line extension to Hartland Road in Vermont South. Also, with the introduction of the new myki ticketing system, the tram zone boundaries have also been extended. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for Route 75 passengers travelling across Zone 1+2, as they now only need to pay Zone 1 fares.|$|E
50|$|The {{capture of}} Baghdad, a provincial capital, {{also meant that}} the first Ottoman {{province}} had fallen under British control.

50|$|News of {{the death}} of the Xianfeng Emperor {{encouraged}} the Governor of Hubei, Hu Linyi, to attempt the recovery of Anqing for Qing. However, he died on September 30. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for Chen Yucheng, because Hu Linyi was the most formidable of his enemies.|$|R
60|$|The post of {{this morning}} brought a letter from my sister. We were to expect her return by the next day's train. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> Philip and I might stand in need of clever Helena's help, and we might be sure of getting it now.|$|R
5000|$|Overall {{the state}} of the {{research}} of couples being treated specifically for martial infidelity is in its infancy. One study, looked at 19 couples who had an affair. This study found that both traditional behavioral couples therapy and integrative behavioral couples therapy were effective in increasing intmacy after the affair was disclosed. The authors suggested that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for couples. A greater reliance on behavioral conceptualizations of romantic love [...] intimacy and forgiveness [...] may be helpful in easing the pain of such difficult situations.|$|E
5000|$|Isuzu new rugged ladder-frame chassis {{platform}} dubbed [...] "i-GRIP" [...] (Isuzu Gravity Responsive Intelligent Platform) underpinning the new D-Max makes 42% {{stronger than}} its predecessors leading to improved ride and handling.

Longer wheelbase of 3095mm - 45mm longer than before - is now standard {{on all three}} body styles. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for double cab users as rear riders not only get more leg space but also more comfortable seats.|$|E
50|$|Cantabrian brown {{bears are}} {{often found in}} the park, which {{appears to have a}} key role in the {{corridors}} used by this endangered species.Genetic studies show that the surviving Cantabrian brown bears were divided in the twentieth century into two populations separated by a bear-free zone. (This rupture has been interpreted as the consequence of the development of communication infrastructures and human pressure). However, genetic evidence has been found in Redes of hybridisation, the result of recent breeding between individuals from the two populations. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the bears as it shows that they have found a way to reverse the fragmentation of their habitat.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> indeed! La Paja Brava was {{the name}} of the estate my ancient friend and neighbour, Don Evaristo, had bought so many years before: no doubt I should find some of the family, and they would give me a horse and {{anything}} I wanted.|$|R
50|$|Toxic {{assets were}} placed in a bad bank called Royal Park Investments. Thanks in part to good {{management}} and multi billion euro guarantees by the government the holding performed better than expected. In April 2013 it was sold for 2.3 billion euro to the American investment firm Lone Star. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for public finances (1 billion euro) and the Fortis holding since renamed to Ageas.|$|R
50|$|The NZFC itself {{went through}} a major restructure during this same period to keep Waikato FC and Team Wellington in {{competition}}. To keep the costs down, {{the third round of}} the competition <b>was</b> culled. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for some clubs but not others, especially teams based in the Auckland region. As a compensation for them an extended finals was introduced with each team playing home and away.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2010 Archbishop Neary said “the {{truth of}} past pain is {{certainly}} {{coming to the}} surface. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> We should embrace the truth even though {{this can be a}} painful task.” He continued “however, we should also be aware of the dangers contained in what some have called a ‘culture of blame’. We seek out the negligence of doctors, the health service, bankers, the Church or the school. Maybe this makes it easier to deal with our own shortcomings, the neglect and indifference of others and the tyranny of blind chance. Christ did not encourage us to imprison people by their human failings. Instead he taught us the way of forgiveness.” ...|$|E
50|$|Now that Penny has died, Daniel {{agrees that}} Betty should get {{her job and}} says he'll {{recommend}} it. While <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> to the Suarez family, she tells them that she is cautious. The next day, a funeral for Penny is held (organized by Betty), where everyone is shocked to learn that Penny has a twin sister, Mindy. Penny's life is celebrated, sort of, with Betty giving the eulogy. However, Marc, who turned down the Vogue job, shows up to honor Penny with the announcement that he will take over her job, shocking Betty in a big way. This causes Daniel and Wilhelmina {{to come up with}} a compromise: whoever does the best job in completing Penny's research before the deadline will succeed Penny as the new feature editor.|$|E
5000|$|As many sprinters are now 20 years old, TOCs are {{beginning}} to replace them. For example, London Midland have decided to replace their ageing Class 150 fleet with Class 172 Turbostars from 2010. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the passenger as most Sprinters lack air conditioning [...] and have {{a top speed of}} only 75 mph. They can be noisy inside, as opening windows are needed for ventilation and there are no pressure doors {{at the end of each}} carriage, next to the external doors. It is likely these trains will be 'cascaded' to other TOCs to replace Pacers, which do not meet an accessibility requirement and will be withdrawn by 2019 unless they receive an extensive refurbishment, and it will be withdrawn by 2030 as it is also too old.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1930s, as the Great Depression came to an end, the U.S. economy began to strengthen. [...] <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the Cessna Aircraft Company as Dwane Wallace (Clyde Cessna's nephew who was a {{recently}} graduated aeronautical engineer) decided to assist his uncle in building more modern airplanes. The design of the first Airmaster is credited to Wallace, and the first flight of the C-34 model was in June 1935. Not long after introduction of the C-34, Clyde Cessna retired from aircraft-building activity, leaving the company to his nephew.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{scientists}} have found the new species of bass, {{their goal is to}} make sure that the population and habitat stays healthy by starting conservation practices early instead of later. FWC has found that the biggest danger to the Choctaw bass comes from the spotted bass and the Alabama bass, which are closely related to it. So far everywhere {{scientists have found}} Choctaw bass there has been an absence of the Alabama bass and the spotted bass, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> because the different bass species are often introduced outside of their native range to try and popularize sport fishing, which can offset the native bass. If spotted bass and Alabama bass were to be introduced into the habitat of the Choctaw bass, these species can overtake the Choctaw bass through interbreeding thus lowering the number of purebred Choctaw bass.|$|E

We acknowledge that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> for people regardless of their gender, race or sexual orientation. We believe that, in order to strengthen the Gospel's proclamation of justice to the world, and for the greater glory of God, the Church's own common life must be justly ordered. To that end, we call on our Church to live out {{the promise of the}} Gospel; to celebrate the diverse gifts of {{all the members of the}} Body of Christ; and in the ordering of our common life to open the ministries of deacon, priest and bishop to those called to serve by God, regardless of their sex, race or sexual orientation".|$|E
5000|$|Another participant, Laurie Niles, {{criticized the}} study's characterizations, stating that she wasn't asked to {{identify}} old vs. new violins, only to state her preferences. She {{also noted that the}} organizers adjusted the new violins, while the old violins were in whatever state the lender had them. She said, [...] "I think we can conclude that, with a very limited amount of playing time and under circumstances that are a lot like those in a violin shop (a dry room, lots of testing), we are just as impressed with the tonality of great new instruments as with the tonality of great old ones." [...] She added, [...] "Honestly, I have no issue with the idea that a well-made modern can sound as good as an $8 million Strad. The moderns I played under these odd circumstances were just beautiful-sounding. The old Italians were, too. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for us violinists, because virtually none of us can afford a multi-million dollar Strad." ...|$|E
50|$|In Brno, he {{established}} himself amongst the theatrical and literary circles of the time. Noted for his poetry and his artwork, he became {{best known for}} his theater posters which contained his unique brand of surrealism and humour. <b>This</b> unique style <b>was</b> popular with the people, but not with the communist regime, and it eventually landed him in 'hot water'; in 1978, he was forced to flee his motherland and ended up in far-away Sydney, Australia. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the theater scene in Australia as it was in long awaited need of something new and edgy, and Pepča brought and planted his unique style there.|$|R
60|$|Collecting {{others of}} his {{scattered}} followers, Hereward kept up his warfare {{from his own}} house at Bourn, continually harassing the Normans, until at length he took prisoner his old enemy, Ivo Taillebois, and, {{as the price of}} his liberty, required him to make his peace with the Conqueror. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> to William, who highly esteemed his valor and constancy, and could accuse him of no breach of faith, since he had made no engagements to him. Hereward was therefore received as a subject of King William, retained his own estate, and died there at a good old age, respected by both Saxons and Normans.|$|R
60|$|Next day the {{old order}} of life was resumed in the village. And {{the arrival of a}} heavily laden pack-train, under the {{guidance}} of Withers, attested {{to the fact that the}} Mormons meant not only to continue to live in the valley, but also to build and plant and enlarge. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> to Shefford. At least the village could be made less lonely. And there was plenty of work to give him excuse for staying there. Furthermore, Withers brought a message form Bishop Kane to the effect that the young man was offered a place as teacher in the school, in co-operation with the Mormon teachers. Shefford experienced no twinge of conscience when he accepted.|$|R
50|$|At {{home that}} evening, Jen and Tommy ignore {{constantly}} ringing phones. The news {{reports that there}} was a massive voter turnout and that Carcetti is in the lead. Similar scenes unfold at Royce and Gray's homes. Tommy learns that Bond is beating Demper in the State's Attorney race. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for Tommy, as it shows a lack of support for Royce's ticket. Jen convinces Tommy {{to go for a walk}} with her. They make their way around the harbor and Tommy tells Jen that he hopes to make Baltimore great again. She is positive about his chances. He gets a call from D'Agostino to tell him that Royce has conceded, making him the presumptive mayor-elect because Baltimore is such a heavily Democratic city. Tommy is unsure whether he is happy about the win but finally breaks into a smile. They make their way to a celebration and Tommy thanks his supporters and his opponents, appealing for their help in the forthcoming general election and in improving Baltimore for their children. Council President Naresse Campbell congratulates Carcetti. Jen tells him that she is going home and to enjoy his night. Davis also attends the party and is unashamed of his actions, telling Carcetti he let him off lightly.|$|E

60|$|Ellen bent swift {{steps toward}} her camp. Long shafts of gold preceded {{her through the}} forest. Then they paled and vanished. The tips of pines and spruces turned gold. A hoarse-voiced old turkey gobbler was booming his chug-a-lug from the highest ground, and the softer chick of hen turkeys {{answered}} him. Ellen was almost breathless when she arrived. Two packs {{and a couple of}} lop-eared burros attested to the fact of Antonio's return. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for Ellen. She heard the bleat of lambs and tinkle of bells coming nearer and nearer. And she was glad to feel that if Isbel had visited her camp, most probably it was during the absence of the herders.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was,</b> indeed, <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> The {{inhabitants}} of Farley's had been anxiously awaiting {{the day when}} {{it would be possible to}} earn something toward the household expenses, and this first evidence that the works were really to be opened caused a great amount of pleasurable excitement.|$|R

Robert swiftly raised an army and set out for Lincoln, joining forces with Ranulf on the way. Stephen held a council of war at which his advisors counselled that he leave a force and depart to safety, but Stephen disregarded the odds and decided to fight, but was obliged to surrender to Robert. Ranulf took advantage of disarray amongst the king’s followers and {{in the weeks after}} the fighting managed to take the Earl of Richmond’s northern castles and capture him when he tried to ambush Ranulf. Richmond was put in chains and tortured until he submitted to Ranulf and did him homage.|$|R
