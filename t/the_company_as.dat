5|$|A 1996 E. Coli {{outbreak}} {{at one of}} Burger King's largest beef providers, Hudson Foods, gave Tyson Foods one of {{its largest}} business coups. Hudson {{was one of the}} largest poultry providers in the United States and one of Tyson's largest competitors when they moved into beef processing at the behest of Burger King. Once it had secured a contract with Burger King, Hudson opened a beef processing plant in Nebraska. When the plant was identified as the source of an E.

5|$|Even {{though the}} {{original}} Insta-Burger King had rapidly expanded {{throughout the state}} and its operations totaled more than 40 locations by 1955, the group ran into financial difficulties. McLamore and Edgarton purchased the national rights to the chain in 1959 and rechristened <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>as</b> Burger King of Miami. The company eventually became known as Burger King Corporation and began selling territorial licenses to private franchisees across the US by 1959.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>as</b> a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics.

5|$|KFC popularized {{chicken in}} the fast food industry, diversifying the market by {{challenging}} the established dominance of the hamburger. In 1960 the company had around 200 franchised restaurants; by 1963 this had grown to over 600, making it the largest fast food operation in the United States. In 1963, Sanders met John Y. Brown, Jr, a young Kentucky encyclopaedia salesman, who {{explained that he was}} keen to join the company. Sanders instead proposed the sale of <b>the</b> <b>company,</b> <b>as</b> business skills did not come naturally to him, and he lacked an obvious or willing heir among his relatives.|$|E
5|$|Kartodikromo {{was born}} in Blora, Central Java, Dutch East Indies, in 1890 to a low-ranking priyayi (noble) family.

5|$|Lacking {{sufficient}} funds himself, Brown {{convinced the}} financier Jack C.

The group acquired the company in 1964 for US$2 million (around US$15 million in 2013). The contract included a lifetime salary for Sanders and the agreement that he would be the company's quality controller and trademark.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{subsequently}} {{served as}} a second lieutenant in the Virginia Volunteers during the Mexican–American War.

5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> <b>As</b> Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut; they spent the summer in Amagansett, Long Island. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic {{and had to be}} terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her gynecological problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>as</b> they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E
