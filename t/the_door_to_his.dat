The episode ends with Carrie pausing before anything happens to Quinn.|$|E
25|$|Then on 24 December, Darlan {{was assassinated}} in mysterious circumstances. On the {{afternoon}} of 24 December 1942, the admiral drove to his offices at the Palais d'Été and was shot down at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> bureau by a young man of 20, Bonnier de la Chapelle, a monarchist. The young man was tried by court martial under Giraud's orders and executed on the 26th. With the strong backing of the Allies, especially Eisenhower, Giraud was elected to succeed Darlan.|$|E
500|$|At 7:00 am on {{the morning}} of June 21, 1957, Fisher {{answered}} a knock on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> room, Room 839. Upon opening the door, he was confronted by FBI agents who addressed him as [...] "colonel" [...] and stated that they had [...] "information concerning [...] involvement in espionage." [...] Fisher knew that the FBI's use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen. Fisher said nothing to the FBI and, after spending twenty-three minutes staring at Fisher, the FBI agents called in the waiting Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who arrested Fisher and detained him under section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.|$|E

5000|$|Homestead Cabin/STS Lodge: The {{original}} Estes homestead, {{built in}} 1925, the Homestead Cabin {{was the principal}} building of the STS Ranch. It was expanded gradually, evolving from a square to a T-shaped plan with additions for a lounge, dining room and library. <b>The</b> homestead's <b>doors</b> are notably short, since Buster Estes was short and adapted <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> dimensions.|$|R
500|$|Merriam, scorned by the crew, {{finds that}} {{he can no longer}} lock <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cabin. Fearing for his life, he tries to steal a gun from the ship's weapons locker, but is confronted by Captain Stone. Stone dares Merriam {{to try to get the}} support of the crew, but Merriam is rebuffed in this effort. This changes when Radioman Winslow (Edmund Glover) {{receives}} a radiogram asking if Merriam is on board, and Captain Stone orders Winslow to lie, replying that Merriam is not aboard. [...] The radioman shows Merriam the captain's reply radiogram and says that he now mistrusts the captain and will send a message to the company expressing his concerns about Stone's mental health. However, as he leaves Merriam's cabin, Winslow encounters the captain. As the two walk side-by-side, Winslow drops the captain's radiogram to the deck, and it is picked up by an illiterate crewman, Finn the Mute (Skelton Knaggs), whose internal monologues serve as a sort of one-man Greek chorus throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|The raiders {{successfully}} sneaked {{past the}} outer garrisons of provincial militia, and were first spotted in the pre-dawn light by a villager. [...] Firing his gun {{to raise the}} alarm, {{he ran for the}} village, with the French and Indians in noisy pursuit. [...] The action quickly became general as the raiders descended on the houses in the village. [...] One of the colonial garrisons was stationed in the home of the minister, Benjamin Rolfe, who had barred the door in an attempt to keep the raiders out. [...] Raiders fired through the door, wounding Rolfe, and then broke the door down. They then slaughtered Rolfe, his wife, infant child, and the colonial militiamen, who, [...] "paralyzed by fear", were begging for mercy. [...] In another house, one baby was thrown through an open window by a raider but suffered no injury. [...] A number of villagers escaped by hiding in cellars whose trapdoors were not discovered by the raiders. [...] Captain Wainwright was preparing to organize a defense when gunfire from the raiders passed through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house, killing him instantly.|$|E
500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several head shot photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him. Tom Wolfe characterised Shepard's dual personalities as [...] "Smilin' Al" [...] and the [...] "Icy Commander". [...] "Inside his locker", Wolfe wrote, [...] "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Plato {{also held}} {{rational}} insight {{to a very}} high standard, as is seen in his works such as Meno and The Republic. Plato taught on the Theory of Forms (or the Theory of Ideas) which asserts that non-material abstract (but substantial) forms (or ideas), and not the material world of change known to us through sensation, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality. Plato's forms are accessible only to reason and not to sense. In fact, {{it is said that}} Plato admired reason, especially in geometry, so highly that he had the phrase [...] "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter" [...] inscribed over <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> academy.|$|E

2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection. He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. When he confronts her about her lies after she discovers he lied to her, she says, [...] "Just because I chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give {{you the right to}} be rude!": and Andrew replies, [...] "How about driving my father away? Do I get to be rude then?", and shuts the door in her face. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 ADC offices {{suffered}} {{a series of}} violent attacks. On August 16, a bomb exploded in the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee office in Boston, severely injuring two police officers. On October 29 an arson fire damaged the ADC office in Washington, D.C. On October 11, {{the day after the}} ending of the Achille Lauro incident where a Jewish American died, [...] Alex Odeh, ADC's west-coast regional director, was killed in a bombing as he opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> office. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) suspected Jewish Defense League and Jewish Defense Organization members. Although Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin, who lived in Southern California, made some controversial statements about the bombing, the investigation focused on Robert Manning and his wife Rochelle who fled to Israel. They eventually were prosecuted on another bombing charge and Manning is serving a life sentence on that charge. In 2007, the FBI revealed they had received information from a deceased informant, believed to be former Jewish Defense League member Earl Krugel who had been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for 2001 plots to bomb a Southern California mosque and office of U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, who is Arab-American. It is believed that Irv Rubin, who committed suicide in 2002 in custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Los Angeles while awaiting trial on the same charges, revealed to Krugel the names of those responsible for Odeh's death and that Krugel shared those with the FBI before he was murdered in prison in 2005. The bombers are believed to be Manning and two individuals now living in Israel. ADC continues to honor Odeh’s memory and call for prosecution of his killers. The FBI has failed to arrest anyone in the Odeh bombing case.|$|E

Coincidentally, Librescu's act of heroism happened on the 27th of Nisan on the Jewish lunar calendar. That date is Yom HaShoah which is Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel.|$|R
60|$|A rumor of the odd {{character}} of the priest had spread from the sentinel at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> comrades; so that when Harvey and Wharton reached the open space before the building, they found a dozen idle dragoons loitering about with the waggish intention of quizzing the fanatic, and employed in affected admiration of the steeds.|$|E

60|$|When Norman of Torn {{regained his}} senses, {{he found himself}} in a small tower room in a strange castle.
