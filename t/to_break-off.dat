Using the spatial and temporal distribution of the magmatic rocks, their major- and trace-element features, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope characteristics, we suggest that lithospheric extension in the Pannonian Basin had {{a major role in the}} generation of the magmas. Dehydration of subducting slab should have resulted in thorough metasomatism in the mantle wedge during Cretaceous to early Miocene that would have lowered the melting temperature, therefore playing an indirect role in the generation of magmas later on. Mixing between mantle-derived magmas and lower-crustal melts was an important process at the fi rst stage of the silicic and calc-alkaline magmatism in the Northern Pannonian Basin. However, the crustal component gradually decreased with time, which is consistent with magmatic activity in a continuously thinning con-tinental plate.

Authors attribute uplift <b>to</b> <b>break-off</b> {{of the southern}} Neo-Tethys slab beneath the Bitlis–Zagros Suture at ~ 15 – 10 Ma, coupled with continued plate convergence and regional crustal shortening. Since this time {{there has been an}} upsurge in mantle-derived collision magmatism over large parts of NW Iran, Eastern Anatolia and the Lesser Caucasus, potentially hundreds of kilometres from the site of southern Neo-Tethys slab break-off, > 10 Myr after the proposed break-off event. Whole rock elemental and Sr–Nd–Pb–Hf isotope data are presented for < 3 Ma trachy-basalt to trachy-basaltic andesite lavas erupted in Armenia in the South Caucasus. Samples formed by < 5 % melting of fertile subduction-modified spinel-facies lithospheric mantle, and few display elemental or isotopic evidence for contamination by the 45 -km thick Mesozoic–Paleogene arc crust or South Armenian Block continental crust. Recent magmatic activity in Armenia may not be a direct consequence of southern Neo-Tethys slab break-off 300 – 450 km away, beneath the Bitlis Suture. Late Miocene break-off of a second (northern Neo-Tethys) slab beneath the Pontide Arc may have allowed asthenospheric upwelling over a wider area than was affected by southern Neo-Tethyan break-off. However, whole-scale delamination of mantle lithosphere is ruled out due to the modest degrees of partial melting, a lack of asthenospheric components and limited crustal involvement in magmatism. Small-scale sub-lithospheric convection may be complementary <b>to</b> <b>break-off,</b> causing localised removal of lithospheric mantle and aiding the occurrence of melting for a significant time interval after the break-off event(s). Collision magmas such as those in Armenia represent mantle-derived additions to continental crust, enriched in incompatible elements but with Th/La ratios≤ 0. 2, much lower than those calculated for continental crust (0. 25 – 0. 3). Collision magmatism in Turkic-style orogens must be balanced by infra-crustal recycling and delamination to produce bulk continental crust...|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of drop formation under gravity {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} elasticity using a set of low-viscosity, ideal elastic fluids and an equivalent Newtonian glycerol-water solution. All solutions had the same shear viscosity, equilibrium surface tension, and density, but differed greatly in elasticity. The minimum drop radius {{in the early stages of}} drop formation (necking) was found to scale as expected from potential flow theory, independent of the elasticity of the solutions. Thus, during this stage of drop formation when viscous force is still weak, the dynamics are controlled by a balance between inertial and capillary forces, and there is no contribution of elastic stresses of the polymer. However, upon formation of the pinch regions, there is a large variation in the drop development <b>to</b> <b>break-off</b> observed between the various solutions. The elastic solutions formed secondary fluid threads either side of a secondary drop from the necked region of fluid between the upper and lower pinches, which were sustained for increasing amounts of time. The break-off lengths and times increase with increasing elasticity of the solutions. Evolution of the filament, length is, however, identical in shape and form for all of the polymer solutions tested, regardless of differing elasticity. This de-coupling between filament growth rate and break-up time (or equivalently, final filament length at break-up) is rationalised. A modified force balance to that of Jones and Rees [48] is capable of correctly predicting the filament growth of these low-viscosity, elastic fluids in the absence of any elastic contributions due to polymer extension within the elongating filament. The elongation of the necked region of fluid (which becomes the filament) is dominated by the inertia of the drop, and is independent of the elasticity of the solution. However, elasticity does strongly influence the resistance of the pinch regions <b>to</b> <b>break-off,</b> with rapid necking resulting in extremely high rates of surface contraction on approach to the pinch point, initiating extension of the polymer chains within the pinch regions. This de-coupling phenomenon is peculiar to low-viscosity, elastic fluids as extension does not occur prior to the formation of the pinch points (i. e. just prior to break-up), as opposed to the high viscosity counterparts in which extension of polymers in solution may occur even during necking. Once steady-state extension of the polymers is achieved within the pinch at high extension rates, the thread undergoes elasto-capillary break-up as the capillarity again overcomes the viscoelastic forces. The final length at detachment and time-to-break-off (relative to the equivalent Newtonian fluid) is shown to be linearly proportional to the longest relaxation time of the fluid.

40|$|The Taconic orogeny in Newfoundland {{consisted}} of three accretionary events (Taconic 1, 2, and 3). Taconic 1 is represented by ca. 495 Ma, west-directed obduction of the infant-arc Lushs Bight oceanic tract (510 – 501 Ma) onto the peri-Laurentian Dashwoods microcontinent. Subduction is inferred to have initiated at a spreading center abandoned during an inboard ridge jump responsible for separation of Dash-woods from Laurentia and opening of the Humber seaway. Clogging of the subduction zone by Dashwoods forced subduction to step back into the Humber seaway. Inception of the new subduction zone led to formation of the ca. 490 Ma Baie Verte oceanic tract. Closure of the Humber seaway formed the Notre Dame arc (489 – 477 Ma) built on Dashwoods and the coeval Snooks Arm arc built on the Baie Verte oceanic tract. Sea-way closure led to collision (Taconic 2) between the arcs and Laurentia, which caused significant shortening of the Notre Dame arc. After a magmatic gap of 7 – 10 m. y., the Notre Dame arc records a voluminous flare-up of predominantly tonalite magmatism (464 – 459 Ma) during the waning stages of Taconic 2. Magmatism overlaps with deformation and includes both arc and non-arc-like tonalite. This flare-up was related <b>to</b> <b>break-off</b> of the oceanic lithosphere of the downgoing slab.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{compilation}} and comparison of geochemical data of Aegean Eocene to Recent magmatic rocks: (1) North Anatolian Eocene magmatic rocks (NAEM), (2) Aegean to west Anatolian Oligocene–Miocene magmatic rocks (AOMM), (3) Pliocene–Quaternary South Aegean volcanic arc (SAVA), (4) Pliocene–Quaternary Denizli–Isparta volcanics (DIV), and (5) Na-alkaline basalts with intra-plate geochemical affinity (IPV). These rocks are also compared with Miocene Galatean volcanics (GVP) from central Anatolia. The NAEM, SAVA and GVP show similar geochemical features {{indicative of a}} subduction-related origin in which subducted oceanic plate contaminated the overlying mantle wedge. The distinct geochemical features of the AOMM reflect derivation from an intensely metasomatised mantle source, resulting from partial subduction and accretion of both continental and oceanic assemblages in the fore-arc of a southward migrating subduction system. These features provide an insight {{into the history of}} the distinct types of mantle metasomatism in the region and into its geodynamic evolution — an evolution that include complex interaction of subduction roll-back, slab break-off, strike-slip faulting along major transfer zones, block rotations and core complex formation. Thus, the Eocene to recent magmatism in the region was controlled by various tectonic events: (1) the NAEM was most probably related <b>to</b> <b>break-off</b> of the subducted slab in western Anatolia, (2) magmatic activity in the western AOMM was controlled by rotational extension around poles in northern Greece developed in response to rotational roll-back of the Hellenic subduction system, (3) while AOMM magmatism in the east is closely associated with core complex formation and asthenosphere-related thermal input along a ~ N–S-trending slab tear.

Here we present new U-Pb zircon geochronology and whole rock geochemistry and neodymium isotopes from Early Paleozoic volcanic ashes and siliciclastic units on the northern Appalachian margin of Laurentia. Volcanic ashes in the Table Point Formation of Newfoundland and the Indian River Formation of the Taconic allochthon in New York yield dates between 466. 16 ± 0. 12 and 464. 20 ± 0. 13 Ma. Red, bioturbated slate of the Indian River Formation record a shift to more juvenile neodymium isotope values suggesting sedimentary contributions from the Taconic arc-system by 466 Ma. Eight ashes within the Trenton Group in the Mohawk Valley were dated between 452. 63 ± 0. 06 and 450. 68 ± 0. 12 Ma. These ashes contain zircon with Late Ordovician magmatic rims and 1. 4 to 1. 0 Ga xenocrystic cores that were inherited from Grenville basement, suggesting that the parent magmas erupted through the Laurentian margin. The new geochronological and geochemical data are integrated with a subsidence model and data from the hinterland to refine the tectonic model of the Taconic orogeny. Closure of the Iapetus Ocean by 475 Ma via collision of the peri-Gondwanan Moretown terrane with hyperextended distal fragments of the Laurentian margin is not clearly manifested on the autochthon or the Taconic allochthon other than an increase in sediment accumulation. Pro-foreland basins formed during the Middle Ordovician when these terranes were obducted onto the Laurentian margin. 466 to 464 Ma ashes on the Laurentian margin coincide with a late pulse of magmatism in both the Notre Dame arc in Newfoundland and the Shelburne Falls arc of New England that is potentially related <b>to</b> <b>break-off</b> of an east-dipping slab. Following slab reversal, by 455 Ma, the Bronson Hill arc was established on the new composite Laurentian margin.

40|$|In {{doing this}} paper, the {{researcher}} {{intended to use}} historical data gathered on early Coon Prairie and Westby in order to write a narrative account to the community. This material would cover the background to settlement, the process of settlement itself, and significant developments in social history of the community. Intentions were to cover the years up {{to the beginning of}} the twentieth century, however, it became necessary in dealing with certain subjects, such as the histories of local churches and schools, to follow through <b>to</b> logical <b>break-off</b> points rather than stop exactly at 1900. Methods and procedures used in gathering the data were standard historical research techniques. County histories and Wisconsin histories and atlases containing material dealing with the area were consulted as were all relevant issues of the Wisconsin Magazine of History. Local church histories were used and translated as necessary. Microfilmed copies of back issues of local newspapers were extensively utilized as were available data from such sources as file clippings and pamphlets in the Westby Public Library, Vernon County Museum, Area Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, and the State Historical Society Library in Madison...|$|R
40|$|The {{tongue of}} Triftgletscher, Switzerland, is {{particularly}} susceptible <b>to</b> major <b>break-off</b> events due <b>to</b> its steep slope. In order to detect precursors {{of such an}} event, we monitored the local seismic activity and detected 2426 icequakes with sources located in an area ranging between 2050 and 2350 m a. s. l. Events triggered by cracks and icefalls were recorded, but no precise {{distinction between the two}} sources was possible using duration or frequency criteria. Clusters of seismic activity were located and confirmed by visual observations. We performed a surface motion analysis and found that surface motion was driven significantly by runoff changes at a timescale of 2 - 3 days. By means of a statistical analysis, a power-law behaviour of the released seismic energy distribution was discerned at certain times during the period investigated. Variations in power-law exponent values indicated that low- and high-energy events predominantly occurred during phases of enhanced and reduced surface motion, respectively. Substantial releases of seismic energy likely to signal the glacier recoupling were detected during phases of decreasing runoff. Clues to potential seismic precursors of break-off events are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A cold hanging glacier {{located on}} the south face of the Grandes Jorasses (Mont Blanc, Italy) broke off on the 23 and 29  September 2014 with a total {{estimated}} ice volume of 105   000  m 3. Thanks to accurate surface displacement measurements taken up <b>to</b> the final <b>break-off,</b> this event was successfully predicted 10  days in advance, enabling local authorities to take the necessary safety measures. The break-off event also confirmed that surface displacements experienced a power law acceleration along with superimposed log-periodic oscillations prior to the final rupture. This paper describes the methods used to achieve a satisfactory time forecast in real time and demonstrates, using a retrospective analysis, their potential {{for the development of}} early-warning systems in real time...|$|R
30|$|Laser-produced surface {{nanostructures}} show considerable {{promise for}} many applications while fundamental {{questions concerning the}} corresponding mechanisms of structuring are still debated. Here, we present a simple physical model describing those mechanisms happened in a thin metal film on dielectric substrate irradiated by a tightly focused ultrashort laser pulse. The main ingredients included into the model are (i) the film–substrate hydrodynamic interaction, melting and separation of the film from substrate with velocity increasing with increase of absorbed fluence; (ii) the capillary forces decelerating expansion of the expanding flying film; and (iii) rapid freezing into a solid state if the rate of solidification is comparable or larger than hydrodynamic velocities. The developed model and performed simulations explain appearance of microbump inside the focal spot on the film surface. The model follows experimental findings about gradual transformation of the bump from small parabolic to a conical shape and to the bump with a jet on its tip with increasing fluence. Disruption of the bump {{as a result of}} thinning down the liquid film to a few interatomic distances or due <b>to</b> mechanical <b>break-off</b> of solid film is described together with the jetting and formation of one or many droplets. Developed theory opens door for optimizing laser parameters for intended nanostructuring in applications.|$|R
40|$|Post-nappe brittle {{structures}} {{across the}} Austroalpine-Penninic wedge {{are representative of}} two principal deformation stages. The former (D 1) developed during the Late Oligocene, the latter (D 2) from the Miocene to the Present. Major D 1 features are the E-W Aosta-Ranzola half-graben and the NE-SW Ospizio Sottile subvertical normal fault system. Oligocene extension was also characterized by hydrothermal activity and intrusion of calc-alkaline to ultra-potassic dikes. From the Miocene onwards (D 2), the Ospizio Sottile system was re-activated as a SE sinistral boundary of the Pennine-Graian Alps block of nappes, bodily {{moving away from the}} Simplon detachment to the SW. Inside the escaping block, a number of D 2 slightly diverging sublatitudinal splays (Aosta-Piccolo San Bernardo system) was generated, as well as a regular set of NW-trending normal faults from the Simplon to the Gran Paradiso massif. Instead, the Aosta-Ranzola system was poorly reworked in that time. More generally, the short-lived Oligocene extension (D 1) was associated <b>to</b> slab <b>break-off</b> of lower plate, wedge rebound, rapid uplift and thermal perturbation. From the Early Miocene onwards the Oligocene extension was replaced by renewed compression, allowing the vertical extrusion of the Lepontine dome and lateral escape of the overlying Pennine-Graian Alps block...|$|R
