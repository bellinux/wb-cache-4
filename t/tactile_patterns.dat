40|$|This paper proposes an {{artificial}} <b>tactile</b> <b>pattern</b> recognition system, which combines recognition by touching the object surface with {{an artificial}} tactile sense and recognition by grasping the object with an artificial hand. The inspiration for this proposition {{was found in}} the function of the tactile sense of a human hand. The fundermental principle of artificial <b>tactile</b> <b>pattern</b> recognition is to process a stress distribution that the unknown object produces in the artificial tactile sense elements. In the proposed method, the 3 -dimensional stress distribution is partitioned into a 2 -dimensional peripheral pattern and a threshold decrement by analogy with threshold phenomena in the living body. The object surface is recognized as a sequence of the peripheral processings at each threshold decrement. A simple experiment classifying cylinders and square pillars was performed by the artificial hand with on-off switches instead of the pressure sense elements. As the result, a high reliability of recognition is obtained. 1...|$|R

40|$|The main {{target of}} this work is to improve human-robot {{interaction}} capabilities, by adding a new modality of sense, touch, to KASPAR, a humanoid robot. Large scale distributed skin-like sensors are designed and integrated on the robot, covering KASPAR at various locations. One of the challenges is to classify different types of touch. Unlike digital images represented by grids of pixels, the geometrical structure of the sensor array limits the capability of straightforward application of well-established approaches for image patterns. This paper introduces a novel histogram-based classification algorithm, transforming tactile data into histograms of local features termed as codebook. <b>Tactile</b> <b>pattern</b> can be invariant at periodical locations, allowing <b>tactile</b> <b>pattern</b> classification using {{a smaller number of}} training data, instead of using training data from everywhere on the large scale skin sensors. To generate the codebook, this method uses a two-layer approach, namely local neighbourhood structures and encodings of pressure distribution of the local neighbourhood. Classification is performed based on the constructed features using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the intersection kernel. Real experimental data are used for experiment to classify different patterns and have shown promising accuracy. To evaluate the performance, it is also compared with the SVM using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and results are discussed from both aspects of accuracy and the location invariance property...|$|R

The key components of the proposed approach are (1) an algorithm that segments a scene into perceptually uniform segments; (2) a procedure for generating perceptually distinct tactile patterns; and (3) a mapping of the visual textures of the segments into tactile textures that convey similar concepts. We used existing digital halftoning and other techniques to generate {{a wide variety of}} tactile textures. We then conducted formal and informal subjective tests with sighted (but visually blocked) and visually-impaired subjects to determine the ability of human tactile perception to perceive differences among them.

40|$|People {{often fail}} to detect changes between {{successively}} presented <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns,</b> a phenomenon known as tactile change blindness. In this study, we investigated whether changes introduced to <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns</b> are detected better when a participant's {{attention is focused on}} the location where the change occurs. Across two experiments, participants (N = 55) were instructed to detect changes between two consecutively presented <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns.</b> In half of the trials, the stimulated body sites in the two patterns were identical.

Endogenous (or voluntary) attention was manipulated by instructing participants which new bodily location was most likely to be stimulated. We found that changes at the attended location were detected more accurately than changes at bodily locations that were unattended. This finding demonstrates that attention can effectively modulate tactile change detection.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this chapter {{is to give the}} reader {{insights}} into the human factors issues related to the use of tactile displays. Torso-mounted displays, which are particularly suited for direction and orientation cues, are emphasized. First, perceptual issues relevant to tactile stimulation are discussed. These include issues regarding spatial acuity and absolute localization of tactile cues on the torso, such as internal reference points, anchor points, and spatial accuracy. In addition, tactile illusions, burst durations, and temporal effects are discussed in relation to tactile torso display design. A second section focuses on issues related to coding principles; that is, how best to develop <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns</b> to be intuitively understood within a specific operational context. Cognitive issues are then addressed, such as how tactile stimulation can either alleviate or exacerbate attention tunneling, {{and the extent to which}} multiple <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns</b> can be used effectively. Cognitive processes related to tactile cueing are described, followed by issues related to multisensory integration and multifunction displays. Finally, issues related to user acceptance are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Perceptual {{segregation}} in rapidly changing visual displays can be facilitated by a synchronized salient sound that segregates itself from other {{sounds in the}} sequence (Vroomen & de Gelder, 2000). We examined whether this “freezing” phenomenon {{can also be found}} in tactile perception. Three vibrators were placed on the participant's palm to produce four different <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns.</b> Four sounds were presented separately and simultaneously with each of the four <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns.</b> Among the three same-pitch tones, an abrupt high-pitch tone was presented simultaneously with the designated temporal position of the target pattern in the sequence of tactual stimuli that was presented rapidly and repeatedly. The task was to identify the tactile pattern of the target. Results showed that participants responded faster and more accurately with the high-pitch tone, compared to the condition when all the tones were of the same pitch. However, the result reversed when an extra tactile cue was presented on the wrist. This suggests that a salient auditory signal can improve perceptual segregation not only in vision but also in touch. That is, it is a cross-modal facilitation, not an alerting or attentional cueing effect...|$|E

Although Braille reading is tactile, it does not activate the somatosensory cortex, but the primary visual cortex (striate area) or area 17.

40|$|An element {{having the}} {{mechanism}} of timevarying threshold has been proposed by S. Aida and denoted as an IMICTRON. Several applications of the IMICTRON have already been discussed. The most distinguishing property of the IMICTRON is its time-varying threshold level with a function of reintegration, which {{makes it possible to}} realize a fuzzy logic, such as required for the dynamic visual-pattern-recognition network discussed here. The other method using the time-varying threshold is named the Varishold method, which is an abbreviation of the variable threshold method. In this system, the threshold is applied in a descrete time, whose level is variable in each sampling time.

It can for example {{be used to}} give directions to visually impaired individuals, or for waypoint navigation while cycling on busy streets, when vision or audition should not be loaded further.

We compared the just noticeable difference (JND) of the coupled and the individual variables. The results show that the perception of the coupled variable can be characterised by JND smaller than JNDs of the individual variables. This allowed us to create short tactile pattens (tactons) for display of direction and speed, which can be distinguished significantly better than tactons based on motion alone. Additionally, most subjects were also able to identify the coupled-variable tactons better than the magnitude-based tactons...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ultrasound (US) elastography {{can provide}} {{information}} about the hardness of calcification and might help decide treatment strategy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the hardness of the calcific area within rotator cuffs by US elastography as an aid for the selection of aspiration or fine-needle repeated puncture for the treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendinosis. Methods: This prospective study included 39 patients (32 males, 7 females; mean age, 52. 9 years) who received US elastography and gray-scale ultrasonography before US-guided treatment for rotator cuff calcific tendinosis. The morphology of the calcifications was classified as arc, fragmented, nodular, and cystic types. US elastography using virtual touch imaging (acoustic radiation force impulse) technique was performed to examine the calcified region to obtain an elastogram that was graded dark, intermediate, or bright. The hardness of the calcifications were recorded, and graded as hard, sand-like, or fluid-like <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns</b> during the US-guided treatment, and the <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns</b> were compared with the results of US elastography and gray-scale ultrasonography. Results: Though the morphologies of the calcifications were significantly related to the tactile pattern of the needle punctures (p <  0. 001), gray-scale US could not accurately demonstrate the hardness of the calcifications. With the aid of elastography, the fluid-like tactile pattern could be predicted well as a nondark pattern by elastography (p <  0. 001). Conclusion: Ultrasound elastography is a useful modality for evaluation of rotator cuff calcific tendinosis, and as an aid to guide management. If elastography shows the calcified area as a non-dark pattern, then fine-needle aspiration should be performed...|$|E

While some simulators can produce strong vibro-tactile sensations, discrimination of several <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns</b> can remain quite poor. Currently used actuators, such as shaking motor, have also technological and methodological restrictions. We designed a vibro-tactile pen and software to create tactons and semantic sequences of vibro-tactile patterns on mobile devices (iPAQ pocket PC). We proposed special games and techniques to simplify learning and manipulating vibro-tactile patterns. The technique for manipulating vibro-tactile sequences is based on gesture recognition and spatial-temporal mapping for imaging vibro-tactile signals.

40|$|Manipulation and {{grasping}} have key {{importance in}} most types of interactions {{between humans and}} the world surrounding them [1, 2]. Even if almost all existing haptic interfaces provide a user interaction based on a single contact point, an increased number of contact points, not only allows to display a more natural haptic interaction [3, 4], but also improves the quality of interaction that users can perform in the environment. Haptic exploration is highly dependent {{on the number of}} fingers used for exploration of common objects [5], the largest difference appearing between the ‘one finger’ and the ‘two fingers’ conditions [6], and as proven by Jansson et al.

However, those studies found very high correlations between roughness scaling by humans and measures of spatial variation in SAI and RA firing rates. The present study used textured surfaces composed of dots of varying height (280 – 620 mm) and diameter (0. 25 – 2. 5 mm) in psychophysical and neuro-physiological experiments.

40|$|The rodent whisker-barrel {{system has}} been an ideal model for {{studying}} somatosensory representations in the cortex.

The spatiotemporal pattern of whisker irradiation thus produced a barrel-cortical response with a specific spatiotemporal pattern as evidenced by electrophysiological and functional MRI (fMRI) studies.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis took as its starting point {{the question of whether}} touch has the information processing characteristics required to deal with speech transforms. A review of the current status of tactile speech prostheses and of the range of potential limitations to touch's ability to deal with speech transforms, lead to the identification of two specific research foci. First, it was argued that an appropriate strategy for tactile aid development is to establish where tactile and auditory processes overlap and where they differ, then to take advantage of any similarities, or compensate for any differences, between these modalities {{in the design of the}} prosthesis. In line with this argument, a series of experiments was undertaken to test previous suggestions that there is an underlying similarity between auditory and tactile representations of stimuli. In support of these claims, it was found that auditory and tactile versions of patterns are easier to compare than are auditory and visual versions of those patterns. Subsequent research revealed that one aspect of this processing affinity between touch and hearing is that both modalities, unlike vision, process temporally distributed information more efficiently than spatially distributed information. This finding has broader theoretical significance in view of the current controversy regarding the division of senses according to a spatial vs temporal criterion. The second research focus addressed was whether touch has the spatial and temporal acuity required to deal with speech transforms. It was argued that the limiting factors in tactile spatial and temporal acuity were more likely to occur at the higher level of touch's ability to deal with the strong interactive effects between pattern elements, rather than at the lower level of two-point thresholds in time and space. As masking is a primary interactive force between tactile pattern elements, an attempt was made to resolve the ongoing debate regarding the extent to which tactile masking effects either limit the perception of complex <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns</b> by obscuring the identity of pattern elements or facilitate this task via a process of perceptual integration. This question was investigated by measuring the discriminability of three-element <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns</b> as the spatial and temporal separation, and hence the level of masking, between pattern elements was varied. It was expected that performance would De best at closer element spacings, due to the greater opportunity for perceptual integration to occur. Contrary to this prediction, it was found that the increasing levels of masking induced by decreasing the spatial and temporal separation between pattern elements caused a decrease in the discriminability of the patterns. One caveat to the acceptance of this result was the possibility that training may be required before touch can take advantage of any beneficial interactions between pattern elements, a possibility supported by the anecdotal reports of the subjects. Tentative support for this suggestion was provided by a pattern learning experiment involving three subjects from the previous experiment. After brief experience with closely spaced <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns,</b> the subjects were able to discriminate these stimuli at least as well as widely spaced <b>tactile</b> <b>patterns.</b> While failing to demonstrate the proposed beneficial effects of integration, these results did indicate that close spatial and temporal proximity between tactile pattern elements may not adversely affect the discriminability of those patterns. If subsequent research confirms this tentative finding, then the implication for tactile speech prostheses is that the display employed need not avoid the strong masking effects induced by close spatial and temporal proximity between speech pattern elements. In summary, this thesis showed that there is a general similarity between auditory and tactile perceptual representations of patterns which may both assist in the implementation of tactile speech prostheses, and advantage touch over vision for this purpose. Second, it appears that although tactile pattern perception is initially impeded by the occurrence of masking effects between pattern elements, this performance deficit may be removed once the observers have sufficient experience with the stimuli. There is, however, a clear need for further research before this tentative conclusion can be confirmed...|$|E

40|$|The {{inability}} {{of people to}} detect changes between consecutively presented visual displays, when separated by a blank screen or distractor, is known as "change blindness". This phenomenon has recently been reported to occur within the auditory and tactile modalities as well. To date, however, only distractors presented within the same sensory modality as the change have been demonstrated to produce change blindness. In the present experiment, we studied whether tactile change blindness might also be elicited by the presentation of a visual mask. Participants made same versus different judgments regarding two successively presented displays composed of two to three vibrotactile stimuli. While change detection performance was near-perfect when the two displays were presented one directly after the other, participants failed to detect many of the changes between the tactile displays when they were separated by an empty temporal interval.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{extension}} to new geometries of the <b>Tactile</b> <b>Pattern</b> Display (TPaD) developed at Northwestern University. The TPaD is a haptic device which allows to simulate texture sensations by means of friction modulation. The underlying assumption is that shear forces play a signicant role {{in the perception of}} the surface characteristics. Previous work allows to be condent on the plausibility of this assumption. To modulate friction, which is the principal factor in the generation of shear forces, a squeeze lm of air between the ngertip and the device, is conveniently used. A "thick" squeeze lm of air will reduce the friction between the skin and the surface of the device, while a "thin" or nonexistent lm will cause the friction to be at its maximum. Knowing the position and eventually the velocity of the nger, it is possible to generate a great variety of spatial texture sensations. In order to apply this technology to a wide number of devices for everyday use, it is necessary to explore the possibility of increasing the dimensions of the active surface of the device. This work addresses this challenge. The document is arranged as follows: After {{a brief description of the}} TPaD an analytical approach to the problem is presented.

40|$|Two {{competing}} {{models of}} the effects of pattern element proximity, masking, and perceptual integration on the discriminability of spatiotemporal vibrotactile patterns are compared. Kirman's 'integration hypothesis' predicts that pattern perception is facilitated by a process of perceptual integration which requires that pattern elements be presented in close spatial and temporal proximity. Conversely, the 'isolation hypothesis' predicts that the strong masking effects which occur when pattern elements are presented in close proximity impede the perception of patterns. Traditional masking studies do not provide a fair test of these two hypothesis because they rely on methods that measure the subject's ability to identify the target when the target is presented in conjunction with the mask, rather than the discriminability of the complex percept resulting from the integration of the target and mask. To account for this, a new procedure was devised where the amount of interelement masking and the discriminability of the pattern as a whole were measured independently as the spatial and temporal separation of the pattern elements were varied. As expected under both hypotheses, masking between pattern elements increased as either the spatial or the temporal separation between them was decreased. The pattern discrimination data also support the isolation hypothesis in that the patterns were discriminated less well with increasing temporal element separation with a similar but nonsignificant trend in the case of spatial separation. It is concluded that this new methodology should be applied to a wider range of <b>tactile</b> <b>pattern</b> processing situations in order to assess the generality of the results obtained...|$|R
40|$|Tactile expertise, {{resulting}} from {{extensive use of}} hands, has previously been shown to improve tactile perception in blind people and musicians and {{to be associated with}} changes in the central processing of tactile information. This study investigated whether expertise, due to precise and deliberate use of the fingers at work, relates to improved tactile perception and whether this expertise interacts with age. A <b>tactile</b> <b>pattern</b> and a frequency discrimination task were conducted while ERPs were measured in experts and nonexperts of two age groups within middle adulthood. Independently of age, accuracy was better in experts than in nonexperts in both tasks. Somatosensory N 70 amplitudes were larger with increasing age and for experts than for nonexperts. P 100 amplitudes were smaller in experts than in nonexperts in the frequency discrimination task. In the pattern discrimination task, P 300 difference wave amplitude was reduced in experts and late middle-aged adults. In the frequency discrimination task, P 300 was more equally distributed in late middle-aged adults. We conclude that extensive, dexterous manual work leads to acquisition of tactile expertise and that this expertise might delay, but not counteract, age effects on tactile perception. Comparable neurophysiological changes induced by age and expertise presumably have different underlying mechanisms. Enlarged somatosensory N 70 amplitudes might result from reduced inhibition in older adults but from enhanced, specific excitability of the somatosensory cortex in experts. Regarding P 300, smaller amplitudes might indicate fewer available resources in older adults and, by contrast, a reduced need to engage as much cognitive effort to the task in experts...|$|R
