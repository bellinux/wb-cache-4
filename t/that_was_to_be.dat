5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, {{rather than as}} bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of}} the sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E

5|$|Approximately at noon of 7 October 1991, Tuđman {{met with}} Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, both ethnic Croats, in the Banski dvori. The {{purpose of the}} meeting was to persuade Marković to leave his {{position}} {{as the head of}} the Yugoslav federal government, which he appeared reluctant to do, and to discuss the need for Croatia's independence. The meeting was adjourned for lunch <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attended by presidential aides. Tuđman made another effort at persuading Marković, trying to appeal to his Croatian origin. The three left the lunch as dessert was being served and moved into the president's office to continue their discussion. After Tuđman left the room, everyone else followed.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War the Australian Army was demobilised and the 1st Armoured Regiment was reconstituted as {{a reserve}} {{formation}} in the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) on 1 April 1948, adopting the designation of the 1st Armoured Regiment (Royal New South Wales Lancers), in recognition of its previous history. During this time the regiment continued to operate Matilda tanks and was based at Lancer Barracks in Parramatta, in New South Wales. However, in 1949 the regiment was renamed the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers and its battle honours and history were perpetuated by this unit, to reallocate the former name to the tank regiment <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> established in the new Australian Regular Army.|$|E

The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E

The ships carried 2,700tons of coal, and were later modified to carry an additional 160tons of oil <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sprayed on the coal, to increase its burn rate. Electrical power {{was provided}} by eight turbo-generators, producing 1,280kW at 225V.|$|E

To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> echoed in the one between Joe and Polly.

5|$|The Silba {{class was}} {{developed}} by the Brodarski institut (BI) from Zagreb as a replacement for a large number of aging barge-like landing craft based on German World War II designs (Marinefährprahm and Siebel). All three ships were completed at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (BSO) in Split, Croatia. The first one, Krk (DBM-241), was commissioned with the JRM sometime between 1986 and 1990. The keel for the second ship <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> named Rab (DBM-242) was laid down in 1990. As the Croatian War of Independence started, unfinished Rab was captured by Croatian forces. It was completed and launched as Cetina (DBM-81) on 18 July 1992. A third and final ship was launched on 17 September 1994 as Krka (DBM-82).|$|E

Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when going for a header. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E
5|$|Burge {{moved to}} Championship club Doncaster Rovers on a {{short-term}} deal on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2011.

On 17 March 2011, Burge joined League Two team Oxford United on loan {{for the rest}} of the season, after impressing in a reserve game against Colchester United which Oxford won 2–0. He went straight into the starting line-up for the match against Crewe Alexandra two days later, and provided the assist for James Constable's winning goal. His first performance at Oxford received praise in the local media. A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off his heel on its way into the net for what would have been his first Football League goal. In mid-April 2011 he was recalled by Doncaster, and a few weeks later they offered him a new deal.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{discovers that}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the mystery buyer of the pub, {{and she and}} Jake make a quick sale to Ian before fleeing the Square. At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon confronts and then punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in {{exchange}} for a meeting with Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over the pub to Chrissie, thus the pub legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visits Chrissie in jail and asks her to marry him. She finds out that he has lost the £25,000 <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to testify in court about what Den was really like, wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (which he never did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. After an emotional farewell to Jake, she walks into her cell with a contented smile.|$|E
