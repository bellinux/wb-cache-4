5|$|One of {{the first}} notable people to have lived in Chiswick was the artist William Hogarth, who lived in Chiswick from 1749, when he bought <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>now</b> known as Hogarth's House. Hogarth {{lived in the house}} until his death in 1764. He is buried in St Nicholas's churchyard. The house later belonged to the poet and {{translator}} of Dante, Henry Francis Cary, who lived there from 1814 to 1833.|$|E
5|$|Nine weeks later, {{with neither}} side winning the {{majority}} of electors, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> (<b>now</b> Republican-controlled) will decide the President and the Senate (Democrat-controlled) for the Vice President, the first instance of this happening since the 1824 presidential election aftermath. Claire eventually wins when Donald Blythe issues a bill to block any filibuster of coming onto the floor; while the house couldn't reach a majority. In the meantime, Claire is sworn in as Acting President of the United States and begins to exert her limited power by excluding Frank from certain presidential functions, such as the swearing-in of the new Justice of the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The Palladian mansion, {{built in}} 1838 for Bristolian banker George Cave, is a Grade II* listed {{building}} and the park's flower meadow is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The park includes two early 20th century lodges at both entrance gates, a ruined coach house, a lake and boathouse, a pond, and several streams, several gardens and areas of woodland, and Hilston Tower, a late 18th-century folly made of red sandstone in the northeastern corner of the grounds. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>now</b> serves as a residential outdoor education centre run by Gwent Outdoor Centres, an organisation jointly supported by the local authorities of Newport, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent and Monmouthshire.|$|E

5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, Henry VIII {{sold it to}} Sir William Sharington for £783, who {{demolished}} {{the abbey}} church and converted the abbey into a house, starting work in about 1539. So {{as not to be}} incommoded by villagers passing close to his residence, he is said to have sold the church bells and used the proceeds to erect a bridge over the River Ray for their convenience. Few other alterations were made to the monastic buildings themselves: the cloisters, for example, still stand below the living accommodation. About 1550, Sir William added an octagonal tower containing two small chambers, one above the other; the lower one was reached through the main rooms, and was for storing and viewing his treasures; the upper one, for banqueting, was only accessible by walking across the leads of the roof. In each chamber is a central octagonal stone table, carved with up-to-date Renaissance ornament. A mid-16th century stone conduit house stands over the spring from which water was conducted to the house. Further additions were made over the centuries, and <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>now</b> has various grand reception rooms.|$|E
5|$|San Martín was {{initiated}} in the Lodge of Rational Knights in 1811. They {{met at the}} house of Carlos María de Alvear, other members were José Miguel Carrera, Aldao, Blanco Encalada and other criollos, American-born Spaniards. They agreed to return to their home countries and join the local revolutionary movements. San Martín asked for his retirement from the military, and moved to Britain. He stayed in the country for a short time, and met many other South Americans at a lodge held {{at the house of}} Venezuelan general Francisco de Miranda at 27 Grafton Street (now 58 Grafton Way), Bloomsbury, London (<b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>now</b> has a blue plaque with Miranda's name). Then he sailed to Buenos Aires aboard the frigate George Canning, along with the South Americans Alvear, Francisco José de Vera and Matías Zapiola, and the Spaniards Francisco Chilavert and Eduardo Kailitz. They arrived on 9 March 1812, to serve under the First Triumvirate.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>now</b> has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E

Along Somonauk Street is another of the district's elegant examples of Queen Anne architecture, the David Syme House.

At its earliest, it dates from the 17th century but it has been much {{extended}} and restored since. In particular, during the period 1896 to 1903 when it was owned by one John Pattinson Kirk, a London merchant, a large Edwardian wing was added to the south side. The 17th century element lies behind the façade {{in the form of a}} flint and chalk chequer building. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>now</b> plays host to the London Borough of Sutton's Museum, and has a local history collection, including objects that date back to the Bronze Age.

25|$|Nash {{was part}} of the 1633 triumvirate, along with John Hall and the vicar of Harbury Richard Watts, that was to oversee the wranglings {{associated}} with Thomas Quiney and his lease on a house called The Cage.

25|$|To {{offset the}} cost of {{maintaining}} such a large and historic dwelling in the 21st century, the present owners allow the house {{to be used for}} corporate and public hospitality, and as a wedding venue. Marriages can take place in the nearby church or in the principal rooms. Receptions and functions can also be held in the grounds, including the 17th century stables. The house has also been the location for television serials, and filming. The gardens are listed, Grade II*, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. For the greater part of the year, the house remains a little-known home. The greatest threat to <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>now</b> without its former estate, is the ever encroaching town of Yeovil. Once some miles distant, its suburbs and industrial estates are now almost visible from the windows of the house. As recently as June 2005 a public planning enquiry was held to investigate the suitability of 15 ha of land adjacent to the house to be developed as a business park.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>now</b> {{known as}} Elmwood was built about 1767 by Thomas Oliver, {{appointed}} Lieutenant-Governor of Massachusetts {{in the spring}} of 1774.

[...] Oliver's property extended from Fresh Pond in the north across the Charles River to what is now the Boston neighborhood of Brighton to the south, then part of Cambridge.
