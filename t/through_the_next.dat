Through the 2004 season, the Packers had the longest streak of non-losing seasons (13) in the NFL, despite an 8–8 record under head coach Ray Rhodes, a 9–7 season under head coach Mike Sherman, and no playoff berths in either 1999 or 2000. The streak ended in 2005, with the Packers finishing with a 4-12 record.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} several missions that the player has to complete while fighting enemies and completing objectives. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to exploring areas and recovering items such as keycards, explosives or laptop computers, which are useful to hack into electronic devices. The player can pick up new weapons, health and ammunition dropped by enemies if necessary. The game also features several mini-games, including a driving level and a sniper mission, as well as numerous boss battles that the player has to defeat in order to progress <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> level.

Benjamin Franklin, John and Sarah Jay, and John and Abigail Adams met there every Monday, and dined in company with Lafayette's family and the liberal nobility, including Clermont-Tonnerre and Madame de Staël. Lafayette continued to work on lowering trade barriers in France to American goods, and on assisting Franklin and his successor as envoy, Jefferson, in seeking treaties of amity and commerce with European nations. He also sought to eliminate the injustices that Protestants in France had endured since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes a century before.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on August29, Omar {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} with 10‑minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg) as estimated by the JMA; this intensity was maintained for 24hours before a steady weakening trend began. The JTWC estimated higher 1‑minute winds of around 240km/h (150mph), making Omar a super typhoon. Two days later, the typhoon came {{close enough to the}} Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA, who named the storm Lusing. By 1500UTC on September3, the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. Heading generally westward, the storm made landfall on the east coast of Taiwan near Hualien City on September4. After traversing the island in seven hours, Omar exited the coast of Yunlin County and emerged into the Taiwan Strait. The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near Xiamen, Fujian, on September5. Inland, Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west-southwest. It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening, and completely dissipated over northern Vietnam on September9.|$|E

5|$|Chaney {{was named}} the Coach of the Year for the 1990–91 season, after leading the Rockets to a 52-30 record despite Olajuwon's absence due to injury for 25 games. The Rockets were once again {{eliminated}} {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, 3–0 to the Lakers. Midway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and replaced by one of his assistants, former Houston player Tomjanovich. Although the Rockets did not make the playoffs, in the next year, the Rockets won-loss record improved by 13 games, as they won 55 games. Olajuwon won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, and the Rockets clinched the Midwest title. The playoffs started with Houston's first series victory in 5 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics during a game 7 overtime loss in one of the classic postseason series in NBA History.|$|E
5|$|In the South of China Sea on December11, Amy quickly slowed in {{forward motion}} {{and began to}} execute a {{cyclonic}} loop. Late that day, the typhoon strengthened back to Category2 intensity, and as such concurrently attained a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160km/h (100mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 968mbar (hPa; 28.59inHg). Late on December13, Amy weakened back to a Category1 typhoon for a transient period of time before restrengthening and reaching a quaternary peak intensity as a Category3 typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). Afterwards, the typhoon began to weaken, and at 0900UTC on December17, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam issued their last bulletin on the tropical cyclone. Upon the issuance of the last advisory, Amy set records for most typhoon bulletins issued at 58, and most reconnaissance fixes at 25. However, Amy continued to persist <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day before degenerating into a remnant low-pressure area late on December18. The following day, the associated remnants of Amy dissipated east of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{ordered the}} ship {{abandoned}} {{later in the}} day, and the carrier was still afloat in the evening, albeit with a slight list to port and down by the bow. Over {{the next couple of}} days, more compartments in the ship flooded and she settled {{on the bottom of the}} harbor. Another attack on 28 July hit her several more times and the resulting damage from those hits and more near-misses to port caused the ship to list further to port. This gradually increased <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day until Amagi capsized at 10:00 on the morning of 29 July with part of her flight deck falling overboard. The losses among the ship's crew are unknown, but were supposedly light.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{replaced}} a 1912 plank road {{across much}} of Imperial County. The winding two-lane road through the Cuyamaca Mountains {{was one of the}} factors that led to a four-hour journey from San Diego to El Centro. During the 1930s, the road was realigned through the mountains, but several curves remained. In the 1950s, work began on constructing what would become Interstate 8 (I-8) to replace the old highway in San Diego to bypass the cities of San Diego, La Mesa, and El Cajon. This started with the construction of the Alvarado Canyon road as well as Mission Valley Road through the San Diego area, as well as construction a replacement for the old highway across the Viejas Grade. The construction continued across the rest of the route <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two decades. US 80 was gradually decommissioned after 1964 as I-8, through San Diego and Imperial counties, was completed. In 2006, the highway was designated by the California State Legislature as Historic U.S. Route 80.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{started on}} May 15, 2007 {{in the eastern}} Pacific, {{designated}} as the area east of 140°W, and on June 1, 2007 in the central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140°W, and lasted until November 30, 2007. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. The season began slowly; {{through the end of}} July, the seasonal Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) was the third lowest since the geostationary satellite era began in the 1966 Pacific hurricane season. The inactivity continued <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> month, which was the third quietest August in terms of ACE since reliable records began in the basin during the 1971 Pacific hurricane season. In June, Tropical Storm Barbara caused $55million (2007USD) in crop damage to southeastern Mexico from heavy precipitation. In August, Hurricane Flossie formed in the eastern Pacific and crossed into the central Pacific; the hurricane threatened Hawaii but caused little damage. In early September, Hurricane Henriette dropped heavy rainfall in southwest Mexico, which caused nine fatalities and $25million (2007USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|All {{four of the}} Ganguts were {{assigned}} to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet in December 1914 – January 1915 when they reached Helsingfors. Their turrets and fire-control systems, however, were still being adjusted and fine-tuned <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> spring. Their role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so they spent their time training with occasional sorties into the Baltic. Several ships ran aground in 1915 and 1916, often while providing cover for minelaying operations, but only Sevastopol suffered any significant damage. A minor mutiny broke out on 1 November on board Gangut when the executive officer refused to feed the crew the traditional meal of meat and macaroni after coaling. The crews of the battleships joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after the idle sailors received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Gangut and her sisters led the first group of ships on 12 March and reached Kronstadt five days later in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway {{as a part}} of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker to get a closer view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Trøndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.|$|E
