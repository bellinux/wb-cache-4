5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been incapable of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus {{could not have been}} oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E
5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E
5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic eruptions about 44million {{years ago}} during the Eocene {{deposited}} lavas accompanied by debris flows (lahars) atop the older {{rocks in the}} western part of the province. Containing fragments of shale, siltstone, conglomerates, and breccias, the debris flows entombed plants and animals caught in their paths; the remnants of these ancient flows comprise the rock formations exposed in the Clarno Unit. Preserved in the Clarno Nut Beds are fossils of tropical and subtropical nuts, fruits, roots, branches, and seeds. The Clarno Formation also contains bones, palm leaves longer than , avocado trees, and other subtropical plants from 50million years ago, when the climate was warmer and wetter <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the 21stcentury. Large mammals that inhabited this region between 50 and 35million years ago included browsers such as brontotheres and amynodonts, scavengers like the hyaenodonts, as well as Patriofelis and other predators. Eroded remnants of the Clarno stratovolcanoes, once the size of Mount Hood, are still visible near the monument, for example Black Butte, White Butte, and other buttes near Mitchell.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, even if {{we assume}} that the entire {{investment}} drop was a consequence of fear or uncertainty, {{the vast majority of the}} decline in the quantity of labor remains unexplained unless fear or uncertainty affect the labor market through another mechanism. Real investment per capita <b>in,</b> say, 2011 <b>was</b> $ 2, 000 (2005 prices) less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> 2007, before the recession began. $ 2, 000 per capita is only about 4 percent of GDP, and a 4 percent reduction in aggregate labor demand is expected to reduce the aggregate quantity of labor by about one percent. 4 But in fact the employment-population ratio was a full 7 percent less <b>in</b> 2011 <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> 2007.|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} the tax {{preference}} for pensions depends on the marginal tax schedule and on the tax treatment of income from assets held outside a pension account. We examine the change over time {{in the value of}} pension investing, accounting for changes in the tax schedule and in the treatment of equity and bond income. We find that changes in U. S. tax law, especially the treatment of equity income, have led to sizeable changes in the {{value of the}} pension tax preference. On balance the value of the pension tax preference to worker-savers <b>is</b> modestly lower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the mid- 1980 s and substantially lower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the late 1980 s. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{captain who}} wins the toss must choose whether to bat or field.

25|$|The {{predominant}} {{wind direction}} in the Netherlands is southwest, which causes a moderate maritime climate, with warm summers and cool winters, and typically high humidity.

25|$|A different, {{and more}} {{recently}} developed, statistic which {{is also used to}} gauge the effectiveness of batsmen is the strike rate. It measures a different concept however – how quickly the batsman scores (number of runs from 100 balls) – so it does not supplant the role of batting average.
