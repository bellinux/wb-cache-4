5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, resistors (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

Though they have not received widespread attention, multi-dimensional <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are a very effective way to extract materials and their boundaries for both scalar and multivariate data. However, identifying good <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> is difficult enough in one dimension, let alone two or three dimensions. This paper demonstrates an important class of three-dimensional <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> for scalar data, and describes the application of multi-dimensional <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> to multivariate data. We present a set of direct manipulation widgets that make specifying such <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> intuitive and convenient.

Although sigmoidal <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> {{are the most common}} there is no apriorireason why models based on such functions should always provide optimal decision borders. A large number of alternative <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> has been described in the literature. A taxonomy of activation and output functions is proposed, and advantages of various non-local and local neural <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are discussed. Several less-known types of <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> and new combinations of activation/output functions are described. Universal <b>transfer</b> <b>functions,</b> parametrized to change from localized to delocalized type, are of greatest interest. Other types of neural <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> discussed here include functions with activations based on non-Euclidean distance measures, bicentral functions, formed from products or linear combinations of pairs of sigmoids, and extensions of such functions making rotations of localized decision borders in highly dimensional spaces practical.

5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

The displacement <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are expressed explicitly in terms of beam geometrical parameters and surface strains (uniaxial bending strains) obtained at equally spaced strain stations along the surface of the beam structure. By inputting the measured or analytically calculated surface strains into the displacement <b>transfer</b> <b>functions,</b> one could calculate local slopes, deflections, and cross-sectional twist angles of the nonuniform beam structure for mapping the overall structural deformed shapes for visual display. The accuracy of deformed shape calculations by the first- and second-order displacement <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are determined by comparing these values to the analytically predicted values obtained from finite element analyses. This comparison shows that the new displacement <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> could quite accurately calculate the deformed shapes of tapered cantilever tubular beams with different tapered angles.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} creating abstract <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> supporting dataflow analyses. Writing these functions by hand is problematic: <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are difficult to understand, difficult to make precise, and difficult to debug. Bugs in <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are particularly serious since they defeat the soundness of any program analysis running on top of them. Furthermore, implementing <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> by hand is wasteful because the resulting code {{is often difficult to}} reuse in new analyzers and to analyze new languages. We have developed algorithms and tools for deriving domains. The interval domain is standard; in the bitwise domain, values are vectors of three-valued bits. For both domains, important challenges are to derive <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> that are sound in the presence of integer overflow, and to derive precise <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> for operations whose semantics are a mismatch for the domain (i. e., bit-vector operations in the interval domain and arithmetic operations in the bitwise domain). We can derive <b>transfer</b> <b>functions,</b> and execute them, in time linear in the bitwidth of the operands. These functions are maximally precise in most cases. Our generated <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> are parameterized by a bitwidth and are independent of the language being analyzed, and also of the language in which the analyzer is written. Currently, we generate interval and bitwise <b>transfer</b> <b>functions</b> in C and OCaml for analyzing C source code, ARM object code, and AVR object code.

25|$|The {{internal}} state {{variables are}} the smallest possible subset of system variables that can represent {{the entire state}} of the system at any given time. The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system, , is usually equal to the order of the system's defining differential equation.
