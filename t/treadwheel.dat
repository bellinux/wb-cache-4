25|$|The largest {{monolith}} lifted by cranes was the 108t {{heavy corner}} cornice block of the Jupiter temple at Baalbek, {{followed by an}} architrave block weighing 63t, {{both of which were}} raised to a height of about 19m. The capital block of Trajan's Column, with a weight of 53.3t, was even lifted to c. 34m above the ground. As such enormous loads far exceeded the lifting capability of any single <b>treadwheel</b> crane, it is assumed that Roman engineers set up a four-masted lifting tower in the midst of which the stone blocks were vertically raised by the means of capstans placed on the ground around it.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{monolith}} lifted by {{a single}} crane can be determined from the characteristic lewis iron holes (each of which points at the use of one crane) in the lifted stone block. By dividing its weight by their number, one arrives at a maximum lifting capacity of 7.5 to 8t as exemplified by a cornice block at the Trajan's Forum and the architrave blocks of the Temple of Jupiter at Baalbek. Based on a detailed Roman relief of a construction crane, the engineer O'Connor calculates a slightly less lifting capability, 6.2t, for such a type of <b>treadwheel</b> crane, {{on the assumption that}} it was powered by five men and using a three-pulley block.|$|E

50|$|In 1895 {{there were}} 39 tread-mills and 29 cranks {{in use in}} English prisons, and these had diminished to 13 and 5 {{respectively}} in 1901. The use of <b>treadwheels</b> was abolished in Britain in 1902 by the Prisons Act (1898).|$|R
50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that medieval cranes rarely featured ratchets or brakes to forestall the load from running backward. This curious absence is explained by the high friction force exercised by medieval <b>treadwheels</b> which normally prevented the wheel from accelerating beyond control.|$|R
500|$|Medieval {{machines}} and inventions, {{such as the}} <b>treadwheel</b> crane, became indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity. When building in stone a prominent concern of medieval builders was to have quarries close at hand. There are examples of some castles where stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Château de Coucy and Château Gaillard. When {{it was built in}} 992 in France the stone tower at Château de Langeais was [...] high, [...] wide, and [...] long with walls averaging [...] The walls contain [...] of stone and have a total surface (both inside and out) of [...] The tower is estimated to have taken 83,000average working days to complete, most of which was unskilled labour.|$|E

They were also obliged to maintain the banks of the Welland. The inadequacy of its outfall and a spate of bad weather stopped them from completing their task. They tried renting out the land they had been granted, but many tenants were unable to pay the rent, due to the poor state of the drainage which reduced crop yields. In April 1729, the Deeping Fen Adventurers received a letter from Captain John Perry, expressing the opinion {{that the only way to}} improve the drainage was to improve the river outfalls, and proposing the construction of scouring sluices on the river at Spalding, on Vernatt's drain at its outfall, and on the River Glen at Surfleet. Perry was an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, when he published his recommendations for the North Level of the Fens. His plans were approved, and the Adventurers offered to give him land covering nearly [...] in payment for the work. He sold one third of the land to finance the project, and began work in 1730.

A navigation lock was constructed beside the sluice, so that vessels could still gain access to the river above. Perry died in February 1733, and was buried in Spalding churchyard.

50|$|Stationary {{harbour cranes}} are {{considered}} a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244. The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double <b>treadwheels.</b> There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and <b>treadwheels</b> with only the jib arm and roof rotating. These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like see-saws, winches and yards. Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are three}} types of team boats.

50|$|A horse mill is a mill, {{sometimes}} {{used in conjunction}} with a watermill or windmill, that uses a horse as the power source. Any milling process can be powered in this way, but the most frequent use of animal power in horse mills was for grinding grain and pumping water. Other animal engines for powering mills are powered by dogs, donkeys, oxen or camels. <b>Treadwheels</b> are engines powered by humans.|$|R
50|$|Cubitt's treadmills for {{punishment}} usually rotated {{around a}} horizontal axis, requiring {{the user to}} step upwards, like walking up an endless staircase. Those punished walked around {{the outside of the}} wheel holding a horizontal handrail for stability. Earlier <b>treadwheels</b> include either horizontal or inclined-axis devices designed for a single user as well as a horizontal-axis design with the user inside and using the shaft as a handrail, {{in a manner similar to}} the familiar toys for small pet animals such as hamsters.|$|R
2500|$|They {{followed}} the veins with shafts and tunnels underground, {{some of which}} still exist on the site. The remains of Roman dewatering machines were found during the 1880s and the 1920s when the Rio Tinto mines in Spain were being mined by opencast methods. [...] At Dolaucothi, a similar discovery was made in 1935 during mining operations, and it included part of a reverse overshot water-wheel which {{is now in the}} National Museum of Wales. It was found with burnt timbers, suggesting that fire-setting was used to help break up the hard quartz in which the gold was trapped. A similar but larger wheel was rediscovered during mine operations at Rio Tinto in Spain, and is now in the British Museum, where it is displayed prominently in the Roman gallery. The Spanish example included a sequence of no fewer than 16 reverse overshot water-wheels, each pair of wheels feeding water to the next set in the sequence. Each wheel would have been worked like a <b>treadwheel,</b> from the side rather than at the top, {{but it would have been}} a hard and lonely activity for the miners working these wheels lifting water from the mine bottom. Since the fragment of a reverse overshot water-wheel was found 160 feet below any known adit or stope, it must have been part of a similar sequence at Dolaucothi to that in Spain. Gold mining was sophisticated and technologically advanced at Dolaucothi, suggesting that the Roman army itself pioneered exploitation at the site. The construction of such dewatering machines is described by the Roman engineer Vitruvius writing in 25 BC, and their use for irrigation and lifting water in thermae was widespread.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{process by}} which the <b>treadwheel</b> crane was reintroduced is not recorded, {{although}} its return to construction sites has undoubtedly to be viewed in close connection with the simultaneous rise of Gothic architecture. The reappearance of the <b>treadwheel</b> crane may have resulted from a technological development of the windlass from which the <b>treadwheel</b> structurally and mechanically evolved. Alternatively, the medieval <b>treadwheel</b> may represent a deliberate reinvention of its Roman counterpart drawn from Vitruvius' De architectura which was available in many monastic libraries. Its reintroduction may have been inspired, as well, by the observation of the labor-saving qualities of the waterwheel with which early treadwheels shared many structural similarities.|$|E
50|$|The <b>treadwheel</b> {{dates from}} the early seventeenth century. It was {{probably}} not worked by a horse due to its size. The <b>treadwheel</b> is housed in a small timber-framed building with a thatched roof and was originally built at Catherington, Hampshire.|$|E
50|$|A new harbour crane {{installed}} in 1684 {{is attributed to}} Jacob Leupold. This crane could also rotate but two large <b>treadwheels</b> enabled six men to lift a load of three tonnes. In his book on the theory of machines, Leupold illustrates two cranes at Bremen. The more ambitious model is pictured here. The boom {{would have been much}} longer as it has been shortened to fit within the illustration. The crane would have been used for moving exceptionally heavy loads of single items as the predominant method of moving loads was to use human labour.|$|R
50|$|The {{prison was}} {{originally}} built in 1820 and opened as the Surrey House of Correction, Brixton Prison {{was intended to}} house 175 prisoners. However, regularly exceeding its capacity supporting over 200 prisoners, overcrowding was an early problem and with its small cells and poor living conditions contributed to its {{reputation as one of}} the worst prisons in London (worsened when Brixton became one of the first prisons to introduce <b>treadwheels</b> in 1821). There is an illustration of prisoners on the 1821 treadmill used to mill corn in Surrey House of Correction.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} types of harbor cranes can be identified with a varying geographical distribution: While gantry cranes which pivoted on a central vertical axle were commonly found at the Flemish and Dutch coastside, German sea and inland harbors typically featured tower cranes where the windlass and <b>treadwheels</b> were situated in a solid tower with only jib arm and roof rotating. Interestingly, dockside cranes were not adopted in the Mediterranean region and the highly developed Italian ports where authorities continued {{to rely on the}} more labor-intensive method of unloading goods by ramps beyond the Middle Ages.|$|R

50|$|A treadle OE tredan, {{is a part}} of {{a machine}} which is {{operated}} by the foot to produce reciprocating or rotary motion in a machine such as a weaving loom (reciprocating) or grinder (rotary). Treadles {{can also be used to}} power water pumps (as in the treadle pump), or to turn wood lathes (as in the pole lathe). In the past, treadles have been used to power a range of machines including sewing machines, looms, wood saws, cylinder phonographs and metal lathes. Along with cranks, treadmills, and <b>treadwheels,</b> they allowed human and animal power of machinery in the absence of electric machinery.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} {{construction}} cranes were invented by the Ancient Greeks and were powered by men or beasts of burden, such as donkeys. These cranes {{were used for}} the construction of tall buildings. Larger cranes were later developed, employing the use of human <b>treadwheels,</b> permitting the lifting of heavier weights. In the High Middle Ages, harbour cranes were introduced to load and unload ships and assist with their construction - some were built into stone towers for extra strength and stability. The earliest cranes were constructed from wood, but cast iron, iron and steel took over with the coming of the Industrial Revolution.|$|R

Factories also used hydraulic and pneumatic power. Many small workshops continued to use water, human and animal power until electrification after 1900.|$|R

50|$|During the High Middle Ages, the <b>treadwheel</b> crane was reintroduced on a {{large scale}} after the {{technology}} had fallen into disuse in western Europe with the demise of the Western Roman Empire. The earliest reference to a <b>treadwheel</b> (magna rota) reappears in archival literature in France about 1225, followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240. In navigation, the earliest uses of harbor cranes are documented for Utrecht in 1244, Antwerp in 1263, Brugge in 1288 and Hamburg in 1291, while in England the <b>treadwheel</b> is not recorded before 1331.|$|E

A programme of archaeological works has already been carried out within the area by the Centre including an archaeological Desk-Based Assessment (Nash 2013), watching briefs, evaluations and excavation (Reader 2013 a; 2014 a; b; c). This revealed the well preserved and substantial remains of New Bailey prison, which was in operation between 1790 and 1868. This was at one stage one of the largest prisons in the country and excavations so far have revealed the remains of the Male Felon area, Female wings, <b>treadwheels</b> and Cook House.

50|$|It {{is assumed}} that Roman {{engineers}} lifted these extraordinary weights by two measures (see picture below for comparable Renaissance technique): First, as suggested by Heron, a lifting tower was set up, whose four masts were arranged {{in the shape of}} a quadrangle with parallel sides, not unlike a siege tower, but with the column in the middle of the structure (Mechanica 3.5). Second, a multitude of capstans were placed on the ground around the tower, for, although having a lower leverage ratio than <b>treadwheels,</b> capstans could be set up in higher numbers and run by more men (and, moreover, by draught animals). This use of multiple capstans is also described by Ammianus Marcellinus (17.4.15) in connection with the lifting of the Lateranense obelisk in the Circus Maximus (ca. 357 AD). The maximum lifting capability of a single capstan can be established by the number of lewis iron holes bored into the monolith. In case of the Baalbek architrave blocks, which weigh between 55 and 60 tons, eight extant holes suggest an allowance of 7.5 ton per lewis iron, that is per capstan. Lifting such heavy weights in a concerted action required a great amount of coordination between the work groups applying the force to the capstans.|$|R
