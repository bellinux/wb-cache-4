25|$|Goalkeepers are not {{required}} to stay in the penalty area; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> involved in play anywhere on the pitch, and it is common for them to act as an additional defender (or 'sweeper') during certain passages of the game. Goalkeepers with a long throwing range or accurate long-distance kicks may be able to quickly create attacking positions for a team and generate goal-scoring chances from defensive situations, a tactic known as the long ball.|$|E
25|$|An ETF {{is a type}} of fund. It owns assets (bonds, stocks, gold bars, etc.) and divides {{ownership}} of itself into shares that are held by shareholders. The details of the structure (such as a corporation or trust) will vary by country, and even within one country there may be multiple possible structures. The shareholders indirectly own the assets of the fund, and they will typically get an annual report. Shareholders are entitled to a share of the profits, such as interest or dividends, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> a residual value in case the fund is liquidated. Their ownership interest in the fund can easily be bought and sold.|$|E
25|$|An athlete {{may choose}} to leave their sport due to many reasons, either due to an injury or due to them {{reaching}} an old age. If an athlete becomes injured, this must be looked deeper into, as an injury can vary between very subtle and very dangerous. If the athlete loves their sport, they will sometimes hide {{the severity of the}} injury and just wait till it heals slightly {{in order for them to}} get playing as soon as possible, which could cause catastrophic injuries later on in their career. This is why injuries need to be looked into, because if the injury is too extreme where the athlete can't physically go back to playing their sport, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> forced to retire in order for them not to damage themselves at a more extreme level, resulting in the athlete experiencing many different feelings, such as alienation, distress or uselessness.|$|E

25|$|Recruits {{had to pass}} {{tests of}} {{elementary}} riding and shooting, as well as medical tests, amid considerable competition for limited places. Most volunteers were young, single and worked with their hands. Motivations for joining varied, with many seeking to escape from a worsening drought, high unemployment and a heat wave which was gripping Australia at the time. Men from the colonial contingents already in South Africa were also encouraged to join. Competition for commissions and battalion commands was also fierce and {{the decision was made}} to appoint all officers in Australia in order to avoid some of the previous problems of 'importing officers' to positions of command. Hutton was also keen to reserve positions for senior permanent force officers so that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> experience in leadership and staff work, and five of the eight battalion commands were initially allocated to permanent force officers. This had its own draw backs with a number of appointments later disputed, and one—Wallack—was later dismissed amid claims of inefficiency and ill discipline. Training commenced at a high tempo, with Hutton keen to instil professionalism and a high level of discipline in the new force.|$|E
500|$|Amṛtacandra {{says that}} animals {{should not be}} killed for guests or persons deserving respect as often {{advocated}} in certain scriptures. It is also a wrong belief that wild animals that kill many other animals should be killed. This is often justified {{in the name of}} hunting of ferocious animals like tigers for sport. Another wrong belief forwarded to justify killing of ferocious animals is that, these kill many lives and accumulate grave sins and hence killing them is an act of mercy. According to Jainism, killing can never be an act of mercy. It is also a misconception to believe that it is advisable to kill those who are suffering so that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>get</b> relief from agony. These sorts of arguments are forwarded to justify killing of those animals that may have become old or injured and hence have become commercially useless.|$|E
