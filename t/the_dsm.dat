5|$|RAD {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{researched}} and most poorly understood disorders in <b>the</b> <b>DSM.</b> There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.|$|E
5|$|The ICD-10 {{criteria}} are typically used in European countries, while <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> {{criteria are}} used in the United States and to varying degrees around the world, and are prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian first-rank symptoms. In practice, agreement between the two systems is high. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} textual standardization of discursive and pragmatic {{practices in the}} American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Specifically, this study examines psychiatrists’ prescriptive and proscriptive discursive practices in the diagnostic manuals. This study claims psychiatrists’ metadiscourse about the textual standardization of discursive and pragmatic practices in <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> as a distinct object of study. This project focuses on the textual standardization of a professional discourse community’s communicative practices by asking {{about the ways in}} which <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> help to constitute psychiatric knowledge. In order to answer the question, the project examines psychiatrists’ metadiscourse about style, standards, and standardization in <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> themselves, in psychiatric journals, and in journalistic coverage of <b>the</b> <b>DSMs.</b> <b>The</b> three chapters of analysis focus on different processes and stages in the textual standardization of <b>the</b> <b>DSMs.</b> <b>The</b> analysis of psychiatrists’ metadiscourse demonstrates that, in an effort to standardize disciplinary knowledge, sometimes the object of scientific inquiry in <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> is <b>the</b> discursive practices of psychiatrists. When this happens, the development of a professional style for American psychiatry contributes to knowledge-making because psychiatrists locate the evidence for knowledge claims in discourse structures. In addition to the many other purposes the diagnostic manuals fulfill (e. g., diagnostic, statistical, forensic, actuarial, and so on), the textual standardization of the professional style constitutes a handbook of usage, and in this sense, then, <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> are a rhetoric. A central claim of this project is that the professional style facilitates the cultural shareability and portability of the APA 2 ̆ 7 s “common language” across a range of rhetorical situations. The study concludes that the development of a professional style and the textual standardization of that style in the APA 2 ̆ 7 s diagnostic manuals are central to the discursive construction of the APA as a professional scientific society and to the discursive production of psychiatric knowledge...|$|R

5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|Autism {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E

After elimination of systematic errors among <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> and down-sampling of <b>the</b> SfM-derived <b>DSM,</b> elevation changes on the order of 10 − 1  m – including not only topography but also growth of vegetation, vanishing of flood waters, and restoration and repair works – were detected. Comparison of <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> showed that <b>the</b> volume eroded by the flood was more than twice the deposited volume in the area within 300 – 500  m of the breached artificial levee, where the topography was significantly affected.

5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> until 1973.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth edition of <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> (DSM-5). To {{be diagnosed with}} schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
5|$|With {{insensitive}} or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways {{of coping with}} fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.|$|E
25|$|Because an individual's {{degree of}} {{impairment}} {{is often not}} correlated with symptom counts and can stem from various individual and social factors, <b>the</b> <b>DSM's</b> standard of distress or disability can often produce false positives.

5|$|In February 1918, {{the call}} {{went out for}} volunteers to {{participate}} in a special mission to close the port of Zeebrugge using blockships. Although many aboard Australia volunteered their services in an attempt to escape the drudgery of North Sea patrols, only 11 personnel—10 sailors and an engineering lieutenant—were selected for the raid, which occurred on 23 April. The lieutenant was posted to the engine room of the requisitioned ferry , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) for his efforts. The other Australians were assigned to the boiler rooms of the blockship , or as part of a storming party along the mole. All ten sailors survived—Australia was the only ship to have no casualties from the raid—and three were awarded <b>the</b> <b>DSM,</b> while another three were mentioned in dispatches. One of the sailors was listed in the ballot to receive a Victoria Cross, but he did not receive the award.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside <b>the</b> <b>DSM</b> and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E

Instead, each application is profiled using a low-overhead profiling tool. The appropriate coherence flag setting, suggested by the profiling, is specified when the application is launched. We have compared {{the performance of a}} hardware DSM (Sun WildFire) to a software DSM built with identical interconnect hardware and coherence strategy.

40|$|Regional trade {{agreements}} (RTAs) {{have become an}} indelible feature of the international trading landscape. Most, if not all, RTAs contain provisions that establish procedures for resolving disputes among their signatory members. Yet, the design and functioning of these dispute settlement mechanisms (DSMs) and, more specifically, how they differ from the WTO dispute settlement system remain relatively unexplored. Existing academic literature has primarily focused on the narrow issue of jurisdictional conflict between DSMs of RTAs and the WTO dispute settlement system. Literature mapping out and classifying systematically <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> of RTAs is more limited. This research paper goes beyond considering the issue of jurisdictional conflict between the multilateral and regional regimes. We map out <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> in RTAs that have been notified to the WTO and were in force {{at the end of}} 2012, and consider a typology of these DSMs based on their nature and design. We also use the data obtained from our mapping exercise in two ways. First, we identify trends and patterns of use, either regionally or by individual countries, of the different types of DSMs in RTAs. Trends are analysed in relation to five key factors: (i) evolution over time, (ii) level of economic development, (iii) regional characteristics, (iv) level of integration (partial scope agreement, free trade agreement or customs union), and (v) configuration (bilateral or plurilateral). Second, we undertake a nuts and bolts analysis of <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> of RTAs by examining their approach to various issues in international dispute settlement. Our aim is to draw conclusions {{about the extent to which}} the predominant type of DSM in RTAs has features that are different from those of the WTO dispute settlement system...|$|R

The schedule is a list of all required lighting equipment, including color gel, gobos, color wheels, barndoors and other accessories. The light plot is typically a plan view of the theatre where the performance will take place, with every luminaire marked. This typically specifies the approximate lighting focus and direction, a reference number, accessories, and the channel number of the dimmer system or lighting control console.|$|E

Two orientation models have been tested in this work: the rigorous Toutin’s model, developed at the Canada Center for Remote Sensing (CCRS) and implemented in the commercial software package PCI Geomatica, and the radargrammetric model developed at University of Rome La Sapienza and implemented in the scientific software SISAR. A full comparison and analysis has been carried out over Beauport test site (Quebec, Canada), where a LIDAR ground truth and a dense set of GNSS CPs (Check points) are available. Moreover, a preliminary comparison between <b>the</b> <b>DSMs</b> extracted, respectively with SISAR and PCI-Geomatica has been performed. The accuracy of <b>the</b> generated <b>DSMs</b> has been evaluated through the scientific software DEMANAL developed by Prof. K. Jacobsen of University of Hannover.
