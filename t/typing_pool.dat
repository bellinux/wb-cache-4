This development allowed the complete functions of a <b>typing</b> <b>pool</b> to be automated {{into a single}} system supporting about 50 workstations. With {{the support of the}} UK’s National Enterprise Board the company established a new subsidiary to exploit this technology, Logica VTS. A range of stand alone word processors, the VTS 100 and the VTS 2200, were developed and were manufactured at a purpose built factory in Swindon. These machines were sold internationally by BT and by International Computers Ltd and were amongst the first word processors to achieve mass sales. However the advent of the Personal Computer and software such as Microsoft Word led to the decline of this business and its ultimate closure.|$|E

Second, we show that complicated communication, where far-away <b>types</b> <b>pool,</b> allows dynamic manipulation of beliefs and enables better information release in the future. If communication is restricted to be simple, such as monotonic partitional, full revelation is impossible. Thirdly, we show that conditioning future information release on past actions improves incentives and information release. ...|$|R

We build a model of persuasion in which low and high <b>types</b> <b>pool</b> on their choice of complexity. A natural criterion based on forward induction selects the high-type optimal pooling equilibrium. More complexity always leads to lower scrutiny by the receiver because it makes understanding marginally more costly. When the receiver is biased towards rejection, more complexity also makes the receiver more selective, and the sender simplifies her report in equilibrium. When the receiver is biased towards validation, however, more complexity makes the receiver less selective, and we provide sufficient conditions that lead to complexity inflation in equilibrium...|$|R
