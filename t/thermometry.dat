5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for <b>Thermometry</b> (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee was of the view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E

25|$|If molecules, or atoms, or electrons, are {{emitted from}} a {{material}} and their velocities are measured, {{the spectrum of}} their velocities often nearly obeys a theoretical law called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, which gives a well-founded measurement of temperatures for which the law holds. There {{have not yet been}} successful experiments of this same kind that directly use the Fermi–Dirac distribution for <b>thermometry,</b> but perhaps that will be achieved in future.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} these restrictions, most {{generally}} used practical thermometers are of the empirically based kind. Especially, it was used for calorimetry, which contributed greatly {{to the discovery of}} thermodynamics. Nevertheless, empirical <b>thermometry</b> has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical physics. Empirically based thermometers, beyond their base as simple direct measurements of ordinary physical properties of thermometric materials, can be re-calibrated, by use of theoretical physical reasoning, and this can extend their range of adequacy.|$|E
25|$|Lambert's book is {{fundamentally}} experimental. The forty experiments described in Photometria {{were conducted by}} Lambert between 1755 and 1760, after he decided to write a treatise on light measurement. His interest in acquiring experimental data spanned several fields: optics, <b>thermometry,</b> pyrometry, hydrometry, and magnetics. This interest in experimental data and its analysis, so evident in Photometria, is also present in other articles and books Lambert produced. For his optics work, extremely limited equipment sufficed: a few panes of glass, convex and concave lenses, mirrors, prisms, paper and cardboard, pigments, candles {{and the means to}} measure distances and angles.|$|E
25|$|HMFGs were {{initially}} slated for optical fiber applications, because the intrinsic losses of a mid-IR fiber could in principle {{be lower than}} those of silica fibers, which are transparent only up to about 2 μm. However, such low losses were never realized in practice, and the fragility and high cost of fluoride fibers made them less than ideal as primary candidates. Later, the utility of fluoride fibers for various other applications was discovered. These include mid-IR spectroscopy, fiber optic sensors, <b>thermometry,</b> and imaging. Also, fluoride fibers can be used for guided lightwave transmission in media such as YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers at 2.9 μm, as required for medical applications (e.g. ophthalmology and dentistry).|$|E
25|$|This {{statement}} {{helps to}} define temperature {{but it does}} not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a one-dimensional manifold, stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include {{the existence of a}} unique universal hotness manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature. To be suitable for empirical <b>thermometry,</b> a material must have a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable, such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the ideal gas, which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined {{on the basis of the}} second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

2500|$|Acoustic <b>thermometry</b> {{is an idea}} {{to observe}} the world's ocean basins, and the ocean climate in particular, using trans-basin {{acoustic}} transmissions. [...] "Thermometry", rather than [...] "tomography", {{has been used to}} indicate basin-scale or global scale measurements. [...] Prototype measurements of temperature {{have been made in the}} North Pacific Basin and across the Arctic Basin.|$|E
2500|$|The Acoustic <b>Thermometry</b> of Ocean Climate (ATOC) {{program was}} {{implemented}} in the North Pacific Ocean, with [...] acoustic transmissions from 1996 through fall 2006. [...] The measurements terminated when agreed-upon environmental protocols ended. [...] The decade-long deployment of the acoustic source showed that the observations are sustainable on even a modest budget. [...] The transmissions have been verified to provide an accurate measurement of ocean temperature on the acoustic paths, with uncertainties that are far smaller than any other approach to ocean temperature measurement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practical}} {{basis of}} <b>thermometry</b> is {{the existence of}} triple point cells. [...] Triple points are conditions of pressure, volume and temperature such that three phases are simultaneously present, for example solid, vapor and liquid. [...] For a single component there are no degrees of freedom at a triple point and {{any change in the}} three variables results in {{one or more of the}} phases vanishing from the cell. [...] Therefore, triple point cells can be used as universal references for temperature and pressure (see Gibbs phase rule).|$|E
2500|$|Ocean {{acoustic}} tomography {{is a technique}} used to measure temperatures and currents over large regions of the ocean. [...] On ocean basin scales, this technique {{is also known as}} acoustic <b>thermometry.</b> [...] The technique relies on precisely measuring the time it takes sound signals to travel between two instruments, one an acoustic source and one a receiver, separated by ranges of 100–5000km. [...] If the locations of the instruments are known precisely, the measurement of time-of-flight can be used to infer the speed of sound, averaged over the acoustic path. [...] Changes in the speed of sound are primarily caused by changes in the temperature of the ocean, hence the measurement of the travel times is equivalent to a measurement of temperature. [...] A 1°C change in temperature corresponds to about 4m/s change in sound speed. [...] An oceanographic experiment employing tomography typically uses several source-receiver pairs in a moored array that measures an area of ocean.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{scientific}} and <b>thermometry</b> communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale. Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or, when greater specificity was desired, as degrees centigrade (symbol: °C). [...] Because the term centigrade was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/100 of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term centesimal degree (known as the gradian, [...] "grad" [...] or [...] "gon": 1ᵍ = 0.9°, 100ᵍ = 90°) was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the BIPM. More properly, what was defined as [...] "centigrade" [...] then would now be [...] "hectograde". [...] Furthermore, in the context here, centigrade/hectograde is referring to the whole 0–100 range, not the given part thereof, hence [...] "20° centigrade" [...] means [...] "20ᵍ per 100 gradians" [...] (or 20% hectograde), not its literal description, [...] "0.2 gradians".|$|E
