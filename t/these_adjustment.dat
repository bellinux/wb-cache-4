50|$|One {{theory of}} the {{determination}} of fixed investment focuses on {{the discrepancy between the}} current quantity of the fixed capital stock and the optimal or target capital stock. The target capital stock—the level at which a firm's profits would be highest if actual fixed capital holdings equaled that level—is determined as the level at which the marginal product of capital equals the marginal cost of capital. Then the flow of net investment per unit of time is determined by balancing losses from having a less-than-optimal level of capital with the adjustment costs of installing new capital; <b>these</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs in per-unit terms may be an increasing function of the speed of installation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1915, Denmark {{became one}} of the first {{countries}} in the world to introduce leveling seats in their parliamentary elections. Since then, all parliamentary elections in Denmark have allocated <b>these</b> <b>adjustment</b> seats as a substantial fraction of the seats in the parliament. The parliamentary seats currently comprise 135 county seats and 40 leveling seats, with a further 4 [...] "North Atlantic seats" [...] elected separately by proportional representation in the Faroe Islands and Greenland (which are not treated as an integral part of the Danish election system). The leveling seats are supplementary to the normal seats which are allocated by proportional votes within each county. All parties which achieve at least 2% of the national votes are granted as many leveling seats as required to achieve proportional representation at the national level.|$|E

50|$|A folding {{skeleton}} type buttstock {{designed for}} right- and left-handed shooters is also available. The folding stock is 0.5 kg {{heavier than the}} non-folding green, desert tan or dark earth stock variants and is hinged behind the pistol grip; it folds {{to the left side}} and locks into position. When folded, the rifle becomes 250 mm shorter. The steel parts of the folding stock are manganese phosphatised and the polyurethane parts are coloured olive drab or desert tan. The rear of the buttstock is adjustable for length of pull and height. The cheek-piece and rear support are also adjustable for height. <b>These</b> <b>adjustment</b> options allow shooters of various sizes and shapes to tailor the TRG folding stock to their personal preferences, which is an uncommon feature for folding stocks.

If the limitations associated with enforcement of international trade agreements are sufficiently severe, trade adjustment assistance can facilitate reciprocal trade liberalization. We argue that this suggests a possible efficiency rationale for adjustment policies that treat resources differently when traded sectors are involved. ...|$|E
30|$|Over the {{business}} cycle, firms {{have to adjust}} their labor volume. This employment adjustment causes adjustment costs, which firms {{have to take into}} account. Their adjustment behavior depends on the functional form of <b>these</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. One can distinguish three basic specifications: fixed, linear and convex. A combination of these specifications is also possible and in the existing literature there is a predominance of such a combined structure for adjustment costs. However, this has not been shown to extend to Germany yet. Furthermore, adjustment costs are asymmetric. Studies show for Germany that dismissal costs exceed hiring costs.|$|E
