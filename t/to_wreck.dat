5|$|In 1788, Marshall {{announced}} his candidacy to be a {{delegate to the}} Virginia Ratifying Convention. The proposed constitution was very unpopular {{in all parts of}} Kentucky except Jefferson County, but Marshall openly favored its ratification. Hoping <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> Marshall's candidacy, a man named Jordan Harris charged that Marshall had, in a letter to John Crittenden, Sr., acknowledged himself to be a liar. In the pages of the Kentucky Gazette, Marshall called on Harris to publish the letter. Harris was so insulted by Marshall's demand that he threatened to cane him. At their next meeting, Harris fired two pistols at Marshall. Neither shot injured Marshall, who retaliated by beating Harris with a stick severely enough to force his retreat from the encounter.|$|E

25|$|The British Protection of <b>Wrecks</b> Act, enacted <b>to</b> protect {{historic}} <b>wrecks,</b> controls access <b>to</b> <b>wrecks</b> such as Cattewater Wreck {{which can}} only be visited or investigated under licence. The British Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 also restricts access <b>to</b> <b>wrecks</b> which are sensitive as war graves. The Protection of Military Remains Act in some cases creates a blanket ban on all diving; for other wrecks divers may visit provided they do not touch, interfere with or penetrate the wreck. In the United States, shipwrecks in state waters are regulated by the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act of 1987. This act is much more lenient in allowing more open access to the shipwrecks.|$|R
5|$|While {{the comics}} are set during the Sonic X timeline, their plot is original. Eggman imprisons humans inside robots {{and tries to}} use them to kill the animals, but the animals destroy the robots. Eggman uses {{malicious}} Chao to destroy Station Square, but Tikal and Chaos arrive from the past, return the Chao to normal, and bring them back to the past. Soon, Sonic finds a machine in the desert and thinks nothing of it, but after fighting with Eggman in Paris and a bizarre world created by the doctor, Eggman reveals the desert machine was his and it begins <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> Station Square. Sonic defeats it, but he is accused of working with Eggman, so he and Eggman are both locked up. Nelson bails Sonic out of jail, and he saves Cream and Chris from some ghosts.|$|E

The U.S. 36th Infantry Division took possession of the damaged ouvrage on 20 March 1945.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} activities of the spy in the union during a strike is <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> the strike relief benefit fund, upon which, of course, {{the success of the}} strike so largely depends. If the spy cannot himself have access to the fund, his next policy is to spread discontent and cause the strikers to demand higher benefits than the union is able to pay. He will frequently create the impression that the fund is dishonestly handled by the union officials.|$|E

25|$|House {{demolition}} {{is primarily}} a military tactic which {{has been used in}} many conflicts for a variety of purposes. It has been employed as a scorched earth tactic to deprive the advancing enemy of food and shelter, or <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> the enemy's economy and infrastructure. It has also been used for purposes of counter-insurgency and ethnic cleansing. Systematic house demolition has been a notable factor in a number of recent or ongoing conflicts including the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the Darfur conflict in Sudan, the Iraq War, the Vietnam War, the Yugoslav wars and the Caucasian conflicts of the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suggested}} that {{elements of the}} British security forces were using loyalist paramilitaries as proxies. It was said that a significant element within the security forces favoured a military solution to the conflict, and opposed a political solution, which was being pursued by the UK's Labour government. Merlyn Rees, the British government's Northern Ireland Secretary, believed that his polices in pursuit of peace in 1974 had been undermined by a faction in British Army Intelligence. The inference was that the bombings were intended <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> the Sunningdale Agreement and to make both governments take a stronger line against the IRA.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of March 28, 1865, Grant {{modified}} his order, telling Sheridan to lead his troopers around the Confederate right flank and to fight the Confederates, with infantry support, if the Confederates came out of their trenches.

News of the incident quickly reached the Bowery Boys, who then called upon other gangs of the Bowery to join them and confronted the Five Pointers at Bayard Street, where one of the largest street gang battles in the city's history occurred.|$|E
25|$|Ordered to the Pacific, Hall {{departed}} Charleston, South Carolina on 21 December {{and arrived}} at Pearl Harbor 11 January 1944. On 22 January, she cleared Hawaii with Rear Admiral Richmond K.

Sent with three cruisers and three other destroyers on a special mission <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> the airfields on Tarao Island during the invasion, Hall joined in the devastating bombardment of that island 30 January. Her guns knocked out a gasoline dump with a tremendous explosion, hit several gun emplacements, and then screened the larger ships during {{the remainder of the}} firing. Tarao effectively neutralized, the ships then sailed for Kwajalein and the main assault.|$|E
25|$|During Najibullah's {{tenure as}} KHAD head, it {{became one of}} the most brutally {{efficient}} governmental organs. Because of this, he gained the attention of several leading Soviet officials, such as Yuri Andropov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Boris Ponomarev. In 1981, Najibullah was appointed to the PDPA Politburo. In 1985 Najibullah stepped down as state security minister to focus on PDPA politics; he had been appointed to the PDPA Secretariat. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, was able to get Karmal to step down as PDPA General Secretary in 1986, and replace him with Najibullah. For a number of months Najibullah was locked in a power struggle against Karmal, who still retained his post of Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. Najibullah accused Karmal of trying <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> his policy of National Reconciliation.|$|E

25|$|A few ships {{have come}} to grief on the island, however the crews were easily rescued. It is {{said that there are}} the remains of a great many shipwrecks round the Isle. An old story relates that one of the Spanish Armada ships was wrecked here, and sank in deep water. A local sorceress, named as Elcine de Aggart, is said to have used a ball of yarn and spells to cause the ship <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> itself on the island and it is further {{recorded}} that the ship was that of none other than Vice-Admiral Alcarede. The galleon {{is said to have been}} carrying a gold throne on board, a gift to King Phillip of Spain.

25|$|On 19 April 1800, Revolutionnaire and Dryad {{arrived in}} Milford Haven in a distressed state. Dryad {{had been on}} a cruise out of Cork and was on her way home when on 2 April, with her rigging much damaged by hurricanes, when she had {{encountered}} Revolutionnaire, which had lost her rudder. Dryad escorted Revolutionnaire to Cork, but when they were no more than an hour out of the port, the winds blew them towards Plymouth. On 16 April they were close to the rocks at Waterford when Dryad succeeded in getting a cable on to Revolutionnaire. Unfortunately, the cable broke and Dryad pulled away, expecting Revolutionnaire <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> on the rocks. However, providentially, the wind shifted and pushed her away from shore. On 19 April both vessels succeeded in safely reaching Milford Haven.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Islamic terrorists from Soviet Azerbaijan destroy an {{important}} Soviet oil-production facility at Nizhnevartovsk, RSFSR, crippling the Soviet Union's oil production and threatening <b>to</b> <b>wreck</b> the nation's economy due to oil shortages. Energy Minister Mikhail Sergetov, a non-voting candidate {{member of the}} Politburo, suggests making concessions with the West to survive the crisis. He is overruled by the Defense Minister, KGB Chairman Boris Georgiyevich Kosov and the Foreign Minister, who, fearing that the west would {{take advantage of the}} Soviet Union's weakened state to permanently cripple it, instead approve a plan to seize the oil fields in the Persian Gulf by military force. Sergetov reluctantly agrees, claiming that the Soviet Union has sufficient oil reserves for the war in order to gain political favor. The mobilization is tasked to Marshal of the Soviet Union Shavyrin and Commander-in-Chief of Ground Forces Rozhkov.|$|E
