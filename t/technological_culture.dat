"Eiseley {{took the}} {{occasion}} of the lunar landing to consider how far humans had to go in understanding their own small corner of the universe, their home planet, much less what he called the 'cosmic prison' of space. Likening humans to the microscopic phagocytes that dwell within our bodies, he grumpily remarks, 'We know only a little more extended reality than the hypothetical creature below us. Above us may lie realms it is beyond our power to grasp.' Science, he suggests, would be better put to examining that which lies immediately before us, although he allows that the quest to explore space is so firmly rooted in Western <b>technological</b> <b>culture</b> that it was unlikely to be abandoned simply because of his urging. Eiseley's opinion continues to be influential among certain environmentalists, and these graceful essays show why that should be so.|$|E

The rigging of dog-sleds is also similar to these Chukotko-Kamchatkan groups. [...] Spiritual beliefs {{are similar to those of}} the Northwest Coast Indians of North America, whose ancestors migrated from this area. The Nivkh are physically and genetically different from the surrounding peoples, and scholars believe they are the indigenous inhabitants of the area. The current archeological model suggests that a sub-Arctic <b>technological</b> <b>culture</b> originating from the Transbaikal region, termed the microlithic culture, migrated across Siberia and populated the Amur and Sakhalin region during the Late Pleistocene, perhaps earlier. Scientists believe that people of this microlithic (small tool) culture were the first to migrate eastward into the Americas.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{technologies}} and scientific advancements offer not only opportunities but risks. Technological systems {{are vulnerable to}} human error and technical malfunctioning that have far-reaching consequences: one flipped switch can cause a cascading power failure across a networked electric grid. Yet, once addressed, vulnerability accompanied by coping mechanisms may yield a more flexible and resilient society. This book investigates vulnerability, in both its negative and positive aspects, in <b>technological</b> <b>cultures.</b> The contributors argue that viewing risk in terms of vulnerability offers a novel approach to understanding {{the risks and benefits}} of science and technology. Such an approach broadens conventional risk analysis by connecting to issues of justice, solidarity, and livelihood, and enabling comparisons between the global north and south. The book explores case studies that range from agricultural practices in India to neonatal intensive care medicine in Western hospitals; these cases, spanning the issues addressed in the book, illustrate what vulnerability is and does. The book offers conceptual frameworks for empirical description and analysis of vulnerability that elucidate its ambiguity, context dependence, and constructed nature. Finally, the book addresses the implications of these analyses for the governance of vulnerability, proposing a more reflexive way of dealing with vulnerability in <b>technological</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R

Can STS help to make science accountable to society and make it work—make it function in our democracies and let it produce scientific knowledge? In his valedictory lecture, Wiebe Bijker looks back upon three decades of STS research in general, and upon engaging STS with questions of democratization and development in particular. He starts from the question how to study <b>technological</b> <b>cultures</b> and ends with the question how to construct them.

40|$|AbstractThis {{theoretical}} contribution {{deals with}} democratic standards {{in music education}} {{in an era of}} <b>technological</b> <b>cultures.</b> Recalli ng John Dewey‘s claim on Democracy and Education (1916) to consider the effects of the ‘industrial revolution‘, the attention is drawn to the effects of the ‘digital revolution‘, continuing since the middle of the 1990 s. Communication with and through computer interfaces seems {{to be one of the}} basic skills for self-determined participation in the network society. Firstly, there are different authors emphasizing the need to provide the growing-up citizens with the adequate knowledge and skills to face the expectable future challenges. Secondly, music pedagogical scholars are looking for changes into more self-determined democratic paths, as for instance, informal learning. Against this background, I argue for a music pedagogical move to social networking and digitally music production, editing, and recording in the world of digital musical cultures...|$|R
40|$|The paper draws its {{inspiration}} from the provocation which Merton offered sociology both to engage with empirical data and to perform analyses ade-quate to guide intervention beyond the particular case. Whilst contemporary STS is very different both in its models of theory and its forms of methodol-ogy, this paper suggests Merton’s concerns with engagement and adequacy provide a useful way to interrogate current approaches. Specifically, the paper explores some recent anthropological conceptions of ethnographic fieldwork that have provided potent models {{for the study of}} scientific and <b>technological</b> <b>cultures.</b> These multi-sited approaches have also provided the opportunity to develop new notions of intervention and explore alternative ways of making contributions to development of theory and practice. In the process of pursuing the goals of engagement and adequacy notions of ethnography have however become stretched. This sense of detachment from methodological canons accentuates the need for methodological debate and skill-sharing in STS...|$|R
40|$|Cultural {{and social}} studies of {{technology}} have regarded infrastructure as less significant than the interfaces, devices, materials, and practices where processes of consumption, representation, attachment, embodiment, identification, and sociality are most visible. Infrastructural elements of new technologies usually remain {{in the background of}} analysis. What would it mean to invert the figure-ground relation between technology and "infrastructure"? Via a case study of an increasingly popular, everyday contemporary wireless networking technology, Wi-Fi, the author suggests that infrastructures have begun to figure as sites of cultural contestation. Infrastructures work as highly potentialized fields, triggering a multiplicity of interpretations. Using textual and ethno-graphic materials, the author suggests that rather than being the immobile grounds of <b>technological</b> <b>cultures,</b> different imaginings and practices of connectivity run through the many Wi-Fi projects, enterprises, and visions of the past 2 years. In seeking to understand these different imaginings of connectivity, the author suggests that contemporary infrastructures embody cultural logics at odds with each other...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{a specific}} piece of computer code, the Linux operating system kernel, {{as an example}} of how technical operationality figures in contemporary culture. The analysis works at two levels. First of all, it attempts to account for the increasing visibility and significance of code or software-related events. Second, it seeks to extend familiar concepts of performativity to include cultural processes in which the creation of meaning is not central, and in which processes of circulation play a primary role. The analysis concentrates on the practices and patterns of circulation of Linux through versions, distributions, clones and reconfigurations. It argues that technical ‘culture-objects’ such as Linux take on a social existence within contemporary <b>technological</b> <b>cultures</b> because of the authorizing contexts in which the reading, writing and execution of code occur. The ‘force’ or performance of certain technical objects, their operationality, can be understood more as the stabilized nexus of diverse social practices, rules and personae than as a formal property of the objects themselves...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{contemporary}} individual, {{the notion of}} the user, and <b>technological</b> <b>cultures</b> that stem from states to global digital platforms. Taking its lead from social studies, writings on software, and the artistic practice of the author, the thesis asks where and how does the contemporary individual fit within the digital societies of twenty-first century mediated by the technologies of tracking, listing, and surveillance? Through reflexive analysis, this thesis takes a form of a comparative manual both to think on previous artistic work and to construct a possible world for new work, as the artistic practice of the author looks to reveal and test some of these new experiences brought on by the technologies of self-tracking and digital mediation. By building a lineage from the individual to global computational structures, this writing becomes a thread through the collection of artistic work that the author has produced while at MIT. by Rainar Aasrand.

40|$|While {{climate change}} {{inaction}} is often attributed to self-interest and denial, the motivations for action and advocacy {{tend to be}} taken for granted. This asymmetry limits {{our understanding of how}} <b>technological</b> <b>cultures</b> mobilize in the face of crisis. This thesis charts new territory by examining advocacy for CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). CCS could reconcile climate and energy concerns in international climate change mitigation, but there are controversies about its safety and societal implications. CCS supporters include fossil fuel companies, governments, environmental organizations and scientists. As technology advocates they seek political support and public acceptance. Participant observation and interviews with policy actors in Europe and the USA tune in to three dimensions of advocacy: representations of CCS as a public good; organizations channelling CCS support; and emergent communities of CCS experts. Here advocacy factions must negotiate diverging interests, resources, and levels of urgency. Technical-social systems constrain displays of, and commitments to, shared advocacy, belying popular claims about technology as a tool for policy convergence and crisis response...|$|R

40|$|Cultures {{deal with}} their environments by {{adapting}} to them and simultaneously changing them. This is particularly true for <b>technological</b> <b>cultures,</b> such as the dynamic culture of computer users. To date, the ability to change computing environments in non-trivial ways has been dependent upon the skill of programming. Because this skill has been hard to acquire, most computer users must adapt to computing environments created by {{a small number of}} programmers. In response to the scarcity of programming ability, the computer science community has concentrated on producing general-purpose tools that cover wide spectrums of applications. As a result, contemporary programming languages largely ignore the intricacies arising from complex interactions between different people solving concrete problems in specific domains. This dissertation describes Agentsheets, a substrate for building domain-oriented, visual, dynamic programming environments that do not require traditional programming skills. It discusses how Agentsheets supports the relationship among people, tools, and problems in the context of four central themes: (1) Agentsheets features a versatile construction paradigm to build dynamic, visual environments {{for a wide range of}} problem domains such as art, artificial life, distributed artificial intelligence, education, environmental design, an...|$|R
