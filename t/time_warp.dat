5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a <b>time</b> <b>warp</b> {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} distance measures in similarity search of time series; however, the exact calculation of dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> has become a bottleneck. We propose an approach, named early abandon dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping,</b> to accelerate the calculation. The method checks if values of the neighbouring cells in the cumulative distance matrix exceed the tolerance, and if so, it will terminate the calculation of the related cell. We demonstrate the idea of early abandon on dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> by theoretical analysis, and show the utilities of early abandon dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> by thorough empirical experiments performed both on synthetic datasets and real datasets. The results show, early abandon dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> outperforms the dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> calculation in the light of processing time, and is much better when the tolerance is below the real dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> distance...|$|R

Our work is motivated by the observation that subsequence searches slow down quadratically as the total length of data sequences increases. To resolve this problem, we propose the SegmentBased Approach for Subsequence Searches (SBASS), which modifies the similarity measure from <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> to piecewise <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> and limits the number of possible subsequences to be compared with a query sequence.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an effective}} processing of similarity search that supports <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> in large sequence databases. <b>Time</b> <b>warping</b> enables finding sequences with similar patterns {{even when they}} are of different lengths. Previous methods for processing similarity search that supports <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> fail to employ multi-dimensional indexes without false dismissal since the <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> distance does not satisfy the triangular inequality. They have to scan all the database, thus suffer from serious performance degradation in large databases. Another method that hires the suffix tree, which does not assume any distance function, also shows poor performance due to the large tree size. In this paper, we propose a new novel method for similarity search that supports <b>time</b> <b>warping.</b> Our primary goal is to innovate on search performance in large databases without permitting any false dismissal.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the biggest challenge}} in speech recognition – noise reduction. Traditionally detected transient noise pulses are removed with the corrupted speech using pulse models. In this paper we propose {{to cope with the}} problem directly in Dynamic <b>Time</b> <b>Warping</b> domain. Bidirectional Dynamic <b>Time</b> <b>Warping</b> algorithm for the recognition of isolated words impacted by transient noise pulses is proposed. It uses simple transient noise pulse detector, employs bidirectional computation of dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> and directly manipulates with warping results. Experimental investigation with several alternative solutions confirms effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the reduction of impact of noise on recognition process – 3. 9 % increase of the noisy speech recognition is achieved.

25|$|Ron Harper and James Naughton played Alan Virdon and Peter Burke, two 20th-century American astronauts {{who pass}} through a <b>time</b> <b>warp</b> to a future where apes subjugate humans (unlike the {{original}} film, the humans can speak). Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts. Booth Coleman played orangutan Councillor Zaius and Mark Lenard played gorilla General Urko. The episodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen as they look for answers, aid downtrodden humans and apes, and avoid the authorities. The show premiered on September 13, 1974, filling CBS' 8–9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned low ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the series famous. Given the considerable production costs, CBS cancelled the show after 14 episodes, the last airing on December 20, 1974.|$|E

In this report we present a modification of ESNs- <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> invariant echo state networks (TWIESNs) that can effectively deal with <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> in dynamic pattern recognition. The standard approach to classify <b>time</b> <b>warped</b> input signals is to align them to candidate prototype patterns by a dynamic programming method and use the alignment cost as a classification criterion. In contrast, we feed the original input signal into specifically designed ESNs which intrinsically are invariant to <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> in the input. For this purpose, ESNs with leaky integrator neurons are required, which are here presented for the first time, too.

40|$|Dynamic <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> (DTW) is a {{well-known}} quadratic time algorithm to determine the smallest distance and optimal alignment between two numerical sequences, possibly of different length. Originally developed for speech recognition, this method {{has been used in}} data mining, medicine and bioinformatics. For gene expression time series data, <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> distance is arguably a more flexible tool to determine genes having similar temporal expression, hence possibly related biological function, than either Euclidean distance or correlation coefficient—especially since <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> accommodates sequences of different length. The BTW web server allows a user to upload two tab-separated text files A,B of gene expression data, each possibly having a different number of time intervals of different durations. BTW then computes <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> distance between each gene of A with each gene of B, using a recently developed symmetric algorithm which additionally computes the Boltzmann partition function and outputs Boltzmann pair probabilities. The Boltzmann pair probabilities, not available with any other existent software, suggest possible biological significance of certain positions in an optimal <b>time</b> <b>warping</b> alignment.

500|$|After the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, there was academic discourse {{on the effect of}} section8B(1) on the future development of the common law. The amendments merely caused a <b>time</b> <b>warp</b> in the common law, taking it back to 1971. As they did not amount to a codifying or declaratory Act seeking to replace the common law of judicial review, there is uncertainty whether the courts may continue to develop the common law and move away from the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng. Michael Rutter has asserted that the common law can indeed continue to change.

[...] The scene between Magnus and Zimmerman after her return at the very end of the episode was originally meant to be light hearted, but toned this down somewhat as the producers felt that doing so would betray the audience, though they decided Zimmerman was allowed to have a playful attitude, since he did not see the dystopia Magnus saw.|$|E

In the first of two twist endings of the Pierre Boulle book, the astronaut escapes back to planet Earth, only to be greeted by a gorilla in a jeep on the landing strip.

The store was then loaded with merchandise obtained from restaurant supply houses and cooperative food manufactures. The last scene filmed was of the station exploding. After filming ceased, the station was demolished and the road returned to its previous state.
