5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Dot {{moves in}} with fellow senior citizen Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) and is arrested for the illegal use of cannabis, which she confuses for herbal tea. When Lilly leaves after she is mugged, Dot moves in with Pauline. Her oldest friend Ethel also comes {{to stay with}} the Fowlers for a time, having become terminally ill. Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against {{euthanasia}} and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is sent down for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place {{about five years}} before , in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an {{experienced}} crime-fighter {{in the second year}} of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> not know whether he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger and faster than his opponents. However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.|$|E
5000|$|One {{young lady}} said that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>did</b> not care because <b>the</b> <b>police</b> viewed <b>the</b> young female murder victims as [...] "fast girls who hang out a lot". [...] The victims were {{described}} {{by both the}} press and family members as pretty, hardworking, and serious young women, however. Others said the reason why <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>did</b> not take <b>the</b> murder cases serious because the women were both working class and black.|$|R
5|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, {{with whom}} Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer {{disagreed}} with the majority's holding that fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer held that <b>the</b> actions <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>did</b> not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were {{not as important as}} what <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>did</b> <b>do.</b> Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had Alvarado's parents bring him to <b>the</b> <b>police</b> station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|R

Even after checking with metal detectors for guns and bombs, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> {{not allow them to}} go unless they pay. The return journey is more hazardous because they have money in their pockets.|$|E
25|$|A {{spokesperson}} for Pride London {{stated that the}} route of their gay pride march, set for 30 June 2007, would be unchanged although extra precautions such as removing bins would be implemented. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> not think the attacks were targeted at the event. Other suspicious vehicles in Park Lane and Fleet Street were investigated by police, as well as reports of suspicious cars {{in other areas of}} the UK, such as Warrington, which suffered a 1993 bomb attack by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.|$|E
25|$|Robert Donston Stephenson (also {{known as}} Roslyn D'Onston) (20 April 1841 – 9 October 1916) was a {{journalist}} and writer interested in the occult and black magic. He admitted himself as a patient at the London Hospital in Whitechapel shortly before the murders started, and left shortly after they ceased. He authored a newspaper article, which claimed that black magic was the motive for the killings and alleged that the Ripper was a Frenchman. Stephenson's strange manner and interest in the crimes resulted in an amateur detective reporting him to Scotland Yard on Christmas Eve, 1888. Two days later Stephenson reported his own suspect, a Dr Morgan Davies of the London Hospital. Subsequently, he fell under the suspicion of newspaper editor William Thomas Stead. In his books on the case, author and historian Melvin Harris argued that Stephenson was a leading suspect, but <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> {{not appear to have}} treated either him or Dr Davies as serious suspects. London Hospital night-shift rosters and practices indicate that Stephenson was not able to leave on the nights of the murders and hence could not have been Jack the Ripper.|$|E

25|$|When Lynsey gives {{sexual health}} advice via a college radio, she angers Silas who {{prevents}} her receiving a promotion. Lynsey wears a naughty nurse's outfit on webcam for the show, further angering Silas who causes a blackout in Lynsey's flat, breaks in and grabs Lynsey from behind. Silas steals her ring but when Riley hears her screams he leaves. Upon hearing Silas' voice, Lynsey accuses {{him of being}} her attacker. Riley refuses to believe Lynsey and {{due to lack of}} evidence <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> not investigate. Lynsey and Texas begin to question whether Silas is responsible for India's murder. When searching Silas' belongings for her ring, Lynsey is interrupted by Riley and returns home to discover her ring has been returned. Texas makes Riley doubt Silas' innocence and when Lynsey accuses Silas of murdering India, Riley questions Silas. Silas collapses with a heart attack and is taken to hospital where Lynsey is assigned as Silas' nurse. Assuming he is faking a heart attack, Lynsey removes his oxygen mask and questions Silas about his innocence. Silas' daughter Heidi finds Lynsey withholding treatment from Silas and calls for help leading to Lynsey being suspended. Lynsey gives Cheryl some diet pills, which Silas replaces with his heart medication. Cheryl falls, knocking herself unconscious which leads to the discovery of sedatives in her system. Silas tells Cheryl that Lynsey could have given her the sedatives, making her doubt Lynsey's state of her mind.|$|E
500|$|If a party gives {{consent to}} a search, a warrant is not required. There are {{exceptions}} and complications to the rule, including {{the scope of}} the consent given, whether the consent is voluntarily given, and whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another's property. [...] In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973), the Court ruled that a consent search is still valid even if <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> not inform a suspect of his right to refuse the search. This contrasts with Fifth Amendment rights, which cannot be relinquished without an explicit Miranda warning from police.|$|E
500|$|In United States v. Mendenhall (1980), the Court {{held that}} a person is seized only when, by means of {{physical}} force or show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained and, in the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave. In Florida v. Bostick (1991), the Court ruled that as long as <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required, the police contact is a [...] "citizen encounter" [...] that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment. If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government, there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person's privacy under the Fourth Amendment.|$|E

500|$|On 7 July, {{there were}} {{large-scale}} armed demonstrations by ethnic Han in Ürümqi. Conflicting {{estimates of the}} Han demonstrators' numbers were reported by the western media and varied from [...] "hundreds" [...] to as high as 10,000. The Times reported that smaller fights were frequently breaking out between Uyghurs and Hans, and that groups of Han citizens had organised to take revenge on [...] "Uyghur mobs". Police used tear gas and roadblocks {{in an attempt to}} disperse the demonstration, and urged Han citizens over loudspeakers to [...] "calm down" [...] and [...] "let <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> their job". Li Zhi, party chief of Ürümqi, stood on the roof of a police car with a megaphone appealing to the crowd to go home.|$|E
500|$|The {{principle}} {{against a}} public authority fettering its discretion by rigid {{adherence to a}} policy also applies to the exercise of discretionary police powers, as indicated by obiter dicta in the High Court case of Chee Soon Juan v. Public Prosecutor (2011). Although the case did not involve judicial review and did not specifically cite Lines International, Justice Woo Bih Li discussed the validity of a general police policy {{in the context of}} judicial review, opining that the adoption of a policy [...] "determining that political activities as a class posed a greater threat to public order than commercial activities... was not in itself offensive for the purposes of administrative law provided that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> not fetter their discretion and remain prepared to consider the facts of each case".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{was never}} {{questioned}} about the killing. According to an RUC detective, {{he was not}} interrogated for [...] "reasons of operational strategy". Weir suggested that [...] "Jackson was untouchable because he was an RUC Special Branch agent." [...] The Barron Report stated that Weir had made an offer to testify against Jackson and Robert John [...] "R.J". Kerr, but only {{on the condition that}} the murder charge against him was withdrawn. This offer was refused by the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions who said"Kerr and Jackson have not been interviewed by the police because the police state they are virtually immune to interrogation and the common police consensus is that to arrest and interview either man is a waste of time. Both men are known to police to be very active and notorious UVF murderers. Nevertheless <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>do</b> not recommend consideration of withdrawal of charges against Weir. I agree with this view. Weir and McCaughey must be proceeded against. When proceedings against them are terminated the position may be reviewed in respect of Jackson and Kerr".|$|E
