50|$|Surprisingly {{given that}} in {{previous}} years numerous drivers of turbo powered cars had failed to finish a race at San Marino due to running out of fuel and that the 1988 fuel limit of 150 litres was 45 less than in 1986-1987, and 70 less than the 1984-1985 limit, no turbo runner ran out of fuel at Imola in 1988. The only <b>turbo</b> <b>starter</b> to not finish was the Ferrari of local hero Michele Alboreto, who was classified as 18th and last despite suffering engine failure on lap 54. This was his second engine failure of {{the day after his}} Ferrari also blew up in the morning warm-up session forcing him into the spare car for the race. He was also forced to start {{from the rear of the}} field after stalling his engine as the field went away on the warm-up lap.|$|E

As the ignition of such propellants is {{more sensitive to the}} well known igition parameters than most other propellants, a special program was initiated in order to study the effect of these parameters and develop the proper ipition system for the equipment...|$|R
