5|$|Žirmūnai is well-served by Vilnius' bus and <b>trolleybus</b> {{transportation}} network. One of Vilnius' <b>trolleybus</b> hubs {{is located}} in the northernmost part of Žirmūnai elderate, and Vilniaus Autobusai, Vilnius' main bus operator, is headquartered and has its main depot in Žirmūnai. Žirmūnai suffers from rush hour traffic jams. The street network in the district was primarily designed in the Soviet era for a much lower vehicle traffic.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a complex}} system of {{regional}} transportation, providing road, air and rail connections to major cities in Romania and Europe. It {{also features a}} public transportation system consisting of bus, <b>trolleybus</b> and tram lines.|$|E
5|$|Metro began {{testing a}} fleet of new hybrid {{diesel-electric}} buses in 2002, intending to use them in the bus tunnel {{before and after the}} conversion to joint bus-rail operations. The first few of a planned fleet of 235 hybrid diesel-electric articulated buses began operating on tunnel bus routes in June 2004. The Breda dual-mode trolleybuses were removed from the tunnel in January 2005 and would later be refurbished into electric-only trolleybuses for use on the city's <b>trolleybus</b> network. The last day of <b>trolleybus</b> operation in the tunnel was January 24, 2005, with only a single dual-mode bus in service on the final day.|$|E
5|$|The Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (RTA) {{operates}} public bus {{routes in}} the Dayton metro area. In addition to routes covered by traditional diesel-powered buses, RTA {{has a number}} of electric trolley bus routes. The Dayton <b>trolleybus</b> system is the second longest-running of the six remaining <b>trolleybus</b> systems in the U.S., having entered service in 1933. It is the present manifestation of an electric transit service that has operated continuously in Dayton since 1888.|$|E
5|$|The Oslo Tramway had a {{ridership}} of 108 million {{passengers in}} 1948. On 17 January 1949, the Korsvoll Line {{became the first}} tram line to be closed. followed by the Rodeløkka Line on 6 February. The latter reopened following a new route on 2 January 1955. In 1960, with the deregulation of the sale of cars, cheap diesel and the decision to build the metro, the city council decided to close the tram and the <b>trolleybus</b> networks. Tracks would be kept and trams would run until they would be naturally retired. However, no major investments would {{be made in the}} lines or rolling stock. Within a year, the Kampen, Rodeløkka, Vippetangen, Simensbråten and Vestbanen Lines were closed, as were <b>trolleybus</b> lines 18 and 24. The remaining two <b>trolleybus</b> routes were closed in 1968. On 24 June 1968, Vålerenga Line was closed.|$|E
5|$|The square {{was taken}} into use as a tram stop on 1 February 1923. The station took the name after the square, which is again named for the 18th and early 19th-century {{politician}} Carl Berner. From 6 February 1949, Line 20 of the Oslo <b>trolleybus</b> started serving the square. From 2 January 1955, the Rodeløkka Line of the tramway was rerouted to run via Carl Berners plass, although it was closed again on 1961. The underground metro station opened on 16 October 1966, and the <b>trolleybus</b> service was replaced by diesel buses in 1968. From 20 August 2006, the metro station also started serving the Ring Line (Line 5).|$|E
5|$|Andrei {{finds a way}} to {{get hold}} of a car and plans to steal his father's <b>trolleybus.</b> He manages to do so, {{together}} with his friends. His father sees him and starts following the boys with another driver, his colleague. Arriving at the prostitutes' meeting place, the boys cannot find Marilena. Andrei recognizes Giani's car parked in front of block P7, so he goes in.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill {{station is}} also served by three bus routes {{operated}} by King County Metro that use bus stops {{adjacent to the}} station: Route 36, an electric <b>trolleybus</b> route, runs along Beacon Avenue from Othello station to the International District and Downtown; Route 60 runs between West Seattle, Georgetown, Beacon Hill, First Hill and Capitol Hill; and Route 107, which terminates at the station and travels southeasterly to Georgetown, Rainier Beach station, Skyway and Renton.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{on the bus}} tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for extended periods of service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric <b>trolleybus</b> routes onto 1st Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The film's idea {{resulted}} from a small scale exercise between Nemescu and Liviu Marghidan {{when they were in}} university in 2003. The original idea belonged to Cătălin Mitulescu and Andreei Vălean; {{the only part of the}} original story that was kept is that of a group of boys trying to steal a <b>trolleybus</b> in order to get to some prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Othello {{station is}} also served by three bus routes {{operated}} by King County Metro that use bus stops {{adjacent to the}} station: Route 36, an electric <b>trolleybus</b> route, begins at the station and travels north through Beacon Hill and the International District to Downtown Seattle; Route 50 travels west from the station to Seward Park, Columbia City, SoDo and West Seattle; Route 106 provides local, frequent-stop service on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South as well as service to the International District, Renton and Skyway. Prior to March 2016, route 8 served the Martin Luther King Jr. Way corridor, connecting Othello station to the Central District, Capitol Hill, and Lower Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|The Sinsen Line {{opened on}} 1 February 1923 as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line, which {{continued}} along Trondheimsveien to Carl Berners plass. The entire Rodeløkka Line was rebuilt with double track in 1938. In December 1940, a service extension of the Rodeløkka Line was built from Rodeløkka to Søndre Åsen, operated by the Oslo <b>trolleybus,</b> remaining in service until 14 January 1945. The tram service on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated on 6 February 1949, and replaced with bus line 27, although the tracks were kept.|$|E
5|$|The first streetcars {{appeared}} in 1889 and {{were instrumental in}} the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle <b>trolleybus</b> system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|Tunnel {{construction}} {{was completed in}} early June 1990, {{a few weeks before}} the June 23 completion of the Waterfront Streetcar extension serving the future station. International District station was dedicated at a public open house during the annual Seafair on July 15, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. The tunnel was served by dual-mode buses that would switch from diesel power to electric <b>trolleybus</b> (supplied by overhead wires) at International District station and Convention Place station, the tunnel's respective termini.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the {{municipal}} bus company Bergen Sporvei made {{a proposal to}} establish {{what they called the}} Lightning Tram, from Varden in Fyllingsdalen via a tunnel to Møhlenpris and the city center, then make a 120° turn and return along the route of the Bergen <b>trolleybus</b> to Birkelundstoppen. The same year, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature proposed a more extensive system, the Environmental Tram, which more closely resembles the current proposals. From the city center, it would run northwards via Åsane to Flaktveit and southwards via Rådal to the airport (not via Nesttun). The southern section would have branches from Hop to Nesttun and Midttun, and from Minde westwards to Fyllingsdalen and Loddefjord. Later, Bergen Sporvei's successor, Gaia Trafikk, proposed building a bus rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|Rainier Beach {{station is}} also served by three bus routes {{operated}} by King County Metro that use bus stops {{adjacent to the}} station: Route 9 Express, which runs along Rainier Avenue during peak periods towards Downtown Seattle, First Hill and Capitol Hill; Route 106, which provides frequent-stop local service on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South, parallel to Link, and continues southeast to Skyway and Renton; and Route 107, which originates in Renton and travels northwest to Georgetown and Beacon Hill. Metro's Route 7, a major electric <b>trolleybus</b> route, stops several blocks east on Rainier Avenue. Prior to March 2016, route 8 served the Martin Luther King Jr. Way corridor, terminating at the station and traveling north to the Central District, Capitol Hill, and Lower Queen Anne. Metro also runs the Route 97 Link Shuttle, a shuttle service serving Link stations along surface streets during Link service disruptions, between Downtown and Rainier Valley stations.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{music and}} sound was also {{thoroughly}} post-processed by the project's sound designer, Andrei Toncu, {{to improve the}} quality of the recordings, because the budget did not allow for complex equipment to be used, and for creative interest. The movie's background music has reduced volume, following the emotional evolution of the charactersToncu combining the background music (recorded with, or without intention) and a series of effects characteristic to electronic music and musique concrète. However, a few distinct moments can be observed in the film's music, either composed by Andrei Toncu (Andrei imagining stealing the <b>trolleybus),</b> or already existing recordings, edited so that they would integrate into the movie's atmosphere (Elvis Presley's dedication is dynamically equalized to suggest the shift from one radio to another). Another scene in which multiple layers of sound were used was the radio show heard in Giani's car about the breeding of Memestra brassicae butterflies.|$|E
5|$|The town's tram, <b>trolleybus</b> and {{bus fleet}} was always painted in crimson and off-white colours, with ornate gold lining {{out until the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II. The buses were notable in that they never carried exterior advertisements, with the town's crest occupying the space between decks where other bus operators placed adverts; and they carried two green lights on the front, to enable the town's ratepayers to see at night {{which was one of}} the town's own buses and not one of those of a competitor. At local government reorganisation in April 1974, the Wigan Corporation Transport Department became part of Greater Manchester Transport. The former Corporation tram/bus garage in Melverley Street is still in use by First Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Holmenkolbanen had {{built-up}} large debts {{in building}} the underground section to Nationaltheatret, including large amounts of compensation to house-owners who had their buildings damaged during construction. To finance their debt, the Akersbanerne-owned Smestad Line was transferred to Holmenkolbanen on 16 November 1933, with Akersbanerene taking over the majority of shares in Holmenkolbanen. The latter remained listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. From 4 January 1937, Bærumsbanen took over the operation of trams on the Østensjø Line, though the ownership of the line remained with Akersbanerne. Oslo Sporveier started operating <b>trolleybus</b> lines from 1939. On 1 October 1944, Oslo Sporveier bought Bærumsbanen and took over {{the operation of the}} Lillaker and Østensjø Lines. On 1 January 1948, the municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged, and on 31 May 1949, the two municipally-owned companies, Oslo Sporveier and Akersbanerne, merged, taking the name of Oslo Sporveier. The following year, Oslo Sporveier took over Ekebergbanen. In 1975, Oslo Sporveier bought all {{but a few of the}} shares in Holmenkolbanen, and at the same time took over operation of all the suburban lines.|$|E

25|$|Bergen {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} cities in Europe to have both tram and <b>trolleybus</b> electric urban transport systems simultaneously. Public transport in Hordaland is managed by Skyss, which operates an extensive city bus network in Bergen and to many neighbouring municipalities, including one route which operates as a <b>trolleybus.</b> The <b>trolleybus</b> system in Bergen is the only one still in operation in Norway and one of two <b>trolleybus</b> systems in Scandinavia.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 the <b>trolleybus</b> {{operated}} {{along the}} former tram route 3. In June 2009, the <b>trolleybus</b> stopped running, {{and under the}} Pegasusplan the route will revert to tram operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of the Bulwell and Arkwright Street routes to <b>trolleybus</b> operation was well in hand, together with the extension to Bulwell Hall Estate, and <b>trolleybus</b> services over these routes came into operation on Sunday 13 May.|$|E
25|$|The first {{closing of}} tram lines {{occurred}} in 1949; on 17 January {{the line to}} Korsvoll was closed, followed on 6 February the line to Rodeløkka. The line to Rodeløkka was not removed, and a new line opened on 2 January 1955. By 1960 {{the plans for the}} T-bane were in the works, and the city council decided to terminate all tram and <b>trolleybus</b> lines—replacing them with rapid transit and diesel buses. The closure would not be immediate; not until the tram and <b>trolleybus</b> vehicles were to be retired would lines be closed. Within a year the tram lines the Kampen-, Rodeløkka- and Vestbanen Line were closed, as were the <b>trolleybus</b> lines 18 and 24. The remaining two <b>trolleybus</b> routes were closed in 1967.|$|E
25|$|Wolverhampton St George's (in {{the city}} centre) {{is now the}} {{northern}} terminus for the Midland Metro light rail system. Wolverhampton {{was one of the}} few towns to operate surface contact trams and the only town to use the Lorain Surface Contact System. Trolleybuses appeared in 1923, and in 1930 for a brief period the Wolverhampton <b>trolleybus</b> system was the world's largest <b>trolleybus</b> system. The last Wolverhampton <b>trolleybus</b> ran in 1967, just as the railway line through the High Level station was converted to electric operation.|$|E
25|$|Bus rides may be {{paid with}} the Urbana payment card (also {{used for the}} funicular) or with a mobile phone. Sometimes the buses are called trole (referring to trolley poles), harking back to the 1951–71 days when Ljubljana had <b>trolleybus</b> (trolejbus) service. There were five <b>trolleybus</b> lines in Ljubljana, until 1958 {{alongside}} the tram.|$|E
25|$|Trolebuses de Chile, S.A. {{became the}} {{operator}} of the <b>trolleybus</b> system in early 2007.|$|E
25|$|Vilnius has a {{well-developed}} {{public transportation}} system; 45% {{of the population}} take public transport to work, {{one of the highest}} figures in all of Europe. The bus network and the <b>trolleybus</b> network are run by Vilniaus viešasis transportas. There are over 60 bus, 18 <b>trolleybus,</b> 6 rapid bus and 6 night bus routes. The <b>trolleybus</b> network {{is one of the most}} extensive in Europe. Over 250 buses and 260 trolleybuses transport about 500,000 passengers every workday. Students, elderly, and the disabled receive large discounts (up to 80%) on the tickets. The first regular bus routes were established in 1926, and the first trolleybuses were introduced in 1956.|$|E

25|$|Almost every {{settlement}} in Crimea {{is connected with}} another settlement by bus lines. Crimea contains the longest (96km or 59mi) <b>trolleybus</b> route in the world, stretching from Simferopol to Yalta. The <b>trolleybus</b> line starts near Simferopol's Railway Station (at Soviet age start near Simferopol International Airport) through the mountains to Alushta and on to Yalta. The length of line is about 90km. It was founded in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Ruse has an {{extensive}} public transport system with around 30 bus and <b>trolleybus</b> lines, including the Ruse <b>trolleybus</b> system. Most of the buses are operated under a concession by the Bulgarian {{subsidiary of the}} Israeli transport holding Egged Ruse. There are also several suburban bus lines, operated by various private Bulgarian transport companies. A 14 kilometer bicycle network is currently under development in the city.|$|E

25|$|The tram system {{began to}} decline in the 1930s. <b>Trolleybus</b> {{services}} replaced trams on one route in 1934, and by November 1936, all tram services in Portsmouth had been withdrawn. Bus and <b>trolleybus</b> services were reduced during World War II, when the city's dockyards were a target for bombing and its population depleted by evacuation and military service. Unusually, at this time there were two numbers (or letters for trolleybuses) for each route, depending on the direction. In 1946 an agreement was reached between PCT and Southdown to operate jointly on some routes. Leigh Park, which expanded rapidly after the war, was served {{for the first time}} in 1949; although this was intended to be a short-term measure prior to the introduction of <b>trolleybus</b> services, the route was never served by trolleybuses.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, the Königsberg tramway {{system was}} opened, {{and it still}} {{functions}} to this day. In 1975, a <b>trolleybus</b> system was also introduced.|$|E
