40|$|The {{dominant}} vegetation {{types in}} southern California’s coastal foothills are chaparral and costal sage scrub. Chaparral shrubs have mechanically strong evergreen leaves whereas coastal sage scrubs bear mechanical weak, facultative deciduous leaves. What about the ferns {{that live in}} the understory of these vegetation types, especially considering their adaptations to a summer dry, Mediterranean-type climate? We tested the hypothesis that some fern leaves are stronger than others and mechanically strong leaves are associated with greater dehydration tolerance. Twelve fern species were examined. Tissue water relations were assessed via pressure volume curves using Scholander-Hammel pressure chambers. We estimated osmotic potential at saturation (Ys,sat) and at the turgor loss point (Ys,tlp). We examined pinna strength using an Instron Mechanical Testing Device to measure Young’s Modulus (YM) and <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> (TSB). We also measured vein density to determine if it was associated with mechanical strength. We found significant differences among our 12 fern species. Young’s Modulus was positively correlated with dehydration tolerance of leaf tissues, increasing with osmotic potentials at saturation (r 2 = 0. 514) and osmotic potentials at the turgor loss point (r 2 = 0. 536). Consistent with our initial hypothesis, we also found vein density to increase with mechanical strength and Young’s Modulus to increase with increasing <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> We conclude that similar to species of chaparral shrubs and coastal sage scrubs in California the mechanical strength that increasing mechanical strength of leaves may be associated with increasing dehydration tolerance of their cellular tissues...|$|E

The {{glass transition temperature}} of the nanofilled adhesives increased up to an optimal filler loading and then decreased, probably due to concurrent and contrast-ing effects of chain blocking and reduction of the crosslinking degree. <b>Tensile</b> modulus, <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> and fracture toughness of bulk adhesive were posi-tively affected {{by the presence of}} untreated alumina nanoparticles at an optimal filler content.

In particular, the shear strength increased by about 60 % for an optimal filler content of 1 vol. %, and an adhesive failure mechanism was evidenced for all the tested specimens. Concurrently, a relevant decrease of the equilibrium contact angle with water was observed for nanofilled bulk adhe-sives.

" In order to develop thermal joining processes, basic knowledge needs to be created. To gain this knowledge a simple machine is created which allows to bond plastic to metal, in a lap joint or butt joint, to a hybrid product. The plastic is locally plasticized and under welding pressure applied on the metal surface. The heat required to plasticize is introduced via heat conduction into the metal. Accompanying to the joining experiments the process is mapped in a simulation. The simulation based imaging of temperature gradients across {{the thickness of the}} plastic and the metal part gives valuable insights into details of the thermal joining process. The relative error in the simulation was 1. 25 %. In addition to the material combinations, classic joining parameters, such as joining temperature, joining pressure or joining time are varied. Different metals such as stainless steel, aluminum and galvanized steel are combined with different thermoplastics like polycarbonate, polyamide and polybutyleneterephthalate. The latter two thermoplastics are also modified with glassfiber. The surface properties of metals have a significant influence on the adhesion quality. To investigate this influence the roughness of the metal surface is modified by sand blasting or it will be provided with undercuts by laser structuring. With optimal choice of parameters a cohesive failure of the plastic partner is possible.

Clay (Na+ montmorillonite, MMT) particles were used with and without structural modification to obtain silicate nano-layers within the PP matrix. Structural modification of MMT using hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (HTAC) was applied to obtain organophilic silicates (OMMT). XRD results demonstrated that the dispersion of the modified silicate layers and compatibilized with PPgMA (OMMT/PPgMA) is better than those for incompatibilized compositions. The addition of silicate layers increased the crystallization temperature of PP {{as well as the}} thermal stability, but the melting temperature of the nanocomposites was decreased by the addition of silicate as compared with neat PP.

In addition, possible powder production methods are investigated including mechanical and physiochemical methods. Furthermore, some general information about polyolefins is discussed. The experimental part investigates injection moulding grade polypropylene and polyethylene as well as two different commercial polypropylene powders. The material properties of these polyolefins were investigated to determine their suitability {{to be used in the}} SLS. Grinding was employed to pulverize materials in granulate form. Furthermore, the flowability of the powders was evaluated with a SLS machine and tensile specimens were produced with the SLS for the tensile testing. In addition, the fracture surfaces of the tensile specimens were investigated with SEM to evaluate the sintering quality and porosity of the specimens. Thermal analysis showed that all the investigated polypropylenes had adequate thermal properties, however, the investigated polyethylene did not. Rheological properties were superior for the commercial polypropylene powders compared to the injection moulding grade. The commercial powders had a relatively spherical morphology and sufficient particle size. However, grinding did not lead to the desired extrinsic properties. The flowability evaluation showed that the grinded polypropylene could not be spread evenly enough to be able to use it in the SLS. However, both of the commercial powders showed promising flowability and the tensile specimens could be manufactured with one of the commercial powders. The tensile specimens were produced with the different energy density levels to determine the optimal value for the specific material. According to the tensile tests, increasing the energy density level increases the tensile strength.

Glass transition and melting temperatures of 13. 8 and 88. 2 °C respectively, and {{heat of fusion}} of 7. 0 J g i were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (d. s. c.) for the as-synthesized polymer. Crystallization studies from the melt, in both isothermal and dynamic regimes, showed a low crystallizability of PBPP, due to the high mobility and steric hindrance of lateral substituents, with a heat of fusion no higher than 9 J g- 1.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the serious drawback of huge quantities of plastic waste obtained {{at the end of}} the life of agricultural plastic mulching films, researches on innovative biodegradable materials have been developing. The paper examines a new sustainable approach in which a water solution of natural biodegradable polymers is sprayed on a cultivation area in order to form a mulch coating. The material used is a blend of two polysaccharides, such as Guar Gum and Locust Bean Gum additivated with glycerol. A protected field experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of spray black biodegradable mulching coating in a tomato crop in Southern Italy. Field performance and physical properties, evaluated by means of laboratory tests, are compared to those of commercial low density polyethylene and biodegradable starch based mulch films. The spray mulching coating is opaque in the solar radiation range and behaved as a black body. The tested spray coating showed much lower values of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> in comparison with the values of commercial low density polyethylene and biodegradable starch based mulch films. Such innovative coatings were characterised by functionality during their use in field. Results indicate that the biodegradable spray coatings could be a sustainable alternatives to plastic films based on fossil raw materials...|$|R

Protection from hail, wind, snow, or strong rainfall in fruit-farming and ornamentals, shading nets for greenhouses and nets moderately modifying the microenvironment for a crop are the most common applications. A systematic review of the current state-of-the-art of structural parameters, standard and regulations, most common agricultural net applications, and their supporting structures has been developed by means of a literature study, technical investigations, concerning characteristics and use of nets. As a result, the survey highlighted that in many cases different, not even similar, net types were adopted for the same application and the same cultivations by various growers. Results show that neither growers nor net producers have clear ideas about the relationship between the net typology optimization for a specific application and the construction parameters of the net. The choice often depends on empirical or economic criteria and not on scientific considerations. Moreover, it appears that scientifically justified technical requirements for nets used in specific agricultural applications have not been established yet...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{surfactant}} and electron beam (EB) radiation treatment on the morphology and properties of polypropylene (PP) /expanded graphite (EG) composites were investigated. Surfactant treatment and sonication of EG before mixing with PP significantly influenced the morphologies of the composites, and the modification of EG with {{sodium dodecyl sulphate}} (SDS) had a strong negative influence on the electrical conductivities of these composites. The electrical percolation concentration is shifted from 5 to 6 wt% filler to about 10 wt% filler {{in the presence of}} SDS. The melting and crystallization temperatures of PP in the composites were not affected by surfactant or EB radiation treatment. There were small differences in PP crystallinity, depending on the type and combination of treatments. The filler particles acted as nucleating agents and the crystallization temperatures shifted to higher temperatures. The thermal stability of PP was significantly higher after irradiation, and improved even further for the samples containing EG, but the presence of EG had little influence on the thermal stabilities of the non-irradiated composites. For both non-irradiated and irradiated composites the maximum <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> values are lower than the neat matrix, while the tensile modulus increased significantly.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} properties {{of industrial and}} neat Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) polymers, aged under γ-irradiation at different temperatures, are studied. The focus {{is given to the}} dose rate effects in polymer insulation materials, so the ageing is performed in the wide range of dose rates, doses and temperatures. Industrial EPDM samples are extracted from the cables in use in Belgian Nuclear Power Plants (NPP), and the neat EPDM samples are produced in the laboratory. The mechanical tests of non-aged and aged polymers are performed, and the methodology of estimating the polymer life time is discussed. The ultimate <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> are found to be strongly affected by both irradiation condition and temperature. The ultimate <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> clearly exhibits the dose rate effect observed through the shift of the crossover between cross-linking to chain scission process {{as a function of the}} dose. This crossover shifts to high dose for large dose rates, while the opposite is observed by increasing the temperature. Dose rate effect is less evident in the elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> data, probably because both cross-linking and chain scission affect the elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> in the same way, by decreasing it. In comparison to industrial EPDM aged under the same conditions, the cross-linking to chain scission crossover appears at lower dose in neat polymer and the elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> decreases faster by increasing the dose. In addition, the elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> experimental results can be modeled by changing single parameter, namely pre-exponential factor of the irradiation rate constant. This confirms that both aging processes, cross-linking and chain scission affect the elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> in a similar way, by deteriorating network structure responsible for polymer elastic properties. Irradiation rate constant is found to follow the square root dependence for industrial EPDM, while the linear dependence is observed for the neat EPDM. This indicates the existence of different degradation processes in these two polymers...|$|R
40|$|Focal {{point of}} plastic-aesthetic {{operations}} is the cosmetic correction {{of the female}} breast with silicone implants. Main part of them are breast augmentations. Beside the common public interest {{is the use of}} silicone imlants in reconstructive plastic intervention and tumor aftercare. The implant material silicone, considered as inert material for lots of years, causes problems and its degradation could not be explained sufficently up to now. Implantation of a silicone implant can cause the formation of a fibrous capsule as answer of the organism to the foreign material, emersion of silicone filling material into the body (silicone bleeding) or even the total collapse of the implant (rupture). The described reactions require with every third woman an additional surgical intervention. Studies of the implant ageing are often limited to the evaluation of the implant state in vivo or at the point of explantation (ruptures or rate of fibrose capsules) without further analysis. Cause studies concerning the degradation are seldom. Furthermore research is restricted and hindered in comparability and actuality by small sample volumes, short implantation times or concentration on the implants of a single manufacturer. Mechanical ageing of explants was studied only for implants of the US-americain market. They are limited in disposability by the ban of the US-americain health administration FDA since 1992 and are restricted to selected patient panels. The study presented here arised from the question about the material causes for the ageing of 110 of the department for plastic surgery of the Klinikum rechts der Isar, München, explanted silicone implants during the years 2002 to 2005. Compared to hitherto published studies implants with implantation times of 2 weeks up to 31 years were included, containing 16 of the eldest ever studied explants. Main focus of the study was the mechanical, chemical and biological degradation of the mostly silicone filled implants with increasing implantation times. Changes of basic material properties in vivo could be shown by uniaxial tensile tests according to the americain standard ASTM 703 - 96. <b>Tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of the silicone explants decreased with increasing implantation times, whereas the module of elasticity proves itself independent of long invivo-times. Degredation of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> could be already seen after short implantation times of about 1 year, reaching a limit after an implantation period of 10 years combined to a total loss of strength of about 30 % compared to native implants. Chemical analysis of the explants exhibits diffusion processes of non crosslinked residual monomers – or oligomers of the filling material with all studied silicone filled explants, resulting in an accumulation of silicone oils in the implant shells. Extraction with the solvent Hexane showed an increase within a period of 10 years of implantation of about 8 weight per cent to a saturation value of about 18 weight per cent. Furthermore a higher silicone content of the implant shells frequently was accompanied by the incidence of higher fibrous capsule degrees. Irrespective of the implantation time fibrous capsules of baker degrees II – IV could be seen cumulatively with a silicone accumulation of ³ 15 weight per cent silicone oils in the shells. Colonisation tests demonstrated an affinity of characteristic cells of the immune system to silicone gel, but a stronger immun response in general to implants with long implantation times could not be shown. The study of the explants exhibited the role of the enrichment of the implant shells with lightly crosslinked silicone oils as reason for the biodegradation of the implants. The accumulation independent of implant typ or manufacturer showed an impact to the overall ageing of the implants. The measured degradation of strength could be concluded by a preceding elongation of the material, but did not lead to an impairment of the structure {{in the form of a}} softener. The biggest influence can be seen in the biological reaction on the implant material, expressing in a higher risk for the forming of high-grade fibrous capsules...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{correlation}} between morphology and mechanical properties of different triblock terpolymers of polystyrene-b-polybutadiene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), SBM, especially of those having lamellar morphology subtypes (e. g. well segregated lamellae or a transitional lamellar pattern) have been extensively investigated. Moreover, {{the influence of}} polybutadiene (B) isomers (which is mainly controlled by the solvent polarity) on the morphology and mechanical properties have been explored. Different polybutadiene isomers (from higher 1, 2 - to lower 1, 2 -B) were obtained by sequential anionic polymerization method. The morphological and mechanical investigations for different lamellar type SBMs showed that very well segregation of the lamellar domains for both 1, 2 - and 1, 4 - SBM were obtained at molar masses ranging from 80 to 170 kg/mol. Short lamellar domains were found for the molar masses ranging from 40 to 55 kg/mol. Mixed lamellae can be achieved in the polymers containing low molar mass (35 - 70 kg/mol) and higher contents of 1, 4 -B. A transitional lamellar morphology {{were found in the}} 1, 2 -B dominant SBMs and for the presence of significant amount of residual precursors (S homopolymer and SB diblock copolymer). The chain like oriented lamellae was obtained in a SBM existing short chain B domains where the ratio of the 1, 2 - and 1, 4 -B is 1 : 2. The mechanical investigation shows that the polymers with lower x(1, 2) % and relatively higher 1, 4 -B content show moderate stress drops after yielding and an increasing stresses during elongation process. On the other hand, the polymers with higher x(1, 2) % and relatively higher 1, 2 -B contents, higher stress drops and lower strain hardening are observed. Higher elongation was obtained if 1, 4 - B is predominant and the molar masses of SBMs are high. The <b>tensile</b> modulus and <b>stresses</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> were mainly affected by the nature of glassy domains of the polymers as well as the 1, 2 - B content. However, the effect of B isomers on the <b>stresses</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> is moderately low. A strong influence of the ratio of the 1, 2 - and 1, 4 -B was observed on the mechanical properties. If the molar mass of the B domains are low and the ratio of 1, 2 - and 1, 4 -B is close to 1 : 2, the mechanical properties are found remarkably low. The deformation patterns were studied from in-situ tensile test- SAXS evaluation. An anisotropic deformation behavior for 1, 2 -B content SBMs and a four point SAXS pattern for 1, 4 -B content SBMs were unveiled. No orientation occurs in low molar mass 1, 2 - SBM (1, 2 S 31 B 31 M 3855) due to the ductile behavior. On the contrary, orientation perpendicularly to the stretching direction at large elongation occurs in high molar mass 1, 2 -SBM (1, 2 S 32 B 31 M 3791). In case of low molar mass 1, 4 -SBM (1, 4 S 30 B 29 M 4153), random orientation occurs at 300 % elongation whereas slightly orientation perpendicular to the stretching upto 400 % elongation was seen for high molar mass 1, 4 -SBM (1, 4 S 34 B 31 M 3580). Significant influences of the residual precursors on the mechanical properties during tensile test were found. The results show an increasing tendency of E-modulus but a decreasing tendency of <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> and strain <b>at</b> <b>break</b> for the presence of high amount of residual precursors...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the effect}} of {{modification}} through transition metal ions (TMI) on montmorillonite (MMT) clay that was incorporated into thermoplastic polyurethane (PU) was discussed. The TMI modification was intended to achieve a good dispersion of the clay into PU with fewer agglomerates. The modification of the MMT clay was carried out using Copper (II) Chloride and Iron (III) Chloride. The fabrication of the nanocomposites was done via solution intercalation method by employing chloroform as the solvent. The clay content was varied at three different clay loadings (1 to 3 weight percentage). The existences of the TMIs on the modified clay were confirmed through Inductive Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) whereas its morphological structure was tested through Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The morphology of PU-MMT nanocomposites was determined through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), XRD and FESEM. The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were studied through its <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> whereas its thermal properties were analysed using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and thermal conduction. Gas and water permeation through the nanocomposites was employed to investigate the nanocomposite’s barrier properties. The modification process was proved successful as high amount of copper and iron ions were detected in the ICP-MS and even distribution of the clay was obtained in FESEM. XRD data with higher d-spacing values was obtained for PU with modified clay which suggests that a good intercalated structure has been achieved. SEM micrographs illustrated lesser agglomerates in PU with modified clay nanocomposites due to the TMI modification that enables an even distribution of the clay into PU. The homogeneous dispersion of the clay strengthened the structure of PU {{which led to a}} remarkable improvement in its mechanical properties. The highest increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> was obtained in 2 % PU-MMT Cu which showed 148 % hike in its 1 % and 3 % clay loading. The thermal stability was also improved in the modified nanocomposites due to its higher thermal degradation temperature however there were no significant effect of the clay on the melting temperature of the nanocomposites. Thermal conductivity of the PU nanocomposites decreased with increasing clay loading which makes it a suitable thermal insulation material. Both the gas and water permeability decreased in PU with modified clay nanocomposites due to the formation of the tortuous path in its matrix. The highest significant decrease in the gas permeation analysis amounted to 68 % in 3 % PU-MMT Fe and 40 times decrement in water permeation coefficients were obtianed in 1 % PU-MMT Fe. The results obtained showed that the incorporation of modified clay into PU has brought significant improvements in its properties...|$|R
