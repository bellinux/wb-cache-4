40|$|We {{analysed}} 57 {{patients with}} non-myeloid malignancies {{who received a}} non-purged autologous PBSCT, All had similar mobilisation and conditioning regimens. A high prior chemotherapy score {{and the number of}} chemotherapy lines used (P = 0. 015 and P = 0. 01, respectively) were adverse predictors of CD 34 cell yields. Lower CD 34 values (P = 0. 002) were seen in patients treated with potent stem cell toxins (BCNU, melphalan, CCNU and mustine), designated <b>toxicity</b> <b>factor</b> 4 agents (<b>TF</b> 4), All patients infused with grafts containing CD 34 cell doses between 1. 0 and 2. 0 x 10 (6) /kg (range 1. 25 - 1. 90) engrafted by day 51. The only variable associated with slow platelet recovery was exposure to TF 4 (P = 0. 007), The majority of patients with CD 34 > 1. 0 x 106 /kg achieved rapid and sustained engraftment and the only predictive factor of delayed recovery is prior exposure to stem cell toxins, Potential PBSCT candidates should if possible avoid first line and salvage chemotherapy containing TF 4 drugs. We therefore advocate a minimum CD 34 threshold of > 1. 0 x 10 (6) /kg in patients without extensive prior chemoradiotherapy, and {{greater than or equal to}} 2. 0 x 10 (6) /kg in all other patients...|$|R

40|$|Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) {{is one of}} the {{non-traditional}} {{techniques to}} simulate natural phenomena into a numerical algorithm. TLBO mimics teaching learning process occurring between a teacher and students in a classroom. A parameter named as teaching <b>factor,</b> <b>TF,</b> seems to be the only tuning parameter in TLBO.
