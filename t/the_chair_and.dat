5|$|In 2005, Target {{started selling}} an Emeco 1006 {{imitation}} product supplied by Euro Style. The supplier said it planned {{to modify the}} chair's style to avoid a legal dispute over alleged trademark infringement.

Restoration Hardware removed the chair from its website, stopped selling <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> reached an undisclosed settlement with Emeco.|$|E

5|$|After The Legacy disbanded, Orton unsuccessfully {{challenged}} Jack Swagger for the World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules in April. During {{a number}} one contender's {{match for the}} WWE Championship on Raw, Orton was speared by Edge, costing him the match and setting up a bout at Over the Limit, Orton separated his right shoulder during the match, which ended in a double countout. At Fatal 4-Way in June, Orton competed in a fatal four-way WWE Championship match involving champion Cena, Edge, and Sheamus, who won the title after interference from The Nexus. On July 18 at Money in the Bank, Orton competed in a Money in the Bank ladder match for a WWE Championship contract, which was won by The Miz. The following night on Raw, he won a number one contender's match over Edge and Chris Jericho, earning a WWE Championship match against Sheamus at SummerSlam. Sheamus was disqualified for bringing a chair into the ring, giving Orton the win, but not the title. Immediately afterward, Orton hit Sheamus with <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> an RKO onto the broadcast table.|$|E
5|$|Before {{deciding}} on Capital Waterside {{as the site}} of the National Assembly, Davies announced on 13 March 1998, that an international competition would be held to select the design of the building for the debating chamber. Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Competitions would oversee the competition and a design panel would recommend a design to the Secretary of State for Wales. The Design Competition Advisory Panel was made up of seven members and was chaired by Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, the former MP for Cardiff South and Penarth and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> four members were appointed by Davies and the remaining two members were appointed by the RIBA. The competition was advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 June 1998.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Rhodes fought Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore and A-1, in what was billed as a Prince of Darkness match next. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 20 seconds. In this contest, there would be three falls, but the third fall would be contested under blindfold match rules, in which both wrestlers wore hoods over their heads. Roode earned the first fall with a roll-up pin, and Dustin earned the second one when he forced Roode face-first into the mat from the top rope. During the third fall, both wrestlers wore black hoods that impaired their vision, causing Dustin to accidentally knock the referee unconscious in storyline terms. Due to this, D'Amore opened the cage door and passed Roode a steel folding chair. Roode then attempted to bash Dustin with it but instead mistakenly struck D'Amore. Dustin then grabbed <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> struck Roode with it, which gave him the pinfall as the referee came to.|$|E

5|$|In late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, Rivers briefly {{considered}} running {{to be the}} chair of Clark County, a new position created with the home rule charter that Rivers worked to pass. There is no official rule against serving both as <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> a state senator, but there were concerns about Rivers' ability to balance the two offices. In December 2014, Rivers officially announced she would run for the office. On March 2, 2015, The Columbian reported Rivers would likely be withdrawing from the race later that week. That was confirmed when Rivers released a statement later that day that said Rivers {{would not be a}} candidate. Rivers cited the time commitment and desire to stay in the State Senate as reasons for her withdrawal. She was considered the front runner for the office.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{he needs}} allies, Batman works with Gordon {{and the police}} to retake the prison. Sitting at the {{electric}} chair, the Joker offers Batman a choice: kill Bane, or allow Bane's heartbeat to charge <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> kill the Joker. Batman uses the electric gloves to stop Bane's heart. Satisfied, the Joker leaves, intending to detonate bombs placed around the city. Batman revives Bane, who injects himself with a steroid that transforms him into a hulking beast. He loses the ensuing battle to Batman and suffers amnesia as a side effect from the steroid, thus preserving Batman's secret identity. With Gordon's help, Batman locates the Joker in the prison chapel. Dismayed that Bane is still alive, the Joker tries to goad Batman into killing him but Batman subdues him instead. Gordon chooses not to pursue Batman, believing he can help the city. In a radio interview during the credits, Quincy Sharp says he will lobby to reopen Arkham Asylum to house the city's worst criminals; after the credits, an imprisoned Deathstroke is approached by Amanda Waller to join her Suicide Squad.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{focused on}} her family full-time, and {{continued}} to concentrate on her interior design business. Several of her clients came from the NASCAR community. She also started a company called Happy Chairs in the Matthews area of Charlotte where she creates her own furniture and redesigns old chairs. It came after Robinson looked for furnishings in a national furniture chain store and discovered a display chair that she liked. She begins the process of renovating old chairs by searching for those that are in poor condition but are structurally intact and are architecturally appealing. Robinson dismantles <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> starts reconstructing it. Her work has received critical acclaim from online magazines and customers. Robinson names designer Trina Turk and several clothing companies as her influences.|$|E

5|$|The anti-Khrushchev {{minority}} in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck {{at the heart of}} Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At a 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through Minister of Defense Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, accused of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Steel cage {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Triple H and Randy Orton. During the {{beginning}} of the match, Triple H gained the advantage over Orton, as he performed a High Knee on Orton. Orton came back with a kick to the gut before starting his prolonged attack and attempting to escape through the cage door but Triple H prevented him from escaping. Triple H took control as he took out Orton's knee with a chop block and applied a figure four leglock. After Orton broke the hold, he crawled across to the cage door to escape, but Triple H grabbed him back inside. But, on the way back in, Orton managed to grab a steel chair that was on the ring floor. Orton tried to hit Triple H with the chair, but Triple H managed to avoid being hit. Triple H grabbed the chair to hit Orton with it, but Orton hit him in the groin. Orton followed this with a chair shot to Triple H's back and performed a DDT. Throughout the match, Orton tried escaping from the cage, but was not in successful in doing so, as Triple H dragged him back in each time. The match came to an end when Orton tried to execute a running punt on Triple H's head, however, Triple H grabbed <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> hit Orton with it. Triple H followed up by executing a pedigree. Triple H covered Orton for the pinfall victory, and thus retaining his title.|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E
