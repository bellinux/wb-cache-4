5|$|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the <b>taproot,</b> although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured <b>taproot.</b>|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata has {{a central}} <b>taproot</b> and few lateral roots. Clusters of fine {{branched}} proteoid roots up to 15cm (6in) long arise from larger roots. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, {{such as the}} phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Daucus carota is a {{biennial}} plant. In {{the first}} year, its rosette of leaves produces {{large amounts of}} sugars, which are stored in the <b>taproot</b> to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.|$|E
40|$|<b>Taprooted</b> crops create large sized biopores in the subsoil {{which in}} turn {{facilitate}} root growth of following crops. To date it was unclear, over which periods of time biopores created by <b>taproots</b> remain stable. This study based on a long-term field experiment provides evidence that soil physical effects of <b>taprooted</b> chicory are persistent even 6 years after cultivation. Moreover, repeated cultivation of <b>taprooted</b> crops probably has cumulative beneficial effects on soil structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} compares the {{exogenous}} NAD(P) H oxidation and the membrane potential ([delta][psi]) generated in mitochondria isolated from different tissues {{of an important}} agricultural crop, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris}. We observed that mitochondria from <b>taproots,</b> cold-stored <b>taproots,</b> and in vitro-grown tissue cultures contain a functional NADH dehydrogenase, whereas only those isolated from tissue cultures displayed a functional NAD(P) H dehydrogenase. It is interesting that the NADH-dependent [delta][psi] of mitochondria from cold-stored <b>taproots</b> and from tissue cultures was not affected by free Ca 2 + ions, whereas free Ca 2 + was required for the mitochondrial NADPH oxidation by in vitro-grown cells and cytosolic NADH oxidation by mitochondria from fresh <b>taproots.</b> A tentative model accounting for the different response to Ca 2 + ions of the NADH dehydrogenase in mitochondria from cold-stored <b>taproots</b> and tissue cultures of B. vulgaris is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Soil {{characteristics}} strongly {{influence the}} architecture of taproots; for example, deep rich soils favour the development of vertical <b>taproots</b> in many oak species such as Quercus kelloggii, while clay soils promote the growth of multiple <b>taproots.</b>|$|R
5|$|The most {{commonly}} eaten portion is the napiform <b>taproot,</b> although the entire plant is edible and the tops {{can be used}} as a leaf vegetable. The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw in a similar way to a mung bean.|$|E
5|$|T. oreades has {{a central}} <b>taproot</b> and few lateral roots. Like most Proteaceae, it has fine proteoid roots {{that arise from}} larger roots. These are roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E

40|$|Purple carrots {{accumulate}} abundant cyanidin-based anthocyanins in <b>taproots.</b> UDP-glucose: {{sinapic acid}} glucosyltransferase (USAGT) can transfer the glucose moiety to the carboxyl group of sinapic acid thereby forming the ester {{bond between the}} carboxyl-C and the C 1 of glucose (1 -O-sinapoylglucose). 1 -O-sinapoylglucose can serve as an acyl donor in acylation of anthocyanins and generate cyanidin 3 -xylosyl (sinapoylglucosyl) galactoside in purple carrots. This final product helps stabilize the accumulation of anthocyanins. In this study, a gene named DcUSAGT 1 encoding USAGT was cloned from 'Deep purple' carrot <b>taproots.</b> Enzymatic activity was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The optimal temperature and pH value were 30 Â°C and 7. 0, respectively. Kinetic analysis suggested a Km (sinapic acid) of 0. 59 mM. Expression profiles of DcUSAGT 1 showed high expression levels in the <b>taproots</b> of all the three purple carrot cultivars but low expression levels in those of non-purple carrot cultivars. The USAGT activity of different carrots in vitro indicated that crude enzyme extracted from the purple carrot <b>taproots</b> rather than non-purple carrot <b>taproots</b> exhibited USAGT activity. These results indicated that DcUSAGT 1 may influence anthocyanin biosynthesis of purple carrot <b>taproots...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a <b>taproot</b> which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the <b>taproot</b> eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged <b>taproot.</b> Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The root {{structure}} of B.prionotes exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is phreatophytic, that is, its long <b>taproot</b> extends {{down to the}} water table, securing it a continuous water supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though the supply of water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that are adequate for the plant's nutritional needs.|$|E

40|$|Nematodes cause yield {{reduction}} in agriculture worldwide. In research, {{the main focus}} has been on cyst nematodes and root-knot nematodes and not so much on free-living plant-parasitic nematodes. Thus, the importance of free-living plant-parasitic nematodes is likely underestimated. The aim of this survey was to get an overview of free-living plant-parasitic nematodes in carrot (Daucus carota var. sativus) production, and their association with damage. Soil samples were collected from 19 fields in the carrot-producing regions of Norway where nematode damage was suspected. The samples were analysed for free-living plant-parasitic nematodes. The analyses showed that free-living plant-parasitic nematodes occur frequently in carrot fields in Norway. Root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.) were the most frequently occurring genus and P. crenatus the most frequently occurring species. Symptoms of nematode damage were observed in all the samples where <b>taproots</b> were received for analysis. Symptoms observed in this survey include, but are not limited to, necrotic spots, forked <b>taproots,</b> split <b>taproots,</b> short <b>taproots</b> and <b>taproots</b> with galls. In fields with a high occurrence of Longidorus spp. and Xiphinema, growth of carrots seems to be severely disturbed. Geographical distribution of Xiphinema spp. seems to be limited to the south of Norway...|$|R

5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding <b>taproot</b> makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and lower}} leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2â2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow <b>taproot.</b>|$|E
