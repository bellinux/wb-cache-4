5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> edges.|$|E
5|$|When Zong sailed from Accra with 442slaves on 18August 1781, it {{had taken}} on more than <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people that it could safely transport. In the 1780s, British-built ships {{typically}} carried 1.75slaves per ton of the ship's capacity; on the Zong, the ratio was 4.0 per ton. A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193slaves and it was extremely unusual for a ship of Zong relatively small size to carry so many.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pieces available.|$|E

5|$|Confederate forces {{still at}} Columbus blocked the Union army's {{access to the}} lower Mississippi. Grant, and General James B. McPherson, {{came up with a}} plan to bypass Columbus and with a force of 25,000 troops, move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and then ten miles east to Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, with the aid of gunboats, opening both rivers and {{allowing}} the Union access further south. Grant presented his plan to Henry Halleck, his new commander under the newly created Department of Missouri. Halleck was considering the same strategy, but rebuffed Grant, believing he needed <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> troops. However, after Halleck telegraphed and consulted McClellan about the plan, he finally agreed on condition that the attack be conducted in close cooperation with navy Flag Officer, Andrew H. Foote. After Foote's gunboats had silenced most of the guns at the fort, Grant's troops moved in and easily captured Fort Henry on February 6, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{learned to}} swim at Bankstown {{at the age}} of 7. She was {{initially}} slow to learn, and her coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. This allowed him to fish her out of the water if she fell into difficulty. Due to her slow learning, Morgan was given <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lessons as the other students. At the age of eight, she won the district championship, and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) Primary School Championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of Frank Guthrie in Enfield. At the time, Guthrie was {{regarded as one of the}} best coaches in the state; his students included Gary Chapman, Kevin O'Halloran and Lorraine Crapp. All three (plus Morgan) would win medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Her mother had to drive her to Enfield, as her father was busy with the plumbing business.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom, and this continued through the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed {{the name of the}} country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army became the VKJ. The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its formations. For example, Yugoslav infantry divisions had <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> men of contemporary British infantry divisions. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} alcohol (1 ml per kg body weight) on {{the rate of}} forgetting was {{investigated}} using a continuous recognition memory paradigm. Subjects were required to make a speeded old/new response to each of 200 items presented sequentially on a computer screen. Ninety-five items appeared <b>twice.</b> <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> items intervening {{between the first and}} second occurrence were 1, 4, 9, 19 and 49 (19 of each). With alcohol, subjects were less sensitive (decreased d-prime) and more conservative (increased beta). Recognition speed and accuracy were both impaired by alcohol and by increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> intervening items. In addition, an interaction between the effects of alcohol and of delay on recognition accuracy indicates that the impairment of memory with alcohol can be at least partly attributed to faster forgetting...|$|R
5|$|The {{restructuring}} {{also called}} for the reduction of four services on the Meråker Line and two services to Oppdal, terminating all commuter train services on the lines. For the service to Oppdal, NSB had an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million and 21,000 passengers in 1998. The Meråker Line had about <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> passengers. The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies, they were free to do so. As compensation, travelers between Trondheim and Rennebu and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to not pay for seat reservations on the intercity services. Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the commuter train services, so they could continue the service to Oppdal, but this {{was rejected by the}} ministry.|$|E
5|$|The {{quantity}} of benthic macroinvertebrates at sites in Tangascootack Creek has been {{measured by the}} West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition using different systems. These sites included designations T-1 and T-2the main creek just {{above and below the}} entry of Muddy Run, respectivelyand T-3 which is further downstream from T-2. Total taxa richness, as measured by the organization, ranged from 3 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 7 at site T-1, with an average of 4.3. The EPT Taxa Richness (measured on a scale of 0 to 4) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 2 at site T-1, with an average of 0.7. The scores of the sites according to version 3 of the Beck’s Index (<b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pollution-intolerant benthos taxa plus the number of facultative benthos taxa) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 6 at site T-1. On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (a method of determining a stream's ecosystem quality based on its benthic macroinvertebrates), the sites ranged from 3.538 for site T-1 to 6.2 for site T-2, with an average of 5.024. On the Shannon index, the sites ranged from 0.950 at site T-2 to 1.925 at site T-3, with an average of 1.325.|$|E

The peak potentials of gram-negative bacteria were 0. 70 to 0. 74 V versus the SCE. Gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria were also classified based on the ratio of the second peak current to the first peak current when the potential cycle was repeated <b>twice.</b> <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> cells on <b>the</b> membrane filter were determined from the peak currents.

50|$|Like mitosis, meiosis {{is a form}} of {{eukaryotic}} cell division. Meiosis gives rise to four unique daughter cells, each of which has half <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes as <b>the</b> parent cell. Because meiosis creates cells that are destined to become gametes (or reproductive cells), this reduction in chromosome number is critical — without it, the union of two gametes during fertilization would result in offspring with <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes.|$|R
25|$|To {{preserve}} <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes in <b>the</b> offspring – which differs between species – each gamete {{must have}} half <b>the</b> usual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes present in other body cells. Otherwise, the offspring will have <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> chromosomes, and serious abnormalities may result.
