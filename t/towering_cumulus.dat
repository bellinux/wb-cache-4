50|$|Cumulus {{castellanus}} (from Latin castellanus, castle) {{is a type}} of cumulus {{cloud that}} is distinctive because it displays multiple towers arising from its top, indicating significant vertical air movement.

It is therefore one of three warning clouds often recorded by the aviation industry, the other two being <b>towering</b> <b>cumulus</b> and cumulonimbus. Altocumulus generally forms about 2,000 to 6,100 m above ground level, a similar level to altostratus formations, and satellite photography has revealed that {{the two types of}} cloud can create formations that can stretch for thousands of square miles. Extensive altocumulus formations, particularly if they take the form of undulatus are often referred to as altocumulus mackerel sky.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three drought relief {{cloud seeding}} {{programs}} were conducted ~n Georgia {{during the summer}} of 1977 by on-site meteorologists who flew on specially equipped seeding aircraft. Suitable clouds, actively growing <b>cumulus</b> <b>towers</b> reaching at least the- 5 °C level, were seeded with ejectable silver iodide pyrotechnic flares. The seeding technique was patterned after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Florida Area Cumulus Experiment (FACE) in southern Florida, and followed a dynamic seedability hypothesis. In limited evaluation of one of the three programs, a target~ontrol comparison indicated an excess of 27 percent in actual July-August precip-itation over that predicted from control area precipitation. A one tailed Student’s t test indicated less than five chances in 100 that this difference could be attributed to chance. 1...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} GCM parameterizations for {{two types}} of ice clouds: (1) ice clouds formed by large-scale lifting, often of limited vertical extent but usually of large-scale horizontal extent; and (2) ice clouds formed as anvils in convective systems, often of moderate vertical extent but of mesoscale size horizontally. It is shown that the former type of clouds can be parameterized with reference to an equilibrium between ice generation by deposition from vapor, and ice removal by crystal settling. The same mechanisms operate in the mesoscale clouds, but the ice content in these cases {{is considered to be}} more closely linked to the moisture supplied to the anvil by <b>cumulus</b> <b>towers.</b> It is shown that a GCM can simulate widespread ice clouds of both types...|$|R
500|$|Dr. R. Cecil Gentry {{became the}} {{director}} of Stormfury in 1968. [...] There were no more near-seedings until 1969. In the interim, equipment was improved. What once was the primitive method of hand-dumping dry ice was replaced with rocket canisters loaded with silver iodide, and then gun-like devices mounted {{on the wings of}} the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds. Observation equipment was improved. Additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the working hypothesis. The new theory took <b>cumulus</b> <b>towers</b> outside the eyewall into account. According to the revised theory, by seeding the towers, latent heat would be released. This would trigger the start of new convection, which would then cause a new eyewall. Since the new eyewall was outside the original one, the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart. In addition, since the new eyewall was broader than the old one, the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure difference.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a parametrization of Jovian moist convection based on a heat engine model of moist convection. In comparison to other moist convection schemes, this framework allows the computation of the total available convective energy TCAPE and the corresponding mass flux M as dynamic variables from the mean atmospheric state. The effects of this parametrization have been investigated both analytically and numerically. In agreement with previous numerical experiments and observations, the inclusion of moist convection leads to heat and water vapor transport from the water condensation level into higher altitudes. The time development of the modeled convective events {{was found to be}} strongly influenced by a rapid reduction of kinetic energy and a subsequent lowering of the <b>cumulus</b> <b>tower's</b> top in response to convective heating. We have tested the sensitivity of the scheme to different variations in the fractional cloud coverage and under the inclusion of external radiative forcing towards a stable/unstable temperature profile. While the time development of convective events differs in response to these variations, the general moist convective heating and moistening of the upper troposphere was a robust feature observed in all experiments. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Our {{ability to}} study and {{quantify}} the impact of cloud-radiation interactions in studying global scale climate variations strongly relies upon the ability of general circulation models (GCMs) to simulate the coupling between the spatial and temporal variations of the model-generated cloudiness and atmospheric moisture budget components. In particular, the ability of GCMs to reproduce the geographical distribution of the sources and sinks of the planetary radiation balance depends upon their representation of the formation and dissipation of cloudiness in conjunction with cloud microphysics processes, and the fractional amount and optical characteristics of cloudiness {{in conjunction with the}} mass of condensate stored in the atmosphere. A cloud microphysics package which encompasses five prognostic variables for the mass of water vapor, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and snow has been implemented in the Colorado State University General Circulation Model (CSU GCM) to simulate large-scale condensation processes. Convection interacts with the large-scale environment through the detrainment of cloud water and cloud ice at the top of <b>cumulus</b> <b>towers.</b> The cloud infrared emissivity and cloud optical depth of the model-generated cloudiness are interactive and depend upon the mass of cloud water and cloud ice suspended in the atmosphere. The global atmospheric moisture budget and planetary radiation budget of the CSU GCM obtained from a perpetual January simulation are discussed. Geographical distributions of the atmospheric moisture species are presented. Global maps of the top-of-atmosphere outgoing longwave radiation and planetary albedo are compared against Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) satellite data...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of deep convection on water vapor in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL), the region {{just below the}} high (∼ 18 km), cold tropical tropopause, remains an outstanding question in atmospheric science. Moisture transport to this region is important for climate projections because it drives the formation of local cirrus (ice) clouds, which have a disproportionate impact on the Earth's radiative balance. Deep <b>cumulus</b> <b>towers</b> carrying large volumes of ice are known to reach the TTL, but their importance to the water budget has been debated for several decades. We show here that profiles of the isotopic composition of water vapor can provide a quantitative estimate of the convective contribution to TTL moistening. Isotopic measurements from the ACE satellite instrument, in conjunction with ice loads inferred from CALIOP satellite measurements and simple mass-balance modeling, suggest that convection is the dominant source of water vapor in the TTL up to near-tropopause altitudes. The relatively large ice loads inferred from CALIOP satellite measurements can be produced only with significant water sources, and isotopic profiles imply that these sources are predominantly convective ice. Sublimating ice from deep convection appears to increase TTL cirrus {{by a factor of}} several over that expected if cirrus production were driven only by large-scale uplift; sensitivity analysis implies that these conclusions are robust for most physically reasonable assumptions. Changes in tropical deep convection in future warmer conditions may thus provide an important climate feedback. Comment: Submitted to PNA...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} severe weather and organized lines of <b>cumulus</b> <b>towers,</b> called feeder clouds, which form in the inflow region of supercell and multicell thunderstorms. Using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery, correlations between the occurrence of feeder clouds and severe weather reports are explored. Output from theWeather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) mesocyclone detection algorithm (MDA) is also assessed for {{a subset of the}} satellite case days. Statistics from the satellite and radar datasets are assembled to estimate not only the effectiveness of feeder cloud signatures as sole predictors of severe weather, but also the potential utility of combining feeder cloud analysis with the radar’s MDA output. Results from this study suggest that the formation of feeder clouds as seen in visible satellite imagery is often followed by the occurrence of severe weather in a storm. The study finds that feeder cloud signatures by themselves have low skill in predicting severe weather. However, if feeder clouds are observed in a storm, there is a 77 % chance that severe weather will occur within 30 min of the observation. For the cases considered, the MDA {{turns out to be the}} more effective predictor of severe weather. However, results show that combined predictions (feeder clouds plus mesocyclones) outperform both feeder cloud signatures and the MDA as separate predictors by; 10 %– 20 %. Thus, the presence of feeder clouds as observed in visible imagery is a useful adjunct to the MDA in diagnosing a storm’s potential for producing severe weather. 1...|$|R
