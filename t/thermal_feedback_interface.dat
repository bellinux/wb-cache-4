This work addresses the coupled problem of thermal recycling, which is, so far, the missing link for complete GWHP assessment.

The results are compared with the three previous simulations in this series which consists of a model with no {{star formation}}, star formation but no form of feedback and star formation with photoelectric heating in a set with steadily increasing physical effects.

The outflows from the feedback reduce the mass of the cloud but do not destroy it, allowing the cloud to survive its stellar children.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} effect of pebble packing changes on the reactivity of a pebble-bed reactor (PBR) is performed. As a first step, using the MCNP code, the modeling of a PBR core as a continuous and homogenous region is compared to the modeling as a collection of discrete pebbles of equal average fuel density. It is shown that the two modeling approaches give the same trends inasmuch as changes in keff are concerned. It is thus shown that for the purpose of identifying trends in keff changes, the use of a homogeneous model is sufficient. A homogenous model is then used to assess the effect of pebble packing arrangement changes on the reactivity of a PBR core. It is shown that the changes can be large enough to result in prompt criticality. It is shown that for uranium fueled PBRs, <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback</b> could have the potential to offset the increase in activity, whereas for plutonium fueled systems, <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback</b> may not be sufficient for totally offsetting the packing-increase reactivity insertion and could even exacerbate the initial response.

40|$|We compare several common {{sub-grid}} implementations of AGN feedback, {{focusing on}} the effects of different triggering mechanisms and the differences between <b>thermal</b> and kinetic <b>feedback.</b> Our main result is that pure <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback</b> that is centrally injected behaves differently from feedback with even a small kinetic component. Specifically, pure <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback</b> results in excessive condensation and smothering of the AGN by cold gas because the feedback energy does not propagate to large enough radii. We do not see large differences between implementations of different triggering mechanisms, as long as the spatial resolution is sufficiently high, probably because all of the implementations tested here trigger strong AGN feedback under similar conditions. In order to assess the role of resolution, we vary the size of the "accretion zone" in which properties are measured to determine the AGN accretion rate and resulting feedback power. We find that a larger accretion zone results in steadier jets but can also allow too much cold-gas condensation in simulations with a Bondi-like triggering algorithm. We also vary the opening angle of jet precession and find that a larger precession angle causes more of the jet energy to thermalize closer to the AGN, thereby producing results similar to pure <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback.</b> Our simulations confirm that AGN can regulate the thermal state of cool-core galaxy clusters and maintain the core in a state that is marginally susceptable to thermal instability and precipitation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the momentum and energy budget of stellar feedback during {{different stages of}} stellar evolution, and study {{its impact on the}} interstellar medium (ISM) using simulations of local star-forming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern cosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid model for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds from massive stars during early, pre-supernova (pre-SN) evolutionary stages of young star clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star-forming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density mitigates radiative losses of <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback</b> energy from subsequent SN explosions. The detailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation and choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations in which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of the global star formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback implementation to other phenomenological <b>feedback</b> methods, where <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback</b> energy is allowed to dissipate over timescales longer than the formal gas cooling time. We find that simulations with maximal momentum injection suppress star formation to a similar degree as is found in simulations adopting adiabatic <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback.</b> However, different feedback schemes are found to produce significant differences in the density and thermodynamic structure of the ISM, and are hence expected to have a qualitatively different impact on galaxy evolution...|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} from {{high-resolution}} cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of a Milky-Way-sized halo, aimed at studying {{the effect of}} feedback {{on the nature of}} gas accretion. Simulations include a model of interstellar medium and star formation, in which supernova (SN) explosions provide effective <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback.</b> We distinguish between gas accretion onto the halo, which occurs when gas particles cross the halo virial radius, and gas accretion onto the central galaxy, which takes place when gas particles cross the inner one-tenth of the virial radius. Gas particles can be accreted through three different channels, depending on the maximum temperature value, T max, reached during the particles' past evolution: a cold channel for T max 106 K, and a warm one for intermediate values of T max. We find that the warm channel is at least as important as the cold one for gas accretion onto the central galaxy. This result is at variance with previous findings that the cold mode dominates gas accretion at high redshift. We ascribe this difference to the different SN feedback scheme implemented in our simulations. While results presented so far in the literature are based on uneffective SN <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback</b> schemes and/or the presence of a kinetic feedback, our simulations include only effective <b>thermal</b> <b>feedback.</b> We argue that observational detections of a warm accretion mode in the high-redshift circumgalactic medium would provide useful constraints {{on the nature of the}} feedback that regulates star formation in galaxies...|$|R
