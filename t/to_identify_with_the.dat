5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and {{that the most important}} aspect of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Eiland-Hall, a 34-year-old {{computer}} science student in Panama City, Florida, saw the discussion on Fark using the Gottfried joke on Beck {{and created a}} website, GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com, intending it as a parody of Beck's style of political commentary. He chose not <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> WHOIS service and decided to remain anonymous. Eiland-Hall used the domain name registrar Namecheap for his site. It was launched on September 1, 2009, and received over 120,000 page views during its first 24 hours. The website asserted {{that it did not}} believe the charges were true. Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote his opinions and increase his viewership.|$|E

5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half}} of the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Parnell, younger and more radical nationalists became disillusioned with {{parliamentary}} politics and turned toward more extreme forms of separatism. The Gaelic Athletic Association, the Gaelic League and the cultural revival under W. B. Yeats and Lady Augusta Gregory, together with the new political thinking of Arthur Griffith expressed in his newspaper Sinn Féin and organisations such as the National Council and the Sinn Féin League, led many Irish people <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of an independent Gaelic Ireland. This was sometimes referred to by the generic term Sinn Féin.|$|E

She declined to play in any white student venues that were segregated, which meant that when she toured the Southern states she would play only at black colleges.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{selection}} of the site, Congress delegate Mr Isaac Evans wrote a paper, ‘A Waterside Federal Capital’, which, despite being written to advocate a different site altogether, identified large water bodies as improving the appearance and perspective of the built form. Similarly, the design criteria for the capital encouraged such a creation. Furthermore, Evans also romantically described the future capital's dwellings as ‘dotted amongst the foliage’, implying that Evans envisioned a picturesque capital representative of the wider view of Australian society whose relatively new population were beginning <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> iconic surroundings of the Australian outback.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1927 the {{paramilitary}} organization Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold expelled all members belonging to the Old Social Democratic Party, accusing the party of seeking alliances with fascists. At this stage the party began distancing itself from its bourgeois coalition partners, criticizing them from a nationalist angle. It began seeking cooperation with nationalist groups, such as the Stahlhelm and Junge Deutsche Orden. The National Socialist newspaper Völkischer Beobachter began writing positively about {{the positions of the}} Old Social Democratic Party. However, Völkischer Beobachter expressed concerns regarding the name of the party (which sought <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Marxist roots of the SPD) and the position of the Old Social Democratic Party towards the Jewish population (which the National Socialists found too vague).|$|E
25|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Temple of Jerusalem (and most of the city) in the first Jewish revolt, Hadrian rebuilt both in Greek style, dedicated the rebuilt Temple (in Dio's account) to Jupiter, renamed Jerusalem Aelia Capitolina and sought a ban on circumcision as impious disfigurement. The ensuing Bar Kokhba revolt overwhelmed the Roman military occupation and destabilised much of the Empire. For almost three years, Judea was an independent state, led by the messianic commander Simon Bar Kokhba. Then it was obliterated by the Imperial armies and erased from the Roman map – Hadrian renamed it as Syria Palaestina. Christians described their persecution under Bar Kokhba. Jews described theirs in its aftermath. Jewish messianism retreated into abstraction, and a Jewish nation-state became an ideal. Christians were less inclined <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Judaic roots of their religion: some actively repudiated them. Hadrian's restrictions on Judaism were later relaxed and Jewish exemption from the full obligations of Imperial cult proved a source of suspicion and resentment for Hellenists and Christians alike.|$|E

25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs {{as part of the}} control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E
