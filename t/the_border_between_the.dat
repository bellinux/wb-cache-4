5|$|The Ampezzano is {{typically}} Alpine climate, with short summers and long winters that vacillate between frigid, snowy, unsettled, and temperate. In late December and early January, some of Italy's lowest recorded temperatures {{are to be}} found in the region, especially at the top of the Cimabanche Pass on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> provinces of Belluno and Bolzano. The other seasons are generally rainy, cold, and very windy.|$|E
5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two. He sailed along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E

5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive {{growth in the number}} of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Hoover Dam is a {{concrete}} arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction {{was the result}} of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert Hoover.|$|E

5|$|In 1878, Rollin J. Reeves {{surveyed}} {{and marked}} <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> newly created State of Colorado and the Utah Territory. Reeves located the sandstone shaft marker placed by Robbins at today's Four Corners Monument. He {{then began to}} survey and mark the border between Colorado and Utah from this point northward. In 1901, Howard B. Carpenter surveyed and marked the border between Arizona and Utah, completing the survey of borders making up the Four Corners Monument.|$|E
5|$|In Malinau, Oerip patrolled <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Dutch East Indies and the British-controlled Kingdom of Sarawak (part of modern-day Malaysia); he {{also worked}} to prevent {{conflicts}} and headhunting among Dayak tribes. One day, seven years after arriving in Borneo, Oerip returned from patrol to find his home had been burned down. Upon the recommendation of a passing doctor, Oerip went back to Java, via Tarakan and Surabaya, to Cimahi, where he spent several months in recovery from fatigue.|$|E

Castelli argued that it was urgent to rise against Lima because its economy depended largely on those districts, and if they lost power over that area, the main royalist stronghold would be threatened. The plan was rejected as too risky, and Castelli complied with the original orders.|$|E

5|$|Marco Antonio Barbaro, the Venetian bailo who {{had been}} imprisoned since 1570, {{conducted}} the negotiations. In view of the Republic's inability to regain Cyprus, the resulting treaty, signed on 7 March 1573, confirmed the new state of affairs: Cyprus became an Ottoman province, and Venice paid an indemnity of 300,000 ducats. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two powers in Dalmatia was modified by the Turkish occupation of small but important parts of the hinterland that included the most fertile agricultural areas near the cities, with adverse effects on {{the economy of the}} Venetian cities in Dalmatia.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, the Great Falls Turnpike, also known as River Road, was an important traffic artery for trade entering the District of Columbia from western Maryland and beyond. It connected the village of Tenleytown {{with the city of}} Washington, and roughly paralleled the Potomac River before turning northward. Due to its strategic position along the river, which formed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Confederate state of Virginia and the Union state of Maryland, it had great military value and was a likely route for an attacking army, as would be proved three years after {{the outbreak}} of war during the Battle of Fort Stevens.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is {{adjacent}} to the mangrove forest bordering Barker Inlet, part of the largest tidal estuary of Gulf St Vincent. Late in the 19th Century embankments were constructed through the mangroves {{in an effort to}} reclaim land for pasturing. With the construction of the banks of the adjacent saltfields maintenance of the embankments ceased and the mangroves began to reclaim them. One of these embankments is used as the beginning of a boardwalk through the mangroves which forms a 1.7km loop through the samphire saltmarsh flats and mangroves reaching <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> ocean and forest.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Plaman Mapu (27 April 1965) {{was one of}} {{the largest}} battles of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, a {{protracted}} and undeclared war between Indonesia and a Commonwealth of Nations (including Britain) supporting {{the creation of a new}} Malaysian state. The battle occurred as a result of an Indonesian effort to storm a British hilltop base at Plaman Mapu, on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian state of Sarawak and Indonesia.|$|E

The battle pitted the Patriot militia from Georgia and South Carolina against a small fleet of the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} both the Czech Republic and Poland to the European Union in May 2004, and {{especially}} the entry of the countries to the EU's passport-free Schengen zone in late 2007, reduced the significance of territorial disputes, ending systematic controls on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> countries. Signs prohibiting passage across the state border were removed, with people now allowed {{to cross the border}} freely at any point of their choosing.|$|E
50|$|During the {{existence}} of SFR Yugoslavia the island was part of SR Croatia. In 1991 Croatia declared independence. It was {{the opinion of the}} Badinter Arbitration Committee that <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> republics should become <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> countries, but it was under Serbian control like other parts of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srem (east Croatia) at the time. In the Croatian War of Independence, the Yugoslav People's Army and Serbian paramilitary forces occupied the island. After the Erdut Agreement in 1998, Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srem were rejoined with Croatia, but the island of Vukovar was left under Serbian military occupation, as was the Šarengrad island.|$|R

This led to far more regular, and often friendly, diplomatic contacts, as well as a reciprocal recognition of the two empires.|$|E
5|$|The {{lithology}} of the Kirtlandian formations {{are made}} up of mostly a combination of coal beds. The Fruitland Formation consists entirely of them, and one fifth of all rocks of the Kirtland Formation are a coal. The other common rocks found in the Kirtland Formation are siltstone, mudstone, shale and most commonly, sandstone. The Bisti Bed of the Hunter Wash Member is made up completely of sandstone, which marks <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Kirtland and Fruitland formations.|$|E

To the east lie Dunham Town, Dunham Massey, Bowdon and Altrincham, with Little Bollington to the south, and Partington and Urmston to the north.
