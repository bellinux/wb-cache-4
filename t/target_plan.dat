All four bombings that occurred had a similar [...] "signature" [...] which indicated that the explosives had been carefully prepared, a mark of skilled specialists. There is also no explanation {{as to how the}} terrorists were able to obtain tons of hexogen explosive and transport it to various locations in Russia; hexogen is produced in one plant in Perm oblast for which the central FSB is responsible for the security. The culprits would also have needed to organise nine explosions (the four that occurred and the five attempted bombings reported by the authorities) in different cities in a two-week period.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{planning}} models {{is to help}} determine how best to change the controllable variables of a system so that the system will move toward desired goals. In the case of public planning, the welfare criterion or planning objective {{is not likely to}} be the same as the objective function driving the behavior of the individual elements of the system. A rigorous definition of a theory of planning is provided through extensions to the linear-programming analysis of the decentralized firm in order to handle (1) the distinction between the planning objectives and behavioral objectives, and (2) the indirect determination of prices by a public agency through policies which modify existing prices sufficiently to achieve a prescribed allocation of resources. A set of three related mathematical programs is identified which yield respectively a <b>target</b> <b>plan,</b> a projection, and an optimal choice of policies.

By building concrete we have dams, pipelines, drainage, foundations, piling, bridge, highway to skyscrapers. A large number of concrete in construction results the increasing need for concrete material, thus triggering rock mining on a large scale. It decreases the number of natural resources that are available for concreting. It also damages the environment. Hence, considering the new procurement for aggregate resources in the concrete manufacture is needed, for example by replacing the coarse aggregate / gravel with marbles.

40|$|Efficient {{planning}} of design processes is {{of critical importance}} to meet tight deadlines and budgets; {{and the development of}} process planning tools is a lively research area. This paper describes current planning practice in industry and the challenges associated with it. In industry, a multitude of plans are used in parallel each focussing on a different aspect. The units of planning and their resulting plans roughly fall into product plans considering cost, bill of materials and procurement considerations; process plans including different milestone, lead-times, task and activity plans; and quality plans. Over the course of a project, the same plan can serve as a prescriptive plan defining steps in the process, a <b>target</b> <b>plan</b> against which process is measured, and a record of the process. This paper argues that organisations work because individuals use more than one plan and have a tacit understanding of the relationships between these plans.

40|$|Analogical {{planning}} {{provides a}} means of solving problems where other machine learning methods fail, {{because it does not}} require numerous previous examples or a rich domain theory. Given a problem in an unfamiliar domain (the target case), an analogical planning system locates a successful plan in a similar domain (the bast case), and uses the similarities to generate the <b>target</b> <b>plan.</b> Unfortunately, the analogical planning process is expensive and inflexible Many of the limiting factors reside in the base selection step, which drives the analogy formation process. This paper describes two ways of increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of analogical planning. First, a parallel graph-match base selection algorithm is presented. A parallel implementation on the Connection Machine is described and shown to substantially decrease the complexity of base selection. Second, a base-case merge algorithm is shown to increase the flexibility of analogical planning by combining the benefits of several base cases when no single plan contributes enough information to the analogy. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated with examples from the domain of automatic programming. ...|$|E

This analysis examined practice satisfaction with dental PPOs {{and the extent to which}} satisfaction was a function of communications from the plan, claims handling and compensation. Methods Data were collected through telephone surveys with dental practices affiliated with MetLife between January 2002 and December 2004. Each respondent was asked a series of questions related to their satisfaction with a systematically selected PPO with which they were affiliated. Six different PPO plans had sufficient observations to allow for comparative analysis (total n = 4582). Multiple imputation procedures were used to adjust for item non-response. Results While the average level of overall satisfaction with the <b>target</b> <b>plan</b> fell between "very satisfied" and "satisfied," regression models revealed substantial differences in overall satisfaction across the 6 PPOs (p Conclusion Results demonstrate the importance of compensation to dental practice satisfaction with PPOs.

40|$|The East Mendip Hills in Somerset, England have {{historically}} been {{an important source of}} aggregate materials, particularly limestone, for the construction industry. The local limestone formations are however also recognized major aquifers, and exploited in the region for both private and public water supply. Given the current demand for aggregates and considering the increased pressure on groundwater resources posed by a growing population, the planning authorities are faced with the challenge of providing the public with an adequate balance on the exploitation of both resources. This paper describes a local planning tool, based on a framework for the collection and collation of available data and its conversion into an accessible information system. The selected platform for the framework development was MapInfo, a geographical information system (GIS) interface. The system contains over 40 layers of information, distributed and combined within five main topics: local information, mineral resources, water environment, monitoring networks and conservation areas. In addition, a <b>Target</b> <b>Plan</b> was generated by combining layers representing the main factors that affect groundwater management and mineral planning in the region. A ranking system was developed to identify areas of high and low sensitivity with regard to groundwater resources and therefore allow better decisions for future planning.

The existing planning system uses single satellite to serve the user requests which falls into the criteria of “no 100 % ” Coverage of targets therefore, the solution so derived may not be optimal. This causes omission of some value–weighted users. <b>Target</b> <b>Planning</b> System utilizes ground stations and on board resources efficiently to produce optimal solution. The <b>Target</b> <b>Planning</b> System ingests <b>target</b> collection orders, maps orders to candidate satellite sensors based on resource allocation function, calculates constraints, target opportunities for each order and determines optimal solution by incorporating multi-satellite in the architecture and by applying sequential and Random methods of scheduling techniques to plan the selection of target list against the satellites. These scheduling algorithms takes user – defined and weighted scheduling factors including cost, order priority, resource preferences, Field Of View (FOV) and Figure of Merit (FOM) into its account. The usage of multi-satellite with scheduling techniques in this field solves the problem of gaining optimal solution for value – weighted targets to have 100 % coverage and maximum satellites imaging camera time...|$|R
