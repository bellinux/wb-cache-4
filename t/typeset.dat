Though the general design of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled <b>typeset.</b> This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the <b>typeset</b> alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|When {{referring}} to the language, the name is normally capitalized (Perl) as a proper noun. When {{referring to}} the interpreter program itself, the name is often uncapitalized (perl) because most Unix-like file systems are case-sensitive. Before {{the release of the}} first edition of Programming Perl, it was common to refer to the language as perl; Randal L. Schwartz, however, capitalized the language's name in the book to make it stand out better when <b>typeset.</b> This case distinction was subsequently documented as canonical.|$|E
50|$|The <b>typesetting</b> {{from this}} journal, {{including}} its mathematical formulae, {{was chosen by}} Donald Knuth as one of three examples of <b>typesetting</b> quality when he designed the TeX digital <b>typesetting</b> software from 1978.|$|R
50|$|In {{printing}} and typography, hot metal <b>typesetting</b> (also called mechanical <b>typesetting,</b> hot lead <b>typesetting,</b> hot metal, and hot type) is a technology for <b>typesetting</b> text in letterpress printing. This method injects molten type metal into a mold {{that has the}} shape {{of one or more}} glyphs. The resulting sorts and slugs are later used to press ink onto paper.|$|R

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, {{each with its own}} symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol ‚ë£. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number‚Äìname designation, ‚ë£ Vesta, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to <b>typeset.</b> Other punctuation, such as 4) Vesta and 4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.|$|E
5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a <b>typeset</b> transcription on each facing page.|$|E

50|$|During the {{hot metal}} <b>typesetting</b> era, {{printing}} equipment used matrices to cast type as needed during the <b>typesetting</b> process.

But whereas TeX is now frozen due to maximum stability, NTS was intended to remain flexible and extensible.|$|R
2500|$|Ligatures {{have grown}} in {{popularity}} over the last 20 years due to an increasing interest in creating <b>typesetting</b> systems that evoke arcane designs and classical scripts. One of the first computer <b>typesetting</b> programs {{to take advantage of}} computer-driven <b>typesetting</b> (and later laser printers) was Donald Knuth's TeX program. Now the standard method of mathematical <b>typesetting,</b> its default fonts are explicitly based on nineteenth-century styles. Many new fonts feature extensive ligature sets; these include FF Scala, Seria and others by Martin Majoor and Hoefler Text by Jonathan Hoefler. Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko contains a particularly large set to allow designers to create dramatic display text with a feel of antiquity.|$|R
25|$|In hand writing, a {{ligature}} is made {{by joining}} two or more characters in atypical fashion by merging their parts or by writing one above or inside the other. While in printing, a ligature {{is a group of}} characters that is <b>typeset</b> as a unit, and the characters {{do not have to be}} joined. For example, in some cases the fi ligature prints the letters f and i with a greater separation than when they are <b>typeset</b> as separate letters. When printing with movable type was invented around 1450, typefaces included many ligatures and additional letters, as they were based on handwriting. Ligatures made printing with movable type easier because one block would replace frequent combinations of letters and also allowed more complex and interesting character designs which would otherwise collide with one another.|$|E
