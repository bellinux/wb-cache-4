5|$|In February 1980, Roberts made a {{remarkable}} {{return to the}} American Grand National Championship for two races at the season opening Houston TT and short-track events held in the Houston Astrodome over two evenings. After {{more than a year}} away from dirt track competitions, Roberts won the Houston TT race to tie Bart Markel's career record of 28 Grand National victories. He followed that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>evening</b> with a third place in the Houston short-track national. Returning to England once again for the 1980 Transatlantic Match races, Roberts was once again the top individual points scorer as he led the American team to victory over the British.|$|E

5|$|The 42nd Division's {{participation}} in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began on 14 October when it attacked with both brigades. That evening, a conference was called to discuss the attack, during which Charles Pelot Summerall, commander of the First Infantry Division and V Corps, telephoned and demanded that Châtillon be taken by 18:00 <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>evening.</b> An aerial photograph had been obtained that showed {{a gap in the}} German barbed wire to the northeast of Châtillon. Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Bare—the commander of the 167th Infantry—proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a machine-gun barrage. MacArthur adopted this plan. He was wounded, but not severely, while verifying the existence of the gap in the barbed wire.|$|E

5|$|Violence peaked <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>evening,</b> {{the night}} of September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had boarded up and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to {{discourage}} thieves {{taking advantage of the}} strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were in sympathy with the strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E

However, he then receives a telephone call from Laura, who asks if she can stay overnight at his apartment. Though Jerry agrees, he is still unsure whether or not her visit is intended to be romantic. George and Jerry continue to debate the issue, with Jerry determined to find the true nature of her visit.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin {{companies}} were {{running out of}} food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19 a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River approaching the Continental Divide. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them {{a small amount of}} flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20 Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near South Pass that evening, and by <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>evening</b> the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail—the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.|$|E

5|$|With The Legacy finally formed, Manu and Snuka {{still wanted}} revenge on Orton. Fearing {{they would try}} to {{convince}} Raw general manager Stephanie McMahon to fire him, Orton went to speak to her himself but their conversation ended in an argument. When Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father, made his return that night Orton maintained he was owed an apology. His brashness angered McMahon who responded by trying to fire Orton, but before he could finish his sentence Orton slapped McMahon and gave him a running punt which left him hospitalized in the storyline. During the 30-man Royal Rumble match that Sunday the group worked as a team, making them three of the last four contestants in the ring with Triple H as the other. Ultimately, in throwing out Rhodes and DiBiase, Triple H was distracted enough to allow Orton to throw him over the top rope and win the match. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>evening</b> on Raw, The Legacy came to the ring accompanied by lawyers and doctors, with Orton explaining his outburst against McMahon was a result of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and threatened to sue the company and cancel WrestleMania XXV if he was fired, as winning the Rumble guaranteed him a championship match at WrestleMania. Instead he was booked for a no holds barred match with Vince's son, Shane, at No Way Out in February, which Orton won. The night after the event, they fought again until Orton punted Shane unconscious. Stephanie McMahon came to the ring to oversee her brother being carried away by the paramedics and shouted at Orton until he performed an RKO, his finishing move, to her.Triple H ran to the ring and chased away the group, standing over the body of Stephanie McMahon.The next week,Orton and The Legacy attacked Triple H.When Stephanie came out to stop The Legacy,Orton attacked and made out with her before hitting Triple H with a sledgehammer.|$|E
5|$|With a team {{in place}} and a stadium under construction, the Nashville Sounds were set to begin play in 1978 as an {{expansion}} team of the Southern League. As the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, the Sounds played their first game on April 15, 1978, against the Memphis Chicks at Memphis' Tim McCarver Stadium, which they lost, 4–2. The Sounds recorded their first win <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>evening,</b> defeating Memphis, 3–0. Meanwhile, construction on Greer Stadium continued {{in order to be}} ready for the home opener. The team had requested to open the season on the road and had to swap a series with the Chattanooga Lookouts in order to have enough time to complete the stadium. On April 26, the Sounds played their first home game, a 12–4victory, against the Savannah Braves in front of a sellout crowd of 8,156fans. The Greer home opener was scheduled to take place the previous evening, but was rained out. Tractors and grading machines were still preparing the field on game day, and the electricity was turned on only five minutes before the gates opened. Much of the sod that been laid that winter died, and the replacement sod arrived late, leaving it to be laid the day before the scheduled opening game. The Sounds finished their inaugural 1978 season under manager Chuck Goggin with a 64–77 record and failed to win either half of the Southern League's split-season, leaving them out of the championship playoffs. Bruce Berenyi was selected as the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher.|$|E
