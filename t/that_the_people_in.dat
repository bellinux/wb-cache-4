Lycotas dismisses such rustic entertainments and rites, in favour of the delights of the city. Lycotas asks Corydon to tell him more.|$|E

Some of the writings of Paul, especially in Ephesians, instruct slaves to remain obedient to their masters.

25|$|The defense {{strategy}} for the other two suspects was to attack the prosecution on a wide front. Multiple investigators were called to the stand, including {{the leader of the}} arrest team and the lead investigator in the case. The defense claimed illegal searches, improperly kept records, and problems during questioning. Igor Sayenko raised questions about the videotape of the searches conducted in the suspects' apartments. According to Sayenko, the tape constantly stops and restarts, showing the evidence obtained only after being picked up by investigators, but never the actual moment of discovery. The legal team also denied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the murder videos were the suspects.|$|E
25|$|Cantonese {{embroidery}} (Jyutping: Jyut6 sau3; Traditional Chinese: 粵繡) is the Cantonese {{style of}} embroidery, with considerable popularity in Lingnan {{and its own}} subculture. It could trace its root to at least the 9th century, where the Tang Empire had documented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the area were making embroidery. Cantonese embroidery attained its current form at around 15th century and has {{its own set of}} techniques. Visually, it is known for being colorful and containing multiple images without feeling chaotic. Due to Gwongdung's historical role in trade between the Chinese empire and the outside world, Cantonese embroidery had been sold to many Western European people and become a popular type of items in European aristocrats' collections of oriental crafts.|$|E
25|$|According to the Chinese Song Dynasty book Zhu Fan Zhi, written around 1225 CE by Zhao Rugua, the {{two most}} {{powerful}} and richest kingdoms in the Southeast Asian archipelago were Srivijaya and Java (Kediri), with the western part (Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java/Sunda) under Srivijaya's rule and the eastern part was under Kediri's domination. It says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Java followed two kinds of religions, namely Buddhism and the religion of Brahmins (Hinduism), while the people of Srivijaya followed Buddhism. The book describes the people of Java as being brave, short-tempered and willing to fight. It also notes that their favourite pastimes were cockfighting and pig fighting. The coin used as the currency then were made from a mixture of copper, silver, and tin.|$|E

25|$|Prosecution {{evidence}} included bloodstains on the suspects' {{clothing and}} video {{recordings of the}} murders. The defense denied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the videos were the suspects, claiming serious problems with the investigation, including at least 10 more murders covered up by the prosecution, supposed cover-ups of additional arrests of people with powerful connections who were released without being charged, even naming some of the additional people supposedly involved with the murders. The case was heard {{by a panel of}} judges chaired by judge Ivan Senchenko. The prosecution asked for life imprisonment for Sayenko and Suprunyuk, and 15 years of hard labor for Hanzha.

25|$|The rebels {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Mecca {{supported the}} defense offered by Uthman {{and were not}} in the mood to listen to them. That was a great psychological victory for Uthman. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman’s cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (referring to Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.|$|E
25|$|When the Syrian Revolt {{erupted in}} {{southern}} Syria in 1925, the French held in Aleppo State new elections {{that were supposed}} to lead to the breaking of the union with Damascus and restore the independence of Aleppo State. The French were driven to believe by pro-French Aleppine politicians <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Aleppo were supportive of such a scheme. After the new council was elected, however, it surprisingly voted to keep the union with Damascus. Syrian nationalists had waged a massive anti-secession public campaign that vigorously mobilized the people against the secession plan, thus leaving the pro-French politicians no choice but to support the union. The result was a big embarrassment for France, which wanted the secession of Aleppo to be a punitive measure against Damascus, which had participated in the Syrian Revolt. This was the last time that independence was proposed for Aleppo.|$|E

25|$|In 237, Zhou Zhi (周祗), a General of the Household (中郎將), {{wanted to}} recruit {{soldiers}} from Poyang Commandery (鄱陽郡) so he sought Lu Xun's opinion. Lu Xun believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Poyang were very restless {{and should not}} be recruited for military service because they might rebel. Zhou Zhi ignored Lu Xun's advice and persisted. As Lu Xun predicted, the people in Poyang started a rebellion under the leadership of Wu Ju (吳遽) and they killed Zhou Zhi and seized control of many counties. The people in the nearby Yuzhang (豫章) and Luling (廬陵) commanderies had a history of being rebellious, so they responded to Wu Ju's call and joined the revolt. Lu Xun led his forces to suppress the rebellion and succeeded in forcing Wu Ju and the rebels to surrender. He recruited over 8,000 men into his army and pacified the three commanderies.|$|E
25|$|Excavations at the Anglo-Saxon monastery of Repton in {{the heart}} of Mercia between 1974–1988 found a D-shaped {{earthwork}} on the river bank, incorporated into the stone church. Burials of Viking type were made at the east end of the church, and an existing building was cut down and converted into the chamber of a burial mound that revealed the disarticulated remains of at least 249 people, with their long bones pointing towards the centre of the burial. A large stone coffin was found {{in the middle of the}} mass grave; however, the remains of this individual did not survive. A study of the skeletal remains revealed that at least 80% of the individuals were male, and were between the ages of 15 and 45. Further investigation of the male skeletal remains revealed that they were dissimilar to the local population of Repton, and most likely of Scandinavian descent. In contrast, analysis of the female remains revealed that they were similar to the local population, suggesting an Anglo-Saxon lineage. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the grave may have suffered some sort of epidemic when the army overwintered in Repton during 873–74, leading to the mass burial. The nearby cemetery at Heath Wood barrow cemetery contains about sixty cremations (rather than burials). Finds of cremation sites in the British Isles are very rare, and this one probably was the war cemetery of the Great Heathen Army.|$|E
500|$|Parallels can {{be drawn}} from Thomas More's 1516 book Utopia, in which More {{describes}} an island with only one entrance and only one exit. Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to The Truman Show because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's Utopia and real-life groups such as the Shakers and the Oneida Community. It is clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality.

500|$|David Keevill {{argues that}} the {{explicitly}} anti-Christian attitude of most Viking metal artists is an anachronistic view of the Viking Age. Keevill explains that [...] "while bands have used [...] {{as the basis for}} their musical existence... the historical reality of the Viking Age (late 8th century to the 11th century) is a chequered backdrop of a multitude of belief systems and disparate political mechanisms". As an historical example, he cites the raid on Lindisfarne in 793, an event considered the beginning of the Viking Age and celebrated by Enslaved in its song [...] "793 (Slaget Om Lindisfarne)". He contends that this attack was merely an opportunistic raid, not a concerted attack on the growing power of Christianity, and that the terms [...] "heathen" [...] and [...] "pagan" [...] historically did not necessarily mean [...] "anti-Christian", but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> question did not fit under a denominational label. Furthermore, Norse religion and Christianity intermingled and influenced each other throughout the era, and Christianity was often imposed through monarchical regimes such as Harald Klak and Harald Bluetooth or conversion movements such as those initiated by Ansgar. Keevill concludes that, [...] "It's not that bands like Amon Amarth shouldn't flout their Norse heritage, the bellicose nature of the ancestors or the kind of practices that would have taken place in far flung tribal societies, it's just that ruling out the presence of an overbearing Christian influence on the Viking Age is incredibly close-minded." ...|$|E
