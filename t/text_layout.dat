25|$|Throughout the 2000s, {{the display}} and {{rendering}} of Hebrew with diacritics improved with support of complex <b>text</b> <b>layouts,</b> bidirectional <b>text,</b> and right-to-left (RTL) positioned text in most popular open-source web browsers (e.g., Mozilla Firefox, Chromium), text editors (LibreOffice, OpenOffice), and graphic editors (GIMP). Improved support is still needed, especially in open-source text layout/design applications utilizing text (e.g., Inkscape, LyX, and Scribus).|$|R
25|$|A general {{technique}} {{to improve performance}} is to avoid work. A good example {{is the use of}} a fast path for common cases, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary work. For example, using a simple <b>text</b> <b>layout</b> algorithm for Latin text, only switching to a complex layout algorithm for complex scripts, such as Devanagari. Another important technique is caching, particularly memoization, which avoids redundant computations. Because of the importance of caching, there are often many levels of caching in a system, which can cause problems from memory use, and correctness issues from stale caches.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{table is}} a breakdown of each letter in the Hebrew alphabet, describing its name or names, and its Latin script transliteration values used in academic work. If two glyphs are shown for a consonant, then the left-most glyph is the final form of the letter (or right-most glyph if your browser doesn't support right-to-left <b>text</b> <b>layout).</b> The conventions here are ISO 259, the UNGEGN system based on the old-fashioned Hebrew Academy system, and the modern common informal Israeli transcription. In addition, an International Phonetic Alphabet pronunciation is indicatedhistorical (Tiberian vocalization) for ISO 259, prescribed for Hebrew Academy, and in practice for Israeli. For the vowels further down, the letters ח and ט are used as symbolic anchors for vowel symbols, but should otherwise be ignored.|$|E

Although this solution is not ideal for the long term, text indexers may be adapted for compatibility of this encoding with the recommended encoding exposed in the previous paragraph, by considering this character triple as semantically equivalent as the previous character pair; and future fonts and <b>text</b> <b>layout</b> engines could also render this triple by implementing a non-discretionnary ligature between the two graphemes, so that it will render exactly like the standard character pair (which uses a single grapheme cluster).|$|E

Paragraph layout can be controlled automatically or by the user, using a built-in [...] "ruler" [...] object that can be attached to any text view. Spell checking is automatic, using a single dictionary used by all applications that uses the squiggly underlining convention introduced by Microsoft (actually a dashed red underline in Cocoa). Unlimited undo-redo support is built in. Using only the built-in features, one can write a text editor application in as few as 10 lines of code. With new controller objects, this may fall to zero.

We introduce {{the idea of}} using local orientation features to interpolate a vector field from which a warping mesh is derived.

Since the algorithm does not derive the mesh directly from text baselines it is robust over arbitrarily complex <b>text</b> <b>layouts.</b> We describe a baseline detector for extracting the required local orientation features. We also sketch a method for correcting nonlinear distortions of a document’s vertical axis with our algorithm. ...|$|R

Such complex <b>layouts</b> make <b>text</b> line extraction challenging due to multi-orientation of paragraphs. This paper introduces a system for the text line extraction from the complex layout documents. Proposed method is based on the concept of dilation and histogram profiling. The text regions are extracted using dilation and food fill based approach, then paragraph orientation is determined and individual text lines are extracted. The accuracy of extracted text lines are evaluated using the new proposed concept that is also based on the histogram profiling. The results of proposed approach on the complex layouts are promising...|$|R
