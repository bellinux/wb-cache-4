40|$|Theories {{of social}} {{interaction}} (i. e., common coding theory) suggest that visual information about the interaction partner is critical for successful interpersonal action coordination. Seeing the interaction partner allows an observer to understand and predict the interaction partner's behavior. However, it is unknown which of the many sources of visual information about an interaction partner (e. g., body, end effectors, and/or interaction objects) are used for action understanding and thus for the control of movements in response to observed actions. We used a novel immersive virtual environment to investigate this further. Specifically, we asked participants to perform <b>table</b> tennis <b>strokes</b> in response to <b>table</b> tennis balls <b>stroked</b> by a virtual table tennis player. We tested {{the effect of the}} visibility of the ball, the paddle, and the body of the virtual player on task performance and movement kinematics. Task performance was measured as the minimum distance between the center of the paddle and the center of the ball (radial error). Movement kinematics was measured as variability in the paddle speed of repeatedly executed <b>table</b> tennis <b>strokes</b> (stroke speed variability). We found that radial error was reduced when the ball was visible compared to invisible. However, seeing the body and/or the racket of the virtual players only reduced radial error when the ball was invisible. There was no influence of seeing the ball on stroke speed variability. However, we found that stroke speed variability was reduced when either the body or the paddle of the virtual player was visible. Importantly, the differences in stroke speed variability were largest in the moment when the virtual player hit the ball. This suggests that seeing the virtual player's body or paddle was important for preparing the stroke response. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the online control of arm movements is coupled with visual body information about an opponent...|$|R

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is themost common of all cardiac arrhythmias. It {{is detected}} in 5 % to 9 % of individuals older than 65. The most common causes of AF in North America are systemic hypertension, myocardial infarc-tion leading to left ventricular dysfunction, and mitral valve dis-ease. Why treat AF? Many patients with AF {{are at high}} risk for <b>stroke.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 identifies <b>stroke</b> risk factors in the presence of AF. All high-risk patients with AF should be considered candidates for antithrombotic therapy. Warfarin has been shown, by some recent large-scale, placebo-controlled, randomized trials, to reduce the annual risk of stroke by two-thirds. While acetylsalicylic acid appears {{to reduce the risk of}} stroke by one-third, the data is less concrete and some patients run the risk of bleeding. This risk exists in patients with low hemat-ocrit, renal insufficiency, or sys-tolic hypertension. Improving symptom control In most patients with AF, the ven-tricular rate will be excessive, requiring drugs to slow atrioven-tricular conduction. While digoxin is useful at controlling heart rate at rest, a second drug, such as a beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker, is often required with activity. Electrical cardioversion is suc-cessful at restoring sinus rhythm in 70 % to 80 % of patients, but only 25 % of patients will remain in nor-mal sinus rhythm after one year. Clinical judgment is needed to determine whether electrical car-dioversion is warranted. Most patients with AF should receive three to four weeks of warfarin therapy prior to cardioversion. Type 1 antiarrhythmic agents maintain sinus rhythm in close to 50 % of patients by one year. However, these drugs have the potential for very serious side-effects, including m o r t a l i t y. Amiodarone is the antiarrhyth-mic agent of choice for elderly patients. Rate vs. rhythm control: A review of the dat...|$|R
40|$|This study tested two hypotheses: (1) {{compared}} with amateurs and young elite, expert table tennis players {{are characterized by}} enhanced cortical activation in the motor and fronto-parietal cortex during motor imagery in response to table tennis videos; (2) in elite athletes, world rank points are associated with stronger cortical activation. To this aim, electroencephalographic data were recorded in 14 expert, 15 amateur and 15 young elite right-handed table tennis players. All subjects watched videos of a serve and imagined themselves responding with a specific <b>table</b> tennis <b>stroke.</b> With reference to a baseline period, power decrease/increase of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) during the pretask- and task period indexed the cortical activation/deactivation (event-related desynchronization/synchronization, ERD/ERS). Regarding hypothesis (1), 8 – 10 Hz SMR ERD was stronger in elite athletes than in amateurs with an intermediate ERD in young elite athletes over the whole scalp. Regarding hypothesis (2), there was no correlation between ERD/ERS in the motor cortex and world rank points in elite experts, but a weaker ERD in the fronto-parietal cortex was associated with higher world rank points. These results suggest that motor skill in table tennis is associated with focused excitability of the motor cortex during reaction, movement planning and execution with high attentional demands. Among elite experts, less activation of the fronto-parietal attention network {{may be necessary to}} become a world champion...|$|R

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Dr. Bernstein on Pressure Pulse Contour-derived Stroke Volume and Cardiac Output in the Morbidly Obese Patient [1]. It is important to discuss the data presented in the review, considering that caution is necessary to accept his conclusion on pressure recording analytical method (PRAM) [2]. We wonder {{how it is possible}} to draw similar conclusions based on the small number of studies considered and patients enrolled [3 – 5]. We may also highlight some discrepancies not only between the studies considered but also within each study [3 – 5]. It is important to distinguish between hemodynamic data measured directly, such as mean arterial pressure (MAP) or heart rate (HR), and hemodynamic data calculated by the PRAM [6 – 11] or other methods [12]. From an analysis of MAP and HR in reviewed studies, we can observe how [3 – 5] these values present different trends compared with our results (<b>Table</b> 1). <b>Stroke</b> volume (SV) of our patients [1], calculated from stroke volume index (SVI), according to the formula SV= SVI×BSA (Mosteller-derived), is similar to the data of Dumont et al.

40|$|Jump shot is one {{of further}} {{techniques}} in pool which causes the cue ball, because of a downward stroke, to rebound off {{the bed of the}} table in order to jump the cue ball over an impeding ball. After the cue ball jump over an impeding ball, the cue ball should hit the target ball. Making an analysis of the jump shot technique, mathematical approach is needed. Mathematical modeling is how to be able to doing mathematical analysis on the jump shot technique. Mathematical modeling of movement ball on the jump shot technique can be done using analysis of differential equation and relate it with the theories that support the jump shot technique. Theories that support this analysis modeling is Newton’s Laws, Linear Momentum and Conservation of Momentum, Collisions, and Projectile Motion.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the Joint Degree of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University and Nanyang Technological University. Table tennis playing involves complex spatial movement of the racket and human body. It takes much effort for the novice players to better mimic expert players. The evaluation of motion patterns during table tennis training, which is usually achieved by coaches, is important for novice trainees to improve faster. However, traditional coaching relies heavily on coaches qualitative observation and subjective evaluation. While past literature shows considerable potential in applying biomechanical analysis and classification for motion pattern assessment to improve novice table tennis players, little published work was found on table tennis biomechanics. To attempt to overcome the problems and fill the gaps, this research aims to quantify the movement of <b>table</b> tennis <b>strokes,</b> to identify the motion pattern differences between experts and novices, {{and to develop a}} model for automatic evaluation of the motion quality for an individual. Firstly, a novel method for comprehensive quantification and measurement of the kinematic motion of racket and human body is proposed. In addition, a novel method based on racket centre velocity profile is proposed to segment and normalize the motion data. Secondly, a controlled experiment was conducted to collect motion data of expert and novice players during forehand strokes. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the motion differences between the expert and the novice groups. The experts exhibited significantly different motion patterns with faster racket centre velocity and smaller racket plane angle, different standing posture and joint angular velocity, etc. Lastly, a support vector machine (SVM) classification technique was employed to build a model for motion pattern evaluation. The model development was based on experimental data with different feature selection methods and SVM kernels to achieve the best performance (F 1 score) through cross-validated and Nelder-Mead method. Results showed that the SVM classification model exhibited good performance with an average model performance above 90...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the role of head, eye and arm movements during the execution of a <b>table</b> tennis forehand <b>stroke.</b> Three-dimensional kinematic analysis of line-of-gaze, arm and ball was used to describe visual and motor behaviour.

Skilled participants demonstrated an earlier onset of ball tracking and recorded higher performance accuracy than less skilled counterparts. The manipulation of cue condition showed the limits of adaptation to maintain accuracy on the target. Participants were able to accommodate the constraints imposed by the early-cue condition by using a shorter quiet eye duration, earlier quiet eye oþ set and reduced arm velocity at contact.

Quantitative analysis of the continuous variables during the different phases of the motion cycle helps to investigate more deeply the specific movement of the racket or player. Table tennis biomechanics research to date lacks the necessary detail of phase decomposition and phase-based quantitative analysis. Therefore, this study proposes a novel velocity-based piecewise alignment method to identify the different phases of a <b>table</b> tennis forehand <b>stroke.</b> A controlled experiment was conducted {{on a number of}} players of two differing ability levels (experts vs. novices) to implement this novel methodology. Detailed results are shown for the quantitative analysis on multiple strokes of the two groups of participants. Significant differences were found in both the displacement and velocity of the racket movement in the backswing, forward swing and follow-through phases. For example, it is clear that experts strokes show higher racket resultant velocity than novices during both the forward swing and follow-through phases by up to a factor of two. Furthermore, the phase-based approach to analysing racket motions leads to interrogation over a greater duration than the traditional time-based method which is generally only concerned with impact ± 0. 25 s...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Von Willebrand disease (VWD) {{is caused}} by reduced levels of or {{dysfunctional}} von Willebrand factor (VWF) and {{is characterized by a}} bleeding tendency. It is well known that individuals with high VWF levels have a higher risk for arterial thrombosis. Although it has never been studied, we hypothesized that VWD patients may be protected against arterial thrombotic events. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence and prevalence of arterial thrombosis in a large cohort of VWD patients in comparison to the general population. Materials and Methods: We studied clinical history of arterial thrombosis in 637 adult VWD patients (aged 16 - 85 years, 36. 6 % men) in a large nation-wide multicenter cross-sectional study with VWF levels ≤ 0. 30 IU/mL (Willebrand in the Netherlands - WiN study). Clinical history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and cardiovascular risk factors were obtained by a questionnaire. Subsequently, medical records were reviewed for all subjects who reported an event to objectify the arterial thrombosis. The prevalence was compared with data of the Dutch general population. Results: Twenty-one of the 637 (3. 3 %) adult VWD patients had a history of arterial thrombosis. Five patients (0. 8 % (95 %CI 0. 1 - 1. 5) suffered from acute myocardial infarction and 3 patients (0. 5 % (95 %CI 0 - 1. 0)) had an ischemic stroke. Furthermore, unstable angina pectoris was recorded in 8 patients and transient ischemic attacks in 6. Eight patients had more than one event. In comparison with the Dutch general population, VWD patients ≥ 45 years had a significantly lower than expected prevalence and standardized morbidity ratio of coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction and ischemic <b>stroke</b> (see <b>Table).</b> No statistical significant difference in VWF and FVIII levels was observed between VWD patients with and without arterial thrombosis.

40|$|SUMMARY Victims of atfaerothrombotk {{infarction}} of the brain, {{the most}} common variety of stroke, fre-quently have recurrent strokes. Risk factors believed to accelerate such events Include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerotic disease (of heart, aortocervical and intracranial vessels), erythro-cytbemia, stress, tobacco smoking, hyperurlcemia, and perhaps obesity. Most prior studies indicate average anticipated 5 year mortality of 35 to 65 percent and stroke recurrence rate of 20 to 40 percent. A consistent effort to control risk factors in 88 survivors of a first cerebral infarction yielded 17 percent mortality and 16 percent stroke recurrence rates during the 5 years following first stroke. This sustained and systematic approach to risk factor management seemed beneficial to these stroke victims. Stroke, Vol 12, No 6, 1981 ATHEROTHROMBOTIC cerebral infarction, {{the most common}} variety of stroke, frequently does not occur as a single event. It is common for patients with stroke to have recurrent cerebrovascular episodes, and most large series reported indicate a stroke recurrence rate of from 20 to 40 percent, and mortality rate of 35 to 65 percent, in five years. 1 " " Cardiac and peripheral vascular problems {{are also more likely}} to occur. A number of high risk factors have been recognized which seem to accelerate atherosclerotic cerebral vascular disease, and increase liability to <b>stroke</b> (<b>table</b> 1). It has been hoped that correction or control of these factors might improve the anticipated subse-quent vascular morbidity and mortality of stroke vic-tims. A study was conducted to determine whether the long-term prognosis of victims of stroke might be im-proved by an energetic and sustained program to con-trol these 10 common risk factors. Transient cerebral ischemic attacks are not included as risk factors, since they are considered an integral part of the stroke/atherothrombotic brain infarction syndrome. Additional precipitating factors, such as oral contraceptive drugs, hypercoagulable states, arteritis of various sorts (collagen vascular diseases, drug reactions, meningovascular lues, etc.) occur much less frequently and are not included. Age, race, sex and genetic factors are also pertinent but cannot be regulated, and likewise are not considered in this report...|$|R

But about twelve at night, such rapping was {{on all sides of}} them, that it wakened all of them; as the doors did seem to open, the mastive bitch fell fearfully a yelling, and presently ran fiercely into the bed to them in the truckle-bed; as the thing came by the table, it struck so fierce a blow on that, as that it made the frame to crack, then took the warming-pan from off the <b>table,</b> and <b>stroke</b> it against the walls with so much force as that it was beat flat together, lid and bottom. Now were they hit as they lay covered over head and ears within the bed-clothes. Captain Carelesse was taken a sound blow on the head with the shoulder-blade bone of a dead horse, (before they had been but thrown at, when they peept up, and mist;) Browne had a shrewed blow on the leg with the backbone, and another on the head, {{and every one of them}} felt severall blows of bones and stones through the bed-clothes, for now these things were thrown as from an angry hand that meant further mischief; the stones flew in at window as shot out of a gun, nor was the bursts lesse (as from without) than of a cannon, and all the windows broken down. Now as the hurling of the things did cease, and the thing walkt up and down, Captain Cockaine and Hart cried out, In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, what are you? What would you have? What have we done that you disturb us thus? No voice replied, (as the Captains said, yet some of their servants have said otherwise,) and the noise ceast. Hereupon Captains Hart and Cockaine rose, who lay in the bed-chamber, renewed the fire and lights, and one great candle, in a candlestick, they placed in the door, that might be seen by them in both the rooms. No sooner were they got to bed, but the noise arose on all sides more loud and hideous than at any time before, insomuch as (to use the Captains' own words) it returned and brought seven devils worse than itself; and presently they saw the candle and candlestick in the passage of the door, dasht up to the roof of the room, by a kick of the hinder parts of a horse, and after with the hoof trode out the snuff, and so dasht out the fire in the chimnies. As this was done, there fell, as from the ceiling, upon them in the truckle-beds such quantities of water, as if it had been poured out of buckets, which stunk worse than any earthly stink could make; and as this was in doing, something crept under the high beds, tost them up to the roof of the house, with the Commissioners in them, until the testers of the beds were beaten down upon, and the bedsted-frames broke under them; and here some pause being made, they all, as if with one consent, started up, and ran down the stairs until they came into the Councel Hall, where two sate up a-brewing, but now were fallen asleep; those they scared much with the wakening of them, having been much perplext before with the strange noise, which commonly was taken by them abroad for thunder, sometimes for rumbling wind. Here the Captains and their company got fire and candle, and every one carrying something of either, they returned into the Presence-Chamber, where some applied themselves to make the fire, whilst others fell to prayers, and having got some clothes about them, they spent the residue of the night in singing psalms and prayers; during which, no noise was in that room, but most hideously round about, as at some distance.|$|R
