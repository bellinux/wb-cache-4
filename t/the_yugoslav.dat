Since 1991, Maribor have competed in the Slovenian PrvaLiga, the highest level of football in the country. They were one of that league's founding members, and are one of only three clubs never to have been relegated from the top division.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in Slovenia, the army still saw itself as the defender of a federal, {{communist}} Yugoslavia, rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism. Its head, General Veljko Kadijević, <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Minister of Defence and a committed communist, initially sought to forcibly keep Yugoslavia together and proclaimed the army's neutrality in the Serb-Croat conflict. The JNA leadership aimed to cut Croatia in two by seizing the Serb-inhabited inland regions, almost all of the Dalmatian coast and much of central and eastern Croatia. It aimed to force Croatia's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia. The JNA's leadership was not yet dominated by ethnic Serbs, and these early goals reflected <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> outlook of its multiethnic leadership. Kadijević was half-Croat and half-Serb, his deputy was a Slovene, the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle was a Macedonian, and the head of <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Air Force, which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during the battle, was a Croat.|$|E

5|$|Factors {{in favour}} of Croatia's {{preservation}} of its pre-war borders were <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Federal Constitution Amendments of 1971, and <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Federal Constitution of 1974. The 1971 amendments introduced a concept that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution. The 1974 Constitution confirmed and strengthened the principles introduced in 1971. The borders had been defined by demarcation commissions in 1947, pursuant to decisions of AVNOJ in 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organization of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions increased. <b>The</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) to minimize potential resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. In January 1991, Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, made two unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval from <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Presidency to deploy the JNA to disarm Croatian security forces. After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare a state of emergency.

25|$|Initially, Yugoslavia {{had been}} pro-German, and looked set {{to join the}} Axis Powers, but a {{military}} coup toppled the government and declared itself neutral. Infuriated, Adolf Hitler ordered the conquest of Yugoslavia. <b>The</b> <b>Yugoslavs</b> had ordered twenty Do 17 Ka-2s {{at the end of}} 1940.

In October, Ljotić was forced to withdraw his two representatives in the Serbian puppet government {{in order to avoid}} being held responsible for the unpopular and difficult economic measures and food policies enacted by Nedić that month. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, Montenegrin Chetnik commander Pavle Đurišić established ties with Ljotić.

5|$|Pećanac {{became the}} {{president}} of the Chetnik Association in 1932.

During this period, Pećanac formed close ties with the far-right Yugoslav Radical Union government of Milan Stojadinović, and was known for his hostility to <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Communist Party, which made him popular with conservatives such as those in <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Radical Union.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Navy was {{defeated}} and its ships did not sail {{north of the}} Split Entrance again. The battle was the largest engagement of the Croatian Navy during the war.

According to Mladenić, <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Navy lost 22 seamenincluding three aboard Mukostwo minesweepers and a patrol craft. <b>The</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Air Force lost two aircraft but the pilots were rescued by a helicopter that sortied from Vis and picked them up from the sea. Croatian Navy divers later raised Mukos and she was towed to Šibenik by a Brodospas-owned tug. She was repaired and turned over to the Croatian Navy as OB-62 Šolta. Two civilians were killed and nine were wounded in the naval bombardment of Split. The bombardment damaged the Archaeological Museum, Split Municipality Building, Arena Gripe, Public Sanitation Institute, the Technical School, and the ferries Bartol Kašić and Vladimir Nazor, which were moored in the Port of Split. The two civilian fatalities were crew members of Vladimir Nazor.|$|E

40|$|As part {{of their}} broader sociopolitical system of self-managing socialism, <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslavs</b> have {{attempted}} to create a health care system which is simultaneously destaticized, depoliticized, decentralized, democratized and economically and socially efficient.

I conclude with an ideologically unpopular proposal that some form of continuous and legitimate central state coordination may be necessary to resolve current critical problems in Yugoslav health care (e. g. persistent deficits in health financing, shortages of basic medical supplies, duplication of expensive medical technology, unemployed health workers despite unmet health needs, persistent health inequalities). ...|$|R
5|$|When {{they entered}} service, the IK-3s {{suffered}} from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by deficiencies in <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> aeronautical industry which {{had resulted in}} a mixture of foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es in mock dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; <b>the</b> <b>Yugoslav</b> aircraft was more manoeuvrable in level flight, enabling it to quickly get behind a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.|$|E

Serbia was represented by Borisav Jović, a former Serbian member of the federal presidency who had resigned from the position on 15 June, instead of Milošević who refused to attend. Starting at 8am, the EC delegation held separate talks with Kučan and his assistants, then with Tuđman and his assistants, and finally with Jović.
